2010-08-10T18:07:00.000Z	happydonut		hi, in ubuntu server 10.04, why can't i: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql;
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		1) dbus isn't installed, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		2) when I install dbus, I get the error about sending message, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		but mostly, why can't I: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql in an out of the box ubuntu 10.04 LTS server?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		you can in 9.10
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		I've done all of those, and they also recommend the new "upstart" way, and pass to that
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		so I've done all those forms
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		all give the same error, all use dbus, dbus is not installed
2010-08-10T18:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	is this a brand new install ?
2010-08-10T18:12:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	yes, it is a brand new install. No dbus, and installing mysql, and having service / upstate / /etc/init.d - they require dbus (which is fine) but the error is annoying, and the default decision is also annoying
2010-08-10T18:14:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	I can apt-get install, I can install mysql, but afterwards, I can't start / stop it without installing dbus. That should work. Then when i install dbus, I get the errors about the sending for method_call
2010-08-10T18:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	you still there? you get you dbus issue sorted?
2010-08-10T18:40:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	still here
2010-08-10T18:40:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	I'd run tasksel and have the system install the servers, then re-boot and see if it moans about dbus agian.
2010-08-10T18:41:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	search Launchpad for rescent bugs, that's the real tell-tell sign
2010-08-10T18:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	tasksel is made to work on servers, no desktop.
2010-08-10T18:49:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	I am on server, I don't need to find recent bugs - you tried to reproduce it right? If this is a default install, it should work verbatim.
2010-08-10T18:50:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	No, Im not gonna break a system to find a bug, but if ya dont want to look and trust google that's cool
2010-08-10T18:51:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	you said you'd tried it, and how does it break a system installing one package?
2010-08-10T18:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	I dont have the dbus error your seeing, and Im not gonna got try and break my server to find it.
2010-08-10T18:54:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	stop saying you aren't going to break your server, as if i was asking you to. I have not asked you to do anything, nothing I've said implies breaking a server, none of these commands break a server, stop saying you won't break a server
2010-08-10T18:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	happydonut	Im sorry I can't help on this any further.
2010-08-10T18:54:00.000Z	happydonut	KE1HA	in fact, /ignore me, that is fine. I appreciate your help, I was just asking if someone had a fresh 10.04 to verify a behaviour
