2010-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	Coke		Any idea how I can configure the top panel?
2010-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	Coke		ALl the options are greyed out (disabled)
2010-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	Coke		isn't there some setting I can adjust to allow modifications of the panel?
2010-09-17T16:51:00.000Z	Coke		So nobody knows why the option to remove icons from the panel is disabled?
