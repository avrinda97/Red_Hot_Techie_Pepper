2004-09-27T13:30:00.000Z	ondrej		I am missing suspend / hibernate option on my thinkpad (when using ACPI)...
2004-09-27T13:30:00.000Z	ondrej		but that's more kernel then distro issue
2004-09-27T13:30:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	mmm, my new lappy needs dsdt upgrades and things - icky
2004-09-27T13:31:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	i had to wait for few bios updates and disable screen blanking on T40/p, but now it just works...
2004-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	I asked before, but nobody responded.  Ubuntu is using libgnutls10, but I thought it suffers from some security design flaw, at least I remember some mail on d-d@l.d.o about it
2004-09-27T13:33:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	not sure, mdz would know more details
2004-09-27T14:27:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	we decided to ship xpdf for more thorough pdf support, but didn't put gpdf in supported
2004-09-27T14:27:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	we'll most likely ship it by default Hoary
2004-09-27T14:28:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	gpdf is part of gnome 2.8...  so I was interested why it's not in main...
2004-09-27T14:28:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	yeah, that's why :)
2004-09-29T16:40:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	I have spare machine with two 36GB discs; do you think that this would be enough to make czech mirror of Ubuntu?
2004-09-29T16:41:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	um, from memory, yes
2004-10-01T05:07:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	any chance to have ipw2100 and ipw2200 drivers in restricted (intel wireless cards with binary firmware)
2004-10-04T15:00:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	I am going to investigate Gnome BT Downloader as it is mentioned on Bounties page.  who I may talk about it afterwards?
2004-10-04T16:57:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	I am working on GNOME UI BitTorrent Bounty; who I am supposed to contact with result?

2004-10-05T07:23:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	I just finished polishing gnome bittorent downloader, could you please look at it?
2004-10-05T07:24:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	will have a look in a while, attempting to relax a bit atm ;)
2004-10-05T07:28:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	no problem, I am leaving to do some weekend shopping anyway :-)
2004-10-27T16:15:00.000Z	jdub	ondrej	a quick search will find that bug
2004-10-27T16:17:00.000Z	ondrej	jdub	ok, i will stop being lazy :-)
