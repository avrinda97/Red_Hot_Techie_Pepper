2008-04-13T05:37:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	no promises! they can barely emulate ps1 properly let alone ps2!
2008-04-13T05:44:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	because there are about 1000 linux's
2008-04-13T05:46:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	dev-c++ is an IDE. you don't need to mess with an IDE to build wares
2008-04-13T05:46:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	actually you just need to run "make" :)
2008-04-13T05:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	no, "make" is a tool you have on your system for "making" stuff
2008-04-13T05:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	in the source tree, there are "Makefile"s that tell "make" how to build it
2008-04-13T05:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	so it's usually just a case of ./configure --whatever-options-you-want-(or-not); make; sudo make install
2008-04-13T05:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	if you install the package "build-essential", download the tarball you want
2008-04-13T05:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	ok, extract the archive you downloaded with the source
2008-04-13T05:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	gfetco	now is there a readme? :)
