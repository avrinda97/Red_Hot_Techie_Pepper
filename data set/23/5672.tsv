2006-10-28T15:54:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	He doesn't need to run update-grub and removing the "quiet" doesn't help
2006-10-28T15:54:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	if he only removed quiet from the kopt=, commented line, then yes, he does need to run update-grub
2006-10-28T15:55:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	I asked if he wanted to see what happens when his system's booting, apparantly not, so leave splash in.  removing quiet shows what grub does before it starts booting the kernel though
2006-10-28T15:55:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	No, he doesn't. I have done that on several boxes and never need to run update-grub.
2006-10-28T15:55:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	you really do..
2006-10-28T15:56:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	for a test, add something to the commented line, examine the rest of the file.  then run update-grub and examine the rest of the file
2006-10-28T15:57:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	look, I just ran a test to be absolutely sure, and you absolutely, definitely do need to run update-grub
2006-10-28T15:57:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	Please stop, I know what I'm doing.
2006-10-28T15:57:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	as do I
2006-10-28T15:57:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	Pleaced you on my ignore list.
2006-10-28T15:58:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	ignore someone who tells you the correct way to do it, fine..
2006-10-28T11:02:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	I'd answer, but you already ignored me for pointing out you need to run 'update-grub'...
2006-10-28T11:03:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	That comment was completely unnecessary and quite childish
2006-10-28T11:03:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	Go change your diaper
2006-10-28T11:03:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	superfluous indeed, however I'm certain I was right..
2006-10-28T11:05:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	So you know how to fix it?
2006-10-28T11:06:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	it's most likely caused by the preview engine (have you been browing paths with videos?), there's no permanent fix but 'killall nautilus' will respawn nautilus, and it won't choke on the same files again
2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	I don't work with videos at all. But, will keep it in mind.
2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	np's, if you want more detail, you can 'strace' the process
2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	Also, one of the things I do in my initial tweaks is turn all previews off.
2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	strace -p *nautilus process id*, that'll tell you which calls it's racing on
2006-10-28T11:08:00.000Z	JosefK	ianmacgregor	may not immediately help, but it's a lot more useful information :)
2006-10-28T11:08:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	JosefK	Ahh, I'll add that to my notes. Thank you, sir :)
