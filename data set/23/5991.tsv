2006-07-10T14:39:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly , do you know how to install packages?
2006-07-10T14:39:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	warbo explained it to me last night. i think it was extract. open the terminal cd the file name and then i forgot the rest =[
2006-07-10T14:40:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	just go to system > administration > synaptic
2006-07-10T14:40:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	but you may need to enable universe like Warbo said first
2006-07-10T14:41:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	yep very easy
2006-07-10T14:42:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	i cant find gstreamer 0.10 i have a .8
2006-07-10T14:42:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	are you using dapper?
2006-07-10T14:43:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	and warbo: are those things inside of ubuntu
2006-07-10T14:43:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	then you need gstreamer0.8-mad I believe
2006-07-10T14:44:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	if you aren't sure of your version, then run this command after going to applications > accessories > terminal: lsb_release -c
2006-07-10T14:44:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	i have several others some say like .8 - audofile
2006-07-10T14:44:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	it says n/a
2006-07-10T14:45:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	did you put the -c?
2006-07-10T14:45:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	oh no hahaha wait one second
2006-07-10T14:46:00.000Z	ketethatooblack	jrib	& warbo & ljl: http://www.vorbis.com/setup_linux/ do i need htat?
2006-07-10T14:46:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	ok, gstreamer0.8-mad is correct for you then.  Since you can't find it, it means you need to enable universe (ljl had the bot send you instructions)
2006-07-10T14:48:00.000Z	jrib	ketethatooblack	haha ok, I'll just shutup because too many people are talking to you at the same time :)
