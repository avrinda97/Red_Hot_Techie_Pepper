2005-10-28T10:07:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	is your bittorrent firewalled/NATed ?
2005-10-28T10:07:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	does your ISP limit bittorrent traffic ?
2005-10-28T10:07:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	the solution to firewall/NAT problem is to configure your router, for help with this you can ask here or in #networking
2005-10-28T10:08:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	if the problem is your ISP then the solution is to use non-standard ports for bittorrent, high ports like 50000-60000
2005-10-28T10:08:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	what router do you have ?
2005-10-28T10:10:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	login in the web interface of the router in firewall and NAT settings and allow packets to move freely to your PC for bittorrent ports
2005-10-28T10:12:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	so ?
2005-10-28T10:13:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	what ports do u use for bittorrent ?
2005-10-28T10:14:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	find what ports u use for bittorrent, check utorrent settings.
2005-10-28T10:14:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	if there is no ports config in utorrent then you probably use the default bittorrent ports
2005-10-28T10:16:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	just forward the bittorrent ports in the router
2005-10-28T10:17:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	people in #networking may know to explain how to forward ports in d-link, I haven't used that router.
2005-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	NSK	sambagirl	I think no
