2007-10-02T12:47:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	ok, which OS are you being told there's an error loading?
2007-10-02T12:50:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	i've never run into that myself, so i'm really at a loss. hm. stupid question but... your BIOS is set to boot from the HD?
2007-10-02T12:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	i've been dual/triple/on-and-on booting for years
2007-10-02T12:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	can you boot that up with the live CD? maybe a reinstall of GRUB will help :|
2007-10-02T12:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	we're going to make it.
2007-10-02T13:01:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	thank you for your help, regardless of outcome
2007-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	type sudo grub        ... and then  type find /boot/grub/stage1

2007-10-02T13:11:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	type setup (hd2)
2007-10-02T13:14:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	> and then what happens when you try to boot into one?
2007-10-02T13:14:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	i am a big dummy. let's do the live cd thing again, back into a terminal
2007-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	okay, type sudo grub ...  then type  root (hd2,3)  ... then setup (hd2,3), then quit & reboot.
2007-10-03T10:34:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	guess what, error loading operating system, supergrub cannot make ubuntu boot under any of the options in boot, or gnu linux lol, not asking for help just shareing
2007-10-03T10:34:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	ugh, that sucks
2007-10-04T05:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	Innomen	i'm not sure if lilo's on the discs
2007-10-16T10:26:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	uhh disabling a build in device is not what i meant
2007-10-16T10:33:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	Paddy_EIRE: Innomen: we dont want fisherprice windows standards
2007-10-16T10:33:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	disabling a device is no more "tinkering" than creating a folder, its a basic part of an OS
2007-10-16T10:40:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	being young is an insult?
2007-10-16T10:40:00.000Z	Innomen	riotkittie	i meant nothing of the kind
