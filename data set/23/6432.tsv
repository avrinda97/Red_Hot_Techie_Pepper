2009-07-19T04:52:00.000Z	adriana		Google Earth is very slow and is not rendering. I know i it has to run i my PC because when i had WinXp it did work.
2009-07-19T04:53:00.000Z	luca	adriana	maybe it is a 3d issue, have you got an ati or nvidia card?
2009-07-19T05:02:00.000Z	luca	adriana	try glxgears first
2009-07-19T05:02:00.000Z	luca	adriana	is it working "acceptably"?
2009-07-19T05:04:00.000Z	luca	adriana	what fps are you getting in glxgears?
2009-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	luca	adriana	have you tried to disable compiz?
2009-07-19T05:06:00.000Z	luca	adriana	that means, system->preference->appearance and none
2009-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	luca	adriana	no, ubuntu by default ships with "nice 3d effects" enabled, but some 3d apps like google earth eat much more horsepower so disabling those ubuntu desktop effects can give the app the power it needs
2009-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	luca	adriana	that means, system->preference->appearance and none
2009-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	luca	adriana	that means, system->preference->appearance->visual effects and none
2009-07-19T05:09:00.000Z	luca	adriana	select the visual effect tab
2009-07-19T05:11:00.000Z	luca	adriana	can you see what "glxinfo | grep direct" returns in terminal?
2009-07-19T05:13:00.000Z	luca	adriana	it should say "direct rendering: Yes"
2009-07-19T05:15:00.000Z	luca	adriana	in fact your glxgears has very low fps, on my intel laptop i have 1062.682 FPS
2009-07-19T05:17:00.000Z	luca	adriana	well, first you have to make sure the via driver is loaded
2009-07-19T05:17:00.000Z	luca	adriana	after that, you can blame the driver
2009-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	adriana	luca	I have installed openchorme via Sinaptic
2009-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	luca	adriana	openchrome is the browser if i'm not mistaken
2009-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	luca	adriana	what link does it bear to google earth? :/
2009-07-19T05:49:00.000Z	luca	adriana	really I have no clue about it, but i'll google a little
2009-07-19T05:49:00.000Z	adriana	luca	thank you very much!
2009-07-19T05:50:00.000Z	luca	adriana	i think the drivers suck then :P
2009-07-19T05:50:00.000Z	luca	adriana	the "via" module should be the graphic driver
