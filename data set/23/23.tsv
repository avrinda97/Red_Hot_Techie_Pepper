2012-11-14T03:22:00.000Z	guruguy		is this a community only channel, or does ubuntu troll here?
2012-11-14T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	it's an ubuntu support channel
2012-11-14T03:23:00.000Z	guruguy	ikonia	ok tx!
2012-11-16T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	is there a bug logged if it's that well known ?
2012-11-16T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	ok - so what does those bugs say ?
2012-11-16T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	(ubuntu bugs)
2012-11-16T06:18:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	so the /boot partition is not on the raid 10 array ?
2012-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	yeah, I've just said that, no need for caps
2012-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	raid 5 may also be supported, I can't remember
2012-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	the disks work different in a vm
2012-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	what vm platform ?
2012-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	so a.) look for a solution in the bug reports b.) contribute to the bug report
2012-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	so you've created a virtual md0 in the vmware guest ?
2012-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	not the best test in this situation
2012-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	how are you building the array, mdadm, or a hardware controller ?
2012-11-16T06:26:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	what disk controller ?
2012-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	is this box crash and burn ? or does it need to stay as it is ?
2012-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	would you be interested in a test
2012-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	make a 200mb partition on one disk, put /boot on that, (or use a seperate disk) and then leave the rest on raid 10 ?
2012-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	I suspect the perc device may have poor support in the initram
2012-11-16T06:32:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	but that's a livecd - in a full kernel
2012-11-16T06:32:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	ubuntu will see the disks, but it's the pre-boot that's killing you (I think)
2012-11-16T06:34:00.000Z	ikonia	guruguy	I suspect it's an issue for non-seperate boot also
