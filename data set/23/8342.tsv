2004-10-18T10:34:00.000Z	sri		update-desktop-database is looking to create /usr/gnome2/share/applications which does not exist
2004-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	sri		when I upgraded to ubuntu, my home partition migrated itself over
2004-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	sri		but I did not remove .gnome2 or gconf area
2004-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	sri		so it's remembering my old prefix
2004-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	sri		because I built /usr/gnome2 from source in that prefix before upgrading
2004-10-18T10:36:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	well, you could blow away all your settings :)
2004-10-18T10:37:00.000Z	sri	Lathiat	the /usr, / are all fresh partitions
2004-10-18T10:37:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	thats most odd then
2004-10-18T10:38:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	are you certain thats the problem?
2004-10-18T10:39:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	well you could save that stuff
2004-10-18T10:39:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	thats not the problem
2004-10-18T10:40:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	does it state specifically its looking in /usr/gnome2?
2004-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	sri	Lathiat	yeah, let me email it to you.
2004-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	thats what i was thinking
2004-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	export|grep /usr/gnome2 i guess
2004-10-18T10:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	unset all thsoe adn try it again
2004-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	:) get those out of your bashrc or whatever :)
2004-10-18T10:53:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	whats wrong with it
2004-10-18T10:54:00.000Z	Lathiat	sri	hrm thats odd
