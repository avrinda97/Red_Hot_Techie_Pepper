2012-02-06T03:37:00.000Z	GBGames		So I recently updated from 10.04 to 11.10 on a Dell Precision M6600. I can't seem to get any 3D graphics programs to work, though, which makes me think that the only reason why Unity seems to look nice is that my CPU/RAM specs are making up for it.
2012-02-06T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	unity won't run without 3d support on the card, so it's not your ram / cpu making up for it
2012-02-06T03:38:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	Not even Unity 2d?
2012-02-06T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	your ram/cpu can't compensate like that
2012-02-06T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	that would be 2d
2012-02-06T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	that is 3d
2012-02-06T03:39:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	Ok, so if Unity wouldn't run without 3D graphics, then something else is preventing me from running 3D applications.
2012-02-06T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	either that or you are using unity 2d
2012-02-06T03:41:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	How can I test that it is using 3D correctly? glxinfo/glxgears won't detect GLX or anything, and Ubuntu says that my Nvidia drivers are the proprietary, hardware-accelerated ones.
2012-02-06T03:41:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	first question - has this ever worked ?
2012-02-06T03:42:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	You use "this" and "that" and it is hard to know what you are specifically referring to. Has what ever worked?
2012-02-06T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	unity 3d
2012-02-06T03:43:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	Well, as far as I know, I am logged into it. I have no idea if it is "not working" since it runs and I'm not aware of anything that it should do that makes me say "Ah, yes, there's visual proof" since I just installed 11.10 after using 10.04 for years on a different machine.
2012-02-06T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	ok, if you run glxgears, does it run accelerated ?
2012-02-06T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	ok, what video card do you have ?
2012-02-06T03:45:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	Hold on, let me log in to #ubuntu from my laptop so I don't have to type the error messages.
2012-02-06T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	don't need that, just need you to answer my question
2012-02-06T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	so if you open the hardware drivers tool, does it show the nvidia driver as "in use"?
2012-02-06T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	GBGames	ok, do you have a file called /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2012-02-06T04:07:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu.com/830739/ xorg.conf at top, Xorg.0.log below it.
2012-02-06T04:08:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	I notice that the Screen section doesn't list any resolutions.
2012-02-06T04:17:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	I'll have to come back to this later. I have to run. Thanks for your help so far!
2012-02-06T04:25:00.000Z	GBGames	ikonia	I just checked something really quickly, found this: http://efreedom.com/Question/6-73057/Access-Nvidia-Settings-Use-HDMI-Quadro-3000m-Oneiric  And I disabled Optimus in the BIOS. glxinfo/gears works as expected now.
