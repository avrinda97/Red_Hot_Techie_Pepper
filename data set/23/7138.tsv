2005-10-14T08:46:00.000Z	sasch1		Can anybody help me with a little dpkg problem,please? Since I tried to upgrade gstreamer08-gtk I cant use apt-get anymore/
2005-10-14T08:47:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	does it say something about apt-get -f install ?
2005-10-14T08:47:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	no it says something about dpkg --configure -a and then it just does nothing anymore
2005-10-14T08:48:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	then run that :) "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2005-10-14T08:48:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	actually I am on on su -already
2005-10-14T08:49:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	this is what the terminal says and freezes: Setting up gstreamer0.8-gtk (0.8.11-0ubuntu4) ...
2005-10-14T08:50:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	try to remove it
2005-10-14T08:51:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	how? I cannot use any apt-get or other commands
2005-10-14T08:52:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	 dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. *sigh*
2005-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	why did you install it?
2005-10-14T08:54:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	why? I jsut did some smart upgrade.
2005-10-14T08:55:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	so you run Breezy now?
2005-10-14T08:55:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	running breezy
2005-10-14T08:55:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	in that case you can't use hoary apps...
2005-10-14T08:55:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	for a couple of weeks without *cough* problems
2005-10-14T09:00:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	try dpkg --force-depends --purge gstreamer0.8-gtk
2005-10-14T09:05:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	so you removed it but now with --configure it freezes?
2005-10-14T09:05:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	I cant remove anything.....
2005-10-14T09:09:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	can I remove the gstream08 somehow without doing the dpkg --configure before?
2005-10-14T09:10:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	yes with dpkg --force-depends --purge packagename
2005-10-14T09:13:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	dpkg --force-depends --purge gstreamer......freezes too
2005-10-14T09:13:00.000Z	Mon	sasch1	something's really f*cked up. maybe you should try a reboot and then removing it again
2005-10-14T09:13:00.000Z	sasch1	Mon	thank you....rebooting
