2006-12-16T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	turn off your computer.  What do you mean exactly?
2006-12-16T08:02:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	ok, I thought someone had told me about a command like Alt-SysReq-K, or something along that line...
2006-12-16T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Skinny_Elephants_Is_Utterly_Boring ?
2007-09-14T15:32:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	what are you building?
2007-09-14T15:32:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	libcurl
2007-09-14T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	libcurl3 is in ubuntu's repositories, no need to compile
2007-09-14T15:34:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	I'm trying to build gnash from source, and it's complaining about that version of libcurl
2007-09-14T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	and you've done 'sudo apt-get build-dep gnash' (or installed the -dev package for libcurl)?
2007-09-14T15:38:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	ok, the message I'm getting is "This version of libCurl doesn't have RTMP support"
2007-09-14T15:40:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	you should be able to compile the gnash in the repos after doing 'sudo apt-get build-dep gnash', if they've changed the version of libcurl required then I guess you need to compile libcurl as well
2007-09-14T15:42:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	the version of gnash I have is more recent than the version in the repositories...version 0.8.1.....0.7.2 is what the repos have
2007-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	yes, do you understand what I suggested?
2007-09-14T15:47:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	apt-get returned an error that it couldn't satisfy the dependencies
2007-09-14T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	pastebin the command and the error
2007-09-14T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	you might need feisty-updates universe and multiverse
2007-09-14T15:49:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37451/
2007-09-14T15:50:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	can you pastebin your sources.list as well?
2007-09-14T15:54:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37453/
2007-09-14T15:58:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	jrib	backports as well?
2007-09-14T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	nah, those aren't needed
2008-10-10T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	Geoffrey2	yeah
