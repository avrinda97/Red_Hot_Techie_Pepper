2007-09-30T06:38:00.000Z	org_	mattl	thanks, what about a desktop manager, whenever it start. it goes to gnome right away, and I have gdm & kdm. but still. it doesn't let me choose a session, or even see the login window.
2007-09-30T06:39:00.000Z	org_	mattl	and why does it require the CD for apt-get install anyways?
2007-09-30T06:39:00.000Z	mattl	org_	do you have xdm as well? maybe it's using that?
2007-09-30T06:39:00.000Z	org_	mattl	I'm not sure, how to check on what its using
2007-09-30T06:39:00.000Z	mattl	org_	you need to tell it to not use the CD any more. are you okay with editing a file?
2007-09-30T06:40:00.000Z	mattl	org_	Try in a terminal sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2007-09-30T06:40:00.000Z	org_	mattl	I'm fine with pico
