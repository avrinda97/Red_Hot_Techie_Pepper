2007-04-22T05:24:00.000Z	Gigi		I'm changing configurations on Beryl  but I do not see no difference.  Why?
2007-04-22T05:25:00.000Z	idefixx	Gigi	have u selected the beryl window manager or are you still using metacity?

2007-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	idefixx	Gigi	do you have the beryl icon in your tray? the gem thingy next to the clock?
2007-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	Gigi	idefixx	no next to the clock I do have the volume and then internet and then normal software such gaim.  How do I do that?
2007-04-22T05:27:00.000Z	idefixx	Gigi	Go to System Tool in the menu and start the beryl-manager.
2007-04-22T05:29:00.000Z	Gigi	idefixx	OK.  It is the configurations... and now?
2007-04-22T05:30:00.000Z	idefixx	Gigi	if you started the Beryl Manager there should be the try icon i was talking about.

2007-04-22T05:30:00.000Z	idefixx	Gigi	If you do not have the beryl manager. do 'sudo apt-get install beryl-manager'
