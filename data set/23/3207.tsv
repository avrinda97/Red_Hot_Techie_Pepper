2011-06-18T02:40:00.000Z	MrCraig		Hi all - I know it's not strictly ubuntu but, I'm having problems getting apache2 vhosts to work using the a2ensite to enable them. The server restarts, but everything ends up showing me my default site. Any ideas?
2011-06-18T02:41:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	may be you need to specify you document root properly
2011-06-18T02:42:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	thanks - good shout but actually if you set it to a non-existant directory the server throws an error on restart
2011-06-18T02:43:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	I am not saying non-existent, i am saying may be it's still /var/www instead of you correct one
2011-06-18T02:44:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	Appreciated the response, I went and checked anyway. It's correct - and I tried adding a slash at the end in case that made a difference too ( I seem to recall it mattered to apache < version 2 )
2011-06-18T02:45:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	may be you need to paste the content of your vhost file
2011-06-18T02:50:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	and how do you try to access the site now?
2011-06-18T02:53:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	what's the path for this index.html file you are seeing now?
2011-06-18T02:53:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	/web/000catch-all/public/index.html
2011-06-18T02:54:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	remove ServerName  82.165.11.156 and retry
2011-06-18T02:56:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	and make the catchall vhost after your domain in the file
2011-06-18T02:56:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	thanks but still no
2011-06-18T02:56:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	you restarted apache?
2011-06-18T02:57:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	yes - and I'm getting a relavent error message that, if it was there before, I was being blind to...  [warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts  - but that doesn't help me fix it with my level of knowledge.
2011-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	I just googled that and found the answer.  Thank you very much for your time helping me.
2011-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	fine, what's the solution exactly turned to be?
2011-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	I wonder if I wasn't seeing it with ServerName <ipaddress> in there? anyway, it works.   Where I'd put <VirtualHost *>  in the vhost files, it should have read <VirtualHost *:80>
2011-06-18T03:03:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	yes, normally I just copy the default file and modify it so I won't commit such typos
2011-06-18T03:04:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	I'd copy pasted from a tutorial blog/website http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/27/ubuntu-feisty-apache-virtual-hosts and feel a comment is in order :-)
2011-06-18T03:04:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	by the way VirtualHost * is not wrong. It all depends on other config files
2011-06-18T03:05:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	in your case because your ports.conf file has NameVirtualHost *:80, you need to specify the port
2011-06-18T03:07:00.000Z	MrCraig	edgy	thanks - this could be because an ssl is configured on this server also (it's a hosted server installed from a "minimal ubuntu x64 10.04" image)
2011-06-18T03:08:00.000Z	edgy	MrCraig	glad everything is OK now, bye
