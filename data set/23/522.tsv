2011-07-24T21:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	not quite.  You can't have a folder called / so you can't hide it
2011-07-24T21:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	thanks for the info, i was thinking of the config directories in the home directory ./purple etc
2011-07-24T21:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	close again, ~/.purple ;)
2011-07-24T21:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	wow, i'm not thinking clearly today, thanks
2011-07-24T23:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	sounds like DarsVaeda is trying to get tab-complete to reveal usernames
2011-07-31T20:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	saying "ubuntu" is distributed under GPL is an over-simplification, which isn't entirely true.  Much of ubuntu is GPL, but certainly not ALL of it.
2011-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	if you use chromium then you don't get the spying/tracking features ;)
2011-10-02T20:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	funnily enough, i'm running seperate X with my nvidia
2011-10-02T20:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	do you have two wm/de running?  one on each?  what do you use the separate X for?
2011-10-02T20:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	both running xfce, just got a fullscreen terminal in one with htop on all the time
2012-04-27T22:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	vda1?
2012-04-27T22:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	it's virtio for kvm
2012-04-27T22:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	cool
2012-07-29T23:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	thanks - mind reader ;)
2012-08-02T18:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	haha, yeah
2012-08-15T16:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	TJ- can't you run "source .bashrc" to update it?  WhereIsMySpoon
2012-08-15T16:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	he just said he did
2012-08-15T16:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	i think he was just wondering why it didn't work immediately (it didn't take effect because he was already logged in)
2012-08-15T16:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	i "believe" if you run "source .bashrc" you don't need to logout/login...
2012-08-15T16:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	yeah, i know, so does he
2012-08-15T16:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	zykotick9	he was wondering why it doesn't take effect after editing the file
2012-09-15T22:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	ThinkT510	"mesh" wireless networks... cool stuff really.
