2005-01-09T17:37:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	if you have flgrx in your config it shouldnt work
2005-01-09T17:37:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	it's fglrx
2005-01-09T17:38:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	- sorry, typo! that's what I had
2005-01-09T17:43:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	have you got your fglrx module to work?
2005-01-09T17:45:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	no, and I can't seem to get the old ati driver working, either, the server isn't starting at all. a backup of the original file would have been great ;)
2005-01-09T17:45:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	you have a custom kernel or the one that comes with ubuntu?
2005-01-09T17:47:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	dpkg -l |grep fglrx
2005-01-09T17:47:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	check if you have it installed
2005-01-09T17:48:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	/var/log/XFree86.0.log i think
2005-01-09T17:49:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	Yes, I have the -driver and -control packages
2005-01-09T17:49:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	and what does it say when you try to modprobe fglrx ?
2005-01-09T17:49:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	Just followed the steps in ubunu's faq pages
2005-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	nothing at all, that seems to be working fine
2005-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	well..you need the module loaded in order for it to work with your config =)
2005-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	try to set it back to fglrx in the config file now and try start it
2005-01-09T17:51:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	I added it to the end of the modules file - shouldn't that make it load automagically on boot?
2005-01-09T17:51:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	yepp
2005-01-09T17:54:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	changed it back to fglrx, but no luck. is 'startx' enough to restart the server do I need to do anything else?
2005-01-09T17:54:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	it should be
2005-01-09T17:54:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	what error you get? no screens found ?
2005-01-09T17:56:00.000Z	kuckus	huttan	"addscreen/screeninit failed for driver 0"
2005-01-09T17:56:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	you should try that too
2005-01-09T06:00:00.000Z	huttan	kuckus	fglrxconfig
