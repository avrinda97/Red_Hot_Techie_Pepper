2009-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	pradeep		any one knows how to set up my laptop as a server??
2009-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	what sort of server?
2009-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	server is a very broad title
2009-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	so a web server then?
2009-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	ok thats better, "server" on its own means nearly nothing
2009-09-07T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	it is a server now, it is serving httpd
2009-09-07T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	as long as he is connected to your wan, yes
2009-09-07T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	so if s/he is connected to your network, that will work
2009-09-07T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	if you are at your house and your friend is at his/her house then that ip will not work
2009-09-07T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	you need to setup virtual server / port forwarding on your router to allow the traffic through
2009-09-07T13:48:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	how to do that:-)
2009-09-07T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	then your friend will connect to the wan ip of your router and the data will be forwarded to the correctinternal system
2009-09-07T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	it varys wildly from router to router. dig out your manual
2009-09-07T13:50:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	There s a application called Meiga which allows you to share folders over http. y won that work?
2009-09-07T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	bad config, is meiga a windows program?
2009-09-07T13:51:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	meiga.igalia.com
2009-09-07T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	you'd still need to port forward to the internal pc
2009-09-07T13:52:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	But that allows file sharing.
2009-09-07T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	yes but you are behind a router which will drop the requests as they are not permitted
2009-09-07T13:54:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	Anyways i will try messing up with my router and try. The only problem is I am on a college wifi. so i have to get permission to access the router page and do the config
2009-09-07T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	you could share your entire system to every manand his dog, if the router does not permit the traffic then no requests will get to the internal lan
2009-09-07T13:55:00.000Z	pradeep	ActionParsnip1	:-);-) thanks for the help
2009-09-07T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	pradeep	np man
