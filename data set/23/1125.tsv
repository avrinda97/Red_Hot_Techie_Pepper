2010-08-16T02:08:00.000Z	batbrat		Hi
2010-08-16T02:08:00.000Z	batbrat		I'm trying to figure out an installation issue.
2010-08-16T02:09:00.000Z	batbrat		I'm trying to install freeglut3 without libgl1-mesa-dev. I tried to compile it from source since the package manager could not help me.
2010-08-16T02:09:00.000Z	batbrat		When compiling from source, freeglut is unable to find the gl headers
2010-08-16T02:09:00.000Z	batbrat		I located them at /usr/include/ATI/GL
2010-08-16T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	have you installed the opengl headers for development?
2010-08-16T02:11:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	Do you know what needs to be done to get things working?
2010-08-16T02:11:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	hmm.. nope.. but let me google around for a bit.. see if I can't find something useful
2010-08-16T02:12:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	Thanks. I hope you find something useful.
2010-08-16T02:14:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	you've downloaded the source for freeglut somewhere?
2010-08-16T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	I haven't really found anything.. as far as I can tell the opengl development headers should come from the ATI package
2010-08-16T02:20:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	They do come with the ATI package
2010-08-16T02:21:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	and I can't really see a reason for them not being used by the sources for glut
2010-08-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	tried creating symlinks?
2010-08-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	nope.. I would be surprised if you had to do that too.. but it might be a quick way to make things work
2010-08-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	yes
2010-08-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	or just copy them.. it's not like those files are huge
2010-08-16T02:23:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	Have you done this kind of thing before?
2010-08-16T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	I've never had problems with gl headers missing
2010-08-16T02:24:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	Ok
2010-08-16T02:25:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	Thanks for helping. I'm going to dig around a bit. I'll symlink if I cannot find any alternative in another thirty minutes.
2010-08-16T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	batbrat	you're welcome.. I hope you succeed in some way =)
2010-08-16T02:29:00.000Z	batbrat	Slart	I'll let you know if I find a good answer.
