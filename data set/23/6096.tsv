2012-09-29T02:59:00.000Z	jaekid		i guess the smart dude cheez has the answer...
2012-09-29T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	pastebin this "same error"
2012-09-29T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	this channel isn't a pastebin.  Please use http://paste.ubuntu.com in the future.  Can you pastebin the output of: apt-cache policy php5-curl phpapi-20090626+lfs php5-common
2012-09-29T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	this isn't what I asked but if you're on maverick with natty repositories then you have a few issues.  First off, you can't mix repositories like that and expect to not have a broken system.  And second of all, maverick isn't supported anymore
2012-09-29T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	then pastebin what I asked
2012-09-29T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	 Can you pastebin the output of: apt-cache policy php5-curl phpapi-20090626+lfs php5-common
2012-09-29T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	type it in a terminal
2012-09-29T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	everything after the ':'
2012-09-29T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	why did you paste all this garbage in the middle and half of it in the wrong order... it makes it hard to read
2012-09-29T03:15:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	you're pinning things?
2012-09-29T03:19:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	I don't see how you can inadvertently pin a package.  Anyway, that's probably the cause of your issues
2012-09-29T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	pastebin your /etc/apt/preferences*
2012-09-29T03:21:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	if you do not have a /etc/apt/preferences, then what files do you have in /etc/apt/preferences.d/?
2012-09-29T03:22:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	pastebin there contents... and where do these files come from
2012-09-29T03:23:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	what's the output of « dpkg -S /etc/apt/preferences.d/php »?
2012-09-29T03:25:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	just delete those two files in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ and run « sudo apt-get update »
2012-09-29T03:27:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	pastebin...
2012-09-29T03:27:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	so you must edit your sources and remove the duplicate
2012-09-29T03:28:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	you have to check /etc/apt/sources.list as well as /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
2012-09-29T03:28:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	well they're all used
2012-09-29T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	jaekid	sure
