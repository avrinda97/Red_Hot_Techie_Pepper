2011-07-30T10:01:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		I've been on the purple ubuntu loading screen for 15 min now
2011-07-30T10:01:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		You sure that's good?
2011-07-30T10:01:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		I booted the cd in windows
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		I ran the cd in windows*
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Yes I did
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Hatsh matched
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Hash
2011-07-30T10:03:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Logged on?
2011-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		No I ran the cd, then it asked me to reboot, I did then it took me to the boot screen, then I hit 'ubuntu'
2011-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Then it said now installing, and then the purple ubuntu screen came up
2011-07-30T10:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	it has been a a while since I installed a wubi but it may be just installing.
2011-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	the first part just loads the ISO and thr reboot installs.
2011-07-30T10:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	did you just let it make its own space in C, no partitioning?
2011-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	that is the best procedure.
2011-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	I refernce C as the usaual main partition in windows.
2011-07-30T10:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	it's a wubi right?
2011-07-30T10:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	a ubuntu that is installed from inside windows is called a wubi install, just asking to confirm this.
2011-07-30T10:33:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	so besides the great help here , there is a megathread on wubi here,  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1639198
2011-07-30T10:39:00.000Z	TheMoonMan	nit-wit	my problem is not in there
2011-07-30T10:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	I would run the boootscript from a live cd and post it there rubi1200 is on this stuff, if ytou get no help here.
2011-07-30T10:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	there are two daily users there that specialize in wubi, the help is far between.
2011-07-30T10:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	wubi is for people to exsperience ubuntu and be able to remove it from add remove, no partitioning. basically if you like it a dual boot is suggested, it is a little unstable in that a grub update will override the mbr wiping the ms bootloader.
2011-07-30T10:45:00.000Z	nit-wit	TheMoonMan	what?
