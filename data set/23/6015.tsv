2006-07-02T13:37:00.000Z	metrol		Should be a flashplayer.xpt and libflashplayer.so in there or you don't get Flash
2006-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	metrol		I can actually watch Google Video!!  WooHoo! :)
2006-07-02T13:40:00.000Z	metrol		Like some other service has a lock on the audio device
2006-07-02T13:41:00.000Z	metrol		Heck, I don't know what kind of audio backend I'm using right now! :)
2006-07-02T13:41:00.000Z	metrol		Ahh, the beautiful ignorance of just barely grasping what I'm using here :)
2006-07-02T13:43:00.000Z	metrol		Still, for someone looking to learn Unix I think one of the BSD's is a good place to start.  Mostly because they don't provide the ease of use like Ubuntu does
2006-07-02T13:45:00.000Z	metrol		Debian installation guide scared me away :)
2006-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	metrol		I started moving away from Windows with RH 6.0... nice taste of things at the time, but I didn't really learn how to get around Unix
2006-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	metrol		My fault, not red hat's
2006-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	metrol		For whatever reason, I really dug BSD straight off
2006-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	NetBSD is nice
2006-07-02T13:58:00.000Z	metrol	mc__	I was thinking bum, but wasn't sure and didn't want to look much more dumb than I am :)
2006-07-02T13:58:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	maybe cause automatix can install it
2006-07-02T13:59:00.000Z	metrol	mc__	haven't used automatix, but I did read about it

2006-07-02T14:00:00.000Z	metrol	mc__	I'm sure I'll be looking at it at some point

2006-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	hehe,but emacs is really a nice editor too
2006-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	jde is a nice java ide
2006-07-02T14:03:00.000Z	metrol	mc__	I've actually tried to like emacs, on a number of occassions.  My brain and those key strokes were never able to align
2006-07-02T14:03:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	it just takes some time
2006-07-02T14:04:00.000Z	mc__	metrol	i dont like vim
