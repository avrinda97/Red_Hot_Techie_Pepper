2007-10-14T14:01:00.000Z	moDumass		cool, thanks
2007-10-14T06:21:00.000Z	moDumass		hey all, i just installed automatix2 because well, it exists. so its "updating my sources list" and its stops on
2007-10-14T06:21:00.000Z	moDumass		oh, looks like its sorted itself out
2007-10-14T06:22:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	we don't support automatix systems
2007-10-14T06:22:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	by using automatix you risk losing your community support
2007-10-14T06:23:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	read the link ubotu said to learn more about automatix
2007-10-14T06:23:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	because you've not insalled the w32 codecs
2007-10-14T06:24:00.000Z	moDumass	ikonia	i have indeed
2007-10-14T06:24:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	then its probably the wrong codec for the others
2008-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	what command are you using
2008-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	moDumass	ikonia	what do you mean?
2008-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	what command generates that error
2008-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	moDumass	ikonia	sudo mount -a
2008-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	in your fstab do you have any remove hosts
2008-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	moDumass	ikonia	nothing should have changed, i only moved my machine about 5 yards
2008-10-28T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	check if you have remote hosts in your fstab
2008-10-28T14:53:00.000Z	moDumass	ikonia	//192.168.1.2/PUBLIC\040DISK\0401 /media/NAS200/200Gig cifs auto,iocharset=utf8,uid=evilsherpa,gid=users,credentials=/root/.cifscredentials,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775 0 0
2008-10-28T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	thats the problem then
2008-10-28T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	moDumass	no route to host 192.x.x.x
