2010-10-15T02:05:00.000Z	kgunpowder		Can anyone help me? During some Linux boots, I end up with a bunch of sprawling code that will end and lead me nowhere after a point. :(
2010-10-15T02:05:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	You would have to be more specific as to what the code says.
2010-10-15T02:06:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	I believe it says "kernel-init-helper"
2010-10-15T02:06:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	this happens when I use the recovery console, and recently when booting Ubuntu, then I get nowhere.
2010-10-15T02:07:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	Let me do some googling, one second.
2010-10-15T02:08:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	Do you have a prompt that you can use when you boot?
2010-10-15T02:09:00.000Z	kgunpowder		Only a prompt asking me for one of three boot options, and after that it just scrolls through code and would SEEM as if it's waiting for something, but nothing.

2010-10-15T02:10:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	What are your three boot options?
2010-10-15T02:10:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	boot generic, recovery boot, and go back for my Win7 option.
2010-10-15T02:12:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	This would be a lot easier if I had the actual error that you are getting. Could you maybe boot up and give me the last few lines of code on your screen?
2010-10-15T02:13:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	That is the last line, something about the kernel help but along with that there's that line, and one with a ? at the beginning, like that for hundreds of lines too. Not just that one.
2010-10-15T02:14:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	That's a bit confusing. What specifically does it say about your kernel? If it is a kernel issue and it's not giving you a prompt, it's usually cause for a re-installation of the kernel.
2010-10-15T02:16:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	That would make a bit of sense, because I can't get anywhere when it comes down to that, but it would seem that another copy of "Isadora" does just about the same.
2010-10-15T02:18:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	I would try reinstalling Mint, but if a fresh installation throws this error at you, then it's either a bad kernel release (unlikely,) or it doesn't like your computer hardware (more likely.)
2010-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	I'm not familiar what kernel Mint runs on, so from there you're about on your own.
2010-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	kgunpowder	tylermolamphy	I'd take your advice for both, ubuntu didn't have my drivers and although I got around that, Mint has disagreed from the start.
2010-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	Try out a new flavor, like Ubuntu 10.10 or Kubuntu 10.10, and see if you still have the same problems. Then you'll know that it's your hardware, unless Mint and Ubuntu run the same kernel. I have no idea if they do or not.
2010-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	kgunpowder		Ubuntu 10.10 is what I'm using, but I'll give a reinstall a shot.
2010-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	kgunpowder		Tylermolamphy
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	When you said Isadora, I assumed you were running Linux Mint. My bad.
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	In that case, try 10.04 and see if those issues are there.
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	tylermolamphy	kgunpowder	They run different kernels.
