2009-10-29T22:59:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Can someone please help me getting flash to work on my x64 installation? I have no sound when a video plays.
2009-10-29T23:00:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Can someone please help me fix my no-sound issue with x64 Adobe Flash?
2009-10-29T23:00:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	truthfully Rob, uninstall flash from Ubuntu and download and use Adobe's flash ofr 64bit
2009-10-29T23:00:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	darthanubis	Done.
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubis: I've tried installing flash every way possible, I did a clean install of 9.10 and installed the Alpha version of flash from Adobe's website. Still nothing.
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	extract the plugin to ~./mozilla/plugins
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubis: I already did.
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubis: Flash works, there's just no sound.
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubis: I think it has to do with my unconventional audio-card uninstallation.
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	make SURe no other flash/gnash packages from Ubuntu is installed on your system
2009-10-29T23:01:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubis: I did a clean install, I'm 100% sure there isn't one.
2009-10-29T23:02:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubus, But to get my audio card to work, I had to install ALSA 1.0.21, and then...because my audio card has multiple outputs, I had to install Kmix to select the correct one.
2009-10-29T23:02:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	use gnome-alsamixer to adjust sound
2009-10-29T23:02:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		Darthanubus, sound works, though...just not with flash.
2009-10-29T23:03:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	darthanubis	let me see if that works. One moment.
2009-10-29T23:03:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	I had tha before. Close Firefox, killall -9 pulseaudio, restart pulseaudio via alt-f2 then reopen youtube
2009-10-29T23:04:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	darthanubis	still doesn't work.
2009-10-29T23:05:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	:((
2009-10-29T23:05:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	darthanubis	When I open gnome-alsamixer...nothing happens?
2009-10-29T23:06:00.000Z	darthanubis	RobLikesBrunch	'nothing" that can't be good
2009-10-29T23:17:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch		How do I uninstall flash if I installed it from the official adobe site?
2009-10-29T23:17:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	darthanubis	how do I uninstall my current installation of flash?
