2005-10-22T11:02:00.000Z	theantidj		anyone with ideas on how to help me with 802.1x?
2005-10-22T11:02:00.000Z	theantidj		it's for a wired network though
2005-10-22T11:02:00.000Z	theantidj		but they still use 802.1x authentication
2005-10-22T11:03:00.000Z	theantidj		I apparently need a program named xsupplicant
2005-10-22T11:03:00.000Z	theantidj		but I don't know how to install it
2005-10-22T11:03:00.000Z	theantidj		if I'm not already connected to the internet
2005-10-22T11:03:00.000Z	theantidj		since I can't seem to apt-get it
2005-10-22T11:04:00.000Z	theantidj		I've got a tar.gz of the xsupplicant file
2005-10-22T11:04:00.000Z	theantidj		but I don't exactly know what to do with it
2005-10-22T11:04:00.000Z	theantidj		the documentation at Sourceforge is not new-user friendly
2005-10-22T11:05:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	did you look for a .deb at packages.ubuntu.com?
2005-10-22T11:05:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	did you look for a .deb at packages.ubuntu.com?
2005-10-22T11:05:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	no
2005-10-22T11:08:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	they do have it here: "http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/net/xsupplicant"
2005-10-22T11:08:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	download it from there and put the file on your ubuntu-breezy
2005-10-22T11:08:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	should I put it in a specific directory?
2005-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	no
2005-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	Ok, and once I put it on my breezy machine, the apt-get command will work for that package?
2005-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	you will install it with dpkg -i *.deb
2005-10-22T11:10:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	oh ok
2005-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	upon closer inspection there isn't one with a .deb exention
2005-10-22T11:13:00.000Z	sn9	theantidj	the .deb is what you should have downloaded
2005-10-22T11:14:00.000Z	theantidj	sn9	never mind, I went to the wrong place on packages.ubuntu.com  I found it now
