2005-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	neom		It'
2005-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	neom		It's a distro.....
2005-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	neom		You ever seen it running?
2005-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	neom		I've heard some interesting things about it at work today.
2005-02-15T14:27:00.000Z	neom		lifeless - Fuck user friendly, it runs -all- windows programs provided they have a valid install protocal.

2005-02-15T14:29:00.000Z	neom		Well, that's what I was shown at work today by the rep. I took installed frash install, took a windows xp office CD, installed it, and ran it. And then he took a half life cd, installed it and ran it.
2005-02-15T14:29:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	hl at what speed?
2005-02-15T14:36:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	do you own the source?
2005-02-15T14:39:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	well, why don't you own the source when they are "custom company applications"?
2005-02-15T14:40:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	vmware, wine, other software or a good programmer are you alternatives I guess...
2005-02-15T14:42:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	well, maybe the software manufactuer is willing to port it to unix/linux....
2005-02-15T14:45:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	just to get it straight: you have all your business applications ready for linux, you have and office application, a browser, a mailprogramm.... but still need windows, so that the users see a "based on NT Technology" - so they get the fuzzy warm feeling of beeing at home, and having their msn messanger?
2005-02-15T14:47:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	well I understand me.... it's like for me having windows, knowing not to be able to run mutt.... what would I do without mutt...
2005-02-15T14:48:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	so you even run an X-Server on Windows or are the apps text based?
2005-02-15T14:50:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	well, install linux over night, and write a big letter on the front door, that the first ten employee who will pass a company-internal-linux test will get a 10% salary raise... IMHO money solve almost every problem....
2005-02-15T14:53:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	you live in Canada? Where exacly?
2005-02-15T14:55:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	I played with the thought of doing some bigger stay in canada, and possibly do some work there to get some money... but somehow got the impression that there are not that much of IT jobs available... but didn't any decent research...
2005-02-15T15:09:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	I read somewhere that it's custom to get a "check" for you salary - so it's not transfered electronicaly from the account of the company to your private - is that true?
2005-02-15T15:13:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	what does a "huge house" cost in ca
2005-02-15T15:17:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	for that money you might get a flat (is this the right word?) here in switzerland...
2005-02-15T15:20:00.000Z	Phoenix[SPH] 	neom	how many rooms / square meters?
