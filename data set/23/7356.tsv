2007-01-22T07:18:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	do you have all the extra ubuntu repos enabled?
2007-01-22T07:19:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	go into synaptic, then tools -> repositories and check all the extra ones on the first tab (apart from source if you don't want it)

2007-01-22T08:15:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	the package is jsut called network-manager
2007-01-22T08:17:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	i think you need to turn off the normal management of wireless networks, one second
2007-01-22T08:20:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	yeah, should work
2007-01-22T08:21:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	it has a daemon that runs in the background, and i'm n#ot sure where that gets started up....

2007-01-22T08:23:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	try "ps -ae |grep NetworkManager
2007-01-22T08:25:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	hmm, how happy are you editing /etc/networking/interfaces?
2007-01-22T08:27:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	if you sudo gedit /etc/networking/interfaces and comment out everything apart from the "auto ..." lines, e.g. auto eth0
2007-01-22T08:28:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	save that, then do "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
2007-01-22T08:28:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	then try network manager again
2007-01-22T08:30:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	fong	i'm afraid i'm working from my brain
