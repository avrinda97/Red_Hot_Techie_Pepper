2006-02-26T12:06:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	if you need the external vga to work, check out MergedFB. (google)
2006-02-26T12:06:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	Though on most of my machines, if i boot with the projector plugged in, X is mirrored.
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	That's interesting, I'll have to test that.
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	But I was hoping more of a Desktop on screen0, and the actual presentation on screen1, which is controlled by ooimpress2 on screen0
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	If that makes sense?
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	It makes sense, but i think you may be SOL.
2006-02-26T12:08:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Windows and Mac do this fine.
2006-02-26T12:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	it's not something that X makes particularly easy or intuitive.
2006-02-26T12:09:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Today (Fortunately I haven't actually had to do presentations yet), my laptop reverted from doing cloned mode to strict one-monitor mode - perhaps it's to do with the second monitor being plugged in :(
2006-02-26T12:22:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Looks like that rebooting _does_ reset the dual-screen status.
2006-08-28T14:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	Nope.
2006-08-28T14:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	Again, your opinion is based on mysql 3 maybe./
2006-08-28T14:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	it not actually limited anymore.
2006-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	So I'm told, but I still dislike MySQL's data types and default values and treatment of NULL, etc.
2006-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Though, I do admit I base my opinion on various websites.
2006-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	That's a matter of what you're used to, nothing to do with the product.
2006-08-28T14:27:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	This website, in particular: http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html#id2457388
2006-08-28T14:28:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	yes, I've seen it. I base my opinion about Linux on http://g.msn.com/9SE/1?http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;314458&&DI=6066&IG=099c1c4aa3fd4d6bbedd6567401070de&POS=5&CM=WPU&CE=4&CS=AWP&SR=4
2006-08-28T14:29:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	What does it say about linux?
2006-08-28T14:29:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	How to remove it and install XP.
2006-08-28T14:30:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Looks like they're acknowledging their existance now.
2006-08-28T14:30:00.000Z	cafuego	Arafangi1n	Thing is, you can find any opinion on any topic online. With no reference as to whether it's actually true or valuable.
2006-08-28T14:31:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	cafuego	Still, that website I showed is somewhat unbiased - though it does suggest that postgresql is administratively more difficult than MySQL.
