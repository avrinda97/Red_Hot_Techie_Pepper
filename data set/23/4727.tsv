2007-08-11T10:52:00.000Z	TimGroe	locke	well, first you need to get the source file(s) that the patch is for :)
2007-08-11T10:53:00.000Z	locke	TimGroe	im trying to do this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/106622 =x

2007-08-11T11:08:00.000Z	locke	TimGroe	I think I found a thread with the solution, I'm looking at it now. :] 
2007-08-11T11:09:00.000Z	locke	TimGroe	without having to compile the entire kernel thankfully, I didn't really wanna do that. :P
2007-08-11T11:09:00.000Z	TimGroe	locke	well, you will have to if it is a patch :P
2007-08-11T11:10:00.000Z	locke	TimGroe	this guide says you can just compile the patched module. :]
