2005-10-30T07:34:00.000Z	Revellion	jtan325	should be easy
2005-10-30T07:35:00.000Z	Revellion	jtan325	Twinview is Nvidia's own version of Xinerama
2005-10-30T07:35:00.000Z	Revellion	jtan325	Clone or Extended?

2005-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	jtan325	Revellion	does that make any sense?
2005-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	Revellion	jtan325	it makes sense yup
