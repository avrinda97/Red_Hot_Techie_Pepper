2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	napkin		anyone know of vmware server networking problems between host and guest?  running feisty.  tcp connections always hang.
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	how do you have the clients configured?  Bridge?
2007-06-30T13:57:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	yeah, bridge.  ping works, but ssh doesn't, for example.  smb browsing works, but reaching shares doesn't!
2007-06-30T13:57:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	i have been using vmware bridged networking for years so i know my services aren't misconfigured.  something funny is going on.
2007-06-30T14:00:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	 I recently had similar problem - turn out to be duplicate ip addresses. on host and client.  guess it wouldn't something as simple as that?
2007-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	no, they got different addresses from my dhcp server.  in fact both host and guest have no problem connecting with other machines on the lan/internet.  only problems between eachother.
2007-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	any other protocols work?  maybe an ssh setup issue?
2007-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	doubt it. for example, i can ssh from my guest to another machine on the network, and then to the host.
2007-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	they just have a problem with eachother.
2007-06-30T14:06:00.000Z	bodybybuddha		Anyone with any exp. with getting a usb-headset working in feisty?  device is recognized, but no joy in anything i do in the alsa-base.  any suggestions?
2007-06-30T14:07:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	does any other protocol work between host and client - http, ftp, etc.?  or is it just ssh?
2007-06-30T14:08:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	hm, will have to check.
2007-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	http hangs too.  ie, i connect to the host from the guest via http, and via tcpdump i can see the host sending back acks repeatedly but nothing happens.  yes http works fine from other hosts.
2007-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	it's like the acks aren't getting to the guest
2007-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	hm, just trying to rule out any network stuff first - any static routes, firewalls, etc?
2007-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	bodybybuddha		nakin:  vmware forums also point to performance issues.
2007-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	vmware forums also point to performance issues :http://www.vmware.com/community/thread.jspa?messageID=683286
2007-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	may not apply to you
2007-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	not that i know of.  i haven't touched my network settings, and this is a pretty fresh install of feisty.
2007-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	napkin	bodybybuddha	it is a very new laptop though, so maybe it's a problem with the network driver.
2007-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	 sorry, new to ubuntu and vmware.  the only other thing I've heard about some other people doing is actually to setup a static route to the default router to get some of these host/clients issues resolved.
2007-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	 buy YMMV
2007-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	bodybybuddha	napkin	but YMMV
