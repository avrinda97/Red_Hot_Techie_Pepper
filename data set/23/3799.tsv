2008-01-17T22:35:00.000Z	adrock358		So I'm blacklisting some drivers, and I got to build install build files.  I'm new.  Don't know anything about linux, except that I like it.  Goodbye windows.  I need to write these commands in the terminal window except with my version of the headers.
2008-01-17T22:36:00.000Z	adrock358		anybody throw me a bone?  I'm sure this is wickedly simple
2008-01-17T22:36:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	hang on could you explain the problem again, i didn't really follow from your previous
2008-01-17T22:39:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	that still doesn't make much sense to me, you'd  blacklist drivers in /etc/modules or /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist blah
2008-01-17T22:42:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	i'm blacklist bad drivers, putting new ones in.  I am new as heck.  I am following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Belkin_F5D7050_ver_3000_%28Ralink_rt73_driver%29?highlight=%28WifiDocs%2FDevice%29                            thank you for all your help.
2008-01-17T22:42:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	oh for wifi, sorry i don't really know anything about wifi but im sure someone can help
2008-01-17T22:43:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 Thank you.  Can you tell me what a 'header' is ?
2008-01-17T22:44:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	a header is a part of a source code file which generally contains things like definitions of constants which will be used again and so forth
2008-01-17T22:45:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 thank you so much.  albatross.  how do I find what my heading is that I would input into this excerpt from a wireless tutorial :   user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`   user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r` /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
2008-01-17T22:46:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	from what you've posted there, you can actually do those lines and it will work for you
2008-01-17T22:46:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 interesting.  thank you.  I may be back
2008-01-17T22:47:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	  log returns this :  bash: user@ubuntu:~$: command not found
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 thank you.
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	hmm, which command did you try
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	sudo apt-get install linux-headers `uname -a`
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	bash: user@ubuntu:~$: command not found
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	when you're using backticks you have to be very careful you type the backtick (above the tilde not on my keyboard) not the single quote
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 i see, i am retarded.  thank you.
2008-01-17T22:48:00.000Z	albatross	adrock358	also you should be doing this in the terminal asccessories->terminal
2008-01-17T22:49:00.000Z	adrock358	albatross	 yes
