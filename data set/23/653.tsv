2011-12-17T07:16:00.000Z	Snowie		could someone enlighten me on this or point me at some reading. Have picked up 3d animation as a hobby using blender, but the latest version of blender is 2.61, but only 2.58 is in the repo's. what is generally the process around repo updates for software
2011-12-17T07:18:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	historically ubuntu has been debian testing frozen 3-6m before the release date and then tweaked and stabilized
2012-09-26T06:26:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	yup
2012-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	/usr/games/game-data-packager is probably a directory or maybe a broken symlink
2012-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	in other words its not a file
2012-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	run "ls -l /usr/games/game-data-packager" and see what it says
2012-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	what does "file /usr/games/game-data-packager" say
2012-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	try "games-data-packager --help"
2012-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	more than likely the "is not a file" error is coming from inside the script. try "grep -in "is not" /usr/games/game-data-packager" and see if it prints any lines with "is not a file"
2012-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	the other possibility is some kind of filesystem corruption, that is being triggered when BASH gets to a later point in the file. You could try and run "tail /usr/games/game-data-packager" and see if that cause the "is not a file" error
2012-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	ahhh, i get you. meaning that it probably wants an executable path, not a directory??? it does say use a directory.
2012-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	i think it's time to take a step back. What i really want to do is play quake, but instructions are all over the place. i have the official script from the repo's, and have unpacked the shareware version via dosbox. the folder it tells me to move the PAKs to doesnt exist, and even when i create it, the official launcher tells me to head to the readme. Any suggestions?
2012-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	well the PAK file presumably goes in /usr/share/games/quake or the like
2012-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	and you can apt-get install a variant of quake (there are a few different versions)
2012-10-22T07:10:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	yeah. might install darkplaces.
2012-10-22T07:27:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	lol, answer was simply case sensitivity http://www.christopherkois.com/?p=304
2012-10-22T07:27:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	thanks though bro
2012-11-05T06:23:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	anything in /usr/bin should be owned by root. if you manually install something it should NEVER be placed in /usr/bin use /usr/local/bin instead
2012-11-05T06:24:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	its also possible that error is from inside /usr/bin/sandbox (ie sandbox is running and then tries to do something and gets the permission error)
2012-11-12T07:30:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	top? ps?
2012-11-12T07:33:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	i have seen top. not sure what to do with it though. got any reading.
2012-11-12T07:34:00.000Z	escott	Snowie	man top
2012-11-12T07:34:00.000Z	Snowie	escott	ah, i see, thanks
