2009-02-09T02:13:00.000Z	Safe		Stupid internet connection.
2009-02-09T02:14:00.000Z	eut	Safe	yes
2009-02-09T02:01:00.000Z	eut	Safe	Renfield, what is your problem?
2009-02-09T02:02:00.000Z	Safe	eut	well, internet just wont start? I've configured everything as it should be. (according to the examples I've googled.)
2009-02-09T02:04:00.000Z	Safe	eut	it's a little tricky for me since I dual-boot, makes it kinda hard to troubleshoot.
2009-02-09T02:04:00.000Z	eut	Safe	have you tried "sudo dhclient3"?
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	eut	Safe	have you tried manually editing /etc/network/interfaces?
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	Safe	eut	yup, that's the only way I've done it.
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	eut	Safe	paste your interfaces
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	Safe	eut	in a moment.
2009-02-09T02:12:00.000Z	Safe	eut	http://pastebin.com/m576ec9e
2009-02-09T02:13:00.000Z	Safe	eut	did you get that? http://pastebin.com/m576ec9e
2009-02-09T02:16:00.000Z	eut	Safe	looks right to me. can you ping your nameserer? 212.217.248.3?
2009-02-09T02:16:00.000Z	Safe	eut	no, can't ping anything except myself. It doesn't say "no such host" any longer though, so a little progress.
2009-02-09T02:17:00.000Z	eut	Safe	what about your router?
2009-02-09T02:17:00.000Z	eut	Safe	or the gateway
2009-02-09T02:17:00.000Z	Safe	eut	don't have a router or gateway, it's wired directly to the wall.
2009-02-09T02:18:00.000Z	eut	Safe	ahh... in that case i would say try to run dhclient3 and see if you can get a dynamic ip at least
2009-02-09T02:18:00.000Z	Safe	eut	it won't work with a dynamic IP. :D The ISP give us our IP and we punch it in, then it works. (as it does in windows)
2009-02-09T02:20:00.000Z	Safe	eut	I've reinstalled ubuntu to a fresh install just to be sure, and I configured it manually, but still won't work. Should I try with a 32bit version maybe?
2009-02-09T02:22:00.000Z	eut	Safe	are you sure network manager and network manager dispatcher are not running? ps aux | grep -i network
2009-02-09T02:22:00.000Z	Safe	eut	what if they are?
2009-02-09T02:23:00.000Z	eut	Safe	you could try shuting them down, from my experience they tend to screw with things. 'sudo /etc/dbus-1/event.d/2... stop'
