2007-12-05T17:23:00.000Z	SpookyET		Is there any way to invoke the Ubuntu installer xorg configurator? I tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg with no pretty result.
2007-12-05T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	what was the result?
2007-12-05T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	what video card do you have?
2007-12-05T17:26:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	they are installed
2007-12-05T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	what driver did you select?
2007-12-05T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	no, specificallly, what was the name you used when you selected it at the 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' screen?
2007-12-05T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	so what does the restricted driver manager claim at the moment?
2007-12-08T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	you can't since creation time is not stored
2007-12-08T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	you can see all the files that got modified though.  use find with -mtime
2007-12-08T19:59:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	no
2007-12-08T19:59:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	no what?
2007-12-15T21:39:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	at the login screen, click "options"
2007-12-15T22:18:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	yes
2007-12-15T22:19:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	When I select it, it does not apply it. I do see it when I login again
2007-12-15T22:19:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	it's supposed to, I don't know why it would not.  Try #compiz-fusion too
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	inkpot kind of looks like that, but that question is more likely to be answered in #vim
2008-05-28T05:51:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	it's fake.
2008-05-28T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	what is fake?
2008-05-28T05:52:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	the colours in that screenshot in the right window
2008-05-28T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	I don't see why, but ok
2008-05-28T05:53:00.000Z	SpookyET	jrib	screen had the wrong settings and it recoloured inkpot on the left into that, which looks pretty good
2008-05-28T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	SpookyET	that I believe :)
