2006-05-15T16:54:00.000Z	LittleFae		Thats what I'm trying to find out how to do. :p
2006-05-15T16:54:00.000Z	LittleFae		There isn't an option, like, anywhere for it
2006-05-15T16:56:00.000Z	LittleFae		Nor me
2006-05-15T16:56:00.000Z	LittleFae		How? :)
2006-05-15T16:57:00.000Z	LittleFae		yep
2006-05-15T05:00:00.000Z	LittleFae		Thats not a prob. :)
2006-05-15T05:02:00.000Z	LittleFae		Not something I mind, so long as I can avoid that gdm garbage
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	LittleFae		I've, unfortunately, come to really hate gdm over the past month, hence my permanenet switch to xfce
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	LittleFae		Though I er, did try xpde, which was fun
2006-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	LittleFae		If I could get xubuntu to actually install, I would, and save myself so much hassle.
2006-05-15T05:05:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	you can use a text-mode install cd to do it
2006-05-15T05:06:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	do you have an ubuntu cd somewhere that the drive can read?
2006-05-15T05:08:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	does hoary have an option to install just the server?
2006-05-15T05:08:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	then you _can_ install xubuntu
2006-05-15T05:11:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	i have two suggestions: order a shipit cd when they're ready for dapper, or get a new drive :)
2006-05-15T05:12:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	hahaha
2006-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	break the protection :)
2006-05-15T05:31:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	that is what i do (or did, until itunes 6 came out)
2006-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	btw, there is a way to buy music from itunes store on linux. but it does NOT apply DRM to the completed files.
2006-05-15T05:34:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	just install a midi player :)
2006-05-15T05:35:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	did you have any interest in continuing to buy things from the itunes music store, using linux?
2006-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	wrong. pentium D is not core duo. core duo is a product name, not a tech spec
2006-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	spikeb	LittleFae	it does not.
