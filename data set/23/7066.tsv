2005-12-08T15:25:00.000Z	sven		nobody can help?
2005-12-08T15:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	give us a little more detail on what happens when you boot
2005-12-08T15:27:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	Ubuntu just hangs during boot and it gives this error: Kernel Panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt......
2005-12-08T15:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	is ubuntu installed? or is this booting from a CD ?
2005-12-08T15:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	so installation goes without a hitch ?
2005-12-08T15:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	what kind of computer do you have?
2005-12-08T15:30:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	Pentium IV 2,6 with 1024mb of ram, Intel 875 chipset, 2x 300gb Maxtor, ATi Radeon 9800Pro
2005-12-08T15:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	i'm not an expert by any means, but I'd suggest trying to boot with options like 'noacpi' and 'nolapic' (i'm not sure I have those options quite correct)
2005-12-08T15:31:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	do you know where I can see the interrupts that devices are usring?
2005-12-08T15:32:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	I installed ubuntu with those options :(
2005-12-08T15:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	i'm not sure; try 'sudo lshw'
2005-12-08T15:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	so you needed noacpi etc. for install?
2005-12-08T15:34:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	that's what I tried to solve the problem, but it didn't work
2005-12-08T15:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	so you've tried to boot your installed ubuntu using those options?
2005-12-08T15:35:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	not yet, but I installed it with those options so I assume that it uses the option at boot...
2005-12-08T15:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	i'm not sure about that. in /boot/grub/menu.lst, look for the 'kopt=' line
2005-12-08T15:37:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	# kopt=root=/dev/sda1 ro noapic nolapic
2005-12-08T15:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	hrm
2005-12-08T15:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	sven	i'm out of ideas, sorry
2005-12-08T15:39:00.000Z	sven	HappyFool	no problem, I knew it was a tough one, thanks!
