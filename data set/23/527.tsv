2011-07-11T08:20:00.000Z	Sam98961		If I boot my live usb with current changes in casper-rw, can I then have it copy the casper-rw file or it's contents to the ramdisk so it uses it from there and not from my key?
2011-07-11T08:21:00.000Z	Sam98961		Each time I tell it to boot to ram and it's done I yank the key and it starts thorwing stupid errors and stuff starts crashing.
2011-07-11T08:21:00.000Z	Sam98961		Had no luck trying to merge casper-rw and filesystem.squashfs into one and recreating the squashfs.
2011-07-11T08:21:00.000Z	Sam98961		Did that and got tons of weird errors and crap popping up but it did actually boot everything to ram.
2011-07-11T08:21:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	are you using the toram option of casper?
2011-07-11T08:21:00.000Z	Sam98961		yeah
2011-07-11T08:22:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	are you removing the casper-rw partition?
2011-07-11T08:22:00.000Z	Sam98961		I would like to.
2011-07-11T08:23:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	your not going to be able to get the best of both worlds
2011-07-11T08:23:00.000Z	Sam98961		I don't care if I can't change anything after it boots up or if the whoel thing gets wiped out on reboot.
2011-07-11T08:24:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	so you just want some extra packages pre-installed?
2011-07-11T08:24:00.000Z	Sam98961		I've done it once by mounting the two files in another install and rsyncing from casper-rw to the mounted squashfs and it works, but it screws up a lot of random crap so I figured there was a better way.
2011-07-11T08:24:00.000Z	Sam98961		Just can't find it yet.
2011-07-11T08:24:00.000Z	Sam98961		no, I want all kinds of neat crap done and saved to that it all loads to ram.
2011-07-11T08:25:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	make your own custom livecd https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
2011-07-11T08:25:00.000Z	Sam98961		yeah
2011-07-11T08:25:00.000Z	Sam98961		I did that.
2011-07-11T08:25:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	then whats the problem?
2011-07-11T08:29:00.000Z	Sam98961	pfifo	 I'm retarded.  This whole time I've been trying to get my changes from casper-rw to the sqaushfs file that I didn't think to just start over and make all my changes in chroot.
2011-07-11T08:30:00.000Z	Sam98961		I was focused on merging the two....
2011-07-11T08:30:00.000Z	Sam98961		Thanks for the directional guidance.  :)
2011-07-11T08:30:00.000Z	pfifo	Sam98961	put anything you want in /home/ubuntu in /etc/skel
2011-07-11T08:31:00.000Z	Sam98961	pfifo	 yeah, you shoudl of saw the look on my face when I realized that....
