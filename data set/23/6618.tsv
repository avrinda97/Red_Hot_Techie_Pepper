2008-09-09T05:47:00.000Z	cory_		ok
2008-09-09T05:47:00.000Z	cory_		that was odd
2008-09-09T05:48:00.000Z	cory_		I have an error that randomly occurs and my screen goes black
2008-09-09T05:48:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	What's the error?
2008-09-09T05:50:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	What video card are you using and which drivers?
2008-09-09T05:51:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Under System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects, what is it set to?
2008-09-09T05:52:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	and you've completely updated the OS?
2008-09-09T05:56:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Are you using restricted drivers? I have the same video card on my laptop. It's very stable, and I am not using restricted drivers.
2008-09-09T05:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	A Google search though, will show you that 200Xpress cards have caused Ubuntu users a fair amount of grief
2008-09-09T05:57:00.000Z	cory_	bobertdos	if i use restricted drivers then the crash is complete, i cant do anything. I dont use them because at least i can restart without them instead of having to plug pull.
2008-09-09T05:58:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Yeah, that's what I figured.
2008-09-09T05:58:00.000Z	cory_	bobertdos	so i have to log in with failsafe, how do i shut off compiz on normal so i can log in without failsafe?
2008-09-09T05:59:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Unfortunately, having visual effects set to None basically IS compiz disabled.
2008-09-09T06:00:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Oh, I see..........Let's see...........
2008-09-09T06:05:00.000Z	cory_	bobertdos	are you there?
2008-09-09T06:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Yeah, I'm trying to find a file you can edit.
2008-09-09T06:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Well, we could always disable compiz the tedious way :p
2008-09-09T06:16:00.000Z	cory_	bobertdos	we can do that later. I dont mind starting in failsafe id rather fix the crash.
2008-09-09T06:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Well, I am thinking disabling compiz may help the crash.
2008-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Because see, what's happening is that X is crashing, which almost has to do with either the video card, the way Xorg.conf is set up, and/or compiz.
2008-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	cory_	bobertdos	Its off though. Im using failsafe it wont load on failsafe for obvious reasons.
2008-09-09T06:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	cory_	Yeah, but if we can get into your home directory, we can edit the default behavior to affect all sessions, (in theory).
