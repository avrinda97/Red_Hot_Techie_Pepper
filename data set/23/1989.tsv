2009-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	poi77		Hi! I need to set up a remote root login using a public key someone sent me. How is this possible?
2009-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	are you using ssh?
2009-09-19T10:43:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	yes
2009-09-19T10:44:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	do you have physical access to the server?  Can you go to the server and put your public key in it???
2009-09-19T10:44:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	I have sudo access remotely
2009-09-19T10:44:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	Is this not sufficient?
2009-09-19T10:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	that is fine, so you want to setup your ssh key so you dont have to provide a password??
2009-09-19T10:46:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	The challenge (for me) is that this needs to be for root access
2009-09-19T10:47:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	if you want to login with the user "root" i highly discourage you from doing so but I can show you how to configure the SSH key
2009-09-19T10:48:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	Thanks, actually the sys-admin (above me) requested this. Do you have alternative suggestions?
2009-09-19T10:51:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	The instructions I got was to put the public key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
2009-09-19T10:53:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	and you cant login???
2009-09-19T10:53:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	No
2009-09-19T10:53:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	Actually, the sys-admin cannot either
2009-09-19T10:53:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	what error are you getting???  try ssh -v username@server
2009-09-19T10:55:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	To be clear---I am trying to log in as root with my password, which is not working (I think this is expected). The sys-admin is trying with the public key, but cannot for some reason. Do you know how to generate such a key? I don't know what error he is getting
2009-09-19T10:57:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	i would need to know what errors you get when you attempt to log in
2009-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	sure, do you know by any chance how I can generate a public-private key pair such that one will go in authorized_keys  ? Usually, my public keys are binaries
2009-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	what type of encryption are you using?  are you using rsa???
2009-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	dss/dsa
2009-09-19T11:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	 you have it right, you know how to configure the keys, the question is why youre unable to login??  You can tell what is goign on by attempting to log in using verbose mode
2009-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	poi77	mezquitale	Many thanks for your help. This gave me direction on how to resolve the problem.
2009-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	mezquitale	poi77	in between you might want to use rsa encryption, I use rsa encryption but I'm too lazy to use a passphrase though
