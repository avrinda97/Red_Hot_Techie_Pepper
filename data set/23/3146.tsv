2008-07-11T00:54:00.000Z	pl1		can somebody help me with installing netbeans on hardy ? synaptic tell me that some packages are missing and with apt-get install an error comes up..
2008-07-11T00:56:00.000Z	unop	pl1	post your apt-get output to a !pastebin
2008-07-11T00:58:00.000Z	unop	pl1	german is ok, i can translate --, you can do this if the output is quite long.  which pastebinit || sudo apt-get install pastebinit &&  apt-get install netbeans
2008-07-11T00:58:00.000Z	unop	pl1	and give us the URL the command returns
2008-07-11T01:04:00.000Z	pl1	unop	sorry for my noobnes, but i'm stuck with the command : sudo pastebinit || sudo apt-get install pastebinit &&  apt-get install netbeans..it say , are you root ?
2008-07-11T01:05:00.000Z	unop	pl1	err, my bad.    sudo pastebinit || sudo apt-get install pastebinit; sudo apt-get install netbeans
2008-07-11T01:06:00.000Z	unop	pl1	err, bad command, actually, just run   sudo apt-get install netbeans
2008-07-11T01:07:00.000Z	unop	pl1	i'm not concentrating very well today.  if you get errors on that apt-get command .. then rerun it this way.    sudo apt-get install netbeans | pastebinit
2008-07-11T01:09:00.000Z	pl1	unop	it say , no arguments specified..
2008-07-11T01:10:00.000Z	unop	pl1	   this is all one command.    sudo apt-get install netbeans | pastebinit
2008-07-11T01:10:00.000Z	pl1	unop	ahh ok : http://pastebin.com/f12389cf0
2008-07-11T01:13:00.000Z	unop	pl1	can you give us the url this returns too?   pastebinit < /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-07-11T01:14:00.000Z	pl1	unop	: http://pastebin.com/f75941ce0
2008-07-11T01:16:00.000Z	unop	pl1	are you running hardy at the moment? did you upgrade from edgy to hardy?
2008-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	pl1	unop	upgraded from feisty running hardy now... ,the packages are missing right? .. i think i will try it by myself now again, and just paste server in that file right ?
2008-07-11T01:18:00.000Z	unop	pl1	no, you need to comment out these edgy repos you still have enabled in /etc/apt/sources.list -- then run something like.   sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude install netbeans
2008-07-11T01:19:00.000Z	pl1	unop	okey..
2008-07-11T01:21:00.000Z	pl1	unop	only the one in row 24 right ?
2008-07-11T01:22:00.000Z	unop	pl1	and 14 and 15 too
2008-07-11T01:23:00.000Z	unop	pl1	err, sorry, they are already comment out -- so yea, just 24
2008-07-11T01:37:00.000Z	unop	pl1	glad to know that .. yay! :)
2008-07-11T01:39:00.000Z	unop	pl1	i don't necessarily mean monetary donations -- contributions of any kind are welcome, t-shirts, pizza, beer, etc :)  j/k
2008-07-11T01:41:00.000Z	unop	pl1	it was a joke :) but if you have any cool ones you think the team can benefit from .. :)
