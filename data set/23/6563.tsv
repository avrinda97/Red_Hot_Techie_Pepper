2006-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	Jimmey__		Is there any way I can check who's on my network, and their ips?
2006-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	you could log into the router, if it's your network
2006-04-11T12:32:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	I could, but there's no way of telling who's on the network
2006-04-11T12:32:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	ah, no DHCP table?
2006-04-11T12:33:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	I never knew to look for one, but even then, some of the people on the network are static
2006-04-11T12:34:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	you /could/ use nmap: but it can be blocked and/or considered rude.  in other words, best to go and ask people their IPs rather than ask if you can use it
2006-04-11T12:35:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	I can get the DHCP assigned IPs of people on the network, but not the statically assigned ones
2006-04-11T12:35:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	I've got nmap, but how would I use it to get the ips of people on my network?
2006-04-11T12:35:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	it's my network
2006-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	specify the range of IPs available to your subnet so that packets don't go everywhere, nmap will return a list of the ones that are "up"
2006-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	got any examples of this?
2006-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	you may have a hard time relating them to individual machines
2006-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	not as many as man nmap ;)
2006-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	couldn't I just do that with ping?
2006-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	lol
2006-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	I'm never sure with ping how reliable the responses are...
2006-04-11T12:39:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	do my research for me, you lazy get
2006-04-11T12:39:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	if you have a rough count of machines you can gauge the reliability of the results of whatever scan
2006-04-11T12:39:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	tehehe
2006-04-11T12:39:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	it's a home network
2006-04-11T12:40:00.000Z	djm62	Jimmey__	I would recommend trying the router first though.  lots of info comes in web interfaces and the like
2006-04-11T12:40:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	I did, it's a cute little linksys
2006-04-11T12:41:00.000Z	Jimmey__	djm62	lol
