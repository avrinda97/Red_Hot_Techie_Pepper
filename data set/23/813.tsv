2011-06-13T22:56:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	all Nvidia card after the 8800 should have CUDA. This will render your video etc on your GPU. If your into video stuff I wrote a script that will pull the daily gits of ffmpeg, x264 etc and fix all that up. http://pastebin.com/NHXrsBxm
2011-06-13T23:00:00.000Z	A_J	Onryo	nice Script : umm i just copy paste it into the terminal ?
2011-06-13T23:02:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	Yeap. Thats all you got to do. I got a video on youtube what that script does. That script you are looking at will also work with Natty. http://www.youtube.com/user/0nryo
2011-06-13T23:05:00.000Z	A_J	Onryo	wow mate great work.. Really nice.. btw, i tried copy pasting it did not work
2011-06-13T23:05:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	did you call it .sh at the end and make it chmod +x ?
2011-06-13T23:08:00.000Z	A_J	Onryo	i changed the homepath and added a .sh
2011-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	OK so now you need to allow it to run on your computer. sudo chmod +x yourfile.sh
2011-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	then start it like this ./yourfile.sh
2011-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	or just watch the end of my video. Shows you how to do it. The beginning is just what the script is doing manually. www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0IDV6r-bCI
2011-06-13T23:13:00.000Z	A_J	Onryo	mate, upgrade or Install ?
2011-06-13T23:14:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	install then later you can upgraded it with with upgrade. It will grab the newest gits and compile them.
2011-06-13T23:15:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	I also used check install so you can just install it as normal or do a total install of everything that script has done.
2011-06-13T23:16:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	ahhh no big deal. But thx.
2011-06-13T23:18:00.000Z	Onryo	A_J	you dont need to upgrade it right after you install. That script just pulled the head gits. Maybe tomorrow or something the coders have upgraded some code.
