2007-12-11T22:11:00.000Z	Twinkletoes		Hello, I will have a load of thin clients, that make their connections using the ICA protocol.  What do I need to configure in Ubuntu to accept these connections?
2007-12-11T22:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	connections to what ?
2007-12-11T22:12:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	The thin-clients will connect to virtualised Xubuntu desktops running in VMware
2007-12-11T22:12:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	The thin-clients will use either ICA or RDP protocols, but ICA is better apparently
2007-12-11T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	I missunderstood what you where asking, you'll just need firewall ports
2007-12-11T22:13:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	IS that it, it will accept these connections by default?
2007-12-11T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	well no, you'll have to enable desktop sharing, authentication etc etc etc
2007-12-11T22:14:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Ah, that's where I need pointing in the right direction - is there an article somehwere, as you seem to know what I might need to do?
2007-12-11T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	I don't know of an actual article, however I suspect that https://help.ubuntu.com will have some docs
2007-12-11T22:14:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Ok, thank you :)
2007-12-11T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	catch the link of pici, maynot be exactly what you want but very close
2007-12-11T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	I think the remote desktop will only allow 3 connections at once
2007-12-11T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	you may be better using something like ltsp
2007-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	It might even be easier to use RDP - I'll try them both - thank you :)
2007-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	rdp will still only allow 3 connections I think
2007-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	as thats still the desktop sharing service on the desktop
2007-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	I only want one connection - it's just to link a thin-client to it's virtualised machine
2007-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	ahh earlier you said it was many
2007-12-11T22:21:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Each virtualised thin-client will onyl ever receive one connection
2007-12-11T22:21:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Oops....
2007-12-11T22:21:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Each virtualised Linux machine will only receive one connection from a thin-client
2007-12-11T22:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Twinkletoes	so each machine will only ever get one connection, full stop
2007-12-11T22:22:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	ikonia	Yup :)
