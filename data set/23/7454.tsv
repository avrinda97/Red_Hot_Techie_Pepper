2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	laughlin		any experienced UBUNTU users in here who also have extensive experience with GENTOO
2006-05-27T13:03:00.000Z	laughlin		i have a question
2006-05-27T13:04:00.000Z	laughlin		i am an experienced gentoo user, (both server and desktop) but am fed up with gentoo not working on my laptop
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	laughlin		my only questinon would be about the ubuntu package management sistem. i LOVE gentoo's and wound like to know if ubuntu's is as good
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	laughlin		there is nothing better than #emerge -s gnome
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	laughlin		or what ever, it spits out tons of packages, and i just  look for the right one, and bam
2006-05-27T13:06:00.000Z	laughlin		so to search for a package i just use that command?
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	yes, that searches descriptions and names
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	laughlin		cool, and i assume that there are ~ number of packages for ubuntu as well
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	ubuntu repositories have around 16000 packages altogether or so
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	laughlin		very good then, that does it, thanks guys for your hlep!
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	for a few 3rd-party proprietary packs (javadebs, etc) see /msg ubotu seveas
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	laughlin		sounds good
2006-05-27T13:09:00.000Z	apokryphos		sun-java debs, that is.
2006-05-27T13:10:00.000Z	laughlin		ok, thanks
2006-05-27T13:11:00.000Z	laughlin		http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/12/04/libdvdcss2-and-w32codecs-for-ubuntu/
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	first it's really best to see the wiki entry on adding repositories and/or what ones you'll want. /msg ubotu repositories
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	to see the methodology behind the split main/restricted/universe/multiverse main repositories, see /msg ubotu components
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	laughlin		hey, has the MPlayer support on ubuntu gotten better? a while back ago i heard it was crappy
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	laughlin	apokryphos	thanks
2006-05-27T13:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	laughlin	it should work fine
2006-05-27T13:13:00.000Z	apokryphos		though I only ever use kaffeine
2006-05-27T13:13:00.000Z	laughlin	apokryphos	thansk
