2008-04-11T09:54:00.000Z	effinboy		can I ask for help in here, or is that somewhere else?
2008-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	effinboy		I'm trying to go from using my box as a desktop to a headless server... go everything setup, just can't get VNC to work headless.
2008-04-11T09:56:00.000Z	effinboy		I've figured out that it's probably because X isn't configured right... but I can't figure it out, and have searched to no avail.
2008-04-11T09:58:00.000Z	effinboy		bookmark --- normally right click the title bar, and prefereces/options
2008-04-11T10:00:00.000Z	effinboy		ah, sorry about that... :-/
2008-04-11T10:01:00.000Z	effinboy		thanks anyways Alan_M
2008-04-11T10:01:00.000Z	effinboy		does anyone know anything about getting VNC to run headless? I've done it before... but can't get it to go again.
2008-04-11T10:02:00.000Z	HelpMe	effinboy	what do u mean headless?
2008-04-11T10:02:00.000Z	effinboy		no keyboard/monitor/mouse... just the box in a closet.
2008-04-11T10:03:00.000Z	HelpMe	effinboy	i would think an autologin on start and then remote desktop connection enabled would do the trick...i dunno if there is autologin on linux tho...there should
2008-04-11T10:04:00.000Z	effinboy		there is, i got that setup already... got everything how i Like it, just going to be running a few GUI based apps on it (some via wine) that I'll need to get to every so often.
2008-04-11T10:04:00.000Z	effinboy		I think my problem is with X somehow.
2008-04-11T10:05:00.000Z	HelpMe	effinboy	what exactly is the problem then? what is not working?
2008-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	effinboy		I can get to the box via SSH and VNC with a monitor connected just fine, and I can SSH into the box without the monitor... just can't VNC into the box wihtout a monitor hooked up.
2008-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	effinboy	secret901	--- what do you need to do it for? patching drivers?
2008-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	HelpMe	effinboy	well, I'm thinkin that you should try the server edition, i think i saw something about this there...more i dont know as i am not at that level yet
2008-04-11T10:08:00.000Z	HelpMe		so I am new to the whole open source community and I was wondering: what is a good summation of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
2008-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	HelpMe		(i am trying to develop some software and I dont wanna get sued...)
2008-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	effinboy		thanks HelpMe, I think I'm onto something here in searching... I think I need to edit my xorg.conf to trick it into starting like there is a monitor connected... like a virtual monitor
