2006-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	Landon		Hey all, is there something special you have to do to make programs play .mp3 files? I'm tried using JUK and Noatun, but neither of them are playing my MP3s
2006-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	Landon		Not that I know of vidd
2006-10-31T17:45:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-1340337f2ca1d0c54900935468515ba7630fcc59   specifically
2006-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	I like that idea :-P
2006-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	so try that. the howto hasn't been updated for Edgy yet, but installing gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly should still work i think
2006-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	thanks, I'll try it
2006-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	of course, if you have Rythmbox open, you need to close it completely and restart it, for MP3 support to start working
2006-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	see cge too
2006-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Where can I add/remove programs, I don't seem to have that option anymore
2006-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	it should be under Applications -- though that's a stripped-down version. in System / Administration / Synaptic (I think) you'll have the full thing
2006-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	but you can also just use "sudo apt-get install <packagename>" from a terminal
2006-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Yeah, that's what I'll use. I'm trying to convert my music to Vorbis
2006-10-31T17:56:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Is there a way to play MP3's without converting them?
2006-10-31T17:57:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Converting worked, just don't want to convert ALL my must to Vorbis
2006-10-31T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	that wasn't what i was suggesting, at all. converting MP3 to Vorbis loses quality (though Vorbis itself is fine, it's just the conversion from MP3)
2006-10-31T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	scroll *down* some more on that page, where it says " Install the package gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly."
2006-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Okay
2006-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	then just use your Rythmbox to listen to your MP3.
2006-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	Well, let's give this one a try
2006-10-31T06:18:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	My MP3's work now, but my .avi files and other things like that I can't view in my media player, any nice fixes for that?
2006-10-31T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	others will be able to help you better, since i don't have any video codecs installed. the same page i gave you for MP3 has info about other formats, too -- read it
2006-10-31T06:19:00.000Z	Landon	LjL	thanks
2008-01-09T01:50:00.000Z	LjL	Landon	although not really a Server-specific question, you might try asking on #ubuntu-server, since that's a typical setup for the Server edition much more than the Desktop edition
