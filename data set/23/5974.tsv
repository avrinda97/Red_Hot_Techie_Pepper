2006-10-08T06:39:00.000Z	Tru7h		Guys, I'm having trouble booting up Ubuntu on my old Dell. Is there any way I can put it on several floppy disks and boot from those?
2006-10-08T06:39:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	what's the problem?
2006-10-09T13:53:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	what version?
2006-10-09T13:54:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	2.0beta3.1?
2006-10-09T13:55:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	How do I check? I just used "sudo apt-get install gaim"
2006-10-09T13:55:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	go to About in gaim
2006-10-09T13:56:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	I don't think the true latest version is in the repos.
2006-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	How can I install the latest version?
2006-10-09T13:59:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	you can find deb packages if you google
2006-10-09T14:03:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	"Error: conflicts with installed package gaim"
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	you have to uninstall gaim first. (don't be afraid of uninstalling ubuntu-desktop, too, it's just a metapackage.)
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	How can I uninstall it?
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	Sorry for my noobishness.
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	in Synaptic, probably Add/Remove, or just "sudo apt-get remove gaim"
2006-10-09T14:08:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	Another error... "Dependency is not satisfiable : gaim-data"
2006-10-09T14:08:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	wherever you downloaded the deb should also have that
2006-10-09T14:08:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	they split it into two packages.
2006-10-09T14:11:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	Have done so, same error.
2006-10-09T14:11:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	what?
2006-10-09T14:11:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	Should I be running gaim-data?
2006-10-09T14:11:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	erm... you should download the gaim-data package, install it, then install the gaim package
2006-10-09T14:12:00.000Z	Tru7h	BHSPitLappy	Thanks, I'll try that.
2006-10-09T14:13:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Tru7h	no prob.
