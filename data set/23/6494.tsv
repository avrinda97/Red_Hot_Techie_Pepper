2006-12-22T08:26:00.000Z	gibbster		damn. Thanks anyway. Might be time to throw in the towel...
2006-12-22T08:27:00.000Z	gibbster		Anyone here with experience setting up a pptp vpn network with network-manager?
2006-12-22T08:27:00.000Z	gibbster		Help save a poor lad from windows?
2006-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	I could never get the open source vpn clients to work so I use the Cisco Systems vpnclient that my univ provided for us.
2006-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	I was under the impression that cisco vpn was different from microsoft vpn
2006-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	I could be wrong though...
2006-12-22T08:30:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	I have no idea on that sort of thing. I'm just wondering if whomever you are vpning into could provide the vpn client for you.
2006-12-22T08:30:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	or are you setting up your own vpn client/server?
2006-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	well, I'm kindof going on the fringe with my company. Really, I should be sticking with windows, so they don't really provide any linux clients
2006-12-22T08:32:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	yeah I know all about that! :-) What are the clients they provide for Windows? MS?
2006-12-22T08:33:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	I just use the default connection wizard on windows
2006-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	... it's a pity that I _really_ need vpn for my job.
2006-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	so you have already Googled and tried stuff, right? 'Cause I just did a quick google search and there's a lot out there about this. For example: http://www.students.ncl.ac.uk/a.j.mee/blog/index.php/2005/11/21/networkmanager-pptp-vpn-support/
2006-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	yeah, I tried the usual advice
2006-12-22T08:35:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	but I keep on getting VPN Connect Failure
2006-12-22T08:40:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	this looks interesting. Other than that...not sure how to help. :-( http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/
2006-12-22T08:40:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	yeah, tried that :-(
2006-12-22T08:40:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	thanks for the help, though
2006-12-22T08:41:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	I'll putter around for a few more hours. Failing that, you'll probably see me drop in the forum again when feisty comes out :-(
2006-12-22T08:42:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	have you tried the Cisco vpnclient? Might be worth a shot...
2006-12-22T08:44:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	ugh. Yeah, I guess. something I wanted to avoid though
2006-12-22T08:44:00.000Z	whyameye	gibbster	do you know what the server is running? It is Cisco?
2006-12-22T08:45:00.000Z	gibbster	whyameye	I'm pretty sure it's a pptp server. Other than that I don't know
