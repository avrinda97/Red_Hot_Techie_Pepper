2012-07-26T12:27:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Not true.
2012-07-26T12:28:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	oh… sorry
2012-07-26T12:29:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	how to change the password though? and where is the security if such a thing is possible
2012-07-26T12:30:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Insert a livecd/USB Stick, boot it, change your password.
2012-07-26T12:30:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	By design, there is NO security when someone has physical access to your computer - like yourself.
2012-07-26T12:33:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	so I boot ubuntu live and then, how do I change the password?
2012-07-26T12:33:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	By creating a chroot environment, and changing your password using passwd.
2012-07-26T12:34:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	shit shit shit

2012-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	I'm just shocked
2012-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	that just mean thant anybody can go root on the machine
2012-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Having physical access, yes.
2012-07-26T12:40:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	so, even with an encrypted folder: everything is decrypted………
2012-07-26T12:40:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ftp-server.html
2012-07-26T12:40:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Not without knowing the encryption password.
2012-07-26T12:41:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	i mean encrypted home folder managed by ubuntu
2012-07-26T12:41:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Still you have to have the encryption password.
2012-07-26T12:42:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	oh okay… it will ask for when reloggin?
2012-07-26T12:42:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	It will (like before) ask you for the password for decryption.
2012-07-26T12:43:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	nono when ercrypted home folder, it doesn't ask for such password at login
2012-07-26T12:44:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	which is the same password (by default) like the decryption password. After changing the session password as described above, obviously both passwords will differ.
2012-07-26T12:51:00.000Z	Erwyn	bekks	mhhhh
2012-07-26T12:52:00.000Z	bekks	Erwyn	Thats why the first step in security is to regulate physical access ;)
