2012-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	sschultz		I'm definitely a newbie, and setup my first server, and am trying to create a user who can only sftp into their home directory - i tried using the walkthrough over at http://www.romuloaraujo.com/2010/01/how-to-restrict-ssh-sftp-user-only.html but can't seem to get it to work - can anyone recommend how i can accomplish what I'm looking to do? Thanks!
2012-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	what seems to be the issue?
2012-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	When I try and SFTP in it automatically disconnects the user
2012-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	can you get sftp to work without the chroot functionality?
2012-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	Yes
2012-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	try setting the users shell to /bin/bash and test again
2012-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	would I do that in the /etc/passwd file?
2012-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	change /bin/false to /bin/bash or similiar
2012-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	did you remember to restart the ftpd
2012-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	no - if i'm just doing this through SFTP would I only restart sshd then?
2012-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	not sshd, restart the ftpd
2012-03-13T00:14:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	i'm embarassed to ask but how do I do that?
2012-03-13T00:15:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	your guide says '3 - Test the setup (you will probably need to HUP your SSH daemon first, or start it up if it isn't already)' I take it you didnt follow that part of the instructions? That could be the problem
2012-03-13T00:16:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	isn't that what sshd is?
2012-03-13T00:16:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	err, thats not right
2012-03-13T00:16:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	when I "/etc/init.d/ssh reload"
2012-03-13T00:18:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	I thought it gave instructions for restarting the ftpd. anyway, depending if your dameon is a real daemon or an inetd daemon, youll have to restart the ftpd, or xinted
2012-03-13T00:19:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	Ok. I never installed an ftp server/daemon though - just doing this through sftp so it's through ssh (or at least that's what I understand)
2012-03-13T00:20:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	that could be a problem, as you cant really setup a sftpd server without an... sftpd server
2012-03-13T00:21:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	Isn't that contained in sshd though? Sorry if I'm running in circles
2012-03-13T00:21:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	mneptok ahh I see, I was thinking we were talking about 2 different server processes
2012-03-13T00:28:00.000Z	pfifo	sschultz	I recommend using a sftpd daemon that isnt linked to system users and the actual file system
2012-03-13T00:29:00.000Z	sschultz	pfifo	Ok. Thank you for the tip.
