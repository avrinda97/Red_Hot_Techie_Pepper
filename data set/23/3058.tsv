2008-08-11T09:23:00.000Z	CKyle22		I need some help with dhcp3-server can anyone help me? I can't get the server to start no matter what I do! I'm trying to follow the guide here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=74925
2008-08-11T09:24:00.000Z	CKyle22		It's not an error, it just says "fail" when it goes to start.
2008-08-11T09:24:00.000Z	CKyle22		What info do you need?

2008-08-11T09:32:00.000Z	CKyle22	wols	yeah i figured that. how can i add a subnet?
2008-08-11T09:32:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	don't know the dhcp3 config since I don't use it or care about it.
2008-08-11T09:32:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	read the docs. there are also example config files iirc
2008-08-11T09:34:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	/etc
2008-08-11T09:34:00.000Z	CKyle22	wols	yeah I checked, its not there.
2008-08-11T09:34:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	man locate
2008-08-11T09:42:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	sure. dnsmasq
2008-08-11T09:42:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	and ipmasq
2008-08-11T09:43:00.000Z	wols	CKyle22	but you will need to edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf manually as well to enable its dhcp server
2008-08-11T09:43:00.000Z	CKyle22	wols	Thats fine, are there any links?
