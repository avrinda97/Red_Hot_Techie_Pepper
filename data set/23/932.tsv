2010-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	MaindotC		Does anyone here re-stream stuff on justin.tv or ustream?
2010-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	why ?
2010-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	MaindotC	ikonia	because I would like to stream media to friends using those types of sites.
2010-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	what has that got to do wtih ubuntu ?
2010-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	it's web based,
2010-11-24T01:50:00.000Z	MaindotC	ikonia	re-read my question please
2010-11-24T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	in that case, "no" that can't be done as it's a client server connection
2010-11-24T01:50:00.000Z	MaindotC	ikonia	incorrect
2010-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	really, do tell ?
2010-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	how is that incorrect ?
2010-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	MaindotC	ikonia	ws4gl.org
2010-11-24T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	that's broadcasting TO ustream, not re-broadcasting
2010-11-24T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	can you clarify what you mean by re-stream, as the URL you posted is just streaming
2010-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	your not being clear, the URL you posted is just for streaming, yet your talking about "re-streaming" could you please clarify
2010-11-24T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	can you clarify what you mean by re-stream please.
2010-11-24T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	I don't think your going to be able to do that
2010-11-24T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	have you looked at what Amoz about just redirecting from your box to as a proxy/middle host for the link to justin.tv or ustream
2010-11-24T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	you can do it at a simpler level with iptables or squid which will act as a buffer for any latency
2010-11-24T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	you can also put access controls in place if you use iptables or squid to stop anyone else leaching onto it
2010-11-24T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	have you looked at squid or iptables to act as a controlled proxy or forwarder ?
2010-11-24T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	we keep support in the main channel please.
2010-11-24T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	control your language please, keep it clean in this channel
2010-11-24T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	MaindotC	sorry- not you
