2007-05-04T12:04:00.000Z	nickste		what packages do I need to install to be able to use the "make" command?
2007-05-04T12:05:00.000Z	nickste		build essential? Is that gcc build essential?
2007-05-04T12:06:00.000Z	nickste		ta
2007-05-04T12:06:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	you don't need to install anything to be able to use "make" while compiling
2007-05-04T12:07:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	except for the for the libraries and dependencies that you need to build the program
2007-05-04T12:07:00.000Z	nickste		I use the make command, and I get a whole lot of errors saying implicit declaration of function
2007-05-04T12:08:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	did you start with "./configure" to start compiling?
2007-05-04T12:08:00.000Z	nickste		ermmm... nope. instructions just say to type make into the terminal, and then make install
2007-05-04T12:08:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	this couldn't be

2007-05-04T12:09:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	you need to configure then make then make install
2007-05-04T12:09:00.000Z	nickste		sudo: ./configure: command not found
2007-05-04T12:10:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	without sudo and second are you in the right folder?
2007-05-04T12:11:00.000Z	nickste	compengi	I'm in the right folder, and same result when dropping sudo
2007-05-04T12:12:00.000Z	nickste		it doesn't have a configure file in the folder... not sure if that matters?
2007-05-04T12:12:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	what are you trying to compile?
2007-05-04T12:12:00.000Z	nickste		aircrack-ng
2007-05-04T12:13:00.000Z	nickste		ok, just installed the base installation files, and it works with make
2007-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	compengi	nickste	well done
2007-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	nickste		hrmm... not sure if it worked 100%
2007-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	nickste		yeah, it did work.
2007-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	nickste		thanks for the help compengi :)
