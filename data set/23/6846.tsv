2005-12-15T07:47:00.000Z	Paul^		i'm trying to install ubuntu on my work pc, but i have no experience with partitioning and i want to install it on a separate partition of my windows disk. anyone have any pointers?
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	yeah you can use something called the partition magic but that will cost you money
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	poningru		do you have a cd burner?
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	there are free alternatives
2005-12-15T07:49:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	yes, but i have partition magic. the only thing is i don't know how to install ubuntu on it afterwards. i've always chosen autopartition before
2005-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	i want to be sure i do it right, or else i'll erase ~20 gb of important files :/
2005-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	I would say first backup your data because I dont like taking risks
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	then shrink your windows ntfs partition
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	me neither, but backup is not an option right now, i'm kind of short on money. i've already backuped the most important files
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	ah ic
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	poningru		yeah it should work pretty well
2005-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	just shrink your partition and leave the rest empty
2005-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	and then what do i do in the ubuntu installer?
2005-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	that's the hard part for me, creating partitions in windows is no problem
2005-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	poningru		when you install ubuntu it will detect the empty partition
2005-12-15T07:53:00.000Z	poningru		you can just install it on there
2005-12-15T07:53:00.000Z	poningru		hold on there is a good video tutorial for this

2005-12-15T07:54:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	that thing is pretty good
2005-12-15T07:55:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	they use the ubuntu dvd as opposed to the cd but that shouldnt matter
2005-12-15T07:55:00.000Z	poningru	Paul^	skip to around 6 mins
2005-12-15T07:56:00.000Z	Paul^	poningru	thx, i'll watch it
