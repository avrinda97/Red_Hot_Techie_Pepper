2006-12-17T09:39:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	well i want to use mythtv on ubuntu
2006-12-17T09:39:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	hmm -- are you sure your link's a PPPoE link?
2006-12-17T09:40:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	not sure what that even means--i'm using dsl (SBCIS)
2006-12-17T09:40:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	do you use a router or cable modem ??
2006-12-17T09:40:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	and i have like a dsl modem; and i have to use a username and passwrod for it
2006-12-17T09:40:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	yea, thats probably PPPoE
2006-12-17T09:41:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	Do you know how I can fix that error?
2006-12-17T09:41:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	so its a phone line -- not cable eh?? that might be PPPoA rather than PPPoE
2006-12-17T09:42:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	yikes, I don't know--I don't plug the phone line into my computer, but into the 'box', and form that an eternet to my computer
2006-12-17T09:42:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	PPPoE sounds familiar though
2006-12-17T09:42:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	errm, how does the modem connect to computer?
2006-12-17T09:44:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	you didnt tell me how modem hooks upto computer eh
2006-12-17T09:45:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	oh sorry, didn't see that. by ethernet
2006-12-17T09:46:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	ok, errm, do you know the make and model # of the modem? maybe someone else out there has figured out how to use it with linux
2006-12-17T09:47:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	Yeah, it's a Westell WireSpeed, I use it for SBCIS (Pacbell dsl)
2006-12-17T09:48:00.000Z	un_operateur1	mikebot	do you have the specific model # ??
2006-12-17T09:49:00.000Z	mikebot	un_operateur1	it's a relaly long model number
