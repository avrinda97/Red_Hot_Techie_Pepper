2005-04-03T11:07:00.000Z	Tomcat_		I'm still pondering if I want ubuntu or kubuntu when I install hoary... what I wonder is: Is kubuntu as good as regular Ubuntu? :o
2005-04-03T11:08:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Well I like both desktops... it's more that I feel Gnome has more support on Ubuntu - so it'll get more packages and stuff. :o
2005-04-03T11:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Oh well... I'll probably just try. ;)
2005-04-03T11:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_		I'm thinking of getting an AMD64 with 512 and it still seems low :o
2005-04-03T11:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Yeah, indeed.
2005-04-03T11:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Ubuntu needs like... 100 MB RAM and no swap on my laptop. :o
2005-04-03T11:13:00.000Z	Tomcat_		;)
2005-04-03T11:13:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Gotta go. :o
2005-04-03T07:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	the difficult answer is: if it is going to work, you need ndiswrapper
2005-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	Yeah same with nx9030 :)
2005-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	well, the wlan led is all hardware
2005-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	Not mine... mine is software.
2005-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	ah, mine is pure hardware..
2005-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	I have to start ipw2200 with led=1 or something. :] 
2005-08-05T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	w32codecs ARE the windows counterparts...
2005-08-05T15:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	that's what mplayer is for, others don't officially support it ;)
2005-08-05T15:15:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	Yeah the w32codecs are the real Windows codecs, but they don't work as well... I'm not blaming anyone, it's great that it works, and so well... but for some special video codecs it's just better in Windows. Because it's the only target platform. :\
2005-08-05T15:16:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	You mean xine doesn't officially support w32codecs?
2005-09-14T11:56:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	vcd isos not iirc :)
2005-09-14T11:57:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	Worked in Windows with Daemon Tools ;)
2005-12-21T10:46:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	We're not fighting, but it's offtopic, you're right. ;)
2006-01-07T07:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Tomcat_	making my highlight flash helps :p
2006-01-07T07:19:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Seveas	I don't think we'll go any deeper into libdvdcss anyway :P
