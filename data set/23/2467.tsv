2010-01-20T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	microhaxo not true.. there is a version that doesn't.. it's only the "on screen docky thing" that requires compiz
2010-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	ok you're right about that - as i only use gnome-do for the dock I kinda forget it does do other things as well - my bad
2010-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	:)  ..
2010-01-20T09:10:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	I just tried it and it didn't work for me despite man ls saying it should
2010-01-20T09:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	with the an example directory, try "ls dirname" vs "ls -l dirname"
2010-01-20T09:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	s/"ls -l/"ls -d
2010-01-20T09:12:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	if I'm in ~ and simply do a ls -d shouldn't it show the directories in ~?
2010-01-20T09:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	nope
2010-01-20T09:13:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	I have to explicitely name the directory?
2010-01-20T09:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	for the -d to do anything yes
2010-01-20T09:14:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	no.. what I mean is if I'm in my home directory and want a listing of just the directories in home then I have to do "ls -d /home/<user> ?? as opposed to being in the home directory and simply doing ls -d ??
2010-01-20T09:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	i don't know a way (although i'm sure there is one) of listing just directories, but it probably doesn't have anything to do with "ls -d"
2010-01-20T09:16:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	take a look at "man ls" .. the -d switch is for directories like you mentioned.. it's just the syntax that's probably messing with us.
2010-01-20T09:27:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	the correct syntax is "ls -d */" to get a directory listing.
2010-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	ok that's kinda a "work-around" but it works :)  thanks, now i know and you did use -d :)
2010-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	had to go to #linux to get the answer :(
2010-02-07T08:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	audacity is the sound editor (you got it)
2010-02-14T08:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	have you tried kino (with gksu) only way i've been able to dump video from 1394
2010-02-14T08:40:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	running it a root? nope..haven't tried that.. I'll give it a shot though. do you have to chown the files after?
2010-02-14T08:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	scunizi	i believe so but don't remember for sure
2010-02-14T08:41:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	ok.. thanks..
2010-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	scunizi	ZykoticK9	morrison yep.. sorry.. thinking lots of stuff right now
