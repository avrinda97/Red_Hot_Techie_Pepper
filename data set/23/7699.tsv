2005-10-02T12:38:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	i'll brb, then it should work :)
2005-10-02T12:41:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	can you try again please ?
2005-10-02T12:45:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	you having success?
2005-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	naw that's ok .. thanks though. i made this computer full dmz, so i don't know why it isnt working
2005-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	c'mon dude, i've converted it to .tbz for you
2005-10-02T12:47:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	i just don't want to keep asking you to try and try again for the next hour and waste your time, i appreciate the help but my inability to configure my dang router is screwing things up :(
2005-10-02T12:48:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	do you know of other xmssion methods?
2005-10-02T12:48:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	ftp, http .. but im not running either right now, if you are running one we could transfer easy enough
2005-10-03T05:17:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	use k3b
2005-10-06T15:56:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	that's #gentoo
2005-10-06T15:57:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	obviously i know where it is. i want a file that gentoo provides, and i don't run gentoo, i run ubuntu. but everybody in there just says "install gentoo" and i just want 1 file :)
2005-10-11T15:15:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	you mean in the terminal?
2005-10-11T15:16:00.000Z	esac	nalioth	terminal , or simply open a pdf file and have the computer speak it to you
2005-10-11T15:16:00.000Z	nalioth	esac	i dont think so on either
