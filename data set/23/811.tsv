2011-01-29T00:49:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	do you get to the login screen, or just terminal, did you install nvidia drivers maybe ..., how old is that laptop?
2011-01-29T00:50:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	i've been playing with an older laptop for few days now, still cant fix the graphics, btw
2011-01-29T00:57:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	what about glxinfo | grep vendor
2011-01-29T01:01:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	hmm, should be installed i think
2011-01-29T01:06:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	how about lshw | grep VGA
2011-01-29T01:13:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	'lshw | grep VGA'
2011-01-29T01:14:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	enter the command exactly as posted it should return just the VGA part, two lines max
2011-01-29T01:15:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	just one line or what?
2011-01-29T01:16:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	2nd line here is like: product: ION VGA [GeForce 9400M]
2011-01-29T01:26:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	sounds like partitioning tool, i thought you have ubuntu installed allready...
2011-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	are you attempting some dual-boot or ubuntu only?
2011-01-29T01:31:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	how did you partition the drive(s)?
2011-01-29T01:33:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	to me it sound like a borken install, i'd do a clean reinstall and make sure to wipe the HD clean
2011-01-29T01:39:00.000Z	bethdo97	brontoeee	 on a laptop with 4gb ram and 500 gb new hard drive should I use netbook or desktop version and should I use version 10.04 or 10.10
2011-01-29T01:40:00.000Z	brontoeee	bethdo97	10.10 desktop (i wouldnt bother with netbook)
