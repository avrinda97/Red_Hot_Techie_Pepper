2008-05-28T01:44:00.000Z	thekip_		lol
2008-05-28T01:44:00.000Z	thekip_		how can we tell :P
2008-05-28T01:45:00.000Z	thekip_		I ran into the same, here's a post about it: http://www.thekip.nl/2008/05/15/virtualbox-running-smoothly/
2008-05-28T01:46:00.000Z	thekip_		I don't know if it's exactly the same however but you could give it a try
2008-05-28T01:46:00.000Z	thekip_		is there anyone who knows how to completely reconfigure libapache2-mod-php5
2008-05-28T01:47:00.000Z	thekip_		all my configs can be overwritten but I just want to get php5 to work again (I did a test with mono but can't get php to work again)
2008-05-28T01:48:00.000Z	thekip_		what i've tried: apt-get remove, apt-get purge, dpkg-reconfigure
2008-05-28T01:48:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	i missed your initial problem, what did you do to mess up php?
2008-05-28T01:49:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	and does it work without the apache?
2008-05-28T01:49:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	i have no idea, never even heard of that mod
2008-05-28T01:50:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	what error is php giving?
2008-05-28T01:50:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	try <?php echo "test"; ?>
2008-05-28T01:51:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	it could be as simple as not being able to do <? echo "foo"; ?>
2008-05-28T01:53:00.000Z	thekip_	my_haz	uh foo did work
2008-05-28T01:53:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	then what is the problem?
2008-05-28T01:54:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	is it disabled in php.ini ?
2008-05-28T01:55:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	but then again i don't know why that would give you such an error, is it giving you the source code or just a blank file?
2008-05-28T01:56:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	and this is with <?php phpinfo(); ?>
2008-05-28T01:57:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	never seen that before. how about other random functions? like <?php date('z'); ?>
2008-05-28T01:58:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	what does #php have to say?
2008-05-28T02:00:00.000Z	thekip_	my_haz	thx for the tips, just found my error
2008-05-28T02:00:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	what was it so we know?
2008-05-28T02:00:00.000Z	my_haz	thekip_	didn't i mention that up top? my very first suggestion?
