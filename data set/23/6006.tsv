2006-07-11T05:34:00.000Z	livingdaylight		can someone tell me then why sudo cp fonts /usr/share/fonts didn't work? is it because the folders where the sam ename maybe?
2006-07-11T05:35:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	is "sudo cp fonts /usr/share/fonts" exactly what you typed
2006-07-11T05:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	yea
2006-07-11T05:35:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	where are you copying from? Where is the source dir?
2006-07-11T05:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	home?
2006-07-11T05:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	the fonts folder was in /home/username
2006-07-11T05:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	i wanted to copy it to /usr/share/fonts
2006-07-11T05:36:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	try typing this: sudo cp ~/home/fonts /usr/share/fonts
2006-07-11T05:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	ah...is that better command line?
2006-07-11T05:37:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	i dont think so, but it might help
2006-07-11T05:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	thing is i've done it now via gui. But i wanted to do it the cool and geeky way
2006-07-11T05:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	will do. Its just that in the past for other things the way i originally tried i thought was the way. At least i think it has worked before
2006-07-11T05:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	but i'll bear that in mind as an option
2006-07-11T05:40:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	the first command you typed should of worked, you have a directory named "fonts" inside your home folder, and you want to copy the contents to /usr/share/fonts?
2006-07-11T05:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	thats right. Does having two folders with the same name create an issue?
2006-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	try going into "your" fonts directory and typing this: sudo cp * /usr/share/fonts               that should copy everything inside your fonts directory to /usr/share/fonts
2006-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	 magic! that is a coold trick - thanks
2006-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	did it work?
2006-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	yea!
2006-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	thats one mean asterisk
2006-07-11T05:49:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	the asterisk means everything, you can also use it like this: cp vacation*           for everything that starts with vacation
2006-07-11T05:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	farky	thanks for the tip - i learnt something to day  '<
2006-07-11T05:51:00.000Z	farky	livingdaylight	anytime
