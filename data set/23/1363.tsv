2011-08-04T15:12:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	okey, thanks
2011-08-04T14:57:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	it's stable since april
2011-08-04T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	11.04 means it was released in april 2011
2011-08-04T14:59:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	yes I know, that it was _released_ as a stable version then, but previous Ubuntu versions has alwats giving me trouble once I upgraded, that's why I asking
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	"stable" has a specific meaning
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	in any case, read the release notes and bugs.ubuntu.com or just try a live cd
2011-08-04T15:02:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	yes, I know, the meaning of the word stable very well :-)
2011-08-04T15:04:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	as I said I know what a "stable version" is what I meant by asking was not if it was released a as a stable, but if it was running stable for you guys
2011-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	define "running stable"
2011-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	, do you run into annoying bugs into it? (bugs you notice I mean)
2011-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	yes, there's a pulseaudio bug I encounter with my hardware.  Like I said, you should try it and see if there's anything that affects you
2011-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	okey, thanks, for that, what about 10.10 then?
2011-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	I don't know
2011-09-16T18:47:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	what package
2011-09-16T18:48:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	xboxburner, from this site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xboxburner/files/
2011-09-16T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	I'd suggest building your own package from the tar.bz2 then
2011-09-16T18:55:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	Well I got it to install but it crashes as soon as I'm about to write the Disc
2011-09-16T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	how did you get it to install?
2011-09-16T18:56:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	I did sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i xboxburner.deb
2011-09-16T18:57:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	since it is for i386 (I'm using the 64-bit ubuntu version)
2011-09-16T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	zteam	see if your error persists if you install from the tar.gz
2011-09-16T19:02:00.000Z	zteam	jrib	okey, will try
