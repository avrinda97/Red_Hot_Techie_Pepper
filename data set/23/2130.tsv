2009-12-14T21:11:00.000Z	VirusTB		 is there a site where i can check ck like al packages and that they are used for? forceflow
2009-12-14T21:11:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	list installed packages with dpkg -l, so you can check for example if pastebinit is installed by using : dpkg -l | grep pastebinit
2009-12-14T21:16:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 thanks for the dpgk -l  trick.. but is there a way i can check  whats " xserver-xorg  or  w3m  or onboard   or" ? and what its neeeded for?
2009-12-14T21:16:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	sorry i don;t understand your question
2009-12-14T21:17:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	  ok ill rephrase in a bit
2009-12-14T21:18:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 but how do i get the terminal to show me all the contents after runninf command " dpkg -l "  ??  My list starts from M and goes to Z  (im sure it was to numerous to mention so it was cut off, i cant scrool up any further)
2009-12-14T21:19:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	you want to show only installed packages for a certain piece of software correct ? (or do you want a list of various ones )
2009-12-14T21:19:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	ah yes after greping you put | less
2009-12-14T21:20:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	so my previous example would be : dpkg -l | grep pastebinit | less
2009-12-14T21:20:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	this is what you want? to only see a screenful of information at a time and take your time to page through it ?
2009-12-14T21:21:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 yes  '  | less  | is what i was loking for :P
2009-12-14T21:21:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	the other option you have is to pipe it to a text file so you can use a text editor of your choosing to read it
2009-12-14T21:21:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 also pastebin feature hmmm...  how do i install that?  (say i run a command  and the reply goes straight to pastebin.com and makes a url for me) ?
2009-12-14T21:21:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	so my previous example would be : dpkg -l | grep pastebinit > package-list-output.txt
2009-12-14T21:22:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 huh, still a bit unclear to me isnt there a package "pastebinit"
2009-12-14T21:22:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	yes also xchat will let you run commands from the edit box here : /exec -o lsb-release | pastebinit
2009-12-14T21:23:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 hun.. I can use xchat to get information as if it was terminal?
2009-12-14T21:24:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	yes
2009-12-14T21:25:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 installin 'pastbinit"
2009-12-14T21:25:00.000Z	VirusTB	airtonix	 now run command  " /exec -o lsb-release | pastebinit " within xchat?
2009-12-14T21:25:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	try using lspci instead
2009-12-14T21:27:00.000Z	airtonix	VirusTB	it was my original type it's meant to be lsb_release not lsb-release...it was just an example however
