2010-02-15T23:48:00.000Z	abadabad00		hello. I upgraded from Ubuntu 9.04 (64bit) to 9.10 (64bit) yesterday. Everything is working fine except videos. I can't play ANY videos with ANY player. This all worked in 9.04. Can anyone help?
2010-02-15T23:49:00.000Z	abadabad00		I have mediainfo installed so I can give you detailed information about the video files I am trying to play. But, point is this all worked before the upgrade...
2010-02-15T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-02-15T23:51:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- didn't work
2010-02-15T23:57:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- and how exactly do I do that?
2010-02-16T00:00:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- ... look. I don't understand. I have gstreamer installed. Search for it for what? To install it, to reinstall it, to see if I have it?
2010-02-16T00:01:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- instructions like "look for this" doesn't exactly tell me much (I'm not being ungrateful here, just a bit confused in terms of communication)
2010-02-16T00:02:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- do you want the output
2010-02-16T00:03:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- Look man. I have papers to write, books to read and assignments to complete. I don't have the time to learn why Ubuntu is screwing up at every turn. There are only 24 hours in a day and I am usually Up 20 hours of those doing grad school stuff. Its not feasible to expect everyone to be a Linux superuser
2010-02-16T00:04:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- But I appreciate the help
2010-02-16T00:05:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- K, super. I already reinstalled that whole list (actually before you directed me to), but it still isn't working. Incidentally I noticed that MKV files do work in VLC. The only type I have noticed working so far.
2010-05-01T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	can you use http://pastebin.com to give the output of: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-05-01T03:47:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/Upx4kuNP
2010-05-01T03:49:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- did you get my pastebin
2010-05-01T03:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	looks fine to me, can you pastebin the output of: sudo apt-get --reinstall install gedit
2010-05-01T03:51:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- http://pastebin.com/G4F0A7DG
2010-05-01T03:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	ok run: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove    you are good to go, you can install and remove apps as you please
2010-05-01T03:53:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- what caused this?
2010-05-01T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	not sure, sometimes an apt-get update fixes all. gui is nice but cli is where its at
2010-05-01T03:54:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- that did not fix it
2010-05-01T03:54:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- This is what synaptec package manager tells me when I try to install VLC "vlc: Depends: vlc-nox but it is not going to be installed Recommends: vlc-plugin-pulse but it is not going to be installed"
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	abadabad00	ActionParsnip	- Any reason why that did not fix it? Any other course of action available?
2010-05-01T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abadabad00	not sure, this is one of the huge weaknesses in package based distros
