2010-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	MPX		Full screen
2010-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	MPX		Is there any other keys that can bring me out to a terminal?
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I know soyo, but let's say that I can't and that CTRL + ALT + F1 does nothing
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		Nor Alt + Tab
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I heard about SYSREQ keys to press or something
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		No smartviking
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I know all this sebsebseb
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		But I'm for example talking about a fullscreen game that has crashed, leaving me with a black screen, with a moving mouse cursor
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		and ALT + TAB (CTRL + f1) does not work
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		That was it Cynthia thanks :D But is there not a key combo exept for CTRL + ALT + f1 that will bring me to a terminal?
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	Ctrl+Alt+F1 should be the key combo bringing you to one
2010-05-19T23:14:00.000Z	MPX	Cynthia	But if that does not work, but SYSREQ works...
2010-05-19T23:15:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	I don't know of one. Maybe someone else does. (MPX wants to access a terminal from a frozen GUI (virtual terminal 7) and the other VTs are inaccessible. Perhaps a restart of X is in order... Ctrl+alt+Backspace?)
2010-05-19T23:17:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	You'd have to be able to run 'sudo dontzap' or something. So you'll need to have a terminal first, and then you can C+A+Backspace for the next crashes
2010-05-19T23:22:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	It might work, try it. To restart X you'd then type 'restart gdm' (or kdm if you're using KDE) in virtual terminal 1
2010-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	I don't know - again someone else might. I'll try Google though
2010-05-19T23:33:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	killall -STOP Xorg
2010-05-19T23:39:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	If you can then access virtual terminal 1 with Ctrl+Alt+F1, log into it and issue 'sudo restart gdm && sudo restart pulseaudio' - you might have a lot of services stopped, actually
2010-05-19T23:39:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	Oh... blindness? :| You mean you still can't see a terminal?
2010-05-19T23:39:00.000Z	MPX	Cynthia	Exactly
2010-05-19T23:40:00.000Z	Cynthia	MPX	You'll probably have to reboot the computer then, if no one else knows how to recover from a frozen X
2010-05-19T23:42:00.000Z	MPX	Cynthia	another question, Let
2010-05-19T23:43:00.000Z	MPX	Cynthia	another question, Let's say I use backintime to take backup of the entire filesystem on a HDD. How can I restore the backup if Ubuntu decides to totally crash for me and is only accessible through a LIVE cd. And another one....Is there an easier way to take backup of the entire System?
