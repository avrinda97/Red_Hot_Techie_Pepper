2008-08-25T02:07:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	after u installed virtualbox did u add yourself to vboxusers group?
2008-08-25T02:09:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	do sudo useradd -G vboxusers $USERNAME
2008-08-25T02:12:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	Flannel oh right... the previous command is for adding new users to the system
2008-08-25T02:12:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	disregard the one i gave u and use sudo adduser $USERNAME vboxusers
2008-08-25T02:13:00.000Z	guesswho	usser	Flannel; its still giving me this The VirtualBox kernel driver is not accessible to the current user. Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups. You will need to logout for the change to take effect..
2008-08-25T02:13:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	u have to relogin for the group memberships to take effect
2008-08-25T02:14:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	no!
2008-08-25T02:14:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	why would u want to?
2008-08-25T02:15:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	when sudo works just fine
2008-08-25T02:16:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	u can use sudo for that
2008-08-25T02:17:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	the command i gave u above lets your regular access vboxkernel module
2008-08-25T02:17:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	pretty much any task u can up with is possible with sudo
2008-08-25T02:18:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	u can do this with sudo just do gksudo nautilus
2008-08-25T08:23:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	well wine is for the games
2008-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	yes wine does allow to run some viruses, but its pretty well sandboxed the most damage they can do is destroy your home directory
2008-08-25T08:27:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	yes. it is. just make sure you backup your VM regularly
2008-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	thats a bit paranoid but, i guess u can do it. are running a live cd inside virtualbox?
2008-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	yea i can see the point but can do all that with snapshots.
2008-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	virtualbox allows you to take a snapshot of a VM once its setup, and every time u power it on its gonna start from exact state it was when u took the snapshot
2008-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	usser	guesswho	:)
