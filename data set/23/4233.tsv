2007-10-15T14:24:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	you'd have to ask the developers.
2007-10-15T14:25:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	right. probably missing scripts
2007-11-18T00:33:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	are you trying to set up the PC as a router?
2007-11-18T00:34:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	um, not intentionally, just want to network them and shareinternet
2007-11-18T00:36:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	you don't have an eth0 interface on the PC?
2007-11-18T00:36:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	do you have an Ethernet card or integrated?
2007-11-18T00:37:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	yes, I was able to connect the pc to windows network and share internet via the windows machine
2007-11-18T00:40:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	sry, back in 30 minutes
2007-11-18T00:51:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	what kind of cable did you use to connect the machines?
2007-11-18T00:53:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	normal lan cable
2007-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	and no hub?
2007-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	you need either a hub or a crossover Ethernet cable
2007-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	nope, pc to laptop direct
2007-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	peacepipejv	soundray	wha!? it workedfine gutsy to xp
2007-11-18T00:58:00.000Z	soundray	peacepipejv	when you say it worked with gutsy and XP, which one was where?
