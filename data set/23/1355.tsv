2010-05-02T22:40:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	what are you trying to achieve and are you using binary video drivers and the nvidia-settings app ?
2010-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	connects via what kind of connection ?
2010-05-02T22:42:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	I want to set my resolution from 640x480 to 1360x768 (max supported) (it was working great on 9.10). I'm using the proprietary nvidia drivers and I'm using nvidia-setting
2010-05-02T22:43:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	what do you mean by kind of connection? like VGA?
2010-05-02T22:43:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	yes dbus cable, dvi cable hdmi cable etc
2010-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	VGA cable.
2010-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	first thing i would check is if it worked fine with 9.10 is what has changed.. (i assume the binary drivers you were using are not yet tuned properly for the changes that 10.04 brings)
2010-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	where did you install the nvidia drivers from ?
2010-05-02T22:47:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	using ubuntu software to install the recommended driver.
2010-05-02T22:47:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	actually I had a friend here back when I was using 9.10 who changed my xorg.conf to something my monitor recognized great using nvdia drivers.
2010-05-02T22:47:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	but since i forgot to backup that xorg.conf, i'm trying to figure what are the changes needed to be done by my own
2010-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	there is a thread somewhere on ubuntu forums about detecting monitors and setting modelines etc etc for nvidia, under tutorials and tips (it might be a few years old but the concepts still apply)
2010-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	any reason why you're not using the vadpu drivers from the ppa ?
2010-05-02T22:49:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	I don't know. Ubuntu just popped "you may need to install some proprietary drivers for you graphics cards." and then I selected the recommended one and that was it.
2010-05-02T22:50:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	in the nvidia settings gui what version does it say the drivers are ?
2010-05-02T22:51:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	labeled : Server Vendor Version:
2010-05-02T22:51:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	1.7.6
2010-05-02T22:52:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	and the one labeled :  NVIDIA Driver Version:
2010-05-02T22:52:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	195.36.15
2010-05-02T22:53:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	ok yours is newer than mine :(
2010-05-02T22:53:00.000Z	jadakren	o_k_	i suggest you hunt down any nvidia type guides on the ubuntu forums in the tutorial and tips section
2010-05-02T22:53:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	hahah who said that newer is better? i cant even change from 640x480
2010-05-02T22:54:00.000Z	o_k_	jadakren	going to do that, thanks for your time anyway :)
