2008-01-17T19:39:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	yes sure
2008-01-17T19:39:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	it's in the ubuntu repo's
2008-01-18T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	just drag them into the theme manager
2008-01-18T18:21:00.000Z	alison	ikonia	really it's that easy?
2008-01-18T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	it certainly is
2008-01-18T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	flash player not a compatible ? network card driver not as good so slower speed
2008-01-18T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	just random suggestions
2008-01-18T18:24:00.000Z	alison	ikonia	i belive flash is compatible because its working
2008-01-18T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	not "as" compatible that should have read
2008-01-18T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	you probably have the flash player version 10 from adobes download site, there have been issues logged against it
2008-01-18T18:26:00.000Z	alison	ikonia	which flash player works the best on ubuntu?
2008-01-18T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	thats a debatable question, flash-9 was the best I've seen but thats no longer available, flash-10 seems the best option to me at the moment
2008-01-18T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	alison	different version
