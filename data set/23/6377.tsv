2007-03-23T12:38:00.000Z	Erika		i want to download edgy from web. but.. my Service is too much slow .. maximum 9 kbs  .. so if i try to download and Resume it then after sometime when i get bit more speed then again download that resume. so it works ?
2007-03-23T12:38:00.000Z	cfedde	Erika	a slight chalange. but using a torrent might be faster.
2007-03-23T12:39:00.000Z	Erika	cfedde	 but my network admistrator restricted the speed. with torrent i get it fast?
2007-03-23T12:40:00.000Z	cfedde	Erika	with torrent you get several streams at once.  Hard to know how your bandwidth limits will work with that.
2007-03-23T12:40:00.000Z	Erika	cfedde	Bandwidth limited here.. :<
2007-03-23T12:41:00.000Z	cfedde	Erika	at home via dsl direct down load I get about 14KBps.  with bit torrent I get between 60 and 70.
