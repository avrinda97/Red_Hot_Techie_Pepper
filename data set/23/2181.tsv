2009-07-10T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	What's your problem?
2009-07-10T01:43:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	With all do respect.  Wubi is a shoddy linux install.
2009-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	maniheer	edbian	my cd/dvd drive doesnt work anymore
2009-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Try unetbootin  !!  It lets you boot from an ISO without a CD (or a CD drive :) )
2009-07-10T01:46:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Sorry bud :(
2009-07-10T01:46:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	I think it is possible to download windows software to view the file that wubi uses as a harddrive and read / write it.  To get you lost work :).
2009-07-10T01:56:00.000Z	maniheer	edbian	u suggested unetbootin, HELP ME, PWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZ
2009-07-10T01:56:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	?
2009-07-10T01:56:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Be more specific :)
2009-07-10T01:57:00.000Z	maniheer	edbian	how do i install Xubuntu using unetbootin, I need a step by step tutorial, and why it says that it makes live USB disks.....
2009-07-10T01:58:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Do you have unetbootin downloaded / installed for windows?  Are you on the target computer right now?
2009-07-10T01:59:00.000Z	maniheer	edbian	yes and yes
2009-07-10T01:59:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Do you have a xubuntu iso ??
2009-07-10T02:00:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	We'
2009-07-10T02:00:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	We'll need that.  do you know where to get it?
2009-07-10T02:00:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Obviously that takes a bit.  Let me know when it finishes.
2009-07-10T02:01:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	:(.  Patience
2009-07-10T02:07:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Well when you're finished (I probably won't be here) open unetbootin and point it to your ISO file.  Ask around here for help.
2009-07-10T02:08:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	What you're trying to do is "dual-boot" windows XP and xubuntu.  It's easy to do :)
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Once you reboot using unetbootin and the ISO is running there is no difference :)
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	maniheer	edbian	fair enough
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Have you ever installed a dual boot before?
2009-07-10T02:11:00.000Z	edbian	maniheer	Do you know how to use gparted to partition your drive during the install?  Have you ever installed a dual boot system before?
