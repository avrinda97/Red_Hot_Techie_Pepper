2011-05-03T16:47:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	AFAIK you can run ubuntu-bug from the installer
2011-05-03T16:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	happen to know how?
2011-05-03T16:49:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	which installer are you using? alternate cd or live?
2011-05-03T16:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	bullgard4 i would like to report a bug thast i have been seing for several versions now that causes ubiquity to freeze when you choose a keyboard layout which leads to you reinstalling, which is time-consuming on a netbook!
2011-05-03T16:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	not alternat the regular one
2011-05-03T16:50:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	boot the live cd and open a terminal
2011-05-03T16:51:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	i CAN do the whole install process again and then report it... *sigh*
2011-05-03T16:52:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	that's the point of it
2011-05-03T16:52:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	my gratitude also to you for your help!
2011-05-03T16:52:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	there is a way to report a bug without ubuntu-bug
2011-05-03T16:52:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	yes?
2011-05-03T16:52:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	but i can't remember which...gimme some time ;)
2011-05-03T16:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	hehe, sure i will yawn alittle infront of my second install attempt while the progressbar creeps its way...
2011-05-03T16:53:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	here you go
2011-05-03T16:54:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	it was in the middle of the wiki page
2011-05-03T16:54:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	the ubuntu bug reporting page??
2011-05-03T16:54:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	it was in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
2011-05-03T16:54:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	middl of the page
2011-05-03T16:55:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	section Filing bugs at Launchpad.net
2011-05-03T16:55:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	but you SHOULD use ubuntu-bug, really...it gives much more "debug" information
2011-05-03T16:56:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	the bug that i will report is completely independent of hardware, etc...
2011-05-03T16:57:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	nanomad	thanks for your help, dude!:)
2011-05-03T16:57:00.000Z	nanomad	remoteCTRL1	you're welcome!
