2006-12-18T11:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	depends on what you want. exfalso is a good tagger/organizer, and amarok is great with reading tags and building databases
2006-12-18T11:49:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	ohh what up man didn't cya amongst the 1000 faces, anyway is amarok good on sysem resources
2006-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	do i know you?
2006-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	amarok isnt overly resource intensive, but since it uses kde libs you can expect some extra memory usage
2006-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	is amarok better then totem or xmms for mp3 playback
2006-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	imho yes, very much so. try it out and see for your self
2006-12-18T12:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	have you installed xine-extracodecs?
2006-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	i think i need to unmute a certain device
2006-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	man remember the other day i was talking to you about hooking up my computer i had in storage...well the beast lives
2006-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	type alsamixer in a terminal
2006-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	no, sorry i catn say i do :) was that on here, an where you using the same nick?

2006-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	i just did ;)
2006-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	ohh sorry been up all night getting this system in line
2006-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	rearranged a whole room, put in a desk, dustered my tower, put in a new graphics card, backed up data, installed OS and now i'm tweaking it
2006-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	sound like an evning well spent imho :)
2006-12-18T12:25:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	more like a whole night...anyway the problem is i have 2 pc speaker outputs on my sound card but only one is working
2006-12-18T12:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	are you sure they are both speaker outputs? you wont get soudn in the rear channel of a surround sound card if the source is 2ch, fex. not without upsampling, and you dont want that
2006-12-18T12:27:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	i had it set up before to give me 4 ch sound, is it the card i need to configure or the mp3 file?
2006-12-18T12:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	magic_ninja	the player, or card
2006-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	magic_ninja	nolimitsoya	ok, i figured a channel was just messed on the mixer
