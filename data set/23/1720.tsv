2010-01-02T18:05:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Vidalia is just the GUI, yes
2010-01-02T18:05:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	Damn... I never get that torbutton to work
2010-01-02T18:06:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Do you have Tor itself running?
2010-01-02T18:06:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	The usual way to start it is by starting the Vidalia GUI
2010-01-02T18:08:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	I don't know, how to check if it's running?
2010-01-02T18:08:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Open Terminal, type 'pgrep -l tor'
2010-01-02T18:09:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	I can not see it there
2010-01-02T18:10:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Start Vidalia then, it'll start Tor automatically
2010-01-02T18:10:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	Shouldn't it have been setup automatically then I installed torbutton from synaptic
2010-01-02T18:11:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Torbutton is just a button for toggling the proxy settings. The actual Tor program can be running in a different PC.
2010-01-02T18:11:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	okey, it couldn't startup tor...
2010-01-02T18:12:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	guess I don't have the right package installed
2010-01-02T18:13:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	It's called "tor", and is available at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TOR
2010-01-02T18:19:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	now i have installed it, but then i run it vidalia says that tor exited unexpectlenty
2010-01-02T18:30:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Now Tor should be working - just give it a few minutes to connect.
2010-01-02T18:31:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	okey, but according to Vidalia Tor is off?
2010-01-02T18:31:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	Vidalia just is unable to communicate with it, but Tor itself is running
2010-01-02T18:33:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	okey, but the torbutton isn't working either
2010-01-02T18:36:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	I think I give up, this thing won't work
2010-01-02T18:36:00.000Z	grawity	Zteam	When you enable Torbutton and try to open a page, what do you get?
2010-01-02T18:38:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	it just tells me it failed the previous time I tried to use it, and ask me if I want to contiune, if go to whatismyip.com i have my normal ip-adress
2010-01-02T18:39:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	If I run a test it fails, and it tells me to check my proxy settings
2010-01-02T18:47:00.000Z	Zteam	grawity	any clue?
