2005-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	Aron		hey guys, I finally got around to doing a clean reinstall of Hoary. Why is there no more XMMS?
2005-06-15T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
2005-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	it's in the universe repository
2005-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	I've got universe up, or at least Synaptic SAYS I do :P
2005-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	did you update?
2005-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	yes
2005-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	Note that the how2 is for the old synaptic - this new one seems buggy to me.
2005-06-15T08:10:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	well, it's there, I don't know what might be broken in your config
2005-06-15T08:10:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	well according to apt it isn't, lol
2005-06-15T08:10:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-06-15T08:11:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	dude
2005-06-15T08:12:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	00:10:44           bob2 | Aron: paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-06-15T08:14:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	"sudo apt-get update", then paste the output of "apt-cache policy xmms" to #flood
2005-06-15T08:15:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	everything's up in #flood
2005-06-19T05:54:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	it won't work on any operating system
2005-06-19T05:54:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	unless it's a mac
2005-06-19T05:56:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	By "any OS" you mean any Debian-based? Because it worked in Suse.
2005-06-19T05:56:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	suse doesn't automount it when you insert it
2005-06-19T05:56:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	It does when you attempt to access the disk, at least in 9.1
2005-06-19T06:02:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	A floppy drive wouldn't be detected by Ubuntu installation? o.o
2005-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	Aron	bob2	standard amd64 kernel, and gimme a sec
2005-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	er
2005-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	bob2	Aron	that just says where to mount it
