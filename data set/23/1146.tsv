2010-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	tesuji		hi - i am trying to make ubuntu on a usb stick and i need to actually install on the stick (as a real system, not as a livecd).  trouble is, it doesn't boot...  i have tried every trick with grub i can think of and it still won't boot.  however system created with usb-creator does boot.  any clues or suggestions?
2010-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	to "truely" install onto USB, one of the last options during install is to customize GRUB, and you need to point it manually to the USB drive (it will point to HD by default)
2010-08-04T08:58:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	i don't recall that option, where would it be?
2010-08-04T08:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	"Advanced" maybe?  I'm not sure of the wording actually.
2010-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	ok i try again.. thx
2010-08-04T09:05:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	the usb-creator sets up a fat32 file system on the stick (and that boots) - do i have to use fat for a real install or should it work with ext4?
2010-08-04T09:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	you don't need FAT for a real install you can use ext4 if you want.
2010-08-04T09:07:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	does it make any sense to use swap on a stick?
2010-08-04T09:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	if you want hibernate then yes, if you have enough RAM and don't need hibernate then you could try without it...
2010-08-04T09:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	swap will shorten the life of the stick
2010-08-04T09:09:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	i am going to be using it on a laptop that has no harddisk and only 384M ram
2010-08-04T09:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	that isn't a whole lot of memory...  you "might" want some swap - it's up to you though.
2010-08-04T09:11:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	ok i found the boot loader option.  it is asking "device for boot loader installation" - i presume this is where to write the boot loader?  should it be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdb1 ?
2010-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	assuming the USB is sdb then /dev/sdb --- the sdb1 is a parition you DON'T want that, you want it on MBR of drive.
2010-08-04T09:13:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	well i didn't do that last time...  fingers Xed this works now
2010-08-04T09:36:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	it booted!! but i have to interrupt the boot to feed it a grub option - i pressed esc and e repeatedly and it didn't hear me - what do i need to do?
2010-08-05T05:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	i've NEVER used a modem with linux before, but i know a lot of "Win-modems" don't work.  have you checked that your modem works in linux?
2010-08-05T05:27:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	if you aren't familiar with modems you need to read th docs
2010-08-05T05:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	ok sorry.
2010-08-05T23:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	is key ring coming up everytime for nm_applet?
2010-08-05T23:57:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	my wifi wont work until i enter password
2010-08-05T23:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tesuji	move rather then delete the current keyring settings - then the next time keyring should re-prompt, choose the Insecure storage option and it will stop asking.
2010-08-05T23:59:00.000Z	tesuji	ZykoticK9	move? where?  why?
