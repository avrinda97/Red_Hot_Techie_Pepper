2009-10-29T06:05:00.000Z	Roasted		So, I installed conky - and I have no clue where it's at. Anybody?
2009-10-29T06:06:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	alt+f2 conky
2009-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- Hm, it popped up - but I've seen users with it on their desktop and not necessarily in a window like this. Do you know how to customize this menu and put it there?
2009-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	nano ~/.conky.config
2009-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	Or gedit ~/.conky.config
2009-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	It's ~/.conkysomething
2009-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	Might just be ~/.conky
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- I dont even have .conky
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	'man conky' for answers
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	You're probably using default settings, then.
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	'man conky'
2009-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- reading the man page
2009-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- nothing yet though...
2009-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	From my own experience, Conky can be difficult and tedious to configure.
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	Unless you go with a sample config file.
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- is conky the only widget thing available in ubuntu?
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	No.
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- is there a better option you know of out there?
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	No.
2009-10-29T06:12:00.000Z	Roasted		Is there a way by terminal to run a command and see what's currently installed from synaptic?
2009-10-29T06:13:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	Aptitude
2009-10-29T06:13:00.000Z	Roasted	mesula	- beautiful. thx bro.
2009-10-29T06:14:00.000Z	mesula	Roasted	No problem.
