2005-05-29T13:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	install gstreamer0.8-mad

2005-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	you using rhythmbox ?
2005-05-29T13:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	that's a weird bug
2005-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	Chambers`	LinuxJones	so it's a bug?  Can't do anything about it? :(
2005-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	that's a really odd problem, I would file a bug and let the devs know about it
2005-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	Chambers`	LinuxJones	ok thanks, how would I got about filing a bug report?
2005-05-29T13:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	Applications >> System Tools >>Bug Report Tool
2005-05-29T13:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	right click an mp3 file and select open with other application then goto /usr/bin/xmms
2005-05-29T13:46:00.000Z	Chambers`	LinuxJones	but it doesn't set it to open mp3's with xmms from that point on, only that 1 time
2005-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chambers`	not if you stick with the Ubuntu kernel/driver
