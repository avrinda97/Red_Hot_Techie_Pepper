2011-08-12T21:30:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		Hello
2011-08-12T21:31:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		I need help with getting Ubuntu installed on my virtual machine
2011-08-12T21:31:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		Yes
2011-08-12T21:32:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		One second, let me see what it says
2011-08-12T21:32:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		I believe it is an error with BusyBox
2011-08-12T21:32:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		Do you want a screen shot?
2011-08-12T21:32:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	What type of VM?  I've installed it in several systems, and well, it just goes usually....
2011-08-12T21:34:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	Yup, that's what I meant.  Humm... VMWare presents a very streightforward modern machine...
2011-08-12T21:38:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	did you md5sum your iso?
2011-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	Holdon, trying to remember the name of the package...
2011-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/
2011-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	That's a little package of unix utilities for windows, and it includes an md5sum.exe binary
2011-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	Kyle__	Okay thanks, I'll check it out. Also where can I find the checksum on the the ubuntu website? I don't see it
2011-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	If you really want to be nuts, you could could write your own little md5sum binary using the included .net compiler in windows...but seriously, who wants to write in .net?
2011-08-12T21:47:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	Kyle__	I code some in .net xD
2011-08-12T21:47:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	Then create a File object, and find which Digest:MD5 object or whatever it is in that syntax :) easy easy.
2011-08-12T21:47:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	Kyle__	How exactly do I uuse this program? I opened it and it's just a blank cmd
2011-08-12T21:48:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	md5sum.exe file_you_want_checksum_of.foo
2011-08-12T21:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	if you haven't used md5sum before, it seems odd, but many unix programs are like this: if you run it with an argument, it opens the file, without an argument, it's a filter you need to pipe things into.
2011-08-12T21:53:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	Kyle__	So how can I get a direct download? when I press Direct url for this download it shows a different website
2011-08-12T21:54:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	It redirected you to a mirror probably.  Should be a fine download still.
2011-08-12T21:54:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	Kyle__	Alright
2011-08-12T22:01:00.000Z	Kyle__	TYDIRocks	WHohoo!  Always an important check.
