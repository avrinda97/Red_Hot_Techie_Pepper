2005-09-23T07:53:00.000Z	solee		anyone know how there is no dotty screen at the startup of X in Ubuntu?
2005-09-23T07:54:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	you mean before it starts to load the window manager/desktop?
2005-09-23T07:55:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	yes, before loading them..
2005-09-23T07:56:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	are you asking so you can make startx do the same?
2005-09-23T07:56:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	oh...! I see..
2005-09-23T07:57:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	no, i'm using an another linux distribution. and i would like to use it in that distro..
2005-09-23T07:57:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	ahhh, well i'm not sure how gdm loads it... but i'm sure it's in some config somewhere, wherever the core X server or xinit is initialized
2005-09-23T07:58:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	aha. thank you very much. i'll try to find how to set the bgcolor instead of the scary dots!! :)
2005-09-23T07:58:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	it wont be in a "config" file most likely... probably within one of the init scripts itself... whatever gdm invokes when it starts up X
2005-09-23T07:59:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	alright...
2005-09-23T08:02:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	think i found it
2005-09-23T08:02:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	...!!
2005-09-23T08:02:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	/etc/gdm/gdm.conf, scroll down to "Definition of the standard X server"...
2005-09-23T08:03:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	I'm there..!
2005-09-23T08:03:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	i guess that's where you would change it on another distro
2005-09-23T08:04:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	aha.. so i have to give some argument to the 'command' right?
2005-09-23T08:04:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	yeah... i assume so anyway
2005-09-23T08:04:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	alright.. thank you a lot for the help :)
2005-09-23T08:05:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	where to find options for the X server, i dunno... prolly in "man X" somewhere
2005-09-23T08:06:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	ahhh, -br is what makes the root window (bg) black
2005-09-23T08:07:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	and i dont see any way to set a color, so i guess you're stuck with black or mesh :)
2005-09-23T08:10:00.000Z	solee	Quinthius	ahhhh! right, thanks. (hehe, black was also what i would do if i could select color. :D)
2005-09-23T08:10:00.000Z	Quinthius	solee	 :D
