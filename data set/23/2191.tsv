2009-06-05T22:48:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	if it ain't broke, don't fix it
2009-06-05T22:48:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	oh for gfx card go ahead :)
2009-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	the preview is available
2009-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	I'm using it now :)
2009-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	Koheleth	cabrey	is it difficult to install?
2009-06-05T22:55:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	there is a PPA available
2009-06-05T22:55:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa
2009-06-05T22:57:00.000Z	Koheleth	cabrey	do I just add those repos then
2009-06-05T22:57:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	yes & add the public key
2009-06-05T23:01:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	keep in mind it is not "Chrome" it is "Chromium" -- theres a difference
2009-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	Koheleth	cabrey	geez adding the keys aint straight forward or am I missing something
2009-06-05T23:06:00.000Z	cabrey	Koheleth	not exactly :) just follow the instructions
2009-06-05T23:35:00.000Z	Koheleth	cabrey	get this after adding the key and trying to install Chromium...
