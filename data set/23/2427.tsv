2009-03-17T22:53:00.000Z	ZenMasta		can someone help me retrieve files from a hard drive using ubuntu live cd?
2009-03-17T22:53:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	what os in on the harddrive
2009-03-17T22:54:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	I'm not sure what file system
2009-03-17T22:54:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	all I see in computer - file browser is "/boot" "cdrom" "filesystem" and my usbflash key
2009-03-17T22:56:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	it shows the same as I just told you but it also lists "desktop" "trash" and documents music etc
2009-03-17T22:56:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	it will say something like "45gb volume", or something along those lines, most likely
2009-03-17T22:57:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	there is nothing like that, in the places pane
2009-03-17T22:58:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	use mount
2009-03-17T23:00:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	so, mount -t /dev/sda
2009-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	I'm not command prompt savvy so I dont know what type
2009-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	lemme check that okay? ill brb
2009-03-17T23:04:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	sorry if you have already done this, what is listed in the line of /dev/sda if you fdisk -ls
2009-03-17T23:05:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	there are two sections when I do sudo fdisk -l the first one says Disk /dev/sda: 20GB and sector info etc
2009-03-17T23:05:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	the secont section says Device Boot Start End ID System etc
2009-03-17T23:08:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	yeah under system it says linux
2009-03-17T23:09:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	well if you think that it is ext3
2009-03-17T23:09:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	I'll post a screenshot to zoho notebook so you can see what it says
2009-03-17T23:10:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	i dont have a gui, i cant open images
2009-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	i found the auto command
2009-03-17T23:14:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	did you see the command up there ^
2009-03-17T23:15:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	 sudo mount -t autofs /dev/sda1 /media/mountusb -o force
2009-03-17T23:18:00.000Z	ZenMasta	nigtv	I ran both of those commands and I did find the directory it created but it doesn't seem to have mounted the hard drive to that path
2009-03-17T23:19:00.000Z	nigtv	ZenMasta	you may need to check that the harddrive is infact at /dev/sda, it might be sdb or hda or any other things
