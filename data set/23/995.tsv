2010-10-16T16:50:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	well i was thinking as long as i use a light weight window manager should be okay
2010-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 this new updated install is just under 5gb.
2010-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 how much ram do you have?
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	128 mb
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 you got 128mb of RAM? thats going to be a Major bottleneck
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 you would want a lot of swap in that case
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	so at minimum 256 mb swap?
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 i would check out Lubuntu for such a low end system
2010-10-16T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 id say a min of 512mb-1gb..
2010-10-16T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 whats its CPU anyway?
2010-10-16T16:50:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	i think 333mhz
2010-10-16T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 try lubuntu, if thats too sluggish. You may have to go try these super-minimal type disrtos liek Puppylinux, or dsl, or others.
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 it also may take you a few hrs to install on such a low end box.
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 i put it on a Pent I 100mhz once.. ages ago. :) just the install took like 2 hrs..
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	i wouldnt be surprised if it took longer i don't think the cd drive reads very fast
2010-10-16T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 also 'tiny core linux' = 10mb :)
2010-10-16T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 that old a machine may ba a problem on any disrto
2010-10-16T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 on a 333mhz machine.. i dont think 'fast' is a word that should be used with anything, :)
2010-10-16T16:57:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	:-p
2010-10-16T16:58:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	ive never heard of that before
2010-10-16T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 they can use quite a bit.
2010-10-16T17:00:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	Dr_Willis	i was thinking the same thing they play alot of those spam apps on facebook lol...
2010-10-16T17:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CrackerJackz	 more correct is to say 'flash is buggy' :)
