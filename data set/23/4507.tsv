2007-10-28T09:50:00.000Z	jscinoz		no
2007-10-28T09:51:00.000Z	jscinoz		keypad, then go to azureus.sourceforge.net and download the 2.5.0.4 jar
2007-10-28T09:52:00.000Z	jscinoz		hmm thats strange 2.5.0.4 isnt on azureus.soruceforge.net anymore

2007-10-28T09:52:00.000Z	jscinoz		keypad, just going to test this same thing works if i use the 3.X version
2007-10-28T09:54:00.000Z	jscinoz		keypad, yep it works with 3.0.3.4, so download that and drop it in "/usr/share/java", rename or link it to Azureus2.jar so you dont have to mess with other things
2007-10-28T09:55:00.000Z	jscinoz		keypad, did it work?
