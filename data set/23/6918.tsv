2006-09-30T07:13:00.000Z	sethk	feross	I don't use it myself.  but, if he shuts down the server when nobody is getting files, there is nothing wrong with ftp
2006-09-30T07:14:00.000Z	feross	sethk	true, I just think it's a waste of time to install an FTP server when ssh is available and necessary for FTP servers so you can manage from remote anyway.
2006-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	feross	sethk	why don't you use genpoo then? :P
2006-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	feross	that makes no sense.
2006-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	feross	why would I do that?
2006-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	feross	there is a bit of a difference between getting what I want in two minutes vs. getting what I want in two days.
2006-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	feross	sethk	well I guess the initial install takes forever :) then you can install from source.
2006-09-30T07:27:00.000Z	sethk	feross	I can install anything I want from source on any linux distro.
2006-09-30T07:27:00.000Z	feross	sethk	right... what I meant to say came out wrong, was JK.
2006-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	feross	I knew that.  :)
2006-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	sethk	feross	fvwm was slick when it first came out.
2006-09-30T09:09:00.000Z	sethk	feross	does that do tunneling for vnc?
2006-09-30T09:10:00.000Z	sethk	feross	didn't know that, thank you.
2006-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	feross	sethk	hey, you're talking on how to set IP's to the nic but then on reboot it will loose those settings. It can be put into /etc/network/interfaces so that it's there as default if I'm not mistaken.
2006-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	sethk	feross	yes, of course
2006-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	sethk	feross	however, that isn't how I do it
2006-10-05T06:02:00.000Z	feross	sethk	hmm ok if it's in the rc.local I guess it will work but IMHO putting it in interfaces works better in case you need to netoworking restart *shrug* also just seems cleaner.
2006-10-05T06:03:00.000Z	sethk	feross	perhaps.  I prefer methods that aren't distro specific.  If I want to restart the interface, I just use the ifconfig command.  I'm not saying my way is better, just that it works.
2006-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	feross	sethk	sure :) I can see your point.
2006-10-22T10:08:00.000Z	sethk	feross	yes, files specific to the user are created by many things including gnome.  do this in your home directory:    ls -A
2006-10-22T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	feross	all the subdirectories beginning with . (that is dot) are state files.  you'll see the one for gnome, the name is obvious.
2006-10-22T10:14:00.000Z	feross	sethk	ok I see the gnome directories but which one is the one that controls screen resolution and what devices are used to display.. LDC-CRT-TV ... it's on a laptop. I want to be able to control it what to use, right now it only works when I boot up with the devices plugged in.
