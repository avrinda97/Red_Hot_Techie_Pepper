2007-12-22T03:51:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	C++
2007-12-22T03:51:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	or whatever i can use to work with to build apps in ubuntu
2007-12-22T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	well ?
2007-12-22T03:53:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	well, you can use python if you like, here is a good tut, http://www.swaroopch.com/byteofpython/ ... and the real free gift pertaining to that: feel free to contact me for anything, anotequaltob at gmail dot com
2007-12-22T03:54:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	sweet but is there anything thats not script driven for gui development in ubuntu?
2007-12-22T03:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	i'm sorry? hang on, i need to reread your phrasing...
2007-12-22T03:55:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	i use php but i wanted something like C or C++ to use in ubuntu to write apps?
2007-12-22T03:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	you say "is there anything thats not script driven (...)". why do you think scripts are bad? Python is a fully featured programming language
2007-12-22T03:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	for that you can get
2007-12-22T03:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-12-22T03:57:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	is python OOP ?
2007-12-22T03:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	it uses various paradigms, but at its core it is essentially OOP
2007-12-22T03:58:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	they its time i start learning it
2007-12-22T03:58:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	do you recommend an app or have an app i can view to see some of code of a current gui in ubuntu?
2007-12-22T03:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	i gave you a link to a tutorial. there's #python. and i gave you my e-mail. that's your free gift ;-)
2007-12-22T03:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	um, an app... hmm..
2007-12-22T03:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	i'm unsure, altho you can find packages that depend on the python package and look in there for the source code
2007-12-22T04:00:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	kbrooks	cool i sent u a test email
2007-12-22T04:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	ubuntuisloved	i have some hints over here. i will e-mail you the command in a second
