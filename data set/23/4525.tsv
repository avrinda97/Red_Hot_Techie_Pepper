2008-01-04T00:33:00.000Z	apocalypti		i just lost all internet access in ubuntu. i think its a software issue, as i can get online on all my other boxes and from winxp, which i have installed on that same box. any help would be appreciated.
2008-01-04T00:33:00.000Z	apocalypti		also sorry about the caps before
2008-01-04T00:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	run the command ifconfig and pastebin it please
2008-01-04T00:35:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	ifconfig didnt fix it, and it said command not found when i typed in pastebin it
2008-01-04T00:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	No no, open a terminal and run the command ifconfig then run the command iwconfig then copy all that into a pastebin so I can read it
2008-01-04T00:41:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	ok, this will take me a minute, as i have to move the info from my computer to this one and then upload
2008-01-04T00:41:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	Er, ok.
2008-01-04T00:48:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	here you go. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50633/
2008-01-04T00:51:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	: here it is. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50633/
2008-01-04T01:09:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	I apologize, I dozed off...I am really sorry, I am back
2008-01-04T01:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	my sincerest apologies I am getting over a cold and I closed my eyes and lost 20 minutes....
2008-01-04T01:10:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	no problem, i understand. heres the ifconfig printout, if you didnt get it before. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50633/
2008-01-04T01:11:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	Are you able to ping your router?
2008-01-04T01:14:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	no
2008-01-04T01:14:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	i cant ping my router
2008-01-04T01:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	What is the router IP? should be 192.168.1.1, right? What error are you getting when you ping it?
2008-01-04T01:19:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	its actually 192.168.0.1, and it doesnt give me an error, its just sort of been sitting there for about 10 minutes
2008-01-04T01:25:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	silent_: i dont see anything horribly wrong with anything either, should I try putting a livecd in to see if its just the way my network card is now working with ubuntu for some reason?
2008-01-04T01:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	Just use terminal and type route
2008-01-04T01:50:00.000Z	PurpZeY	apocalypti	Dude, that's your router setup page?
2008-01-04T01:52:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	its what i get when i type 192.198.0.1 into firefox. i can send the manual setup page screenshot too
2008-01-04T01:54:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	silent_: it is xp. like i said, the only computer running linux is the one with the problem
2008-01-04T02:00:00.000Z	apocalypti	PurpZeY	silent_: all the cables are fine, that was the first thing i checked. and i ran the cmd, and it said reconfiguring network interfaces... [ok]
