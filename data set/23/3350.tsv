2008-05-10T21:25:00.000Z	Virtue		can someone tell me: in order to backup my settings and stuff - do I need openads-client or something else ?
2008-05-10T21:25:00.000Z	Virtue		openafs-client*
2008-05-10T21:26:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	duplicity is nice
2008-05-10T21:26:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	okay, thank you!
2008-05-10T23:06:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	in order to backup system with duplicity, I need to type source as "/" ?
2008-05-10T23:06:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	or /dev/sda1 ? :]
2008-05-10T23:07:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	I think either, I always use the former though.
2008-05-10T23:07:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	okay thankee! :]
2008-05-10T23:25:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	I got "gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file `/home/hagane/.gnupg/gpg.conf'
2008-05-10T23:27:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	Do you have a GPG key?
2008-05-10T23:27:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	no what's that ? :D
2008-05-10T23:27:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	it asked smth, I wrote some pass, and retyped it.
2008-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	as I understand this is for web servers and etc, but can I save image on my hard ? I don't have any http or local network PC or anything
2008-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	rsync can use the local system as destination too.
2008-05-11T00:14:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	so I made this gnu key, what does it have to do with duplicity anyway ? no matter what I write when it asks to enter (and confirm) the outcome i that error..
2008-05-11T00:15:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	You wanted to encrypt your files... you need a way to decrypt it... else it'd be like a safe without a lock  ;)
2008-05-11T00:16:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	I just wanted to make a backup on another drive, and I ended up totally confused making some key I don't even fully understand what for..
2008-05-11T00:16:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	I distinctly recall you said you wanted to encrypt a tar.gz .... about 5 hours ago  :P
2008-05-11T00:17:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	lol no wai, I asked what prog is good for backing up - and you said duplicity...
2008-05-11T00:18:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	ahh... well duplicity is about the best tool for backups too... you just get some security added in so no one tampers with them... it's really easy once you create a key... you should be signing e-mails and stuff with it anyways, to ensure it's really you etc...
2008-05-11T00:19:00.000Z	fde	Virtue	Once you get the key set up, you get many benefits from it... seems complicated, but it's really not
2008-05-11T00:20:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	well I got it
2008-05-11T00:27:00.000Z	Virtue	fde	it's written FTP and stuff, but how to save backup on my hdd ? I tried this and that, but don't understand how... and don't see it written anywhere
