2008-05-14T08:29:00.000Z	grimlock838		I know how it feesl
2008-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	grimlock838		Dose is it working?
2008-05-14T08:32:00.000Z	grimlock838		Did you recently install somehting from outside of synaptic?
2008-05-14T08:32:00.000Z	grimlock838		neuon
2008-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Nope, and this problem has occurred across two installs on the same machine. The other machine I have running Ubuntu isn't affected.
2008-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	 I thought it might be a problem with APIC, but doing 'noapic' on the kernel parameter list doesn't help anything.
2008-05-14T08:34:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Even stranger yet, the LiveCD doesn't behave this way.
2008-05-14T08:34:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Tell me about it. Tried an ubuntu forum post too, and nobody could help.
2008-05-14T08:35:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Both are laptops. One's a MacBook Pro (the one with the issue), and the other is a Sony Vaio.
2008-05-14T08:37:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	any suggestions? :|
2008-05-14T08:37:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Okay.
2008-05-14T08:38:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Dual boot with OS X.
2008-05-14T08:38:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Yep.
2008-05-14T08:39:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	No, it's got Ubuntu only. Windows is just horridly slow on it, so I decided it would be my Linux-only box.
2008-05-14T08:42:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	Hm. Well, I'm pretty certain this is some sort of interrupt conflict, though I haven't been able to figure out how the liveCD handles interrupts any differently than my current install. /proc/interrupts is the same.
2008-05-14T08:43:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	yes.
2008-05-14T08:44:00.000Z	neunon	grimlock838	but it should still interface with the mouse and keyboard the same way.
