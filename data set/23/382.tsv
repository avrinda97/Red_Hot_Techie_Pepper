2011-11-28T20:58:00.000Z	Reikoku		OK, going to ask another awkward question which seems to have no documentation anywhere: how do I remove indicators from the unity-2d panel? It appears that the whitelist method to remove Skype from the panel only worked in 3d...

2011-11-28T21:26:00.000Z	Reikoku	pauluntu	I've asked so many questions in this channel and got little help with them :/ ended up solving most of mine myself as well
2011-11-28T21:26:00.000Z	pauluntu	Reikoku	now i just need to get skype working.  The camera works but when skype starts up the audio is all staticy can't figure that one out
2011-11-28T21:26:00.000Z	Reikoku	pauluntu	No idea, sorry, my Skype seems fine out of the box except that I can't get rid of that vile green icon on unity-2d
