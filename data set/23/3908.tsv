2008-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	aganthorp		can someone tell my how I set xglx as my default xserver?
2008-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	you mean xserver-xgl ? Install it
2008-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	then it would be the default for ati
2008-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	it isn't turning out that way
2008-01-12T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	you trying to get compiz sorted out?
2008-01-12T09:33:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	I am using ati and it obviously isn't using xglx because it isn't in my processes and I am getting a no composite extension error trying to use compiz
2008-01-12T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	uninstall xserver-xgl , restart X , then run  fglrxinfo  .  Make sure it's using ati drivers, not mesa for 3d
2008-01-12T09:36:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	ok going to reboot x I will be back
2008-01-12T09:37:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	my fglrxinfo output is as follows
2008-01-12T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	don't paste
2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	just the last line, that will do
2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	am I doing something wrong?
2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	yeah, pasting here is wrong :)  Just show me the last line, it has the important info
2008-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	you're using feisty, right?
2008-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	correct
2008-01-12T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	for feisty you have to jump through some hoops to get xgl server to run. A sec, I'll run down a link
2008-01-12T09:40:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	thanks, I was running gutsy originally but I downgraded because I had troubles with SLUB
2008-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	I forgot your nick look up. I have suspend working nicely with that link
2008-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	I tried everything I could find on getting it to cooperate with SLUB but I couldn't do it
2008-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	the downside is the aiglx in the new driver isn't quite there, you get some jerky motion occasionally
2008-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	I have only been using linux for two days though
2008-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	aganthorp	nickrud	I am still trying to figure out what the hell I am doing most of the time
2008-01-12T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	aganthorp	I used that howto, and the acpi-support stuff at the bottom of http://blog.vaxius.net/?p=19 . Only the acpi-support stuff from that page
