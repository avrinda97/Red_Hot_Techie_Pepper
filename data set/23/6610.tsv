2007-11-19T08:16:00.000Z	Jangari		i do
2007-11-19T08:16:00.000Z	Jangari		it replaces the retail OS on the ipod, changes the whole file structure, so you can put files on your ipod as an external hard disk and they will be playable
2007-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	Jangari		wouldn't be in the repos,
2007-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	Jangari		you just load the .exe onto the ipod and use a command line installer, should be fine, their instructions are great
2007-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	Jangari		there's also the #rockbox room on this server
2007-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 what feature for an ipod  are you talking about
2007-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	Jangari		rockbox, keegan
2007-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 it sounded intresting what does it go
2007-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	keegan		go=do
2007-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	Jangari		also, fluffman, it's easily removable, it doesn't replace the retail OS, just runs prior to it. you can even hot-swap between OSs
2007-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 on an ipod ?
2007-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	Jangari		ant, is that all? you don't have to load a whole virtual windows system?
2007-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	Jangari		yes keegan
2007-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	Jangari		no, but i warn you, it's a bit buggy,
2007-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 cool thanks ill look it up
2007-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	Jangari		i had to remove it for some reason or other,
2007-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	Jangari		easy remove
2007-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 what if i want my old ipod software back then whats the procedure
2007-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 i guess that answered my question . i thought it delets the ipod os
2007-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	Jangari		ah, the instructions tell you, but when you download, it includes a command line program that you run, and type -u (on windows, that is) for uninstall, and when you unplug the ipod it'll load the normal OS as per usual
2007-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	Jangari		and i think there's a function in rockbox to restart as retailOS
2007-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	Jangari	domor	cd /
2007-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	keegan	Jangari	 thanks
