2007-12-01T00:15:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	the best way to create "restore" points would be packups
2007-12-01T00:16:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	I've also used PuTTY. :)
2007-12-01T00:17:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	OK, are you on the same local network as your server?
2007-12-01T00:20:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	will do
2007-12-01T00:20:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	join me in #ankur-javaJake if you want. It'll be quieter there. :)
2007-12-01T00:22:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	OK, so are you trying to get to another computer elsewhere on the internet, or to a computer in the same LAN as you?
2007-12-01T00:22:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	kind of
2007-12-01T00:25:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	OK, so it isn't your network
2007-12-01T00:26:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	instead you need to configure PuTTY for your proxy.
2007-12-01T00:27:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	yes please
2007-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	nvm
2007-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	PMs won't work if you are registered, btw
2007-12-01T00:35:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	I'm not receiving your questions.
2007-12-01T00:36:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	join #ankur-javaJake
2007-12-01T00:36:00.000Z	javaJake	ankur	it'll eb the same as PMing
