2007-01-16T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	/dev/hda: block special (3/0)
2007-01-16T09:11:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	no
2007-01-16T09:12:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	I have to remind myself that it's a clone of ether-man
2007-02-19T17:49:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	something's wrong with that link
2007-02-19T17:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	You're right, I can't spell my own name. xD
2007-02-19T17:51:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	will this work with Driver "i810" ?
2007-02-19T17:51:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	That's the only thing it works for.
2007-02-19T17:52:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	thanks
2007-02-19T17:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	For what? xD
2007-02-19T17:53:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	I took the liberty to download your script, too :)  ... and I learnt something from your suggestion.
2007-02-19T17:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	You were having resolution problems?
2007-02-19T17:54:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	no, it's just that I've been unable to help mahound
2007-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	it depends wholly on how much interprocess communication you need on your cluster. That, in turn, depends on the type of application you are going to run
2007-02-23T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	Things like compiling, compressing, I guess.
2007-03-05T06:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	Actually, I don't like it. Unregistered users will try to talk to ubotu and be frustrated that he is not replying (since they can't send PMs). Furthermore, having ubotu answer in the channel lets other users see the responses, and they learn things. Furthermore, helpers read ubotu's responses and make mental notes to use factoids to help people in the future.
2007-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	forcefsck sounds illegal.
2007-03-07T06:47:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	'grep forcefsck /etc/init.d/*
2007-03-07T06:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	:O
2007-03-07T06:48:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	did that clear it up?
2007-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	soundray	I was making a joke about how the name sounds like rape xD I wasn't implying it doesn't do anything or that you don't know what you're talking about.
2007-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	soundray	arrenlex	oh all right. It wasn't clear from the line you wrote ;)
