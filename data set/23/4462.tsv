2007-08-06T09:21:00.000Z	SuperAngryFish		Hi, I have recently installed Ubuntu and it gets to a windows style loader screen, then once the bar has got to the end, it goes to a black screen and freezes on the black screen. Any ideas?

2007-08-06T09:27:00.000Z	stefg	SuperAngryFish	you'd need to boot in recovery mode, this will get you to a text-mode interface. you log in, and enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. This lets you reconfigure your video settings. Have the spec's of your CRT ready
