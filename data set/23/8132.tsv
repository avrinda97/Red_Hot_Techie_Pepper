2005-04-07T16:05:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : out of curiosity, which card are you using?
2005-04-07T16:06:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : so, using snd-via82xx?
2005-04-07T16:07:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : "nothing" being...?
2005-04-07T16:09:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : ok, does cat /proc/asound/modules  list anything?
2005-04-07T16:11:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : lsmod|grep ^via82
2005-04-07T16:12:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : ok, good.
2005-04-07T16:12:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : and you're using Hoary, correct?
2005-04-07T16:13:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : hum!  Have you tried the 'alsa-source' package in universe?
2005-04-07T16:15:00.000Z	crimsun		[nrx_] : which package, alsa-driver? alsa-lib? all?
2005-04-07T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun		jessica_: if you could paste that /var/log/kernel.log.0 on http://pastebin.ca, that would help
2005-04-07T16:17:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	ok
2005-04-07T16:28:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	so you're using Warty?
2005-04-07T16:28:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	is there any way she can dist-upgrade to Hoary?  It has a much newer kernel.
2005-04-07T16:29:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	No, I was. I dist-upgraded to hoary. Kernel 2.6.10-5-386. But it's not stable here. So I used the warty-kernel 2.6.8.1, which worked, but of course missed hoary-features
2005-04-07T16:29:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	I could install hoary-preview as well, but i don't think it will solve the problem
2005-04-07T16:31:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	how is 2.6.10-5-386 unstable for her?
2005-04-07T16:32:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	Seveas is honestly attempting to assist
2005-04-07T16:32:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	Ok, I know, and i appreciate that - really. But I think it's good to address this problem, not bypassing it, see? :)
2005-04-07T16:33:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	sometimes the system spontaneously hangs, or starts getting incredibly inresponsive. I saw dpkg segfaulting, that sort of stuff
2005-04-07T16:34:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	ok, and those times when it is extremely unresponsive or freezes, are there corresponding OOPSes listed in dmesg?
2005-04-07T16:35:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	Yes, that's what it looks like
2005-04-07T16:37:00.000Z	crimsun	jessica_	either will work
2005-04-07T10:02:00.000Z	jessica_	crimsun	Seveas, and others: I have been testing my computers memory. memtest86 did 4 passes without errors, so I interrupted it (should I have waited more passes?). I also followed the advice to upgrade kernel, and installed 2.6.11-1-686. Then, when logging in to gnome, I got a kernel panic (I saw it by quickly switching back to tty1 when trying for the 3rd time). I don't know if this kernel panic is related to the Oopses with 2.6.10-3 to 2
