2006-01-08T06:35:00.000Z	Seicherl		hi there! How good is ubuntu/linux in read-writing NTFS systems?
2006-01-08T06:36:00.000Z	Seicherl		ok, so i will need a FAT-Partition, when running stupid win AND ubuntu on one machine
2006-01-08T06:37:00.000Z	Seicherl		ok, i thought so. just think asking is for free ;)
2006-01-08T06:37:00.000Z	Seicherl		??
2006-01-08T06:39:00.000Z	Seicherl		I think i'll stay old-school like and use a fat swap partition
2006-01-08T06:39:00.000Z	Seicherl		secure concerning what?
2006-01-08T06:40:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	permissions and the like, but if you're the only user, that's moot anyway
2006-01-08T06:40:00.000Z	Seicherl	Hendikins	yes i am.
2006-01-08T06:41:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	Well, if you're the only user, anything else is adding needless complexity to the situation.
2006-01-08T06:41:00.000Z	Seicherl		ok, another one: when installing ubuntu, a friend told me, i can shrink my ntfs-partition easily. that true?
2006-01-08T06:41:00.000Z	Seicherl		how easy is easy
2006-01-08T06:41:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	I know that Linux installers can shrink NTFS, but I suggest defragging the NTFS volume first
2006-01-08T06:42:00.000Z	Seicherl	Hendikins	thats what i'm doing right now
2006-01-08T06:42:00.000Z	Seicherl		anybody running ubuntu on a thinkpad?
2006-01-08T06:43:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	Do you have specific questions about using Ubuntu on thinkpads?
2006-01-08T06:43:00.000Z	Seicherl	Hendikins	not now, but i will soon ;)
2006-01-08T06:44:00.000Z	Seicherl	Hendikins	I found some howtos for debian, but not yet for ubuntu
2006-01-08T06:44:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	Checked the Ubuntu wiki?
2006-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	Seicherl		not yet. can you hand me the url?
2006-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	Seicherl		thx
2006-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	Hendikins	Seicherl	The Ubuntu wiki is located at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
2006-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	Seicherl		I got only a bit of debian experience. will i be able to handle ubuntu?
2006-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	Seicherl	Hendikins	thx for that!
