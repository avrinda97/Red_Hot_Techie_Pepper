2011-06-23T12:40:00.000Z	sammmy		Where should I install my applications?
2011-06-23T12:42:00.000Z	sammmy		ectospasmn: wanted to see if it came with Myriad Pro
2011-06-23T12:43:00.000Z	sammmy		So where should I specify to install the application, the terminal is asking me. :P
2011-06-23T12:44:00.000Z	sammmy		Where are all applications installed on ubuntu?
2011-06-23T12:45:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	/opt
2011-06-23T12:46:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	copy the source folder to /opt
2011-06-23T12:47:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	and ln -s the executable to /usr/bin
2011-06-23T12:47:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	and try running it from Alt-F2
2011-06-23T12:47:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	open terminal, Ctrl-Alt-T
2011-06-23T12:48:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	then you copy the folder of the source to /opt with: sudo cp -r /path/to/source/ /opt
2011-06-23T12:49:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	then you make a link (shortcut in Windows) of the executable to /usr/bin, where you save all your executables with: sudo ln -s /opt/path/to/source/executable.bin /usr/bin/executable
2011-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	when you are prompted for password, enter them, and if all the commands succeeded without further prompts you are ready to run executable by Alt-F2, type in executable
2011-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	remember change /path/to/source to path of the Adobe reader source
2011-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	and change executable with adobe reader's bin file.
2011-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	sammmy	asdjaputra	I'm sorry, I'm getting really lost. :S
2011-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	sammmy	asdjaputra	all I have is a .bin file.
2011-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	then copy the .bin file to /usr/local/bin
2011-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	sammmy	asdjaputra	ln -s the executable, what executable?
2011-06-23T12:52:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	yes, it's an executable file
2011-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	anyways, why don't you just install it from Software Center
2011-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	here's how http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/04/how-to-install-adobe-reader-acroread-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal/
2011-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	sometimes
2011-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	asdjaputra	sammmy	i don't really like to use it though, it hangs all the time
