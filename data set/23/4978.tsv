2007-10-07T12:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908		can i find a system on a network by it's hostname?
2007-10-07T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	  windows can do it that way because itsusing the samba machine names. :) not sure of a way to do it eaially under linux. Other then using some samba browsers
2007-10-07T12:33:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	i want to use rsync to copy some files (rsync uses ssh) and the one computer has a dynamic ip
2007-10-07T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 this is one reason i always set up my machines with static ip's  and edit the hosts file.
2007-10-07T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 its possible the dhcp server will assign that machine the same ip time and time again.
2007-10-07T12:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	nope
2007-10-07T12:35:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	can i have a script or something link the hostnames with the macs?
2007-10-07T12:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 the issue is how to you get their hostname? You can get an Ip list of up machines with nmap easially enough.
2007-10-07T12:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	get the macs and ips, find a mac, and set the host file
2007-10-07T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 set it to what host? :)  what if 2 machines switched ips .
2007-10-07T12:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	macs don't change
2007-10-07T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 there ya go then. go for it..  No idea how ya get a list of macs actually. :) i just use nmap to get ip's up.
2007-11-08T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 ssh -X remote.ip, then run the app 'should' work
2007-11-08T09:41:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	said it failed.
2007-11-08T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	  You could always resort to vnc.  it may be the remote box has X forwarding disabled.
2008-01-02T23:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 ls -l  filename
2008-01-02T23:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	what about for stuff like creation time etc?
2008-01-02T23:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 never noticed, or needed those. check the man pages for ls perhaps it has options
2008-01-02T23:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	so basicly use ls?
2008-01-02T23:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 whats the date for the files that ls -l is showing then?
2008-01-02T23:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 -rw-r--r-- 1 willis willis 0 2008-01-02 13:32 testfile
2008-01-08T09:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Dr_willis	GameCube Sucks.
2008-01-08T09:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Ashfire908	 people who say things suck.. really suck. :)
