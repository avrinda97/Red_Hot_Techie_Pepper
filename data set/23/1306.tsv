2010-06-04T14:03:00.000Z	TommyH		What's the difference between the DVD release and a CD release?
2010-06-04T14:04:00.000Z	TommyH		Oh, if i'm new to linux would you suggest getting the dvd?
2010-06-04T14:05:00.000Z	TommyH		what's the package manager?

2010-06-04T14:05:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	No need of getting DVD. Download CD iso from ubuntu. Or ask for free dilevery w/o shipping charge for CD
2010-06-04T14:27:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	its a linux distro equipped in ASUS EEEPC 1201T
2010-06-04T14:27:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 I have it on my Vaio, but when i install Ubuntu, I lose my splashtop
2010-06-04T14:28:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Yes, its embedded in a way that you can only use that one alone.  =If you want to use anot\her duistro, it will get erased
2010-06-04T14:29:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	What?
2010-06-04T14:33:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	No not till now. You need ubuntu for netbooks?
2010-06-04T14:33:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 I have a laptop, its a Vaio core i3 blah blah blah, I just like the option of splashtop when I'm on the go and I dont wan't to lose the feature
2010-06-04T14:34:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Hard luck! Splashtop is not that advanced, its a very low memory short embed. Not possible
2010-06-04T14:35:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Hard luck! Splashtop is not that advanced, its a very low memory short embed. Not possible if you install other OS apart from from given
2010-06-04T14:35:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 ahh i see! thanks!
2010-06-04T14:37:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	You don't seem to be satisfied. Kindly read Limitaions from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashtop
2010-06-04T14:39:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 hmmm!  that seems interesting, I guess I'm still confused, why do I lose splashtop when I install Ubuntu if it's built into motherboard flash?
2010-06-04T14:40:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	What do you mean by motherboard flash? The answer is this..
2010-06-04T14:42:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 well based on the link you sent me, they said most boards have an embedded 512 mb flash memory that stores the operating system, meaning if i take out the hard drive it should still boot splashtop
2010-06-04T14:42:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Splashtop is not very flexible yet and is not like any other OS. Its like Google chrome OS. And its not like it is part of motherboard. That's a;; i can say now
2010-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Does splashtop boot if you remove HDD?
2010-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	TommyH	ubulucid	 you know I dont really know, because it's a laptop and i dont want to take out the hard drive and mess with it
2010-06-04T14:44:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Sorry i am going wrong with Splashtop. Hold on a second
2010-06-04T14:50:00.000Z	ubulucid	TommyH	Splashtop shouldn't interfere installation of another OS. It is strictly read-only, and if you install other OS, you should have dual boot option. Moreover, its complex since the Splashtop is in motherbord and user Os is in HDD. So, it may or may not reflect Splashtop. But again if the Splashtop is geeting erased, you need to check the hardware since its not serving the advantage of Splashtop then :)
