2009-01-06T08:41:00.000Z	GringoChapin	Dante123	in other words, letters greater than f?
2009-01-06T08:42:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	the key is basically something LIKE this:  #EDC4rfv5tgbn
2009-01-06T08:42:00.000Z	Dante123		But that is not the key- just similar
2009-01-06T08:42:00.000Z	Dante123		the first four digits are capitals
2009-01-06T08:43:00.000Z	GringoChapin		dante123: well, if you have r's and t's in there, then you are right.  It's definitly not hex.
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	I have many letters past f.  Personally I dont think the key is hex....therefore leaving the # sign out is pointless
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	Dante123		He wouldnt have told me to include it if it was HEX
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	GringoChapin		It could still be ascii, and leaving the number out might still work.
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	GringoChapin		It's worth a try at least.
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	Dante123		I dont understand about shared key though.  And I also wonder if part of the problem is network manager.  Maybe I should be tryin
2009-01-06T08:44:00.000Z	Dante123		something else
2009-01-06T08:47:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	does ascii key have to have no numbers in it?
2009-01-06T08:55:00.000Z	Dante123		if you switch to wicd do you have to uninstall network mangler
2009-01-06T08:59:00.000Z	GringoChapin	Dante123	Sorry, I'm back now. Had to help the wife put the kids to bed. :)
2009-01-06T09:01:00.000Z	GringoChapin		Ascii keys can have all letters (both lower and upper case), numbers, and I think _ and - or something like that.
2009-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	I am starting to think this is a network MANGLER thing from reading bug reports and googling the problem.  I notice others having lots of problems ith 128 WEP shared encryption in hardy and intrepid
2009-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	Dante123		I'm going to install wicd and see what happens
2009-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	GringoChapin		dante123: That is possible.  The only other guess I would have is a transcription error.  Also, now that I think about it more, I doubt it is an ascii key, as for 128 bits, I think it should be 22 characters long.
2009-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	I think it is a passphrase
2009-01-06T09:07:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	I tried installiong wicd but it doesnt show up in synaptic any suggestions
2009-01-06T09:07:00.000Z	GringoChapin	Dante123	It's certainly possible.  Anyway, good luck.
2009-01-06T09:09:00.000Z	GringoChapin		dante123: I don't know much about Ubuntu, as I'm a farely new user, however perhaps someone else in the channel knows.  Have you tried enabling the universe and multivers package repos in synaptic?
2009-01-06T09:11:00.000Z	Dante123	GringoChapin	will try again
