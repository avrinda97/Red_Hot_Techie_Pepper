2007-10-22T23:02:00.000Z	DreamThief		anyone here may help me solving a few problems I ran in with my "new" audigy 4 pro?
2007-10-22T23:03:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Just state your problem.  Depending on what it is, someone may answer or direct you to another channel for support.
2007-10-22T23:05:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	my "new" audigy 4 pro produces crackling noise with my external 5.1 speakers connected to the main sound card - the headphones connected to the external I/O hub are working flawlessly ...
2007-10-22T23:05:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Is your I/O hub connected to the audigy, or another on-board sound card?
2007-10-22T23:06:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	the I/O hub is connected to the audigy card
2007-10-22T23:06:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Is this PCI or PCI express?
2007-10-22T23:07:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Does the crackling occur with all output, or just certain (AAC, for example) output?
2007-10-22T23:07:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Also, does crackling occur when no sound is playing?
2007-10-22T23:08:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	this is the card we are talking about http://tinyurl.com/8hx88
2007-10-22T23:08:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	the noise does only occure when some kind of sound is played
2007-10-22T23:09:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Have you tried adjusting the mixer?  (alsa-mixer)
2007-10-22T23:09:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	i already changed the pci slot, i reinstalled all alsa related stuff, i deleted my .asoundrc und generated it new with asoundconf ...
2007-10-22T23:09:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	yes, of course
2007-10-22T23:09:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Is there an onboard sound card too?  If so, try disabling its kernel driver.
2007-10-22T23:10:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	no, onboard sound is disabled
2007-10-22T23:10:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Is this an Ubuntu-specific or Linux-specific problem?
2007-10-22T23:12:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Which kernel driver handles the audigy 4?  (lsmod | grep snd)
2007-10-22T23:13:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	that's the point I want to find out. the problem is, that only few people own such a highend audigy card and therefor the number of people to ask is very limited. I'm also in discussion with some guys from the alsa project do determine if it's probably an alsa bug
2007-10-22T23:13:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	It's almost certarinly a problem in alsa.  Have you tried the latest svn code for alsa?  (You should be able to compile it for the 2.6.22 kernel)
2007-10-22T23:14:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	I'm still using feisty. I didn't have the time to run a dist-upgrade yet
2007-10-22T23:15:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	You should check in the latest kernel.  (Use a livecd)
2007-10-22T23:15:00.000Z	zzxc	DreamThief	Alsa bugs are fixed all the time, especially for new cards.
2007-10-22T23:16:00.000Z	DreamThief	zzxc	thanks for the hint
