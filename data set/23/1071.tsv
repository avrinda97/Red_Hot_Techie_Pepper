2010-09-17T20:20:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	what's the issue?
2010-09-17T20:20:00.000Z	CoSmO		Nul:  It's a wierd issue.  I have a P8400 CPU, rated at 2.26Ghz.  For some reason the scalling is setting it at 8Ghz.  I am not sure how to get this corrected
2010-09-17T20:20:00.000Z	nul		it's not going to 8ghz, CoSmO
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		It might slow it down
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		but not 8ghz.
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		haha
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		it would go down to 1.8 maybe ;)
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	CoSmO	nul	 All indications are pointing to it going that high.  I have used quite a few programs and all of them, even CPUINFO in teh /proc shows 8Ghz..
2010-09-17T20:22:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	well congratulations you have the fastest laptop processor ever built.. or its being dumb ;)
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	CoSmO	nul	 it's not a laptop.  It's a unit we build as a company, this problem is occuring with the P8400 and T9400 CPU's only.  I tried a T3100 and it works fine, no scaling as no speedstep support.  BIOS has no Speedstep options in there, so nothing to enable or disable.  I have taken our the C1E step as well, no change
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	it's not 8ghz dude
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul		is it quad core?
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	CoSmO	nul	 Core 2 Duo's
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul		well, its not 8ghz.. thas not scaling
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		its 2.26 x 2, which isnt really even 4ghz
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		does it have HT?
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		that would explain teh 8ghz
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		the*
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		"4 cores x 2.26 obviously means 8ghz"
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		hehe
2010-09-17T20:26:00.000Z	CoSmO	nul	 This is my reading from the scaling options in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available-freq:  8410000 8000000 6400000 4800000 3200000 1600000  and when in performance mode it's at 8410Mhz    no HT on these CPU's
2010-09-17T20:28:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	anyway dude I don't really care, it's not running at 8ghz even if ti says so
2010-09-17T20:30:00.000Z	CoSmO	nul	 The umtimate problem is that the system is constantly locking up when it goes into the performance mode.  If it runs without it, at the 1600Mhz there is no problem.  Only when it jumps up higher.  I am not so much concerned with what it says it's running at, I have operational issues.  Is there any way to disable speedstep within the ubuntu OS?
