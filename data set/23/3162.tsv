2008-07-08T11:53:00.000Z	jamus		how do i erase dir using root console?
2008-07-08T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	which dir?
2008-07-28T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	Just remove the old kernels through your favorite package manager
2008-09-20T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	No, setting a root password is a bad idea.
2008-09-20T10:22:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 well i guessed that by restricting acceses  u sould help such issues but its just commun sense and no tech knowhow
2008-09-20T10:22:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 now that u point it it is a lame idea -- uups
2008-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	You can still fix it.  You have an account that can sudo, right?
2008-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 yeap
2008-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	sudo passwd -l root
2008-09-20T10:26:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 it says pass changed but when invuked su it fails authentication
2008-09-20T10:26:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	You locked your root account, so that's true.  Don't use su.
2008-09-20T10:27:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 is there any way to get root acces in order to perform ops that need that ?
2008-09-20T10:28:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	You'd use sudo.  You shouldn't need anything else.
2008-09-20T10:29:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 i tryed to sudo aptitude upgrade and needed superuser account
2008-09-20T10:29:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	Yes, you used sudo.
2008-09-20T10:32:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	 it invokes dpkg and when i dp iit says dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege
2008-09-20T10:32:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	When you did "sudo aptitude upgrade"?
2008-09-20T10:34:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	just now i tried to fix bad kernel update 9nvidia card messed up bad)
2008-09-20T10:34:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	i didnt log on for some while so i forgot my super hard and complex pass for root :S
2008-09-20T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	You don't need to know your root password.  Just your user password.
2008-09-20T10:37:00.000Z	jamus	Flannel	ok  i think i can figure it out using forums and stuff but it became an issue on its own -- can i retrieve my root pass any how?
2008-09-20T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	No.  passwords aren't recoverable, only resettable.  But again, you shouldn't have a root password.  Lock your root account.
2008-09-20T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	jamus	You shouldn't ever have been asked for root access.  Ubuntu does not use the root login at all.
