2009-06-24T00:15:00.000Z	ThunderWolf		I just installed ubuntu 8.04 LTS server edition on a machine i have at home, it has a network card but i dont have a eth0 interface. Whats going one?
2009-06-24T00:15:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	lspci
2009-06-24T00:16:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	that card might not be supported without some additional drivers.  What kind of system is it on.  Model number and such.
2009-06-24T00:16:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	its found
2009-06-24T00:21:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	it is found?  but doesn't give a eth0?
2009-06-24T00:22:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	ifconfig -a
2009-06-24T00:22:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	it shows eth0 ! O_o
2009-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	unkmar		does it give an IP with it?
2009-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	does it give an IP with it?
2009-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	nope
2009-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	ifconfig eth0 auto
2009-06-24T00:24:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	you would normally set a static IP for a server.
2009-06-24T00:24:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	it says Host name lookup failure
2009-06-24T00:24:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	you wouldn't want it wandering around when you are trying to find it.
2009-06-24T00:25:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	so what should i do?
2009-06-24T00:28:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	I ponder what Host name lookup failure means.
2009-06-24T00:29:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
2009-06-24T00:29:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	that is not a command.  but a request to see that file.
2009-06-24T00:31:00.000Z	unkmar		PCI vid cards are handy for multiple monitor support.  As in support beyond 2 screens.
2009-06-24T00:31:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	I am curious if the file is set to auto config or static IP.
2009-06-24T00:32:00.000Z	ThunderWolf	unkmar	i think auto config
2009-06-24T00:33:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	Mine is auto and states: auto eth0 (newline) iface eth0 inet dhcp
2009-06-24T00:39:00.000Z	unkmar	ThunderWolf	unkmar leaves for now.  Sorry I didn't have more time to help you with your network problem.
