2009-05-19T17:00:00.000Z	cratel		is there a way to get Gnome to automatically mount an ssh/scp server on session startup? I want to automate the "connected to server..." workflow
2009-05-19T17:00:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	yes create a script that does the mount and run the script on startup
2009-05-19T17:00:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	the only way I know how to do that is sshfs, which is very buggy. I want Gnome to do the mount. So what would be in a script for that?
2009-05-19T17:01:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	how can you mount an ssh server without using sshfs?
2009-05-19T17:01:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	in Gnome: places -> connect to server...
2009-05-19T17:02:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	no it doesn't. I didn't even have sshfs installed and that works. Gnome does some sort of linking in a directory called .gvfs I think.
2009-05-19T17:03:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	this is actually peaking my interest
2009-05-19T17:04:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	well FWIW I've had lots of troubles with machine lockups etc. with sshfs and never a problem with mounting through Gnome.
2009-05-19T17:08:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	one thing you can do is run: nautilus sftp://<server_name or ip>
2009-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	it looks like gnome connects over sftp
2009-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	yes, it connects over sftp
2009-05-19T17:15:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	I don't think there is a way to automount an sftp server
2009-05-19T17:16:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	you can however set on of the folders on the sftp server as a favorite in gnome this doesn't mount it for terminal use
2009-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	you mean bookmark it?
2009-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	yes
2009-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	yeah I was hoping to have it automount for an automated snapshot/backup program like timevault or flyback. It looks like I'll abandon those for rsync.
2009-05-19T17:19:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	rsync is probably the best bet
2009-05-19T17:19:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	be careful with the --delete command, I wiped out an entire svn repo with a missing / and --delete once
2009-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	ok. Thanks for the warning. I wish we had something like Apple's time machine.
2009-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	try unison its a GTK front end to rsync
2009-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	its also in the repos
2009-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	cratel	cambridgecow	will do. I also found grsync, also a front end.
2009-05-19T17:21:00.000Z	cambridgecow	cratel	good luck!
