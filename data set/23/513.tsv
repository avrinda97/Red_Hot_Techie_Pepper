2011-07-11T21:54:00.000Z	eugenix		please
2011-07-11T21:56:00.000Z	eugenix		ubottu:ok thanks
2011-07-11T21:57:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	you are saying that every time you sleep or hibernate the computer wakes itself up again immediately?
2011-07-11T21:58:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	can we narrow it down a little, ? are you issuing  a hibernate command to the computer?
2011-07-11T22:01:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	answer here please? :-)
2011-07-11T22:02:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	thats OK, using the GUI is still issuing commands.  What did you select on the GUI?
2011-07-11T22:04:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	ok, that sounds like the login screen, (xdmctl? GDM? )    is that button on te screen where you enter your username and password?
2011-07-11T22:06:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	so this button shows up after you have logged in?
2011-07-11T22:07:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	OK I'llassume you said yes. Where on the desktop screen is the button located?
2011-07-11T22:08:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	are you using gnome or KDE?
2011-07-11T22:10:00.000Z	eugenix	cluMor_or_less	i'm using gnome
2011-07-11T22:11:00.000Z	eugenix	cluMor_or_less	the exact version is 2.30
2011-07-11T22:11:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	OK, thats as far as i can go. I use KDE and i can't remember the structure of th gnome menus.  Here is what we have so far:  After logging in and selecting "hibernate" from the button on the panel, your screen darkens but the computer resumes immediately up and never goes to sleep/hibernate? Is this correct?
2011-07-11T22:12:00.000Z	eugenix	cluMor_or_less	exactly
2011-07-11T22:12:00.000Z	eugenix	cluMor_or_less	yes
2011-07-11T22:14:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	by the way, did you check the log files for any messages regarding hibernation?
2011-07-11T22:16:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	do you know the directory where the log filea are kept?
2011-07-11T22:18:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	see my last ^^ up there
2011-07-11T22:20:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	in that dir you named, go poke around.  (Means look at all the stuff/files in there)
2011-07-11T22:21:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	I suggest looking at files named messages, any file with acpi in the name, or power in the name, or dmesg
2011-07-11T22:22:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	ok, are you running any bluetooth devices?
2011-07-11T22:23:00.000Z	cluMor_or_less	eugenix	ok, is youe machine running programs that act as connectors, or managers for bluetooth devices?
