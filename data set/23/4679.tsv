2008-02-18T14:48:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	try using the address bar in nautilus, use "smb://0.0.0.0" replace the zeros with your Windows machine IP
2008-02-18T14:49:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	its says error message...
2008-02-18T14:49:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	what error?
2008-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	¨smb://192.168.1.17¨ is not valid location
2008-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	 don't use the quotes
2008-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	without ""
2008-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	yes I didn´t use the quote.
2008-02-18T14:51:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	can you ping your Windows machine?
2008-02-18T14:52:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	yes I can... from windows, I can access feisty sharing folder.
2008-02-18T14:53:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	yes I can ping the windows machine...
2008-02-18T14:54:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	what did you write in the address bar exactly? and did you used feisty to enter windows shares before?
2008-02-18T14:55:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	I write smb://192.168.1.17. And I just reinstall my feisty machine.
2008-02-18T14:56:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	this happens to me sometimes, it is strange, but when I restart it goes normal
2008-02-18T14:58:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	hmmm it seems I didn´t restart my system yet... Ok, I´ll try to restart first, and lets see if its work... I´ll be back :D thanks.
2008-02-18T15:05:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	Unfortunately. It still not working after I restart my feisty server.
2008-02-18T15:06:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	I've run out of ideas :(
2008-02-18T15:06:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	is there something that I should install ?
2008-02-18T15:07:00.000Z	verb3k	msdtux	I hope I can help but....
2008-02-18T15:08:00.000Z	msdtux	verb3k	well ok then... thanks for your suggest anyway... :)
