2010-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	spydee32		trying to install ubuntu on a windows machine. but i don't see automatic partitioning. I want to dual boot, how do I do this without advance partioning option
2010-07-21T08:01:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	try wubi, that'll do the dual boot, no re-partitioning
2010-07-21T08:02:00.000Z	tonysan		I have a problem on synaptic "touchpad" utility (not the package manager)
2010-07-21T08:02:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	any downside for using wubi?
2010-07-21T08:03:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	AFAIK I can't enable grub2 splash screen and change its resolution
2010-07-21T08:04:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	only dual boot, no more OSs with wubi, so if you're trying to do 3-boot later, it will not be an easy task
2010-07-21T08:05:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	If your NTFS dies, your ubuntu dies too
2010-07-21T08:05:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	thanks, but i wonder why the installer won't give me the easy partition option, the graphical partitioning
2010-07-21T08:06:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	wubi makes your installation to a file inside NTFS
2010-07-21T08:06:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	ah yes, i meant when i tried to install through my thumb drive
2010-07-21T08:07:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	there's no partition work for wubi, it's just 1-click install
2010-07-21T08:07:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	ah, i'm trying to say that before wubi i tried to install traditionally by booting up from thumb drive/cd and creating a dualboot
2010-07-21T08:08:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	if you have access to paritition resizing tools, make a room and install
2010-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	however grub will take over the Original Windows Bootloader
2010-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	the second thing i did was use windows 7 to create an unallocated partition, and tried to install it on this but still having only 2 options: erase entire disk or advanced partitioning
2010-07-21T08:11:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	is your unallocated partition inside a virtual partition?
2010-07-21T08:11:00.000Z	tonysan		I forgot what the other paritition is called...
2010-07-21T08:12:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	i just shrunk my windows 7 partition and this resulted in an unallocated partition
2010-07-21T08:12:00.000Z	tonysan		/s/virtual/Extended
2010-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	tonysan	spydee32	I have no idea sorry
2010-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	i think the problem with the installer not showing automatic partioning is because its an hp computer that came with 3 other "recovery partitions"
2010-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	thanks though ill keep trying
2010-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	spydee32	tonysan	in case youre wondering i figured a solution: im using gparted to shrink instead of windows 7, this way gparted can partition into an ext4 instead of "unallocated" and the installer sees this as a free space i can install onto without me needing to mess with partition tables
