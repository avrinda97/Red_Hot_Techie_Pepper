2005-10-20T14:55:00.000Z	Dulak		X will not run as a normal user, only root, permissions all look good, the log gives me nothing
2005-10-20T14:56:00.000Z	Dulak		I did a minimal server install of breezy and installed Xorg and Xfce4, but X will only run as root
2005-10-20T14:57:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	did you install both x-window-system-core and xubuntu-desktop?
2005-10-20T14:58:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	xubuntu-desktop wants gnome or kde
2005-10-20T14:59:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	are you sure?
2005-10-20T14:59:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	I'm trying right now
2005-10-20T15:01:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	yeah ubuntu-desktop wants all the gnome libs and stuff, like 280M of d/l
2005-10-20T15:02:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	not ubuntu-desktop -- xubuntu-desktop
2005-10-20T15:03:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	I installed x-winows-system-core
2005-10-20T15:03:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	it's funny because I get the X hash background and black x cursor then it just dies and nothing in the logs
2005-10-20T15:03:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	what about xubuntu-desktop?
2005-10-20T15:04:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	installing that now
2005-10-20T15:31:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	I installed all the packages you said but I still can't load X as a normal user
2005-10-20T15:31:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	what about graphical login?
2005-10-20T15:32:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	I installed wdm, it loads but no matter what session I try to run it just dumps back to the login manager
2005-10-20T15:33:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	startx as root works perfectly and puts me in xfce4
2005-10-20T15:34:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	xdm won't start at all
2005-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	try gdm
2005-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	gnome libs
2005-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	it wants a lot of them
2005-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	trying for a minimal system, I'll figure it out, thanks for the ideas so far though
2005-10-20T15:44:00.000Z	sn9	Dulak	process is the same as for debian, but the pkg names have "linux" instead of "kernel"
2005-10-21T16:31:00.000Z	Dulak	sn9	it was the ~/.ICEauthority file
