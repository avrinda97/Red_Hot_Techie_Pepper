2006-10-18T15:23:00.000Z	progek		Hello all, everytime I start my computer I need to-> sudo killall nautilus     in order to get my desktop working right. Will I basically need to include this line in my startup or is their a more elegant way?
2006-10-18T15:23:00.000Z	variant	progek	odd..
2006-10-18T15:23:00.000Z	variant	progek	your using dapper, upto date ?
2006-10-18T15:32:00.000Z	variant	progek	probably xgl is the problem
2006-10-18T15:33:00.000Z	progek	variant	Thanks, but I'm running an Athlon64 3700+ with a 3d capable nvidia card. I have direct rendering on and can play opengl games fine. It's just these examples from nehe. The example was like a spinning small block
2006-10-18T15:33:00.000Z	variant	progek	what is nehe
2006-10-18T15:34:00.000Z	variant	progek	xgl can still be the problem, it really doesnt matter how good your hardware is with xgl as it can interfere in very unexpected ways being alpha software
2006-10-18T15:35:00.000Z	variant	progek	and you use proprietry drivers from nvidia which is annother spanner in the works.. very hard to troubleshoot that kind of problem and not much to do to fix it if you find the problem
2006-10-18T15:39:00.000Z	progek	variant	sorry I got d/c. Did you get my last post?
2006-10-18T15:39:00.000Z	variant	progek	no, please repeat
2006-10-18T10:11:00.000Z	variant	progek	there are plugins to do that
2006-10-18T10:11:00.000Z	variant	progek	no, xgl is an xserver..
2006-10-18T10:11:00.000Z	variant	progek	that wont run on windows
2006-10-18T10:12:00.000Z	variant	progek	and bsd/solaris if they have the will power to make it work
2006-10-18T10:12:00.000Z	variant	progek	but not windows users, no
2006-10-18T10:18:00.000Z	variant	progek	xgl is very alpha software.. dont expect it to work flawlessly. you can use xgame to get round that issue though
2007-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	variant	progek	useradd -m -G addgroupshere usernamehere
2007-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	variant	progek	then passwd username
2007-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	progek	variant	thanks for that
2007-04-18T11:01:00.000Z	variant	progek	useradd -m -G users,admin username
2007-04-18T11:01:00.000Z	variant	progek	with sudo infront
2007-04-18T11:01:00.000Z	variant	progek	then passwd username
2007-04-18T11:01:00.000Z	variant	progek	to set a password for the user
