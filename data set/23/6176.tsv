2006-06-03T14:18:00.000Z	donfilipo		halo anyone got ati radeon 8500 to 9500 running on Dapper????
2006-06-03T14:18:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	I think I have 8700
2006-06-03T14:19:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	and does it work properly?
2006-06-03T14:19:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	nm. I have 9600
2006-06-03T14:19:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	but it's working.
2006-06-03T14:20:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	3d acceleration with fglrx drivers...works?
2006-06-03T14:22:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	seems too. The GL screensavers work pretty well.
2006-06-03T14:23:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	maybe you have ati open source driver which works fine for me on debian sarge...you will see which driver you have if you type glxinfo in konzole
2006-06-03T14:24:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	one sec.
2006-06-03T14:27:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	after you type glxinfo and you see any Mesa driver you will know you have ati open source driver which is fine but supposed to be slower than fglrx and can be problem with cedega and GLX desktop
2006-06-03T14:28:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	...mhm XGL desktop sorry
2006-06-03T14:37:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	glxinfo gives me a whole bunch of stuff.
2006-06-03T14:38:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	any word Mesa on the driver section
2006-06-03T14:43:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	hmmm.. *cratching his head* I think using some ubuntu guide in the wiki
2006-06-03T14:39:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	glxinfo | grep Mesa returned nothing.
2006-06-03T14:40:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	so you have probably the right driver it would say radeon 9600 on fglrxinfo
2006-06-03T14:41:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	and you remeber how you installed the fglrx drivers?
2006-06-03T14:41:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	says 9700. now that I think about it, it should be 9700.
2006-06-03T14:41:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	sorry to miss inform.
2006-06-03T14:42:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	do you remeber how you installed the fglrx drivers?
2006-06-03T14:43:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	I think you add some mutliverse to the repos and apt-get something.
2006-06-03T14:44:00.000Z	donfilipo	luli	ok thanks i know that one but it does not work for me thanks anyway
2006-06-03T14:44:00.000Z	luli	donfilipo	sorry.
