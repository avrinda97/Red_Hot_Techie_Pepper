2010-03-03T07:51:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	I think your disk is bad.
2010-03-03T07:51:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	you can try factory-erasing it (use Hiren's boot CD).
2010-03-03T07:52:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	before doing that check if you have some problem on another OS or distro
2010-03-03T07:53:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	it already has windows? so the disk is not broken :D
2010-03-03T07:54:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	I think that you have some trouble on detected disk geometry. When does gparted throw that error?
2010-03-03T07:57:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	main menu?
2010-03-03T07:57:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	yes i am running it a a live CD.
2010-03-03T07:57:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	so you can't boot the live-cd?
2010-03-03T07:58:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	The disk makes a menu pop up and i tell it which option to run
2010-03-03T07:58:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	No, i can boot it, it's just that after i choose and option and it trys to load
2010-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	can you choose the option to run ubuntu without making changes?
2010-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	i have 2 discs, one with ubuntu 9.10 and another with GParted on it. I am getting errors with GParted disc
2010-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	I have not tried the Ubuntu disc
2010-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	you can run gparted from the ubuntu CD :)
2010-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	K, can you run me through the setup while i am doing it? You know, help me as we go.
2010-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	start the live enviroment with the run without making changes option and go to System -> Administration -> Gparted Partiiton Editor
2010-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	now I have to go, it's late, but you can ask anyone in the channel :)
2010-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	Nitsuga	eric_3	good luck !
2010-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	eric_3	Nitsuga	 Thanks
