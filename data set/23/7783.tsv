2005-04-27T15:10:00.000Z	hua		I like netinstall,  can Ubuntu do it.
2005-04-27T15:12:00.000Z	daven	hua	https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/GettingUbuntu talks about installing over a network, is that any help?
2005-04-27T15:12:00.000Z	daven	hua	about the 5th link down - NetBootInstallHowTo
2005-04-27T15:13:00.000Z	daven	hua	it doesn't look as easy as installing from an iso, tho!
2005-04-27T15:20:00.000Z	daven	hua	the netboot install looks more complicated than just putting in the iso and rebooting :)
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	daven	hua	because as far as i can see you have to have a linux of some kind installed already
2005-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	hua	daven	I have install linux many times, I have ADSL,so I like install via it.
2005-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	daven	hua	it might be just the thing for you then! i've not tried it :)
2005-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	hua	daven	I like it because I don't have an disk of ubuntu. I install it from win98 with an iso, but I don't like win98. I have install sarge via two floppies-it is very cool.
2005-04-27T15:27:00.000Z	daven	hua	yes i've done quite a few debian netinstalls - better than downloading 7 or so CDs!  because ubuntu is only 1 CD, i've not been so bothered
2005-04-27T15:31:00.000Z	hua	daven	I want to order a cd of Ubuntu, but I feel it is unnecessry , beacause I have ADSL , and other men that havn't ADSL are more need it.
2005-04-27T15:32:00.000Z	daven	hua	yes, i think so too - i haven't ordered one.  why don't you download the iso?
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	hua	daven	I have downloaded  it, but is in win98,  and the win98  is illegal-I don't real buy it.
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	daven	hua	right, but can't you burn the iso to a cd?
2005-04-27T15:40:00.000Z	hua	daven	: no. I haven't a cdrw, and I feel it is no need. But I have a REDHAT9 which is I bought, but when I met Debian and Ubuntu I havn't leave them two. I don't want install another linux distribution.
2005-04-27T15:42:00.000Z	hua	daven	: do you listen music online via Ubuntu, can you tell me some webpage like this.
2005-04-27T15:43:00.000Z	daven	hua	oh, i understand!  that's annoying!
2005-04-27T15:44:00.000Z	daven	hua	i don't listen to music online, i'm afraid.  i listen to my CDs, or internet radio :-s
2005-04-27T15:46:00.000Z	hua	daven	: some one say Ubuntu is diver from Debian is not a good thing. I don't agree, what do you think?
2005-04-27T15:46:00.000Z	daven	hua	i've not really thought too hard about it.  personally i find ubuntu much more usable as a desktop than debian.
2005-04-27T15:47:00.000Z	daven	hua	but maybe i didn't try so hard with debian :)
2005-04-27T15:48:00.000Z	hua	daven	: yes , I gree it. Ubuntu is more usable. Do you can do everything you want via Ubuntu?
2005-04-27T15:52:00.000Z	daven	hua	other than losing my network connection every so often (and my mouse disappears after i VNC into the box) it's great.
