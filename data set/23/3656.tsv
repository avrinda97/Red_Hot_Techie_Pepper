2008-11-01T21:39:00.000Z	ASTURIAS		No sound at all with an NVidia card on Ubuntu 8.04. Detecing the driver and nothing happens, I re-installed and stills the same...
2008-11-01T21:39:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	nvidia is always a headache:(
2008-11-01T21:39:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	Yes it is
2008-11-01T21:40:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	better to buy a cheap ati card:) instead of being tortured again and again
2008-11-01T21:40:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	I know I will find a solution soon.
2008-11-01T21:41:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	not sure whether this helps, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6076972#post6076972
2008-11-01T21:41:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	I will check it, thanks.
2008-11-01T21:42:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	I got tortured by both nvidia and ati, now, I'm glad, I ended up with ati
2008-11-01T21:49:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	Can I get it via Synaptics?
2008-11-01T21:48:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	using -nv currently?
2008-11-01T21:48:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	What's -nv?
2008-11-01T21:48:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	-nv is the an open source driver for nvidia
2008-11-01T21:49:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	I guess it's installed already, probably the one running, find out in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-11-01T21:50:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	I used Envy-NG to install it
2008-11-01T21:50:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	then, I don't really know:(
2008-11-01T21:51:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	ok
2008-11-01T21:56:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	sound is easier than video, do you have something in cat /proc/asound/cards
2008-11-01T21:57:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	yes, the fdriver appears there
2008-11-01T21:58:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	1) run alsaconf as root 2) add yourself to the 'audio' group (log out and log in again) 3) use alsamixer and unmute channels and raise levels (also try muting some channels) 4) arts or esound stopped? 5) OSS modules unloaded? 6) speakers on? 7) modprobe snd-pcm-oss  8) does "aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav" work for root? Test your sound with aplay and a wav so codec issues don't confuse the situation. <list alsa us
2008-11-01T21:58:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	the checklist from #debian
2008-11-01T21:59:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	Ok, I will try that
2008-11-01T21:59:00.000Z	dli_	ASTURIAS	it's easier, if the driver is up
2008-11-01T21:59:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dli_	Ok, thanks.
