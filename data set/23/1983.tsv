2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		alright
2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		new question then
2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		I have a steam game (Hearts of Iron 3), and wanna play it via (wine)
2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		I installed steam via wine, and installed the game just fine
2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		but then it wants the windows c++ redistributables for the game
2009-08-10T00:16:00.000Z	Frank1		can I emulate those some how ? so the game can run
2009-08-10T00:17:00.000Z	fabio123	Frank1	winetricks
2009-08-10T00:17:00.000Z	Frank1		fabio, what is winetricks
2009-08-10T00:18:00.000Z	fabio123	Frank1	winetricks will let you install the stuff you need with wine
2009-08-10T00:18:00.000Z	fabio123		like directx etc...
2009-08-10T00:18:00.000Z	Frank1		how would I go about getting the redistributable for c++ that this game needs via winetricks then ?
2009-08-10T00:19:00.000Z	fabio123		wait a sec
2009-08-10T00:19:00.000Z	Frank1	fabio123	ok
