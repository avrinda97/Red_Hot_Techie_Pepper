2009-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	you are right
2009-09-29T09:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	that "!info virtualbox-ose" needs to be updated
2009-09-29T09:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	that is the current version in hardy.
2009-09-29T09:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	not hardy but jaunty
2009-11-11T04:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	tinyurl.com is the savior of large links
2009-11-11T04:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	very true - it was just an accident, did NOT expect it to be that big.
2009-11-11T04:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	understood, didn't know if you knew about it or not. :)
2009-12-23T23:53:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	nvidia-settinsg is a graphical application.. use gksudo instead.
2009-12-23T23:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	tt that is correct -- don't use "sudo" for gui apps - my bad "gksu" saves 2 letters as well (for the lazy, which all good unix/linux admins should be)
2010-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	+1
2010-08-05T23:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	the !startup factoid need to be updated for 10.04 me thinks.
2010-08-05T23:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	agreed.
2010-08-22T04:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	i'd just use linux-image (the bug report will include the version info)
2010-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	which is what i have done. i am reviewing the report and it states 'Package - linux-image *not installed*  .. this is the reason i'm asking.
2010-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	in that case i guess you need the actual version...
2010-08-22T19:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	happen to know what lm stands for?  That's a cool test if it works.
2010-08-22T19:34:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	this is what i used to reference lm.. it doesn't give a definition but gives a location where you can find flag identifiers. http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/proc-cpuinfo-flag-lm-358563/
2010-08-22T19:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	thanks
2010-08-22T19:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	possibly lm stands for long mode
2010-08-22T19:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	thanks!
2010-08-22T19:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	ZykoticK9	you peaked my interest and made me dig farther. thank you.
2010-08-22T19:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bastid_raZor	;) - that a really handy test for the "does my cpu support 64" i must say - i'm certainly stealing your command.
