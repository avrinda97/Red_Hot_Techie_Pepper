2008-08-10T19:47:00.000Z	sanguisdex		so ATM I am signed on to a connection in a coffee shop.  Not the shops mind you. Just a randon open coeenction.  when I tried to get to the coffee shops (which is un encrypted BTW) my little net work manager icon just went and went and never connected>  is there a was to connect via the command line so that I could see the errors?
2008-08-10T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	check iwconfig
2008-08-10T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	you can use it to connect and scan for APs
2010-03-18T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	sure, the livecd has a usb installer on it
2010-03-18T19:34:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	so I need two usb drives or can I just mnt the live cd in a vbox and install to the USB drive from there?
2010-03-18T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	if you want you can use tools etc to put the liveCD on the usb and boot from that
2010-03-18T19:38:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	I only have one USB drive handy, can I load the live image on to it, boot from it then wipe the usb  and install on to the usb from the boot in the memeory?
2010-03-18T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	sure, i use my girlfriends lappy + this personally: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-ubuntu-9-10-live-usb-in-windows/  works with lucid too
2010-03-18T19:44:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	I am already using ubuntu, but due to a ATI video card I have avoided upgrading beyond 8.10, but I have heard that people have had luck getting 3d effects by using some other drivers I just want to try
2010-03-18T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	i dont use arti, so i am no help. 8.10 is getting dropped some point next month so look out
2010-03-18T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	s/arti/ati
2010-03-18T19:48:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	I know, its either down grade to LTS, changes distors, or upgrade and lose 3d support
2010-03-18T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	or a new video card, a cheapo nvidia thing will do much better
2010-03-18T19:49:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	it's a lappy
2010-03-18T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	ah, i see. Then you hit the nail on the head. personally i'd just sack off some eyecandy for a decent distro of linux. You will find the other distros are the same as they are essentially the same OS, Linux
2010-03-20T22:39:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	 its just good to thank people when they help

2012-06-04T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sanguisdex	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-06-04T16:58:00.000Z	sanguisdex	ActionParsnip	its actually lisa as this is a mint box but the under the hood architecture is so similar that I came here
