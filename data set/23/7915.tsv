2005-06-01T12:19:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	dude.  the topic says it.  the breezy announcesments said it.  people on the street say it.
2005-06-01T12:19:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	no, sorry, you were warned not to use breezy
2005-06-01T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	upgrading to the development version is in general silly
2005-06-01T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	then you presumably expected it to set fire to your house
2005-06-01T12:21:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	no, they didn't, and hoary was unusally stable
2005-06-01T12:22:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	on gentoo, how do you downgrade to the stable release?
2005-06-01T12:22:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	how about redhat? how do I go from fedora 2 to fedora 1?
2005-06-01T12:25:00.000Z	catch-	bob2	sorry I ment undefine ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86 emerge sync && emerge -uDp world (from memory)
2005-06-01T12:25:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	ok!
2005-06-01T12:28:00.000Z	catch-	bob2	ok ...... meaning ubuntu simply doesnt have the simple ability to downgrade?
2005-06-01T12:28:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	it does indeed, but it's not guaranteed to work
2005-06-01T12:28:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	if you don't know advanced apt fiddling, it's easier to reinstall
2005-06-01T12:29:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	you can pin hoary above breezy and let apt try

2005-06-01T12:35:00.000Z	bob2	catch-	when people say "don't use breezy", they do mean it
2005-06-01T12:35:00.000Z	catch-	bob2	with no one around me who really does computing, and it just being myself with no time to read forums, noone told me
