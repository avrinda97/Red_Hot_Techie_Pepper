2007-10-07T12:46:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	yep
2007-10-07T12:47:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	however, it is more obvious that a cmoplex event such as ww2 would have a larger impact
2007-10-07T12:47:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	as opposed to a butterfly's wings
2007-10-07T12:49:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	I think he just likes messing with ubotu... makes him feel warm and fuzzy and important inside
2007-10-07T12:53:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	only because reading forums take too much time ;P. People are lazy... err like efficiency when they troubleshoot
2007-10-07T12:53:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	i think people would rather interact with others, rather than just read a bunch of ad-ridden forum crap
2007-10-07T12:53:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	that too
2007-10-07T12:54:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	but I will admit that most of the questions asked, Particularly the "newbie questions" could be answered with a simple google search
2007-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	"how do I get to terminal??!?!?!??!??!11oneeleven"
2007-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	true...  but I don't mind that, I never have...  I've banned alot of people from forums for going "search it" ... though
2007-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	 tilda!  :)
2007-10-07T12:56:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	effort is what separates the people who will learn, from the people who will copy. When a person comes into the channel and is given a bunch of stuff he/she doesn't understand.. copies it into console and goes, they learn nothing
2007-10-07T12:57:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	isn't that the point of ubuntu, though, that people dont HAVE to learn, it just works?
2007-10-07T12:57:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	i mean, if you want to learn, roll your own slackware, thats a hell of an experience :)
2007-10-07T12:58:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	yes, I see that as a serious downside for the os. particularly through this point of transition, where it is almost configurable without terminal, but then only the hardest things need to be configured through console
2007-10-07T12:59:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	actually, i love the terminal...  my mom uses ubuntu, when i need to fix something (shes in CA, im in VA) i can tell her exactly what to type in the console, much faster than telling her how to do it in gui...  no "what button?  i dont see that button!" :D
2007-10-07T12:59:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	better yet, get her IP and ssh in
2007-10-07T13:00:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	i would, but they use a damned Apple airport mini, and i cant for the life of me figure out port forwarding on it :)
2007-10-07T13:00:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	oh those Apple devices
2007-10-07T13:01:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	i'm very much love-hate with that thing...its a pain as a router, but for the music streaming its genious
2007-10-07T13:02:00.000Z	silent	rjm1982	apple is a tradeoff... You know it's going to work... but the extent to which it can extend its functionality tends to be limited
2007-10-07T13:02:00.000Z	rjm1982	silent	agreed :)
