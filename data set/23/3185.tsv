2008-06-30T14:01:00.000Z	Unislash		well, here's my situation
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		i'm trying to dualboot, and right now, i can't even get ubuntu to boot because my windows overrode grub
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		thanks
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		lol, i have been
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		and that's exactly what i did :P
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		so, now i'm trying to reinstall it, but instead of trying to fix it once it's installed, i'm trying to fix it before and get it to have a normal letter
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		therefore, i'm asking how to affect drive letters from ubuntu
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	kaliMastah	Unislash	is your windows drive an ntfs?
2008-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	Unislash		because i can boot from ubuntu before i reinstall it
2008-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	kaliMastah		lol
2008-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	Unislash	wols	sorry, but i'm asking a totally valid ubuntu question... how do you affect drive letters using ubuntu? you should be able to
2008-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	Unislash		ah
