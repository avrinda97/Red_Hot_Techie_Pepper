2006-03-13T08:45:00.000Z	sailor		anyone?
2006-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	have you recently changed your hostname?
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	not that i remember--though I may have since I last used the menu editor
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	oh wait. The menu editor
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	blech. that thing is quite prone to buggyness
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	yeah... it won't start, it tries to, then fails silently
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	any other way to edit the menu?
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	you can either try to fix the XML file yourself
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	or delete it and start over
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	where do I find that?
2006-03-13T08:54:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	anything?
2006-03-13T08:56:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	yeah
2006-03-13T08:56:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	 it's ~/.config/menus/applications.menu
2006-03-13T08:56:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	thanks, lemme check that out
2006-03-13T08:56:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	you can delete it, and it'll change your menus back to the system defaults and you should be able to use the editor again
2006-03-13T08:57:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	I've found that sometimes entries will get messed up in the XML and then the editor won't load
2006-03-13T08:57:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	i don't have that file... or the menus dir
2006-03-13T08:58:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	in your home directory you don't have a .config directory?
2006-03-13T08:58:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	i have the .config, but there's only a smeg dir inside it
2006-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	hrm, well smeg is the menu editor
2006-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	but mine saves to the menu directory
2006-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	polpak	sailor	dunno why yours would be different
2006-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	sailor	polpak	there's nothing in the smeg dir either
