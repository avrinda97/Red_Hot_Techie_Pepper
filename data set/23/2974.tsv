2009-10-27T07:26:00.000Z	vock		any ideas why you would get a connection refused in ssh when for sure the port is opened on the firewall and in iptables, and it's a fresh install of openssh-server? (no changes to sshd_config)
2009-10-27T07:26:00.000Z	wt	vock	try netstat -lntp to see if the server is really running and what ip address it's listening on
2009-10-27T07:28:00.000Z	vock	wt	netstat shows something listening on the right port, just listed as tcp
2009-10-27T07:29:00.000Z	wt	vock	try that command as root
2009-10-27T07:29:00.000Z	wt	vock	it will tell you what pid and the name of the app that's bound to the port
2009-10-27T07:30:00.000Z	vock	wt	sshd listening on 0.0.0.0 on the right port and ::, shouldn't it be listening on my router ip?
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	wt	vock	you're jumping ahead
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	vock	wt	sorry,
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	wt	vock	are you trying to connect from a different network
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	wt	vock	np
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	vock	wt	at the moment just the same network, just to get it running, eventually I will want outside from the network
2009-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	wt	vock	don't worry about your router yet then
2009-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	wt	vock	can you ping your ssh box from the client?
2009-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	vock	wt	yep
2009-10-27T07:36:00.000Z	wt	vock	try "nmap -sV hostname" from the client
2009-10-27T07:36:00.000Z	wt	vock	I meant "nmap -sV -P0 -p22 hostname" from the client
2009-10-27T07:37:00.000Z	vock	wt	two seconds, installing nmap
2009-10-27T07:37:00.000Z	wt	vock	btw, 0.0.0.0 in the netstat output indicates that it is listening on all ips on local interfaces
2009-10-27T07:38:00.000Z	vock	wt	oh, okay
2009-10-27T07:39:00.000Z	vock	wt	I'm getting script engine failures, one sec
2009-10-27T07:39:00.000Z	wt	vock	that's no fun
2009-10-27T07:43:00.000Z	wt	vock	anything happening for you?
2009-10-27T07:44:00.000Z	vock	wt	can I pm you for one sec?
