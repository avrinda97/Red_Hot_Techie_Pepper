2008-01-04T16:32:00.000Z	chazco		I'd like to install Windows onto a second HDD (until Ubuntu works fully for me)... whats the best way to do this?
2008-01-04T16:34:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	safely? disconnect the power from the second drive and leave the first one connected
2008-01-04T16:34:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	yes :-)
2008-01-04T16:38:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	perhaps bitpim ?
2008-01-04T16:38:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	but i think there is a specific pocketpc sync app
2008-01-04T16:39:00.000Z	chazco	khermans	- That'll be synce, which doesnt work for me :(
2008-01-05T14:30:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx-new ?
2008-01-05T14:30:00.000Z	chazco	khermans	- If thats the package and thats all it does then thats perfect (I use apt-get, but easy to modify) :)
2008-01-05T14:31:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	restricted-drivers-manager auto detrmines the appropriate driver
2008-01-05T14:31:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	i am not sure you need -new or not
2008-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	restore script?
2008-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	you know about dpkg --get-selections ?
2008-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	chazco	khermans	- After a fresh install I run it and it reinstalls everything and configures stuff
2008-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	dpkg --set/get-selections
2008-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	man dpkg
2008-01-05T14:34:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	you use it to capture and set your installed packages
2008-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	backup your /etc/ and /home folders then
2008-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	chazco	khermans	- Still not ideal (although /home is separate anyway, but I tend to clear out folders)... This way works well, except for the nvidia driver.
2008-01-05T14:37:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	then just /etc
2008-01-05T14:37:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	you can tar it up and restore only the files you need
2008-01-05T15:36:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	lsusb ?
2008-01-05T15:36:00.000Z	chazco	khermans	- Bingo, thanks :)
2008-01-05T15:36:00.000Z	khermans	chazco	np dude
