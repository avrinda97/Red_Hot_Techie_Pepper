2006-03-12T12:27:00.000Z	Lorvija		hey... I'd like to install ubuntu but currently i dont have any free partition.. is it possible to repartition one of my hds? and if so which, slave or master?
2006-03-12T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 yes you can, and it dosent matter
2006-03-12T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 theres always the chance.. and there is loads of docs on the ubuntu wiki site.
2006-03-12T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 when in doubt.. back up stuff.
2006-03-12T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 i do it all the time. - i tend to use a live cd, with gparted, or qt_parted - however for the repartitiong.. and READ the docs on the 2 programs.
2006-03-12T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 if you want fast.. go with somthing really minimal. :P
2006-03-12T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 speed is relative.
2006-03-12T12:36:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	i guess i'll try xubuntu sometime.. (: should be fast?
2006-03-12T12:36:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	ye... but something with lower requiriments should be a bit faster? right?
2006-03-12T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 just apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and select it from the GDM login and try it.
2006-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 oh a high end system - i doubt ya could tell.. on a low end system it will be more noticeable.
2006-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	okay, so on low end system? do you know?
2006-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 define 'low end' :P
2006-03-12T12:38:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	duh :P just your personal opinion? =)
2006-03-12T12:38:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	yes but if the choises are pure ubuntu or kubuntu.. out of the box (:
2006-03-12T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 try them and see.. i dont worry about stuff like that.
2006-03-12T12:39:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	yep i will (:
2006-03-29T08:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 let me guess.. NTFS partition?
2006-03-29T08:47:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	aye
2006-03-29T08:47:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	it's already mounted.. just cant access it (:
2006-03-29T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	 you have to alter the mount entry
2006-03-29T08:48:00.000Z	Lorvija	Dr_Willis	 okay, I'll check it. thanks
2006-03-29T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lorvija	its mounted by root. not a user.
