2005-11-29T17:42:00.000Z	oblib		General quesion: I remember reading about a remote access program similar to vnc. Does anyone know what it's called. It's supposed to be much faster. Has anyone used it?
2005-11-29T17:43:00.000Z	oblib		that's the one
2005-11-29T09:16:00.000Z	oblib		question: I am trying to get the nvidia driver to work. I have an older card, so I'm using nvidia-glx-legacy. When I try to start X with that driver, it fails, complaining about the kernel
2005-11-29T09:16:00.000Z	oblib		I had the same problem when I tried to run the new Breezy drivers with an old kernel
2005-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	oblib		GeForce4 MX 440
2005-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	oblib		I mean
2005-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	new driver should work fine
2005-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	it didn't
2005-11-29T09:18:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	instead of loading Gnome, it would go to a black screen with a cursor at the top. The cursor was not blinking.
2005-11-29T09:18:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	I coudln't switch to a term with Ctrl+Alt+F1 or anything
2005-11-29T09:19:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	strange
2005-11-29T09:19:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	sometimes a lot of ctrl-alt-deletes would reboot it sometimes not
2005-11-29T09:19:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	did you try ctrl+alt+backsoace?
2005-11-29T09:20:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	I guess I'll try again with the new driver and look at the xorg log. Yes, ctrl-alt-back didn't work either
2005-11-29T09:20:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	ok
2005-11-29T09:20:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	no response from anything
2005-11-29T09:21:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	you have to MX 440 as well? Can you use the TV-out on it?
2005-11-29T09:21:00.000Z	oblib	lucaas	or at least dual monitors?
2005-11-29T09:21:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	i dont have tv-out
2005-11-29T09:21:00.000Z	lucaas	oblib	ah, i have 400, not 440
