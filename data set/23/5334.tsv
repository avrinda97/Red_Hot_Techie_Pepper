2006-12-29T09:18:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		hello
2006-12-29T09:19:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		out of curiosity, my compy insists I only have 100 MB, when I know I have 20 Gig
2006-12-29T09:19:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		I've tried re-installing while formatting harddrive
2006-12-29T09:19:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		and it just laughs at me
2006-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		"You only have 100MB, idiot.  Why are you trying to install anything?"
2006-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		I think I just need to reformat my hard drive manually, but I have no idea how to do that
2006-12-29T09:21:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	use fdisk on a floppy or dare I say it, a winxp cd.
2006-12-29T09:21:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	what type do u need it to be?
2006-12-29T09:22:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	ubuntu will format it on install
2006-12-29T09:23:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	is your 'puter an HP or Compaq?
2006-12-29T09:23:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	I think even with them you have to get it to blow away the firsy partition
2006-12-29T09:23:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	they put a recovery volume on there
2006-12-29T09:26:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	I would go so far as to say that a BIOS update may be in order.
2006-12-29T09:26:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	check your bios and see if 2 partions are in there.
2006-12-29T09:33:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	that's your mammories (RAM)
2006-12-29T09:54:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	what exactly do you mean by "die"
2006-12-29T09:56:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	you get that beast to boot live yet?
2006-12-29T10:05:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	Oh, no wonder. You have 256mb ram?
2006-12-29T10:12:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Bradaphraser	remove all your usb stuff too, like printers and such.
