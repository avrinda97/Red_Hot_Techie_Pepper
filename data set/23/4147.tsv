2008-12-30T05:35:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		So I've been trying to install ubuntu on an old inspiron laptop, and I got it working with minimal problems. But now I need to run it on an external monitor, and it is behaving strangely. It works on the other monitor until gnome starts, then it goes back to the laptop monitor.
2008-12-30T05:35:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		I've googled around, and cannot seem to find solutions. Do you need any more information?
2008-12-30T05:37:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		so anyobdy got any ideas
2008-12-30T05:37:00.000Z	Jangari	Labmonkey1	this is what happens to me: the login screen shows up on both laptop and external monitor, but as soon as I log in, the external shows 'input not supported' and the laptop goes blank
2008-12-30T05:37:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		was that directed at me lol? I can't tell
2008-12-30T05:38:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		jangari
2008-12-30T05:38:00.000Z	Jangari		yes it was, that's why your name was in it
2008-12-30T05:38:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		yea
2008-12-30T05:38:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		I was reffering to a different message
2008-12-30T05:39:00.000Z	Labmonkey1	techsuperfreak	what's dmesg lol, sorry im new to this
2008-12-30T05:40:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		ok
2008-12-30T05:40:00.000Z	Jangari		simple question, I have an .rb script to batch run over a directory of text files. What's the bash command?
2008-12-30T05:41:00.000Z	Jangari		as in, what's the bash command to pipe a text file through a ruby script?
2008-12-30T05:42:00.000Z	Jangari		it's just an .rb script, and I want to run some text files through it, not complicated, right?
2008-12-30T05:43:00.000Z	Jangari		to draw attention, elkbuntu
2008-12-30T05:45:00.000Z	Labmonkey1	techsuperfreak	sorry for long wait, I had to find a keyboard for that computer
2008-12-30T05:46:00.000Z	Labmonkey1	techsuperfreak	what parts of dmesg do you want, it was a lot of stuff
2008-12-30T05:47:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		techsuper: anything your looking for? I can't easily copy paste cause its on another comp without net access
2008-12-30T05:49:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		well im not sure how I would get the info over to you
2008-12-30T05:49:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		techsuper: it would take hours to type out
2008-12-30T05:51:00.000Z	Labmonkey1		tech: I am trying to get my laptop (dell insperion 5000) to work with an external monitor (just the external monitor, NOT dual monitor). I plugged the monitor in, closed the laptop, and it shows the computer starting up on the external monitor, but once gnome starts up, the external monitor goes blank, and it starts going on the laptop monitor again.
2008-12-30T05:52:00.000Z	Jangari	Labmonkey1	I would try starting gnome first, then plugging in the external, and going to screen resolution settings to see if it's recognising the monitor properly.
