2009-09-23T02:56:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	what's the issue?
2009-09-23T02:56:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	thanks. I cant seem to get my printet to print. I have CUPS installed, but no joy. Thoughts?
2009-09-23T02:57:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	is it a LAN printer or a USB? Did you add it to the list of printers?
2009-09-23T02:59:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	USB. I cant seem to add it to the list of printers. I have no icon or option. Just says not connected.
2009-09-23T02:59:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	when I try to connect to local host, I get, "There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'httpConnectionEncrypt failed'."
2009-09-23T02:59:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	System > Administration > Printing
2009-09-23T03:00:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	yes, that is where I am. It wont allow me to add a printer. Just says, "not connected".
2009-09-23T03:01:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	Is the printer connected?
2009-09-23T03:01:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	and switched on?
2009-09-23T03:01:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	yes, connected.
2009-09-23T03:02:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	disconnect the printer's usb connection and then run `dmesg | tail -20`
2009-09-23T03:03:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	then connect the printer, and run that command again. pastebin the output
2009-09-23T03:03:00.000Z	dragon	jer_	an easier way to pastebin the output at the end would be `dmesg | pastebinit`
2009-09-23T03:04:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	this is what i got after following your instructions..."[272839.403671]: command not found"
2009-09-23T03:05:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	sorry, how do I  pastebin?
2009-09-23T03:06:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	I guess not :-(
2009-09-23T03:09:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	ok here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/276108/
2009-09-23T03:14:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	any thoughts?
2009-09-23T03:18:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	it keeps telling me "There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'httpConnectionEncrypt failed'." when i try to connect localhost.
2009-09-23T03:22:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	it says, "The CUPS spooler does not appear to be running." Thoughts?
2009-09-23T03:24:00.000Z	jer_	dragon	BRB. Rebooting
