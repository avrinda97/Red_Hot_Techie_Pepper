2006-03-03T16:00:00.000Z	fatejudger		I can't seem to mount Samba shares at boot using the fstab
2006-03-03T16:00:00.000Z	fatejudger		Samba loads after the share mount is attempted
2006-03-03T16:00:00.000Z	fatejudger		which is why it fails
2006-03-03T16:01:00.000Z	fatejudger		does anyone know a way around this?
2006-03-03T16:02:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	those two links tell you all you need to know
2006-03-03T16:02:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	that doesn't work
2006-03-03T16:03:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	like I said, Samba gets loaded AFTER the drive mount is attempted
2006-03-03T16:03:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	sorry they are not on your machine - that is interesting you want the samba client to mount them
2006-03-03T16:03:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	some programs don't do well with smb://
2006-03-03T16:05:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	I don't do samba at all, I don't do windows at all sorry so you have reached the limits of my knowledge on that
2006-03-03T17:25:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/165 that might help, where they use "root@machine #" you use sudo have fun
2006-03-03T17:25:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	thanks
2006-03-03T17:27:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	in this howto they make samba a module so it gets started before the fstab tries to mount the remote filesystem
2006-03-03T17:27:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	I don't know how that'll fly with Kubuntu
2006-03-03T17:31:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	I don't think this'll work
2006-03-03T17:32:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	as I said before I am not a windows person it looks useful at the end you could put that command in a script and initialise it on login into gnome - system - preferences - sessions to do the start up the scripting I'll leave to yourself
2006-03-03T17:33:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	but it wouldn't run it as root
2006-03-03T17:33:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	I could always stick it in the KDE Autostart, but it would run it as a regular user
2006-03-03T17:33:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	gksudo in gnome gives you sudo to start it
2006-03-03T17:34:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	is there anything comparable for KDE?
2006-03-03T17:34:00.000Z	ompaul	fatejudger	#kubuntu I don't do that either
2006-03-03T17:35:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	ah, kdesu
2006-03-03T17:36:00.000Z	fatejudger	ompaul	should I drop it in root's Autostart or my user?
