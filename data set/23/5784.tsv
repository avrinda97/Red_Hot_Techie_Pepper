2006-09-25T16:49:00.000Z	Max_-		well... I'm still stuck with  640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768...  what can I do?  please <:)
2006-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	Max_-		Weird!!  I try to play an mp3 with AmaroK or Music Player and it ways it's not a sound stream (or playlist finished) .. but now this is a file I'm listening to many time a day...  I know it is a working mp3
2006-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	have you installed mp3 codecs?
2006-09-25T05:07:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	no
2006-09-25T05:07:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	didn't know I needed them...
2006-09-25T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	you need to install them ;)  ubout sent you a link
2006-09-25T05:12:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	thanks, everything works now... I just had to look in the add/remove application and search for mp3 codec
2006-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	you need build-essential
2006-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	 thanks again
2006-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	, cant find it in the add/remove, should I install adept .. or is it somewhere else.. or under another name?
2006-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	build-essential, it'll be in apt-get, or whatever GUI you use, or 'sudo apt-get install build essential' will do it
2006-09-25T06:07:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	what can I answer to this :   What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel?
2006-09-25T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	you need to install the linux-headers first
2006-09-25T06:08:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	apt-get install linux-headers ???
2006-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	sorry, that link doesn't have it.  um, linux-headers-arch where arch is your kernels arch
2006-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	well.. okay it just listed me tons of linux-headers packages... I guess in my case linux-headers-2.6.15-27-386 2.6.15-27.48 should do it
2006-09-25T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-09-25T08:43:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	already got caught with that... won't do it again, it f/%/cks everything up.. from the keyboard to the resolution and going by the refresh rate...
2006-09-25T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	no, that's the way to do it.
2006-09-27T11:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	you looking to do it with apache2? or just on it's own?
2006-09-27T11:09:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	 on it's own... first I'd like to know how to get it
2006-09-27T11:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Max_-	read that page, but ignore the stuff that isn't just the base mysql packages ;)
2006-09-27T11:11:00.000Z	Max_-	Flannel	.. well I like that Lamp thing... because even though I just need mysql at the moment, I'll have to work with apache and php very soon.. so I better put this all up now
