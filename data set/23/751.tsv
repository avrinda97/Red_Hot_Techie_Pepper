2011-03-26T00:19:00.000Z	`greenlight		Im connected to the internet via USB stick mobile broadband connection and installed Ubuntu 10.10 with apache, mysql thru LAMP. How can I broadcast my localhost to the web, like when someone will go to my IP will be directly view my localhost site?
2011-03-26T00:21:00.000Z	`greenlight		yup brontosaurusrex , when someone try to go to my IP, they should see my localhost
2011-03-26T00:22:00.000Z	`greenlight		but my question is how can someone from the internet view my localhost
2011-03-26T00:23:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	you need a DNS pointing to your IP, and configure your router/firewall to let traffic through to you
2011-03-26T00:24:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	thank you
2011-03-26T00:24:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	or if you don't want a URL you just need to reconfigure your router/firewall
2011-03-26T00:24:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	yeah, is it possible thru my current connectio:  usb mobile broadband  ?
2011-03-26T00:26:00.000Z	`greenlight		oh
2011-03-26T00:26:00.000Z	`greenlight		yup brontosaurusrex , but it can't connect to me
2011-03-26T00:26:00.000Z	`greenlight		yup brontosaurusrex , but it can't connect to my localhost
2011-03-26T00:27:00.000Z	`greenlight		I don't have a router here, im using usb broadband
2011-03-26T00:28:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	you need to reconfigure your firewall. i'm not sure but there should be some sort of protection in a mobile broadband modem...
2011-03-26T00:28:00.000Z	`greenlight		what question A_J
2011-03-26T00:29:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	oh.. maybe it's in the restrictions of the usb net provider
2011-03-26T00:30:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	do you not have an interface to configure anything for your connection
2011-03-26T00:30:00.000Z	`greenlight		yup
2011-03-26T00:30:00.000Z	`greenlight		in ubuntu nope
2011-03-26T00:31:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	just in the network connections
2011-03-26T00:31:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	under Mobile Broadband Tab
2011-03-26T00:34:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	your current problem is that any requests from the outside are blocked. if you had a router then the firewall built into the router would block that request. as you don't have a firewall in your router, there must be a firewall somewhere in your mobile connection
2011-03-26T00:34:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	okay, will check on it. thanks
2011-03-26T00:35:00.000Z	alsuna	`greenlight	you need to find and reconfigure that firewall. however i cant help you with that
2011-03-26T00:36:00.000Z	`greenlight	alsuna	it's fine. thanks for the inputs anyways. at least I know now where to start
