2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	christoz		why on earth i cannot watch videos via opera 9.5 ..PLEASE HELP
2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	cj	christoz	what types of videos?
2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	cj	christoz	flash?
2008-06-13T23:47:00.000Z	cj	christoz	do you have the opera flash plug-in?
2008-06-13T23:48:00.000Z	cj	christoz	I don't know how they distribute it, but maybe?
2008-06-13T23:48:00.000Z	cj	christoz	did you go to the adobe site and search for an opera plugin?
2008-06-13T23:48:00.000Z	christoz	cj	yes but there wasn't any for debian based  distros
2008-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	cj	christoz	you should be able to get the cups drivers and install them using one of the fancy cups GUI configurators...
2008-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	christoz	cj	please can you be more specific
2008-06-13T23:51:00.000Z	cj	christoz	not really... I can look for a package that might have such a tool, but I'm without X myself right now...
2008-06-13T23:51:00.000Z	cj	christoz	kde or gnome?
2008-06-13T23:52:00.000Z	cj	christoz	gnome = gnome-cups-manager
2008-06-13T23:52:00.000Z	cj	christoz	sudo apt-get install gnome-cups-manager
2008-06-13T23:52:00.000Z	christoz	cj	,ok i'm on it
2008-06-13T23:53:00.000Z	cj	christoz	when you run that, you'll probably get some sort of wizard that will eventually prompt you for the cups driver file
2008-06-13T23:53:00.000Z	cj	christoz	you can find a driver for your printer somewhere on the intarwebs, I bet :)
2008-06-13T23:53:00.000Z	cj	christoz	does sun produce your printer?
2008-06-13T23:53:00.000Z	cj	christoz	I expected that your printer manufacturer would have a 'support' area with drivers
2008-06-13T23:54:00.000Z	christoz	cj	i don't have a printer
2008-06-13T23:54:00.000Z	cj	christoz	I obviously have you confused with someone else.
2008-06-13T23:55:00.000Z	cj	christoz	as for you, my friend, visit adobe
2008-06-13T23:55:00.000Z	cj	christoz	see if they have a flash plug-in for opera
2008-06-14T00:01:00.000Z	christoz	cj	i had to download  flashplugin-nonfree,it is strange that the adobe site didn't make a reference to it
