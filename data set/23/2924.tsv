2008-10-03T01:29:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		thanks
2008-10-03T01:31:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		So with gparted, I can resize my ntfs partition, and lose nothing?
2008-10-03T01:32:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		Is anyone sure?
2008-10-03T01:32:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		ErUsul. Well, ok.
2008-10-03T01:33:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		How do I clone my hard drive onto an external USB drive, and then if necessary restore from it?
2008-10-03T01:34:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		What about gparted?
2008-10-03T01:35:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		Anyone need help with inkscape?
2008-10-03T01:36:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		or Vector graphics?
2008-10-03T01:36:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		oh
2008-10-03T01:37:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar		Try uninstalling things in order of how likely they were to cause the problem.
2008-10-03T01:37:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	do you have a graphics tablet?
2008-10-03T01:38:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	I had an Inkscape tablet question!
2008-10-03T01:39:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	oh me? my tablet cursor 'sticks' quite often in gimp and inkscape
2008-10-03T01:40:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	I have had no luck fixing that and it's annoying
2008-10-03T01:40:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	Windows and OSX don't stick
2008-10-03T01:41:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	I think its the driver, but have no experience hacking HUD drivers, don't know where to begin
2008-10-03T01:42:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	I had to compile the driver in, which worked fine - it's a Genius mouspen
2008-10-03T01:43:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	hehe, you have a pretty long name yourself there :-)
2008-10-03T01:56:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	no
2008-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	you can get adaptors
2008-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	yes
2008-10-03T01:58:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	your BIOS needs to support it, you'll see the option if you go to the boot section
2008-10-03T01:58:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	PostersandGuitar	most newish computers support it
