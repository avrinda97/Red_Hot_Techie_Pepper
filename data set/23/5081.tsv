2007-03-30T14:40:00.000Z	CoolMatty		yeah, no modprobe
2007-03-30T14:40:00.000Z	CoolMatty		don't put modprobe on the end
2007-03-30T14:41:00.000Z	CoolMatty		anyone wanna take a stab at my wireless card problem? :p
2007-03-30T14:42:00.000Z	CoolMatty		I've got one of those accursed broadcom b/g 4306 wireless chipsets. I've followed numerous guides, but none of them seem to be able to get me a useable connection.
2007-03-30T14:43:00.000Z	CoolMatty		Ubuntu doesnt need programming experience lol
2007-03-30T14:43:00.000Z	CoolMatty		there's all these guides and people getting it to work
2007-03-30T14:43:00.000Z	CoolMatty		but mine refuses to ever get an ip. now I cant even get iwconfig to show the connection :/
2007-03-30T14:44:00.000Z	CoolMatty		6.10
2007-03-30T14:45:00.000Z	CoolMatty		I'm trying to use ndiswrapper right now, since I had no luck with the native driver
2007-03-30T14:45:00.000Z	CoolMatty		and now eth1 (my wireless device) just disappeared. no wlan0 either.
2007-03-30T14:45:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	If its broadcom based, I have a great tut
2007-03-30T14:46:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	is it broadcom based?
2007-03-30T14:47:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	that one worked, it even links to a working driver
2007-03-30T14:50:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	have you installed network-manager?
2007-03-30T14:52:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	lol, im thinking about what could have gone wrong
2007-03-30T14:52:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	you sure you blacklisted bcm43xx and rmmod 'd it?
2007-03-30T14:56:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	deselect it from there, otherwise Network-Manager won't be able to use it
2007-03-30T14:59:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	try modprobing it again, then iwconfig again
2007-03-30T15:00:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	its strange that it says wlan0, since ndiswrapper sets it to eth1
2007-03-30T15:00:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	okay :D
2007-03-30T15:01:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	set it back to eth1 ?
2007-03-30T15:01:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	depmod -a?
2007-03-30T15:01:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	CoolMatty	im getting desperate here :D
