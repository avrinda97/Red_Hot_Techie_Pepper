2010-06-03T16:09:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		es. So, I can't change my mind?
2010-06-03T16:10:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx).
2010-06-03T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	what language?  Maybe those parts haven't been translated
2010-06-03T16:10:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	Installed with Hungarian, switched to English but some parts remained Hungarian.
2010-06-03T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	maybe you can help translate? https://edge.launchpad.net/rosetta (also search wiki.ubuntu.com for the hungarian translation team)
2010-06-03T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	wait, you want it all to be english now?
2010-06-03T16:11:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	you misunderstood my problem. I switched FROM HUNGARIAN TO ENGLISH.
2010-06-03T16:12:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	how did you switch?
2010-06-03T16:12:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	When logging in.
2010-06-03T16:12:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	what did you switch to?
2010-06-03T16:13:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	I installed Ubuntu with Hungarian language. Then, I decided to switch to English because of the untranslated things. But now, some things are HUNGARIAN :/
2010-06-03T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	yeah, I understand that.  What exactly was the language that you selected at the login screen?  Also, what's in your ~/.dmrc and /etc/environment?
2010-06-03T16:14:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	A moment...
2010-06-03T16:15:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	I've selected English from the Language drop-down list.
2010-06-04T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	apt only does what you tell it to... Surely it told you what it was going to do and asked if you were sure
2011-04-12T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	did you make it executable?
2011-04-12T19:10:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	How can I do it?
2011-04-12T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	nyuszika7h	chmod +x /path/to/file
2011-04-12T19:11:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	jrib	oh thanks
