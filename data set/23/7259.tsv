2007-04-06T05:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	Nah, its the declaration which is wrong.
2007-04-06T05:55:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	could be as well
2007-05-04T10:48:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	yes, with some caveats
2007-05-04T10:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	meaning?
2007-05-04T10:49:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	you can resize, but only if the beginning of the partition is fixed. to move, you need to create a new partition and copy
2007-05-04T10:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	Supposing I wanted to copy, how would I reconfigure ubuntu to boot from the new partition? I guess I'd need to update grub to find /boot, anything else?
2007-05-04T10:52:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	that would do, just change the stanza in the grub config file to point to the new partition label
2007-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	also, if you don't use a separate boot partition, you may have to reinstall grub so it know where to find its config file in /boot :)
2007-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	That's what I mean, heh
2007-06-05T10:33:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	free
2007-06-05T10:34:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	but that's a bit misleading, you'll want to look at the "-/+ buffers/cache" line
2010-08-09T17:32:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	could you paste the pid line?
2010-08-09T17:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	barney   22432  2.2  0.0      0     0 ?        D    13:24   0:09 [firefox-bin
2010-08-09T17:34:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	what does the cpu line of top report?
2010-08-09T17:35:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	(it does indeed look an i/o wait)
2010-08-09T17:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	which part? my load averages?
2010-08-09T17:35:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	no, the cpu line: us,sy,ni,id...
2010-08-09T17:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	Cpu(s):  0.7%us,  0.7%sy,  0.0%ni, 98.7%id,  0.0%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
2010-08-09T17:36:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	interesting. i suppose the window is still drawn?
2010-08-09T17:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	nope. I actually restarted gdm thinking that detaching it from X would have some effect, but it didn't
2010-08-09T17:37:00.000Z	sipior	Stormx2	any flash plugin processes running atm?
2010-08-09T17:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	That'll be it I bet haha. Lemme see
2010-08-09T17:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	sipior	No flash. I'll just reboot. Bloody pulse is stuck in "uninteruptable" too.
