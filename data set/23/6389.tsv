2006-06-27T16:59:00.000Z	Zarephath		Darn..he left...Ok what is a good program to run once I know an ip of a computer I want to scan for open ports?
2006-06-27T16:59:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	nmap is a great port scanner
2006-06-27T05:01:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	do "sudo nmap -sS 192.16.0.*"
2006-06-27T05:02:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	no quotes :P
2006-06-27T05:02:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	That is what I am saying it doesn't work
2006-06-27T05:02:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	pastebin?
2006-06-27T05:05:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16580
2006-06-27T05:05:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	I didn't mention this is over a wireless connection..does that matter?
2006-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	you need to replace the * with the IP
2006-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	wireless connection shouldn't matter
2006-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Same message if I do so
2006-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	And I did ping the ip to make sure I get a reply after nmap -sP 192.168.0.*
2006-06-27T05:07:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	what is your system arch?
2006-06-27T05:07:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Ubuntu PPC
2006-06-27T05:08:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	did you do "sudo apt-get install nmap" or did you build from source?
2006-06-27T05:08:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Nope did apt-get install nmap
2006-06-27T05:10:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	googling...one sec
2006-06-27T05:10:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Ok...
2006-06-27T05:13:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	weird -- seems to be a mix of problems with non-i386 arch's and being compiled with gcc4
2006-06-27T05:13:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	does it run okay if you don't use root?
2006-06-27T05:14:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Ok..any suggestions for a alternative that might work? Well I did get it to list the ips on my lan without root...other than that no
2006-06-27T05:18:00.000Z	swaj	Zarephath	maybe try knocker?  sudo apt-get install knocker
2006-06-27T05:18:00.000Z	Zarephath	swaj	Ok thanks...I have to run and eat thanks for the help!!!
