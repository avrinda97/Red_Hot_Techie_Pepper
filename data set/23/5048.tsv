2007-07-06T08:42:00.000Z	j1tters		nvidia here.
2007-07-06T08:43:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	what is the problem with beryl for you?
2007-07-06T08:44:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	try using beryl-manager
2007-07-06T08:44:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	it might be that you have not enabled a window manager...beryl is not the manger itself...
2007-07-06T08:45:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	beryl is just the effect me thinks...emerald is the manager if I am not completely wrong
2007-07-06T08:46:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	but anyway....you can't movet the window with holding Alt+click and so on?
2007-07-06T08:47:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	hmmm
2007-07-06T08:47:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	what happens when you run: emerald --replace
2007-07-06T08:47:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	?
2007-07-06T08:49:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	have you followed any instructions somewhere for this?
2007-07-06T08:49:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	which one?
2007-07-06T08:51:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	to me it sounds like beryl-manager is not working correct
2007-07-06T08:51:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_install_Beryl_.28Nvidia.29
2007-07-06T08:51:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	you followed that?
2007-07-06T08:53:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	well...when I installed and followed instructions on other sites I had problem with the same stuff as you....once I did the things on that site it worked without problems
2007-07-06T08:55:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	my suggestion is to start of from scratch with beryl and emerald...following that websites instructions
2007-07-06T08:57:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	not talking about the replace....I am talking about the whole thing about installing it
2007-07-06T08:57:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	to me it seems that emerald is not started
2007-07-06T08:58:00.000Z	scizzo-	j1tters	for example you can get a small choice about restarting the window manager and so on when you have typed beryl-manager
