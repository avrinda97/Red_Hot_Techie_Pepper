2010-10-12T05:18:00.000Z	jmichaelx		since upgrading to maverick, i notice that mplayer no longer shows up in my menu. i have mplayer, mplayer-nogui and mplayer-skins installed... should mplayer not therefore be in the menu?
2010-10-12T05:19:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	type which mplayer at the terminal
2010-10-12T05:20:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	'/usr/bin/mplayer'
2010-10-12T05:21:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	make a launcher on your desktop called Mplayer and enter /usr/bin/mplayer
2010-10-12T05:21:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	if you type mplayer in the terninal it will run the program
2010-10-12T05:22:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	i think what aeon-ltd is referring to is my issue. gmplayer has possibly been removed... checking that out right now
2010-10-12T05:22:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	type which gmplayer at the terminal
2010-10-12T05:23:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	i already know that it isn't installed... just want to see whether or not it has been removed from the repos
2010-10-12T05:24:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	read this http://software.itags.org/linux-unix/605059/
2010-10-12T05:25:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	gmplayer is just a symbolic link to mplayer
2010-10-12T05:26:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	ok, then i am back to my original question....
2010-10-12T05:26:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	so now you know gmplayer is just a symbolic link to mplayer
2010-10-12T05:29:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	wise man
2010-10-12T05:34:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	are you playing a DVD throuugh mplayer or just a regulat .avi .mpg .wmv type file ?
2010-10-12T05:34:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	.avi's, .mpg's, .flv's
2010-10-12T05:35:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	Use vlc player
2010-10-12T05:36:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	i have switched to vlc for the time being... although vlc is unable to play audio on a fair percentage of .flv's
2010-10-12T05:37:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	do you know how to build vlc from source ?
2010-10-12T05:37:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	i know how to build from source, have never done vlc, however
2010-10-12T05:38:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	building vlc from source might be a little challenging for you if your not familiar with how to obtain development libraries
2010-10-12T05:38:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	does building vlc from source require dev libs that are not in the repos?
2010-10-12T05:39:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	jmichaelx	the development libraries are in the repos I had a problem with vlc earlier this week and had to upgrade ffmpeg and build vlc from source
2010-10-12T05:40:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Quantum_Ion	so you compiled ffmpeg before you started as well then?
