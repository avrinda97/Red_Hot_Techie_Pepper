2011-03-28T18:08:00.000Z	MechanisM		so lot's errors
2011-03-28T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 the wubi 'disk file' is mountable via the mount command with the loop option.
2011-03-28T18:09:00.000Z	MechanisM	Dr_Willis	I tried but it's not mounted
2011-03-28T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 you  have to mount the file by hand. to access its contents
2011-03-28T18:10:00.000Z	MechanisM	Dr_Willis	mount /media/Murka Maxtor/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /home/mechanism/wubi -o loop
2011-03-28T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 watch out for spaces in the path.
2011-03-28T18:11:00.000Z	MechanisM	Dr_Willis	but this disk have spaces in name lol
2011-03-28T18:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 quote the path.
2011-03-28T18:12:00.000Z	MechanisM	Dr_Willis	segmentation error
2011-03-28T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 thats interesting if mount is seg faulting...
2011-03-28T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MechanisM	 be sure the dir exists.. and you may need to be doing it with 'sudo'
2011-03-28T18:15:00.000Z	MechanisM	Dr_Willis	I'm as root: root@MechanisM:/home/mechanism# mount '/media/Murka Maxtor/ubuntu/disks/root.disk' /home/mechanism/wubi -o loop and dir wubi is exists
