2006-06-18T09:57:00.000Z	dicesquirre1		Question... has anyone gotten E17 working in Dapper? If so, how?
2006-06-18T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 i found a script that downloaded/compiled E17 from CVS (i think) it worked then.. a little. :P
2006-06-18T09:58:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	I used that same script. And I suppose it worked "a little" also. But I need "totally," otherwise I can't use the danged WM, heh.
2006-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 the script worked great.. it was E that had the issues.
2006-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 i dident find it that impressive really.
2006-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	Could you direct me to this script, then?
2006-06-18T10:00:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	There's several out there, and perhaps I just wasn't using the best one.
2006-06-18T10:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 it was on the E17 site  last i looked. that was 2 mo. ago.
2006-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 i doubt it.
2006-06-18T10:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 easy_e17.sh  was the script i used :P
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	Hmm, I don't hold out much hope then. Blast... all I really want is a really nice replacement for Metacity. I'm sick and tired of how slow and bloated it is. Not to mention those ugly black rectangles :/
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 try 'sawfish' then.
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	can I just apt-get that?
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 and i TOTALLY agree on the rectangles.
2006-06-18T10:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 yea. ya could just isntall sawfish, and run the gnome panel. :P
2006-06-18T10:05:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	I'll give that a whirl. Thanks!
2006-06-18T10:06:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	Oh, and is there anywhere in the Conf-editor where I -can- turn off the black rectangles?
2006-06-18T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 not that i have EVER seen
2006-06-18T10:06:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	Arghh... I know, I looked for about an hour once. Heh.
2006-06-18T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 welcome to the GNOME (we are the boss of you!) world. :P
2006-06-18T10:07:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	Maybe you could answer one more thing that I've wondered about recently? What's the implication of the "LTS" moniker? What service are we actually talking about here? Canonical phone support, or what?
2006-06-18T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dicesquirre1	 no clue there.. Im my own tech support. :P
2006-06-18T10:09:00.000Z	dicesquirre1	Dr_Willis	I've found that LTS doesn't really mean anything outside of the norm. The standard forum help, IRC help, and wiki help that every other distro I've ever used gets. Now, if Canonical actually had free phone support, that would be something...
