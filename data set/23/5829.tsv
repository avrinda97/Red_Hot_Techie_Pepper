2006-08-25T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	what is the problem?
2006-08-25T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	do "firefox", see if there are any errors
2006-08-25T10:04:00.000Z	Eppcott	bruenig	when you say "do" firefox, is that a command line thing?
2006-08-25T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	maybe your path is messed up try "/usr/bin/firefox"
2006-08-25T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	do "ls | grep firefox", tell me the output
2006-08-25T10:11:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	the firefox executables are gone
2006-08-25T10:17:00.000Z	Eppcott	bruenig	it just repeats the prompt.
2006-08-25T10:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok, do ./firefox
2006-08-25T10:24:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	what did ./firefox do?
2006-08-25T10:24:00.000Z	Eppcott	bruenig	it's going through Google Browser Sync, which is way more than it ever did
2006-08-25T10:25:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	since your stuff is already kind of messed up. I have an idea that might work but it is untested and I can't be sure it would work
2006-08-25T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok let me think of the best most recoverable way of doing this.
2006-08-25T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	first do cd /usr/lib
2006-08-25T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok now do "sudo mv mozilla-firefox mozilla-firefox.old"
2006-08-25T10:28:00.000Z	Eppcott	bruenig	terminal still hasn't given me a prompt.
2006-08-25T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	exit out of it and get to a fresh one
2006-08-25T10:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok now do "ln -s /usr/lib/firefox /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox"
2006-08-25T10:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok now try to open firefox like you normally do. The applications menu or desktop icon or however you usually do it.
2006-08-25T10:31:00.000Z	Eppcott	bruenig	it said "ln: creating symbolic link `/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox' to `/usr/lib/firefox': Permission denied"
2006-08-25T10:32:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok yeah my fault "sudo ln -s /usr/lib/firefox /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox"
2006-08-25T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	ok a little surprised it worked to be honest but good to see it did
2006-08-25T10:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	yeah firefox looks for mozilla-firefox and that points to firefox which has everything
2006-08-25T10:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Eppcott	it should even be able to do pretty much anything you want like adding extensions or plugins because that is a system wide link so when you add plugins it will go to mozilla-firefox and then install them in firefox
