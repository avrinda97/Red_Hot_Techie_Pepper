2008-01-26T05:28:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	runaway process? right click the panel, add the system monitor. Change the colors for the processor to contrasting ones, you can see your cpu useage clearly
2008-01-26T05:29:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Which processor?
2008-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	your microprocessor. You can use that tool to see your usage. Nice graphical tool, shows a couple things clearly that top is obscure on
2008-01-26T05:31:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	There are like6 that are blue
2008-01-26T05:31:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	I have user process green, io as red, the others as blue and yellow.
2008-01-26T05:32:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	hnaz: OK, I got both these now, but it looks like they are both really low.
2008-01-26T05:33:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	when you say running slow, what exactly do you see? slow startup, slow screen repaint ....
2008-01-26T05:33:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Like, maybe it's just Opera, but that opened really slowly.
2008-01-26T05:34:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	And it runs really slowly too.
2008-01-26T05:34:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	how about other stuff? If it's just opera, then it's an opera problem not ubuntu
2008-01-26T05:35:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	I mean, I don't really use much else...vlc runs fine I suppose.
2008-01-26T05:35:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Isn't Opera the fastest browser?
2008-01-26T05:35:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	supposedly. But try some other stuff, make sure it's running right. epiphany for example, it's a quick browser
2008-01-26T05:36:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Oh, also, I don't have the normal broswer, I thought I downloaded some different version.
2008-01-26T05:36:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	test stuff.
2008-01-26T05:37:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Haha, how do I do that?
2008-01-26T05:37:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	run gedit. is it snappy after you open it? How about openoffice? once it's open, does it lag? That kind of thing
2008-01-26T05:39:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	What browser do you use?
2008-01-26T05:40:00.000Z	nickrud_	mikebot	firefox mostly.
2008-01-26T05:40:00.000Z	mikebot	nickrud_	Swift fox?
