2008-07-15T04:36:00.000Z	tamayox_		Hi there. Can anyone tell me how boot from terminal?
2008-07-15T04:36:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	you mean start the x server ?
2008-07-15T04:36:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	exactly the opposite
2008-07-15T04:37:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	I want Ubuntu to take me to the terminal before it loads X
2008-07-15T04:39:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	safe mode should work
2008-07-15T04:41:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	you just need to type sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg to restore x
2008-07-15T04:42:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	if you read /etc/X11/xorg.conf it will tell you how to restore x
2008-07-15T04:43:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	how can I? I don't have access to X or the terminal
2008-07-15T04:44:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	why not? your system should boot up into the terminal if x fails
2008-07-15T04:44:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	That's strange... it's not doing it
2008-07-15T04:45:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	if its a blank screen just use tty1 alt+control+1
2008-07-15T04:45:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	er alt+control+F1
2008-07-15T04:45:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	yeah, that's it... the screen doesn't show anything, just shows.... well, nothing
2008-07-15T04:46:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	when?
2008-07-15T04:46:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	after it "loads"?
2008-07-15T04:46:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	you have multiple tty sessions, F1 up to F6 switch to any one using alt+control+F1 to access them and fix X
2008-07-15T04:47:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	after the screen goes blank
2008-07-15T04:47:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	gnub_Chris: that will take to the terminal?
2008-07-15T04:48:00.000Z	joe_electrician	tamayox_	read /etc/X11/xorg.conf  for how to fix X... yw
2008-07-15T04:49:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	but I must be in terminal at least. ctrl+alt+F1 will take me there?
2008-07-15T04:49:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	I'm at my cousin's
2008-07-15T04:49:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	and unfurtonately he has Windows
2008-07-15T04:50:00.000Z	tamayox_	joe_electrician	unfortunately*
