2007-10-15T07:35:00.000Z	psyphen	whyuselinux	and that's it? that's the only reason you want to use linux? is because of the 3d interface? you're a strange one
2007-10-15T07:36:00.000Z	whyuselinux	psyphen	no i want to learn how to use it for MySQL databases ect..
2007-10-15T07:36:00.000Z	psyphen	whyuselinux	i would recommend installing it on a virtual machine rather than dual-booting if you really want to try it
2007-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	whyuselinux	psyphen	virtual machine... how do i do this ?
