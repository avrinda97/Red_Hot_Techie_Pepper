2009-07-03T06:02:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: which driver are you using?  ati or fglrx?
2009-07-03T06:02:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	I'm not too sure, how can i check?
2009-07-03T06:02:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	I'm using whatever came with ubuntu, I didn't install any drivers or anything
2009-07-03T06:03:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	hmh, so is there anyway I can check?
2009-07-03T06:05:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	I just pasted everyting :P : http://pastebin.com/m460e2404
2009-07-03T06:06:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	that I know :P . it's jaunty yeah 9.04
2009-07-03T06:07:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	I've actually looked there for teh restricted drivers, but nothing ever came up
2009-07-03T06:07:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	nope, nothing there
2009-07-03T06:08:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	hmm, so there's no other driver I can use?
2009-07-03T06:08:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	like on Windows it runs fine with the driver from ATI
2009-07-03T06:09:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	ATI radeon x800gt
2009-07-03T06:10:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	well see the reason is a game as simple as tremulous runs slow when i WIndows I could play cs:source great
2009-07-03T06:12:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	yeah i know :) it's odd cause in like previous version of ubuntu that I've tried liek i beleive 8.10 I would get a popup for restricted drivers but not in 9.04
2009-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	I'm kind of new to all this so I would install it with  xf86-video-ati? but then how would I get it to use that driver
2009-07-03T06:19:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	yeah, this might actually even fix the issue I have where I start the computer and it starts in low res randomly sometimes
2009-07-03T06:19:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	glxgear? is it in the repos?
2009-07-03T06:20:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	ohh ok gears :P i did it with gear
2009-07-03T06:20:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	hmm 16720 frames in 5.0 seconds = 3343.920 FPS
2009-07-03T06:21:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	yes, but i kill it before gameplay most times
2009-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	actually I change it using the fusion-icon :)
2009-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	tremuluos for instance
2009-07-03T06:25:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	ohh ok then i guess i dont need it
2009-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	rch2	ohh :( its okay let me see im gonna play with it see what happens
