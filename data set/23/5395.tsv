2006-12-26T09:56:00.000Z	x-r00t-x		how do i register those c++ header file?
2006-12-26T09:56:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	not "register" - just #include them
2006-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	done much C programming before ? ;-)
2006-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	i mean where do i put those file ... yeah i know
2006-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	kindda but on windows
2006-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	they have to be already present when you include them, obviously
2006-12-26T09:58:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	where is <file>.h located at?
2006-12-26T09:59:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	locate ?
2006-12-26T10:01:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	you don't - you donwload (or better, *install*) the development version of whatever library that has that file
2006-12-26T10:01:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	but every linux distribution has stdio.h
2006-12-26T10:02:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	 you mean build-essential?
2006-12-26T10:02:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	probably, yes
2007-01-07T08:12:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	you should have left it alone in the first place :)
2007-01-07T08:12:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	i already did something.
2007-01-07T08:12:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	the proper permissions are 40755
2007-01-07T08:13:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	yep
2007-01-07T08:13:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	adaptr	[~]  ->> $ chmod 40755 ~
2007-01-07T08:14:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	yes, the 4 is set with another util
2007-01-07T08:15:00.000Z	adaptr	x-r00t-x	you can set 0755 with chmod, though - I thnk the 4 is set with chattr or something
