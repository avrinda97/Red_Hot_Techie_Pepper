2006-06-23T15:58:00.000Z	DShepherd	splashtech	what do you mean they are not working?
2006-06-23T16:00:00.000Z	DShepherd	splashtech	are you connected to the internet?

2006-06-24T16:02:00.000Z	splashtech	DShepherd	yeah me too. Bloody annoying though. Thanks anyway :)

2006-06-24T16:14:00.000Z	splashtech	DShepherd	you think it might be worth running x/k/ubuntu on another machine here to see if it has the same repository issues?
2006-06-24T16:20:00.000Z	DShepherd	splashtech	its the default sources right?
2006-06-24T16:20:00.000Z	splashtech	DShepherd	everying is as installed
