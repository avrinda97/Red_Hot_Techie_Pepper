2007-01-16T06:51:00.000Z	zYe		can anyone explain ./configure --prefix=/usr to me?  the "--prefix=/usr" part of the command doesnt make sense to me
2007-01-16T06:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	It means: yo, program! I want you to install everything in /usr, so your libs will be in /usr/lib, executables in /usr/bin/, etc.
2007-01-16T06:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	By default, programs installed from source use the /usr/local prefix -> /usr/local/lib/, /usr/local/bin/, etc.
2007-01-16T06:53:00.000Z	zYe	arrenlex	how does it know which program it is installing?
2007-01-16T06:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	What do you mean?
2007-01-16T06:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	The configure script? The configure script exists to set up your source for compilation. It's tailored to the program it sets up.
2007-01-16T06:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	Look for what?
2007-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	It's a script.
2007-01-16T07:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	You don't understand the syntax. ./ means "in the current folder", and configure is the name of the executable in the current folder.
2007-01-16T07:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	Try cding to /usr/bin and running ./gedit
2007-01-16T07:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	Now try running ./gedit from your home folder.
2007-01-16T07:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	There is a gedit file which you can execute in the /usr/bin folder. Not in your home folder.
2007-01-16T07:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	*facepalm*
2007-01-16T07:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	./ means "current folder" just like /usr means "in the /usr folder". Understand?
2007-02-07T12:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	This closer?
2007-02-07T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	mencoder is a linear editor. You're probably looking for a nonlinear editor.
2007-02-07T12:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	I.E. Mencoder is exactly what it says -- an encoder. i.e. you can reencode a movie, or apply video filters, or cut it, or pull it up, or other technical things. But you can't splice a clip of your horse onto a clip of your daughter and add shiny text.
2007-02-07T12:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	Also, mencoder is commandline
2007-02-07T12:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	As to those, Linux is sadly lacking. :(
2007-02-07T12:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	You could try blender's movie compositor. Or heroine.
2007-02-07T12:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	zYe	No, heroine is the association... the editor is called cinelerra
