2010-01-09T23:32:00.000Z	infid		what linux tool can tell me what motherboard i have?
2010-01-09T23:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	lshw
2010-01-09T23:38:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	if you're having trouble with the network manager i would recommend you install wicd, it's much better
2010-01-14T09:38:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	this is not a debian channel
2010-01-15T03:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	ram has nothing to do with how fast a program starts up
2010-01-15T03:19:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	well it's also a quad core cpu
2010-01-15T03:19:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	with an nvidia geforce 9500gt
2010-01-15T03:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	firefox is a big bloated program. your cpu has a bit to do with it, gpu has nothing to do with it. the bottleneck is your hard drive
2010-01-15T03:20:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	it's a fresh install of ubuntu on a 500gb sata drive
2010-01-15T03:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	ubuntu isn't exactly the leanest, quickest distro of linux. firefox is a very large program and unless you're using an SSD (like i am) it will take a few seconds to open
2010-01-16T01:03:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	have you tried mmv?
2010-01-16T01:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	nope, should i?
2010-01-16T01:04:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	if you like the cli, it can do that gprename stuff from the cli
2010-01-16T01:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	oh ok, i'll give it a tryr
2010-01-23T04:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	check sshd_config
2010-01-23T04:30:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	thanks
2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	you could, you know, enable the root account
2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	 how
2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	but i'm sure someone will flip out at the thought of using the super scary root account on ubuntu
2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	sudo passwd root
2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	well is there a better alternative
2010-01-31T00:13:00.000Z	infid	blakkheim	thanks for trying to help. i guess we both learned something
2010-10-11T01:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	infid	EDITOR=vim visudo
