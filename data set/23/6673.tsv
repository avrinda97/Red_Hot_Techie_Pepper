2006-06-17T07:23:00.000Z	_rodney		is that 1 o or somit as well
2006-06-17T07:25:00.000Z	_rodney		just use another one like gparted or somit... first...
2006-06-17T07:27:00.000Z	_rodney		try using another partition manager to set up the partitions... im sure really... ;(
2006-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	_rodney		whats yer prob again Draconicus  ?
2006-06-17T07:29:00.000Z	_rodney		oh right missing xinitrc
2006-06-17T07:29:00.000Z	_rodney		just put a text file in there with the name of the window manager in it
2006-06-17T07:30:00.000Z	Draconicus	_rodney	'kay
2006-06-17T07:31:00.000Z	Draconicus	_rodney	Looks like this is a problem with broken packages, as there is a "xinitrc.dpkg-new" in there, but no xinitrc.
2006-06-17T07:31:00.000Z	_rodney		yep
2006-06-17T07:32:00.000Z	_rodney		theres a simple but special format for that file.. i cant find it now tho
2006-06-17T07:32:00.000Z	Draconicus	_rodney	Can that file be renamed, or should I just make one like you first suggested?
2006-06-17T07:32:00.000Z	_rodney		its gotta be that name thats its looking for
2006-06-17T07:32:00.000Z	Draconicus		Yeah. I'm just worried that the extension means something... eh... I'll nano it.

2006-06-17T07:33:00.000Z	_rodney		http://www.strath.ac.uk/CC/Courses/oldXC/subsection3_9_3.html
2006-06-17T07:33:00.000Z	_rodney		it just runs the window manager
2006-06-17T07:33:00.000Z	Draconicus	_rodney	Hmm. It's just a complicated bash shell. Should be the right thing.
2006-06-17T07:34:00.000Z	_rodney		yeah most of it.. you dont need... you only the start relevant window manager command really
2006-06-17T07:34:00.000Z	_rodney	chriseba	er there should be a install prog you can click on
2006-06-17T07:35:00.000Z	_rodney		you need 2... 1 label as swap and make double size of ram
2006-06-17T07:35:00.000Z	_rodney		other is file the os make as big as you can.. and label it "/" without the ""
2006-06-17T07:36:00.000Z	_rodney		so you already have set up the partitions ok ?
2006-06-17T07:36:00.000Z	Draconicus	_rodney	All fixed. Should I report this problem somewhere?
