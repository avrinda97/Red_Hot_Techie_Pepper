2010-01-28T20:08:00.000Z	Yoshio		I have massive problems running ubuntu on my AMD 3200+ with Geforce 6800GT. when i surf on the net I have massive lag on almost any site
2010-01-28T20:09:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	what video card drivers do you have installed?
2010-01-28T20:09:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	Nvidia 185 i belive
2010-01-28T20:10:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	it's really painfull to use
2010-01-28T20:11:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	what is the output of this command 'glxinfo | grep dir
2010-01-28T20:11:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	direct rendering: Yes GL_EXT_direct_state_access, GL_EXT_draw_range_elements, GL_EXT_fog_coord
2010-01-28T20:12:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	so what kind of lag do you experience on websites? is it bad when you scroll down fast?
2010-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	yeah and it's not only flash sites that are "slow"
2010-01-28T20:14:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	glxinfo | grep "server glx vendor"?
2010-01-28T20:17:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	server glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
2010-01-28T20:17:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	have you restarted since you activated the nvidia drivers?
2010-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	have you tried another browser?
2010-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	yes... I have had this problem for like 1 year :)
2010-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	yes opera works much better than firefox
2010-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	does flash lag in opera?
2010-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	abit but not nearly as much as in firefox
2010-01-28T20:20:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	what about on live cd - just to cancel out your hard drive as the problem... does it lag in live mode?
2010-01-28T20:20:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	from what i remember the live cd did actually work much better
2010-01-28T20:22:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	because now using firefox is almost unusable
2010-01-28T20:23:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	it's that bad? have you tried re-installing it?
2010-01-28T20:25:00.000Z	Yoshio	boomernang	maybe there is something wrong with my harddrive since it's kinda old
2010-01-28T20:27:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	i don't think it's that bad.. you just need to do the annoying work of trial and error.. you know opera works abit better..  so try another browser that is basically the same as firefox like konqueror or something
2010-01-28T20:28:00.000Z	boomernang	Yoshio	and then you can work out what is going on...  did you upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10? or still on 9.04?
