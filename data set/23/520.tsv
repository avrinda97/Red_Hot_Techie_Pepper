2012-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	blud		i'm trying to use this program called Freevo, but my mplayer has problems so i want freevo to use VLC and I can't seem to get it to use it even though I swear I changed it to vlc in the conf file...  (And/or I need help fixing mplayer)
2012-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	what's the issue with mplayer exactly?
2012-02-18T08:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	try "mplayer -ao pulse file.foo" or "mplayer -ao alsa file.foo"
2012-02-18T08:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	you could set it in .mplayer/config if one works, and freevo "should" pick up the change
2012-02-18T08:42:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	ok, pulse has no audio but alsa did
2012-02-18T08:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	there should be a way to set that in ~/.mplayer/config (not easy for me to websearch right now, or I'd look it up for you)
2012-02-19T04:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	does the laptop have some keycombination to enable/disable video out?
2012-02-19T04:53:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	yeah fn-f7, if i press it, the laptop screen goes dark, but the tv still receives no signal. and no matter how many times i do that the tv wont receive a signal. Also, i cant get the screen back on the laptop and i have to reboot
2012-02-19T04:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	yuck.  well, good luck!
2012-02-19T04:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	VERY good question, i'd have no idea for intel...
2012-02-19T05:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	"lspci | grep -i vga" to find you video card
2012-02-19T05:01:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	it just says what i have been saying  Intel Corp 82852/855M integrated graphics device
2012-02-19T05:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	FYI things will be better in the long run if you solve your issue using Ubuntu package vs. installing a driver manually
2012-02-19T05:02:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	i would be happy to do that, any idea how? :p
2012-02-19T05:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	nope, sorry.
2012-02-19T05:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	there is some ppa-purge command/script out there that can remove PPA and the software installed.
2012-02-19T05:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	i'm not sure on the actual name
2012-02-19T05:40:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	ok thank you! finally an answer to this lol... I googled a page that fully explains it. Now I can try the new driver and be able to revert if need be
2012-02-21T08:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	does you laptop have some hotkey combination to toggle video out?
2012-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	it does but it seems to do nothing
2012-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	blud	zykotick9	back in mythbuntu hitting it (fn-f8) would blank out the laptop screen, but now in lubuntu it has no effect
2012-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	what GPU does it use?
2012-02-21T08:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	blud	sorry, i'm not familiar at all with lxde.  Good luck.
