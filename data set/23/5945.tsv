2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	inmanix		will i not lose data? i mean iv got 170GB free
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	inmanix		sure
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	inmanix		and second question, what setup would you recommend for partitions? just two partitions for XP and linux and room for files?
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	inmanix		someone suggested 4 partitions, 10gb for ubuntu, 20 for xp, then one shared NTSF and another dedicated for linux
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	inmanix		and what is the recommended swap file size for 2gb ram? 4000?
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	inmanix		i will be light gaming on wine though
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	inmanix		ok
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	inmanix		im somehwat of a 1 day old ubuntu noob, but im assuming 'suspend to disk- is not a requirement?
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	inmanix		aye
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	inmanix		okay, so i need ext4 for files, i need a ext4 for ubunutu which i already have, i need a fat32 for shared and i need a ntfs for windows?
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	I just joined, what are you trying to do?
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	you don't need Fat32,   Ubuntu since 7.10 (October 2007) can read and write to NTFS properly,  as long as Windows shut it down properly
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	ok thanks for the pm telling me what you want to do
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	by default Ubuntu  puts everything into  /  which is like C in Windows
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	however it also gives people some swap space,  which is virtual memory in Windows
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	a home is like my documents,  and program files kind of,  well just program user data in hidden .folders   for programs in a home.   by default   home goes in  /  ,but  some of us like having a seperate /home partition, because that makes re installing Ubuntu or even changing to another distro a bit easier
2010-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	for example .mozilla is the Firefox profile, if you remove/move it and then re open Firefox, it's like your using it on Ubuntu for your first time
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	yeah do like 10GB for / that's right you don't need much space for Ubuntu itself, when you got a big seperate /home
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	swap space, well  that depends on how much RAM, how big you make it
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	and if you want to hibernate and such or not
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	yes that's right .wine  the hidden .wine folder is your wine programs
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	by the way you have told me you want to game right,  well there's this idea that Deskop Linux sucks for gaming,  but that really is not the case, there are some pretty good native games for it, and quite a lot of games will work well enough in Wine,  ok so some/many need to be configured a bit first for Wine
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	inmanix	just wanted to be clear, that  there are good games for Desktop Linux as well
