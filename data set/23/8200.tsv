2011-09-23T19:56:00.000Z	WinCamXP		Hello!
2011-09-23T19:57:00.000Z	WinCamXP		I wanted to know how well Ubuntu would run on a Toshiba Satellite 1115-S103
2011-09-23T19:57:00.000Z	WinCamXP		If I'm not mistaken, it has 512MB of RAM
2011-09-23T19:58:00.000Z	WinCamXP		my internet was just out though, dont know how well downloading an entire ISO of ubuntu would work
2011-09-23T19:58:00.000Z	WinCamXP		hmm, I read on the forums, sometime before '08 these two guys had toshiba laptops and had button artifacting issues, they turned something off in their xorg config to fix it
2011-09-23T19:59:00.000Z	WinCamXP		would this still apply 3 years later?
2011-09-23T19:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 perhaps not. My x505 works fine
2011-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 learn to use screen and or byobu.
2011-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 or just ssh in again from a new putty/ssh/whatever terminal
2011-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 or start the command with a & at the end to spawn it to the background.
2011-11-20T23:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 screen would be a good tool to learn
2011-11-20T23:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 i mentioned &  - read up on bash job controll
2011-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 you start screen and use it as your shell]
2011-11-20T23:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 you start the tool befor the sh command.. its that simple
2011-11-20T23:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 OR if this is a ubuntu box. use byobu, its a more friendly screen variant
2011-11-20T23:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 your script has nothing to do with screen....
2011-11-20T23:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 so... install and run byobu, set it to be your default shell.. and awy you go.. run  your server, start a new terminal... repeat as needed
2011-11-20T23:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 no.. its all a multiplexed single window.
2011-11-20T23:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 you really should spend 20 min or so reading some screen tutorials.
2011-11-20T23:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 or just use byobu instead of screen http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3906541/Byobu-Like-Screen-but-Better.htm
2011-11-20T23:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 screen will give you a multiplxed shell.. yes
2011-11-20T23:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 if you get disconnected.. you reconnect, and run screen and all will be as you left it.
2011-11-20T23:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	WinCamXP	 you are confiused about terms.. you ssh to the server, and screen runs ON the server.
