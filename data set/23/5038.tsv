2007-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	WOW! is that guide current? if it is... just... wow.
2007-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	it is dated, but it is still useful.
2007-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	friggin amazing. Thankyou so much. That is going to be a wonderful read :)
2007-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	yep, I keep it at the top of my bookmarks.
2007-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	might take a few weeks but still. Thanks!
2007-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	weeks!? :)
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	the Rute manual is Red Hat based, so it focuses on RPMS, not debs, but RPMs can be converted to debs, with Alien.
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	any other comprehensive guides?
2007-06-10T06:21:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	nothing I've come across that compares to Rute.
2007-06-10T06:21:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	I will read it with caution then. Thankyou :)
2007-06-10T06:22:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	Yes, and also, RH uses lilo as the boot loader, not grub. But 95% of stuff in there is still relevant.
2007-06-10T06:27:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	I understand your enthusiasm, I wish I had found Rute five years ago.
2007-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	This guide is extremely comprehensive.
2007-06-10T06:29:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	Yep, If you can read and comprehend it and "weeks" my hat is off to you. :)
2007-06-10T06:29:00.000Z	omegacenti	n2diy	so you think it will take longer eh? :)
2007-06-10T06:30:00.000Z	n2diy	omegacenti	I don't try to read it, I just use it as a reference. :)
