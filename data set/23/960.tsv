2010-11-05T07:45:00.000Z	roasted		why is it when I delete emails in evolution, they just come back after 20 seconds????
2010-11-05T07:46:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	using pop¿
2010-11-05T07:48:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	then just drag them to the trash directory instead of deleting it using the evolution menu
2010-11-05T07:49:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	is that a serious suggestion
2010-11-05T08:26:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	like i said, just trad them to your trash folder
2010-11-05T08:26:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	that cant be a serious suggestion.
2010-11-05T08:26:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	when I delete an email, it should delete.
2010-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	you see that folders in your IMAP account¿¿ in the sidebar on evolution¿¿ just drag the file to the TRASH FOLDER
2010-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	you've told me this like 8 times.
2010-11-05T08:43:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	and I'm going to tell you something for the 8th time.
2011-07-04T06:27:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	multiboot ¿ i use multi sysmem http://liveusb.info/dotclear/
2011-11-27T05:33:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	if you mean the launcher, no
2011-11-27T05:34:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	oh, sweet. So for two monitors I have to clock the whole way to the left o use it?
2012-05-27T19:48:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	as in a video embeded in a site¿
2012-05-27T19:48:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	pretty much. I have .AVI files hosted off of my server for my video surveillance feed. I can click on them and play them fine in FF but not Chrome. I just get a black screen.
2012-05-27T19:49:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	I can easily use FF, but I find it hard to believe Chrome wouldn't support this.
2012-05-27T19:50:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	then i asume firefox uses the totem plugin¿ tried adding the extracodecs to chromium¿ chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra
2012-05-27T19:52:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	would chromium plugins apply to chrome? I'm using the official google chrome .deb from google's site, not chromium from the repos.
2012-05-27T19:52:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	if you are using chrome it already uses it i believe, no idea then sorry
2012-05-27T19:52:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	well dang, hm okay. Thanks for trying!
2012-05-27T19:52:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	I gotta run anyway, I'll post on forums and see what sticks. Have a good one.
2012-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	xangua	roasted	sound like you changed your wallpaper for something blue
2012-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	roasted	xangua	nah, wallpaper didn't change for the last... 3 weeks?
