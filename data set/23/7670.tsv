2006-08-15T11:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	there's about 18,000 programs in Ubuntu's repositories, that'll keep you busy for a while
2006-08-15T11:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	when you install stuff thru Add/Remove Apps or Synaptic, they're coming from Ubuntu's online repositories
2006-08-15T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	really? You don't get a popup when you put a blank CD-R in your burner?
2006-08-15T11:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	blank DVDs should get a popup too, asking if you want to burn a DVD
2006-08-15T11:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	do normal CDs get automounted?
2006-08-15T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	when you put a blank CD or DVD in your burner, does it show up in the file manager?
2006-08-15T12:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	Places->Home Folder, CD-R or DVD-R should show up at the bottom of the list
2006-08-15T12:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	odd - it looks like your system isn't auto-mounting stuff. What happens when you put an audio CD in?
2006-08-15T12:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	or an existing data CD
2006-08-15T12:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	cool, was it just really slow to start?
2006-08-15T12:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	yes, just drag & drop, there's a Burn button on the top-right
2006-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	are you trying to see a Windows HDD from Ubuntu?
2006-08-15T12:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	& ivx - check your PMs & follow those URLs ;)
2006-08-15T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	some games, thru wine or Cedega, yes. There are Linux ports of popular games, too
2006-08-15T12:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	cedega is payware
2006-08-15T12:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	first, ease up on the Enter key, please
2006-08-15T12:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	davidrincon2006	DNS issues are more likely to be your ISP's problem, in my experience
