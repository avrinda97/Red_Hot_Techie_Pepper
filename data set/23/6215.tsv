2006-09-01T08:34:00.000Z	pestilence		so i have a 6.06 cd in my cdrom.  and i ran apt-cdrom add, and ran apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade.  but it only wanted to upgrade like 4 packages.  what gives?
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	alternate CD right?
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	no, it's a kubuntu cd
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	but is it alternate or desktop (live)?
2006-09-01T08:37:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	it's the official kubuntu cd, official press
2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	the kubuntu desktop CD is not suitable for upgrades
2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	oh that's great.
2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	 how did you determine that?
2006-09-01T08:40:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	says it on the download page: http://releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/6.06.1/
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	oh that's great :)
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	i believe you need the alternate CD for that, or just do a a regular upgrade using the internet
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	that doesn't really make sense, since if i installed it from scratch using this cd it would install all the packages that i want to upgrade
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	*sigh*
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	thanks, though
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	the desktop (live) cds work completly different, they don't have packages per say, it's like transfering an image
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	ah.
2006-09-01T08:43:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	so even with the ubuntu cd, you have to have the "alternate install" cd to upgrade?
2006-09-01T08:43:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	guess so
2006-09-01T08:43:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	that kinda stinks for people like me, but i guess it works well for most others
2006-09-01T08:44:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	you are currently using kubuntu 5.10?
2006-09-01T08:45:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	yes
2006-09-01T08:45:00.000Z	JoseStefan	pestilence	ok, just wanted to confirm
2006-09-01T10:03:00.000Z	pestilence	JoseStefan	kubuntu uses adept
