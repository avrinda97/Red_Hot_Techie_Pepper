2008-05-22T13:05:00.000Z	jsoft		Anyone know how to get rid of the stupid mplayer or or whatever it is plugin for firefox? Im trying to watch a movie and it I want the normal flash type player
2008-05-22T13:06:00.000Z	jsoft		I think it might be some lame flash replacement or something
2008-05-22T13:06:00.000Z	jsoft		ahh, totem
2008-05-22T13:06:00.000Z	jsoft		is there something which works better?
2008-05-22T13:07:00.000Z	jsoft		Better at playing movies in firefox
2008-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	jsoft		You kinda need a front end for iptables, as its not exactly intuitive or easy
2008-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	geremy	jsoft	not intuitive, no, but there are existing total lockdown scripts, and you're better off modifying that than exposing gnome's codebase
2008-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	jsoft		http://www.gametrailers.com/player/12866.html <- as an example
2008-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	jsoft	geremy	total lockdown scripts?
2008-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	jsoft		eh?
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	geremy	jsoft	scripts that totally shutdown traffic in both directions, port by port
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	geremy		nitricacid: ok
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	jsoft	geremy	oh right :/
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	geremy		nitricacid: all you need is port 80 open
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	jsoft		I think firewalls are somewhat overrated
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	geremy	jsoft	?
2008-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	jsoft	geremy	yes you heard me.
2008-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	geremy		nitricacid: this is not production, so make sure your router is not forwarding to 80
2008-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	geremy	jsoft	firewalls are pretty much the first line technology- a bad one pretty much means you're screwed
2008-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	jsoft	geremy	rubbish
2008-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	geremy		nitricacid: yeah
2008-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	jsoft		I guess it is.
2008-05-22T13:13:00.000Z	geremy	jsoft	if you want to tell me why you think that, pm me
