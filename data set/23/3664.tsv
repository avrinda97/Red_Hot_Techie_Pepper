2008-12-22T11:33:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		can I use Conky to monitor some other servers in my network so they display on my desktop at my workstation?
2008-12-22T11:33:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	monitor as in...?
2008-12-22T11:34:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	well, so it'll monitor my network boxes like it can monitor my workstation .. so a server/client situation but display it on my desktop.
2008-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	think Google just turned up a little tutorial ..
2008-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	monitor their activity?
2008-12-22T11:36:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	Yeah, it'll monitor hdd use, network activity, ram, cpu load etc etc . I just want to have a few of my servers showing my live stats on my desktop ..
2008-12-22T11:37:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	that assumes you have a script that can ssh to the server and run an app like htop and return the output
2008-12-22T11:38:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	Looks like a simply -X ssh session will do it. I'll just have to squirt out a bash script that'll fire it up ..
2008-12-22T11:45:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	you run conky on the headless server?
2008-12-22T11:45:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	Yes, it's running fine .. I just use the -X when I ssh over, and it pops up on my desktop ..
2008-12-22T11:45:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	the server's are all w/out Xserver ..
2008-12-22T11:48:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	i know, thus "headless". do you have a desktop on the monitoring pc?
2008-12-22T11:49:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	I run conky on all my servers (headless) and on this workstation I simply crack open term, ssh with the -X option into my servers and start conky as normal .. ssh -X 192.168.0.12 then simply type conky and it pops up on my desktop with the server's info ..
2008-12-22T11:50:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	right now I'm trying to figure out screen placement; they overlap currently if I start more than one machine's conky
2008-12-22T11:52:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	i think you are doing it the wrong way. i think running ONE conky on the monitoring pc and use the output of some other app to monitor the server. maybe some nagios will do
2008-12-22T11:53:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	I've got Nagios and Munin but I need to use a web browser to monitor. If I use conky or gkrellm I can simply use ssh and they'll stay on my desktop (behind all the windows; like a widget sort of) .. Nagios is fine and Munin reports usefully stuff too, but they aren't easy enough to acces like GKrellM or Conky .
2008-12-22T11:54:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	Here is a simple version of what I'm doing: http://spiraledoutward.blogspot.com/2008/06/monitoring-remote-systems-using-conky.html
2008-12-22T11:55:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	cant nagios output to text? simple text. otherwise point it (conky) to the nagios web interface and use grep to isolate the info you need
2008-12-22T11:56:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	yes it can, but still, it doesn't simply show live stats on my desktop "stuck to my desktop" like GKrellM and Conky can .. Nagios is also a bear to keep setup .. I've got 14 machines (8 servers) and setting Nagios up for them took days for me.
2008-12-22T11:57:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	make a script then that will run the conky right after ssh login
2008-12-22T11:58:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	that's what I'm thinking might work .. just need to find out how to give my pw when the script knocks on the other machines ssh door ..
2008-12-22T11:59:00.000Z	jim_p	NineTeen67Comet	i think this will be on ssh manual or inthe ssh settings
2008-12-22T11:59:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	jim_p	aha lol .. kept forgetting to man ssh .. lemme dig a little I'm getting it figured out a little .. thanks for the ideas though .. it's got my gray matter working a little better today ..
