2007-01-16T12:01:00.000Z	harry	michaelpo	in linux just install thunderbird locally and link the local configs to the portable configs or write a script to sync them when u plug in the hdd
2007-01-16T12:02:00.000Z	harry	michaelpo	just "sudo apt-get install thunderbird" its in the repos
2007-01-16T12:02:00.000Z	harry	michaelpo	no need to emulate it - there is a linux version of thunderbird
2007-01-16T12:04:00.000Z	harry	michaelpo	holyduck, as i said - link the configs so your pc sees the ones on the usb disk when its plugged in
