2010-03-20T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	did you visit the link in the output?
2010-03-20T22:53:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	lol its down..  i forgot to mention that
2010-03-20T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	have you websearched the error? Does the cam work in cheese?
2010-03-20T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	I see, websearch how to get the jasper thing, you'll find guides
2010-05-17T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	P4 is a nice chip range
2010-05-17T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	outdated means nothing. If it does its task at a reasonable speed and is faultless then its fine
2010-05-17T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	if all its for is web browsing then its more than enough, isn't it?
2010-05-17T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	therefore outdated is nonesense. Its up to the job it needs to do.
2010-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	you can mount them using /etc/fstab .its a well documented file
2010-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	lol yes i know, this would the 5th time i think of having to do this for 3-4 hdds at once, and all this year =/
2010-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	then have a backed up fstab file you can copy bits out of then, makes sense
2010-05-17T11:30:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	how about ill give you the UUID's of them they are all ext4 and you output them for me =/
2010-05-17T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	because I'm on a G1 phone so it'd take me forever. Can you please cease punctuating with =/ ,its really redundant
2010-10-13T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	yep, its the fastest growing distro available
2010-10-13T10:58:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	what a pity
2010-10-13T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	you dont have to use it
2010-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	oh i dont
2010-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	problem solved
2010-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	but what about all the poor little noobs that are content with a bloated slow system and know no better
2010-10-13T11:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[Screamo]	you can install the minimal and get an unbloated OS
2010-10-13T11:01:00.000Z	[Screamo]	ActionParsnip	nah bad ubuntu is bad
