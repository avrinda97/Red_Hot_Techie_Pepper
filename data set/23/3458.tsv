2009-01-16T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	the blackberry is not syncable with linux, there are tools in development but they are quite beta
2009-01-16T22:38:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	oh now you tell me
2009-01-16T22:39:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	you tried it before?
2009-01-16T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	I did some big research into it before purchasing a black berry and decided against it for this very reason
2009-01-16T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	it uses a propriatary bluetooth stack and the cable is not standard even for sync
2009-01-16T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	sorry to bring you bad news
2009-01-16T22:40:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	well it seem it work when connected with usb cable directly.
2009-01-16T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	really ? you can sync it with the cable, I read it as a diffeent pin out
2009-01-16T22:41:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	actually is like a media, or reconize as storage, but I can that a different matter of a sort
2009-01-16T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	yes, it will see it as a dumb disk
2009-01-16T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	shouldn't be syncable though
2009-01-16T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	(unless you use the development tools, which where hit and miss when I tried them with my demo phone)
2009-01-16T22:43:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	well suck for my blackbery
2009-01-16T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	I know - it's bad news, there is a protest filed with rim over it, but nothing will be changing
2009-01-16T22:43:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	don't feel like getting another phone and I still like my blackberry
2009-01-16T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	I concur - I liked mine, but swapped it within 14 days due to this problem
2009-01-16T22:44:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	what phone work with ubuntu?
2009-01-16T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	nokie E71
2009-01-16T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	that was my replacment for the blackberry bold, just as good, smaller lighter and supported with linux
2009-01-16T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	mysticdarkhack	no idea
2009-01-16T22:47:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ikonia	thank for the help and info. Now I'm going to get my finger reader working
