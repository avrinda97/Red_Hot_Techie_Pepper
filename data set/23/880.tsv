2011-02-20T04:12:00.000Z	induz_		I know its personal coice but for a MS window guy

2011-08-01T05:00:00.000Z	induz_	ActionParsnip	I am back sorry
2011-08-01T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	was the hash ok?
2011-08-01T05:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	if you websearch for the hash you generated, it should find pages
2011-08-01T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	possibly
2011-08-01T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	if you search for the hash in a search engine, you should find results if it matches
2011-08-01T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	its clearly too taxing for you and this is getting really boring: http://duckduckgo.com/?q=5341d0e3e692246c22ad7dd31c94c828+austrumi-1.8.5.iso
2011-08-01T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	there is a hit, your file is fine
2011-08-01T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	your file is fine. I suggest you ask in the channel for your chosen distro
2011-08-01T05:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	the OS is also based on BSD, not mint
2011-08-01T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	I suggest you ask in the austumi irc channel for support, your issue is not with ubuntu
2011-08-01T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	unetbootin may use it, theremay be an issue with the OS and unetbootin which will be given in the austrumi channel;
2011-08-01T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	yes, tahts why I gave the above
2011-08-01T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	they all can, the ISO is 700Mb
2011-08-01T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	ok...?
2011-08-01T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	there will be on the unetbooting page, I thought the GUI was pretty self explanatory
2011-08-01T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	just so you are aware, mint isnt supported here
2011-09-29T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	induz_	loads and loads
