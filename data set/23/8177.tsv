2005-06-09T06:59:00.000Z	lesshaste		is it true that there is no official upgrade process from one version of ubuntu to another?
2005-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	lesshaste		or to put it another way, how to upgrade from one ubuntu version to the next??
2005-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	ubuntuguide.org has it
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	 Warning! This is still in it's development stage. Only use it for experimental purposes
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	I was going Warthog to Hoary
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	What did gave you that error
2005-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	no error. I am reading ubuntuguide like you said
2005-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	http://ubuntuguide.org/#upgradehoarytobreezy
2005-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	ufff.. Hoary to breeze is not warty to hoary
2005-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	yes... I want warty to hoary
2005-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	there are no docs for that
2005-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	you need to use ubuntuguide for warty
2005-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	ah! found that
2005-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	thx.. strange that when you put in the hoary cd it doesn't offer to upgrade
2005-06-09T07:11:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	I guess that it's not so smart that it would know to offer you upgrading when you insert some cd in, and it most often needs net to upgrade
2005-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	I mean it complains that there is an existing install without offering to upgrade it
2005-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	it's not like it can't recognise warty!
2005-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	ahhh.. you mean that when you start the install from the cd..
2005-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	exactly
2005-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	well, don't know about it. but wild guess would be that there is a reason for that
2005-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	lesshaste	thenuke	:) laziness on the part of the unpaid developer ?
2005-06-09T07:16:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	might be true aswell, dont really know :)
2005-06-09T07:16:00.000Z	thenuke	lesshaste	but I guess that they believe that about every user has net
