2012-11-20T22:40:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		theres always that chance
2012-11-20T22:41:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		thats why its a good idea to research before buying
2012-11-20T22:41:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		google it is for free
2012-11-20T22:41:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		:D
2012-11-20T22:42:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		i would
2012-11-20T22:42:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		compare to what the support list says for ubuntu
2012-11-20T22:42:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		windows will alway cover more but checking with the support info for ubuntu you cant go wrong
2012-11-20T22:43:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		slow ssd? dabas
2012-11-20T22:44:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		theres a lot of cheap SSD's out there
2012-11-20T22:44:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	I did not bought the fasted ssd, but compared 2hours compared to a 20 minutes is to much
2012-11-20T22:46:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	yesterday I installed fedora 17 on the desktop and the ssd is working pretty fast (faster the mechanical) It's like that dpkg is taken to much tme
2012-11-20T22:47:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	is that SSD listed in the supported hardware?
2012-11-20T22:47:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	will check is immediately
2012-11-20T22:50:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	yeah SSD drives are no where near replacing a regular harddrive just yet
2012-11-20T22:54:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	what ver of ubuntu?
2012-11-20T22:55:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	ive always thought that a fresh install is better than a upgrade
2012-11-20T22:55:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	yes it is fresh installed
2012-11-20T22:59:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	Will check it
2012-11-20T23:02:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	On the top of the drive there is no label, but this is the site: http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx?imodule=CT128V4SSD2
2012-11-20T23:04:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	if there is nothing to identify the drive on the outside, it could be anything.
2012-11-20T23:05:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	DaBas	figuring out what that drive is will help
2012-11-20T23:06:00.000Z	DaBas	MrELusiveness	thx for help already
