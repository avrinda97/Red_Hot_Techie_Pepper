2009-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	LinuX2half		why I  can't unmount ipod even though its not connected?
2009-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	LinuX2half		ldleOne: I don't have root power
2009-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	sure you do - use "sudo" to temp. gain root power
2009-10-17T08:39:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	is it a blank cd?
2009-10-17T08:41:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	then yes it is supposed to say that...
2009-10-17T08:41:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	it's ready and waiting fof you to do something with it --
2009-10-17T08:42:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	ooops!
2009-10-17T08:42:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	have you tried another cd?
2009-10-17T08:43:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	what programme did you use to write the iso?
2009-10-17T08:44:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	from the CD or from your hard drive?
2009-10-17T08:44:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	ahh not familiar with that.....
2009-10-17T08:45:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	I use Nero in both windows and linux -- same interface - zero re-learning
2009-10-17T08:47:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	can you pastbin the output of:  cat /etc/fstab
2009-10-17T08:48:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	well your computer bios has to be set to boot off the cd -- that might be your problem -- most systems are set up to boot off the hard drive first...
2009-10-17T08:51:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	you should have something that looks like this:  /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
2009-10-17T08:53:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	that should work...
2009-10-17T08:54:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	mine is a dvd looks like your's is a cd....
2009-10-17T08:55:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	no - I'd try another disc -- if you have a bootable windows cd - and if tht works then that tells us the linux cd is bad -- if that doesn't work then it's probably bios
2009-10-17T08:56:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	grub is NOT involved in booting a cd --
2009-10-17T08:58:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	yes...
2009-10-17T08:58:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	if you're getting to grub it's too late in the game --
2009-10-17T08:59:00.000Z	Bluey	LinuX2half	dunno == sorry I couldn't help
2009-10-17T09:00:00.000Z	LinuX2half	Bluey	thanks anyway
