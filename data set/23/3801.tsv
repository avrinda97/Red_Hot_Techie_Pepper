2008-01-19T06:55:00.000Z	adrock358		genii livecd dmesg.  i'm on livecd now, and whatever the wifi config is, it works.
2008-01-19T06:56:00.000Z	adrock358		genii  i wish i could pay you or something.  the availability to the volunteer technicians is unreal to me
2008-01-19T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	freenode could use donations, it provides these channels :)
2008-01-19T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	you'd be better off installing xchat when you have a moment, it's a much better client for irc than pidgin
2008-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	 thanks for the advice about the chat client
2008-01-20T04:01:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	ubuntu is on the 1st part.
2008-01-20T03:59:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	 i can only use wireless from livecd, and i want to dl the alt cd to try that for drivers.  do you know how i can dl a file (ubuntu alternate) to my hd, while using LiveCD?
2008-01-20T04:02:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	didn't work only root can do that
2008-01-20T04:07:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	it worked but i don't see my disk
2008-01-20T04:09:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	no it's not
2008-01-20T04:10:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	according to mtab, /dev/sda1 is already mounted on /mnt
2008-01-20T04:10:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	yah i did but i don't my disk dude
2008-01-20T04:12:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	right?  mnt IS the drive
2008-01-20T04:12:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	no disk icon or anything
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	 i'm on livecd tryin to dl alternate cd, but i can't save it on my hd.
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	what partition and type do you want to save it on?
2008-01-20T05:08:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	i want to save it on any partition with space.  i want to access it from ubuntu when i'm not on the livecd and it's an iso file, so...that's all I know
2008-01-20T05:09:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	understood. But to tell you how, I need to know the partition and what type of filesystem
2008-01-20T05:10:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	it's linux, ubuntu.  only filesystem i have.  it's devsda1 i think
2008-01-20T05:11:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	ok, sudo mkdir /media/sda1 && sudo mount /dev/sda1 -t ext3 /media /sda1 && chmod a+w /media/sda1 , you should be able to write there
2008-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	there was a typo there in the second command:  it's  sudo mount /dev/sda1 -t ext3 /media/sda1  , no space before sda1
2008-04-08T08:31:00.000Z	adrock358	nickrud	can i ask you a question?
2008-04-08T08:31:00.000Z	nickrud	adrock358	I'm always open to questions, but never promise answers
