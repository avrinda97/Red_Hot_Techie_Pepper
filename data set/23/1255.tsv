2010-07-03T07:17:00.000Z	shpook		Or, yet, is there anyway to get wireless working without having any type of wired connection?
2010-07-03T07:17:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	depends on if you have the firmware available
2010-07-03T07:18:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	well, from what I've gathered, b43-fwcutter is supposed to fetch the firmware, but it needs a network connection. :/
2010-07-03T07:19:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	What card are you using?
2010-07-03T07:19:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	Broadcom 4306
2010-07-03T07:21:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	is the machine connected to the internet?
2010-07-03T07:22:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	not at all, I only have wireless available. iwconfig shows wlan0, but ifconfig doesn't.
2010-07-03T07:22:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	is the wireless light on?
2010-07-03T07:22:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	Yessir, I've been bit by that bug before. :D
2010-07-03T07:23:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	Do you have wpa?
2010-07-03T07:23:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	No, it's a completely open network, nothing special, no security, no MAC filtering, nothing.
2010-07-03T07:24:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	iwconfig wlan0 essid "enter wireless ssid here" > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
2010-07-03T07:24:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	my bad
2010-07-03T07:24:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	don't use that
2010-07-03T07:25:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	iwconfig wlan0 essid "enter wireless ssid here"
2010-07-03T07:25:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	"SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not permitted."
2010-07-03T07:26:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	sudo it
2010-07-03T07:27:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	if it works then dhcpcd wlan0 and you're good to go
2010-07-03T07:27:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	I knew that. :) It went through, but to no avail. nm-applet lists Wireless Networks as "device not ready"
2010-07-03T07:29:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	Don't have dhcpcd installed. Always a wall. :)
2010-07-03T07:30:00.000Z	LJRuff	shpook	you're going to need to hook that machine to a network via wire then.
2010-07-03T07:31:00.000Z	shpook	LJRuff	I had a feeling you would say that. I'll put it to the side and try to bring it to work Wednesday. :) Thanks very much for the help, regardless.
