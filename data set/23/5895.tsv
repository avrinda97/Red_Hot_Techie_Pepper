2006-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	ych		ok, the samples sound allright, ompaul
2006-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	ych		it seems to happen with the more bassy songs
2006-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	ych		as if the speakers couldn't support it
2006-08-14T06:28:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	have you checked your volume settings? over 80 generally is too much
2006-08-14T06:29:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	alsamixer?
2006-08-14T06:30:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	i had some crap from a cheap sb-live cause it was using a different input frequency then most do
2006-08-14T06:31:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	had to mess with alsa settings to fix it
2006-08-14T06:32:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	/etc/asoundrc, but do you have the woofer on a different channel?
2006-08-14T06:35:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	i would say use a sample that is local to test it, mplayer or something is pretty reliable
2006-08-14T06:36:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	using samba or ?
2006-08-14T06:38:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	ok, you might look to increase the buffer, dont know about nfs on windows
2006-08-14T06:41:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	samba should work, mp3's are not much data to put over the network, unless there is something really slow about the network
2006-08-14T06:42:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	that would show with any file transfer
2006-08-14T06:43:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	try mplayer file.mp3
2006-08-14T06:44:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	try mounting it first
2006-08-14T06:46:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	i'd suggest typing mount in a term, that would show it and where it's mounted
2006-08-14T06:50:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=YOURUSER,password=YOURPASSWORD //YOURSERVER/SHARE /newhome
2006-08-14T06:50:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	there may be a gui that helps...dunno
2006-08-14T06:54:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	might try smbmount //comp/share /path/to/mount/dir/
2006-08-14T06:56:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	apt-get install smbfs
2006-08-14T06:58:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	spaces?
2006-08-14T07:05:00.000Z	wide-eye	ych	does "smbclient -L comp" show the share?
2006-08-14T07:13:00.000Z	ych	wide-eye	no it doesnst
