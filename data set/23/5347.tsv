2006-12-24T07:11:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	is sshd running?
2006-12-24T07:20:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	i think you mean iptables -F  (Flush)
2006-12-24T07:21:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	on ubuntu it could be... I am an ubuntu noob
2006-12-24T07:21:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	well on any distro it is... but ubuntu it seems it's not in init.d
2006-12-24T07:42:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	if you don[t then how do you find them again?
2006-12-24T07:42:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	there is a default location, no ?
2006-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	no - without a file name it wants the input from the stdin/stdout
2006-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	not in my experience
2006-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	I just tried it on Edgy!!
2006-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	and the same on FC4  - these are current versions of iptables
2006-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	that's funny, I just did without specifying a target and it worked fine
2006-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	are you using a script in /etc/init.d
2006-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	nope... iptables-save
2006-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	and it doesn't go the terminal window?  hmmm
2006-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	terminal window ? this is in a terminal
2006-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	does it go to your screen?
2006-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	wonder where it goes?
2006-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	this is how it's worked for me forever... not sure what you are talkin abuot :)
2006-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	the way it works here on both FC4, RH9 and Edgy.  And by the man pages.
2006-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	dunno what to tell you :)
2006-12-24T07:50:00.000Z	w3ccv	malikeye	we have two different versions.
2006-12-24T07:51:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	1.3.5.0debian1-1ubuntu2
2006-12-24T07:57:00.000Z	malikeye	w3ccv	you need to nullify this in your .bashrc : alias ls='ls --color=auto'
