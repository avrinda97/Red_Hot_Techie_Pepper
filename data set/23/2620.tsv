2009-01-17T20:05:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	on mine java and java script have to be active, also downloaded and installed the adobeflash from synaptic
2009-01-17T20:09:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	apt-cache search  adobeflash returns nothing
2009-01-17T20:10:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	just type adobe in the search text of Synaptic, it comes up as non-free
2009-01-17T20:15:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	Java is enabled
2009-01-17T20:15:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	Is java script enabled also?
2009-01-17T20:22:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	Dont come up with anything doing search for adobe
2009-01-17T20:22:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	Are you on Synaptic: All ?

2009-01-17T20:25:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	let me try again,,,
2009-01-17T20:28:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	whooops! I do not have it installed,,let me check my Firefox settings
2009-01-17T20:28:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	Which is (in fact) installed
2009-01-17T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	flashplugin-nonfree - Adobe Flash Player plugin is what I have installed on this system.
2009-01-17T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	Maybe that is what is broken?
2009-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	must be, I have default install of FirefoxUbuntu
2009-01-17T20:32:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	youtube is working fine without Adobe .......still looking at stuff
2009-01-17T20:34:00.000Z	usr13	vigo	Maybe I should try to unintall flashplugin-nonfree?
2009-01-17T20:36:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	that sounds like a good plan
2009-07-01T00:30:00.000Z	vigo	usr13	that is a silly bot today.
