2007-05-14T16:49:00.000Z	N9URK		hi, I just installed 6.10 (had problems getting 7.04 installed) and the HD won't boot. I can only get the Live CD to boot. I did "find /boot/grub/stage1" "root (hd0,0)" and "setup (hd0)" from the live disk and it won't  boot.  Any ideas?  THanks for all help in advance!
2007-05-14T16:50:00.000Z	N9URK		!grub
2007-05-14T16:51:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	that does not help at all sorry
2007-05-14T16:51:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	I am asking a question that I have a feeling not very many people here know how to do if any /
2007-05-14T16:51:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	->What is your question?
2007-05-14T16:51:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	 I didn't see it
2007-05-14T16:52:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	I was issuing that for my own benefit
2007-05-14T16:53:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	no problem I was asking about grub just letting you know incase it was directed at me

2007-05-14T16:54:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	that is my issue, what is yours?
2007-05-14T16:54:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	raid grub and a multitude of crazyness
2007-05-14T16:55:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	 Ouch, not done much with raid, so I can't help much
2007-05-14T16:55:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	 Sorry :)
2007-05-14T16:56:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	nobody with ubuntu has it seems :)
2007-05-14T16:56:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	raid is taboo with ubuntu!
2007-05-14T16:58:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	it slides, it dices, it makes juliene fries, but it won't do raid
2007-05-14T16:59:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	well raid is very nice :)
2007-05-14T16:59:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	every other distro I have worked with is butter but ubuntu is crap
2007-05-14T05:02:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	 Seems like there are no "perfect" or "excellent" Linux Distros
2007-05-14T05:03:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	sure gentoo was perfect for my needs till the devs started quitting due to infighting
2007-05-14T05:04:00.000Z	N9URK	SlicerDicer-	 key word "was"
2007-05-14T05:04:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	N9URK	lol
