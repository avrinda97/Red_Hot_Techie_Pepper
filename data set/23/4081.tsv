2007-11-28T19:16:00.000Z	Arelis		test
2007-11-28T19:16:00.000Z	Arelis		ah, i can talk again
2007-11-28T19:16:00.000Z	Arelis		what just happened?
2007-11-28T19:18:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	a little attack. sorry for the inconvenience, but we had to restrict the channel to registered users only, that's why you couldn't talk.
2007-11-28T19:19:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	already did?>
2007-11-28T19:20:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	Oh alright. I saw a ctcp something-exec.exe everywhere
2007-11-28T19:20:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	Means other people have been infected
2007-11-28T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	hardly any ubuntu users though
2007-11-28T19:49:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	sure there's a bot attack?
2007-11-28T19:49:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	I saw lots of people disconnecting and connecting
2007-11-28T19:50:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	relatively slowly though
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	drag it back?
2007-12-06T01:28:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	No by dragging it got deleted
2008-01-10T20:41:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	the safest way is to install it on another HD. second safest, back up your current data first.
2008-01-10T20:42:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	well I don't really have another HD at the moment, so that leaves me with backup up.
2008-01-10T20:42:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	Backing up won't be a problem :)
2008-01-10T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	the Ubuntu installer will detect your Windows installation and (unless you explicitly instruct it otherwise), will allow you to shrink its partition without losing data. however, resizing partition is always a potentially dangerous operation, so yes, a backup is needed if you want to be on the safe side
2008-01-10T20:43:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	It detects the size well?
2008-01-10T20:51:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	It will detect the size well? Or will it fail detecting it?
2008-01-10T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	it always detected it correctly for me, but i can't say i did it hundreds of times
2008-01-10T20:52:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	is it really needed to backup?
2008-01-10T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	Arelis	that's only up to you to decide...
2008-01-10T20:54:00.000Z	Arelis	LjL	Well i don't have any important files right now.
