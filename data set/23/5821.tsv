2007-05-08T16:30:00.000Z	bobbob1016		how can I move all of my /home folder to another directory, and save all my settings and everything, and format the partition (it's on a different partition than my root dir), from a livecd or something, then re-format it as ext3 or something whichever it is now, and put everything back without ubuntu knowing?
2007-05-08T16:30:00.000Z	bobbob1016		I've google a bit and that is all I can do to get rid of hidden truecrypt files
