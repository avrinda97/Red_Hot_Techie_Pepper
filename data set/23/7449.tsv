2005-07-27T09:38:00.000Z	ghpolo		someone experiencied with usb mass storage can help me please ?
2005-07-27T09:39:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	plug it in, run dmesg to see what sd? it gets, then mount it
2005-07-27T09:39:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	pen should be sdb
2005-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	yes, that is the problem
2005-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	so, edit the config so it says sda
2005-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	interesting problem, tried using grub to remap the bios addresses of the disks?
2005-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	I think it's the "map" command, been a while since I did it
2005-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	yes, i used to do it to load windows partition
2005-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	but seems a bit different here
2005-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	it boots the pen drive, then it is hd0,0
2005-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	how can i tell now it is hd1,0 ?
2005-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	and then make it able to access my pen drive correctly passed by the root parameter
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	I'd still try map, can't make it worse
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	of course it couldnt, heh
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	but you would map what to what ?
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	80 to 81, 81 to 80
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	exactly like windows ?
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	hmmm
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	cw2	ghpolo	first detected drive always gets 80, no matter what it is
2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	right
2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	well, im gonna try
2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	since i ran out of ideas.. and i didnt think about this
2005-07-27T10:10:00.000Z	ghpolo	cw2	no success ;/
