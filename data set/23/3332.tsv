2008-05-11T09:37:00.000Z	nassty		hello there, anyone know how to make work the bcm43xx drivers?
2008-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	nassty		anyone? wireless bcm4318
2008-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 I would also recommend ndiswrapper.  I had no luck with fwcutter
2008-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 you may have wrong drivers then
2008-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 if no luck with the others try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff
2008-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	i tried the methods according my card and doesn't work, I've used the same drivers with feisty before and worked well but the signal was only 50% tops
2008-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 I don't actually use ubuntu but if you could upgrad your kernel to 2.6.24 (if ubuntu does not use that version) they have better support
2008-05-11T09:50:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 use ndiswrapper from source by the way
2008-05-11T09:50:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	also compiled ndiswrapper before
2008-05-11T09:51:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	deleted the /etc/ndiswrapper files, recompiled from tarball,
2008-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	what does ndiswrapper -l list?
2008-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	if that is fine could you post your dmesg to the paste board
2008-05-11T09:54:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 do you have the bc43 module blacklisted?
2008-05-11T09:54:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	sorry b43 i mean
2008-05-11T09:55:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	din, i'll reboot and back to tell you guys if werks
2008-05-11T10:08:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	checked out my paste
2008-05-11T10:09:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 did you get it?
2008-05-11T10:09:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	almost
2008-05-11T10:09:00.000Z	heirrook	nassty	 what was the paste?
2008-05-11T10:10:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11361/
2008-05-11T10:10:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	doesn't show anything at scanning
2008-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	sorry for the verbosity of the paste
2008-05-11T10:15:00.000Z	nassty	heirrook	gtg, thanks for the halp anyway
