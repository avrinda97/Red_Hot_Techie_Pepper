2008-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	I got like disconnected
2008-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Yeah. Been there.
2008-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	 uh something has happended with my SebNaitsabes name
2008-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	then saying my name was in use and stuff, it should be registered though
2008-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Did you see my other problem?
2008-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	what other problem?
2008-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	When I select Ubuntu from grub, let it load and whatnot, it hangs on the login user selection screen(black).
2008-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	It gets past the splash screen and hangs before it will let me try to log in on my user.
2008-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Black Screen.
2008-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	 so username and password has been entered and it is black screen for a bit?
2008-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	No. It doesn't even load the login bit. It goes black and hangs with the loading cursor forever.
2008-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	so you got the Ubuntu is going to load screen.  like  there is one for WIndows when that loads to
2008-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	and then after that it goes black for a bit before the login screen appears?
2008-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Yeah. It goes black before showing the login bit. But it never comes out of it.
2008-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	how do you log in then?
2008-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	I don't. That's the problem!
2008-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	To clarify, that's the problem. I can't login. I'm using my LiveCD for Hardy.
2008-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	heh no wonder you wanted to boot Vista then
2008-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	I think it could be to do with X or something
2008-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Yeah...I don't often have time to screw around with Linux as of late. So that's another reason.
2008-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	 try recovery mode from Grub
2008-06-29T05:18:00.000Z	Steven1	stupidfreenode	Possibly. I hate messing with X.
2008-06-29T05:18:00.000Z	stupidfreenode	Steven1	and the edited menu.lst?
