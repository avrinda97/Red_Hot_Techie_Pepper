2007-03-21T15:16:00.000Z	tomas_		Does anyone know if there is any ubuntu packages for a mencoder gui? I used kmenc15 and some other gtk gui in the past, but i cannot find a single package that works on edgy :(
2007-03-21T15:18:00.000Z	tomas_		bleh.. asked three times and not a single reply to my question :(

2007-03-21T15:19:00.000Z	tomas_		Am i really the only one who encodes videos?
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	apt-cache search mencoder
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	i find no gui..
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	not sure, never used a gui for that
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	thanks for responding atleast.. :)
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	you need a video editor actually and not a gui to mencoder, if i got that right
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	try kino
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	basically what i need is a program to encode mpeg2 into mpeg4 like xvid or similar. I also need to cut away the top and bottom of the picture
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	acidrip
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	dosent that only support dvds?
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	not sure, never tried without dvds
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	i looked around in it and found no way to open a mpeg2 file
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	i remember a package, i think it was dvd:rip
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	though not sure bout the name, its been a while
2007-03-21T15:24:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	i usually used ^scripts^ for dvd to vcd, svcd, mvcd and xvid, mkv and ogm
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	and then again, i got a weird hunch, how about using vlc to stream an mpg2 to a stdout and take that stdout through mencoder?
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	the problem is that i need to cut away the logo and such
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	well, for the cutting thats where i mentoined kino
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	nevermind	tomas_	i could be wrong, but i remember mencoder as "encoder" which isnt exactly a cutter
2007-03-21T15:37:00.000Z	tomas_	nevermind	many different formats/codecs :\
