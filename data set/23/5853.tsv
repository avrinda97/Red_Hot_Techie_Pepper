2006-11-14T13:28:00.000Z	derek_		quick question, I just downloaded Danger in the Deep, a sub sim, it is a bin file , how do I install it?
2006-11-14T13:30:00.000Z	derek_		lol w30
2006-11-14T13:31:00.000Z	derek_		anyone know how to install a program that has been packed in a bin file?
2006-11-14T13:33:00.000Z	w30	derek_	chmod ugoa+x thebinfile then just type the path and name of the bin file and press enter
2006-11-14T13:37:00.000Z	derek_	w30	humm....I must be stupid I can't get that to work
2006-11-14T13:37:00.000Z	derek_	w30	 can't I just double click it and have it run?
2006-11-14T13:40:00.000Z	w30	derek_	Linux files need permission to execute because of the way security and user seperation is facillicated.
2006-11-14T13:40:00.000Z	derek_	w30	okay...........so what do I do?
2006-11-14T13:42:00.000Z	w30	derek_	to run a bin file in a terminal type chmod ugoa+x thefile.bin. After that type /path/of/file/file.bin and hit enter
2006-11-14T13:44:00.000Z	derek_	w30	do I start path of file with root?
2006-11-14T13:45:00.000Z	w30	derek_	may sudo is necessary in front of the chmod
2006-11-14T13:46:00.000Z	w30	derek_	yeah complete path to keep things simple for now
2006-11-14T13:49:00.000Z	derek_	w30	it says cannot access subsim.bin No such file or directory
2006-11-14T13:49:00.000Z	derek_	w30	do I start the path with /home/derek/installers?
2006-11-14T13:54:00.000Z	w30	derek_	no, use /home/derek/installers/yourfile.bin or whatever the bin file is named
2006-11-14T13:55:00.000Z	derek_	w30	I did it I think.......I type it in and hit enter and it returned to the regular prompt.....is that a good thing or a bad thing?
2006-11-14T13:57:00.000Z	w30	derek_	probably did run then, a executable does or does not produce console output depending on how the author wrote the program
2006-11-14T13:57:00.000Z	derek_	w30	where would it have installed to?
2006-11-14T13:59:00.000Z	w30	derek_	that's a problem with Linux installs, you don't get the name of the executable after the program installs in a menu or icon unless the program wants one. check your documentation for the executable.
2006-11-14T14:00:00.000Z	w30	derek_	what was the name of the program?
2006-11-14T14:01:00.000Z	derek_	w30	it is danger from the deep, it si a sub simulator
2006-11-14T14:02:00.000Z	w30	derek_	I can't help you there, I am not familiar with that one, chek /usr/games/bin and see if omething in there rings a bell.
