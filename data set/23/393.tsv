2011-12-26T06:43:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	anything in dmesg about that mouse at all?
2011-12-26T06:46:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	how many mice are attached, currently?
2011-12-26T06:46:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	could you please lsusb|pastebint?
2011-12-26T06:49:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	do you get dmesg events when de- and reattaching an usb device, like one of the mice?
2011-12-26T06:51:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	yeah, should be recognized as an usb device anyway
2011-12-26T06:54:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	sounds like you really have usb issues
2011-12-26T06:56:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	btw. you the guy from twitter having the same name?
2011-12-26T06:56:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	yup:) hallo auch:)
2011-12-26T06:57:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	could be some speed negotiation issues, had that around here quite often lately.
2011-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	you could try different ports or adding a hub
2011-12-26T06:59:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	ive tried it on 3 different machines already. no joy with ubuntu
2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	I was suspecting some change in usb drivers lately, but got no proof of that yet, do you by change have some older kernel lying around that you could use for testing?
2011-12-26T07:01:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	btw. which version of ubuntu are you running?
2011-12-26T07:02:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	mint 11 on this machine (ubuntu 11.04 equivalent), also tried it with 10.04 on the other one
2011-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	that rules out my theory
2011-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	how old should the kernel be? what ubuntu version? ... oh i see
2011-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	I was thinking about the latest kernel, but, well ;)
2011-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	i tried the mouse with 3.1.5 and 3.0.0 :)
2011-12-26T07:06:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	did you try adding a hub? Maybe that could mitigate your issues
2011-12-26T07:07:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	but what do you make out of my dmsg log? thats not normal is it? looks like an ongoing negotiation process, right?
2011-12-26T07:08:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	yeah, that's why I thought of speed negotioation issues
2011-12-26T07:08:00.000Z	sumosu	SunTsu	i dont have any hub lying around here. and as i said i tried it on 3 machines, so i doubt it's my machine's fault
2011-12-26T07:10:00.000Z	SunTsu	sumosu	yeah, I agree
