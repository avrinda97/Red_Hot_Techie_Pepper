2008-05-11T01:17:00.000Z	shadowdude77		Could anyone help me with this problem I'm having during installation of 8.04? I get up to step 4 where it asks how I want to partition the disk. Before I booted from this LiveCD, I used a partition manager in Windows XP to leave 56.4GB of space unformatted, because I was planning on using it for Ubuntu. But when I pressed Forward, I got a message saying "too small size." What gives? Does anyone know? Thanks in advance.

2008-05-11T01:20:00.000Z	shadowdude77		@Flannel/Rampage: Yes, I'm using Guided Partition... should I be using Manual? I'm not very good with this stuff and I don't want to mess up my Windows partition
2008-05-11T01:21:00.000Z	biouser	shadowdude77	yeah, you might have to declare the partition  as root -    /
2008-05-11T01:21:00.000Z	shadowdude77	biouser	that would mean going through Manual, not Guided, correct?
2008-05-11T01:21:00.000Z	biouser	shadowdude77	yeah, I think so....
2008-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	shadowdude77		okay, I'll try that and see how it works. Thanks!
2008-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	shadowdude77		what do I put into the "mount point" dropdown window though?
2008-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	biouser		I'm still in the process of trying to successfully install Hardy myself :'(
2008-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	biouser		[Errno 5] Input/output error
2008-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	biouser		every time
2008-05-11T01:23:00.000Z	biouser		I guess my HDD is shot?
2008-05-11T01:23:00.000Z	biouser		seems so unlikely
2008-05-11T01:23:00.000Z	biouser		somebody shoot me
2008-05-11T01:23:00.000Z	shadowdude77		Sorry, I have another question. What do I put into the mount point section of the manual partition option? Also, I should use ext3, right?
2008-05-11T01:24:00.000Z	biouser		if I reformat my real partition and it gives me that error I will be very sad
2008-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	biouser		This particular error is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk
2008-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	biouser		that is hard to believe
2008-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	shadowdude77		Sorry, I have another question. What do I put into the mount point section of the manual partition option? Also, I should use ext3, right?
2008-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	biouser	shadowdude77	yes ext3
2008-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	shadowdude77		also, what do I put for mount point?
2008-05-11T01:26:00.000Z	biouser	shadowdude77	      '/' if you want it to be the partition that has the installation... you will need to make a swap too
2008-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	shadowdude77	biouser	if I want it to be the partition with the installation? What else would it be? I'm so confused right now >.<
