2010-11-19T07:20:00.000Z	Sonic132		Ok. SO I'm going to merge my Windows partition with Ubuntu's and grub might have a problem with that. Since I'll need to reformat Window's partion to Ext to merge. Any ideas on what to do with grub so that the transition goes smoothly?
2010-11-19T07:21:00.000Z	Sonic132		um not sure. I have 10.10 netbook remix
2010-11-19T07:21:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	I never had a problem doing that with grub2
2010-11-19T07:22:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	So I can just do it and Grub will compensate?
2010-11-19T07:22:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	I never had any problems on my normal PC but I haven't used netbook remix
2010-11-19T07:23:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	grub2 auto updated when I did mine a while back.
2010-11-19T07:24:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	What if I wanted to expand my swap space? Or should I actually?
2010-11-19T07:24:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	It's 2.25Gib right now and I believe this laptop have 2GB of RAM.
2010-11-19T07:25:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	yeah! do as rediago said
2010-11-19T07:26:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	Ok.
2010-11-19T07:34:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	Yeah.. you have a bit of a cut and paste job if Linux isn't the 1st partition :)
2010-11-19T07:34:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	What do you mean?
2010-11-19T07:34:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	Editing grub menu.lst or whatever it's called now?
2010-11-19T07:35:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	If you want just the one solid partition as opposed to 2 partitions.. moving "/" will be a bit of a cut and paste job with issues...
2010-11-19T07:37:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	Ok...So I moved everything I want to keep from Windows (sda1) to Ubuntu (sda2). So I can reformat that partition. But I believe it's where grub is installed. Thus the problem. What if it removes grub. So can I just move grub to the resulting partition?
2010-11-19T07:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	can't remember exactly how I did it but I know it took me almost and hour to move / and it wasn't without problems.. all because I wanted 1 solid partition.. Can't even remember if I succeded now :D
2010-11-19T07:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	grub will not reside on the windows partition
2010-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	You can safely nuke that and reformat it
2010-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	then specify a mount point for your new partition
2010-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	Sonic132	DarkStar1	Well then it should be alright then? Also, I told it to install grub to sda (no numeral following) during install. So I assumed that was sda1.
2010-11-19T07:40:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	Yeah
2010-11-19T07:40:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	Unless ofc you take a hammer to the hardware...
2010-11-19T07:43:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Sonic132	Yeah.. What he said..
