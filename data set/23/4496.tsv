2007-10-07T06:35:00.000Z	Incompetnce		I want to print two pages on a single page from Firefox. How do I do that? I could do it in windows but the printer options aren't the same...
2007-10-07T06:35:00.000Z	Incompetnce		can anyone help?
2007-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	try lpoptions -o page-set=odd and then when you have printed that page...
2007-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	mechdave		type lpoptions -r page-set and then lpoptions page-set=even
2007-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	and reprint the page. when all is done remove the option with lpoptions -r page-set
2007-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	Incompetnce	mechdave	would that not be for printing back and front? i can do that. its to have two pages, shrunk on the same side...
2007-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	Oh sorry mate, yeah.. bear with me
2007-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	You have the cups server installed on the same machine right?
2007-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	try this url --> http://127.0.0.1:631/help/options.html?QUERY=n%20up#NUMBERUP
2007-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	Incompetnce	mechdave	err. im a little new to all this. i only have the one computer...
2007-10-07T06:43:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	no worries, try the url I just pasted
2007-10-07T06:43:00.000Z	Incompetnce	mechdave	ok that seems to be what im looking for thanks. now ill have to figure out how to print from command line...
2007-10-07T06:44:00.000Z	Incompetnce		i dont suppose there'd be a way to incorporate these options into the dialog box that appears when i click print?
2007-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	all you need to do is open a terminal up and replace lpr with lpoptions
2007-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	eg:lp -o number-up=2 filename will become lpoptions -o number-up=2 filename
2007-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	then print your page through firefox as normal
2007-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	Incompetnce		ah i see. ok. thanks.
2007-10-07T06:47:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	then when finished type lpoptions -r number-up so you don't do all your printing like that!
2007-10-07T06:48:00.000Z	Incompetnce	mechdave	do you know a good website introduction to the command line, while im here? its something ive been meaning to learn about...
2007-10-07T06:51:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	yeah, just go to http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/linux/cmd/ --< that is the one I use
2007-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	Incompetnce	mechdave	thanks for your help!
2007-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	Incompetnce		incompetnce, AWAY!
2007-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	mechdave	Incompetnce	no worries, any time... Have fun mate :)
