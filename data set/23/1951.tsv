2009-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	t__Eest		how to install the "cdbs" pakcet  ? can someone help
2009-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	sudo apt-get install cdbs
2009-08-26T17:46:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	yes
2009-08-26T17:53:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	means something happened to xorg or the video driver
2009-08-26T17:54:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	what video card?
2009-08-26T17:54:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	running 9.04?
2009-08-26T17:55:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	8.04 should work fine, are you using the driver from ati or from the restricted drivers?
2009-08-26T17:58:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	this is different, just looked it up and it only has rpm files unless you are trying to install on Xfree86 4.3

2009-08-26T17:59:00.000Z	t__Eest	Halitech	 its an .run file
2009-08-26T17:59:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	ubuntu doesn't use Xfree86 (someone please correct me if I'm wrong)
2009-08-26T18:01:00.000Z	t__Eest	Halitech	but a .run is okay for installing it or not ?
2009-08-26T18:01:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	yes if you have Xfree86 instead of Xorg
2009-08-26T18:02:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	that driver is from 2006 so it may not work
2009-08-26T18:10:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	you may be stuck with whatever ubuntu installs by default, I don't think any of the other drivers will work for that old a card
2009-08-26T18:11:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	not with your current card
2009-08-26T18:12:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	just seen a post on the forum where the OP had a 9600 and someone suggested an Nvidia 9400 series card that worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in
2009-08-26T18:14:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	uname -m
2009-08-26T19:01:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	different set of apps, different look to the desktop
2009-08-26T19:35:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	sudo apt-get autoremove wine
2009-08-26T19:37:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	did you unistall the programs from wine first?
2009-08-26T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	t__Eest	you should be able to just delete those folders
