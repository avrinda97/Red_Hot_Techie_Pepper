2011-08-13T08:52:00.000Z	rawbdor		howdy... my apt-get update seems to fail with a crap ton of 404's, every time.   someone suggested updating their ".list" file but i'm not sure how to do that, where it lives, or what to put in it.

2011-08-13T08:53:00.000Z	rawbdor		also this is a remote system so i can't really use any UI :(   anyone have any advice?
2011-08-13T08:53:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	what version of Ubuntu?
2011-08-13T08:53:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	^
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 not sure if that gives all the info you need
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	just did a uname -a
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	lsb_release -a. I'm looking for a yy.mm version number
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 9.04
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 so, therefore, no more updates are available?
2011-08-13T08:54:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	correct, and the repositories are moved off the mirrors
2011-08-13T08:55:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	9.04 went EOL in October, to be precise
2011-08-13T08:55:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 makes sense... i don't control the server 100% though and can't go be doing upgrades ;)  guess i need to go yell at a friend. heh.
2011-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 is it safe to do aptitude install update-manager-core?  it alerts me that it is an untrusted version. How can I find out where aptitude is pulling from?
2011-08-13T09:27:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	change your sources.list as the page says, then sudo aptitude update, then move on to installing update-manager-core
2011-08-13T09:28:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 which page says this? Sorry, I must have found the wrong page via my googles
2011-08-13T09:28:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades is the relevant page, but it doesn't mention sudo aptitude update for some reason.
2011-08-13T09:28:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	thanks so much, you guys are greate
2011-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	urlin2u   this is my sources.list   http://fpaste.org/paY5/raw/
2011-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	  do you have any ideas? I've updated the sources.list file to include the old-releases urls, and then when i attempt to install the update-manager-core, it tells me it is insecure
2011-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	rww	rawbdor	did you do sudo aptitude update?
2011-08-13T09:42:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 thanks. I did not. It was not listed on the page between updating the sources.list and trying to install update-manager-core.  Thanks again.
2011-08-13T10:43:00.000Z	rawbdor	rww	 hey just wanted to say thanks for the point ot the doc.  I didn't end up upgrading but using the old repos allowed me to get the few packages I needed to get through
