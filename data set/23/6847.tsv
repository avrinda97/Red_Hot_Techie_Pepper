2005-12-15T06:56:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	the -r flag allows it to go thru all the files in /var/www
2005-12-15T07:03:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	WHAT COMMAND DID YOU ISSYE?
2005-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	 sudo chmod -R 0644 /var/www
2005-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	 you need the recurse flag
2005-12-15T07:05:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	True, but he has on ly HTML
2005-12-15T07:06:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	remember you can type <command> --help for greater knowledge on a command or fo more indepth explainations use man <command>
2005-12-15T07:06:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	take a look at   chmod --help   and    man chmod
2005-12-15T07:20:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	How did you install everything?
2005-12-15T07:23:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	there is a really good install tutorial in the wiki  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
2005-12-15T07:25:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	I assume that the chown has the right users?
2005-12-15T07:30:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	you use chown to change the user,    sudo chown dpupp:root <file> to change the ownership to dpup:root
2005-12-15T07:31:00.000Z	dpupp_apache	selinium	so i can change the owner of all the files in my var/www/ ?
2005-12-15T07:31:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	I have got to dash out now, but fell free to beep me about any server problems!
2005-12-15T07:33:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	yes, if you want to you can use the recurse flag -R again.   sudo chown -R <user>:<user> /path/to/folder    where <user> is the users name. try it without the -R flag on a file and right click and view properties! :)
2005-12-15T07:38:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	good idea, I think maybe you have changed user names between your boxes?
2005-12-15T07:40:00.000Z	selinium	dpupp_apache	pm?
