2011-04-19T22:43:00.000Z	dave-_		ok lets see
2011-04-19T22:43:00.000Z	dave-_		thnx guys
2011-04-19T22:43:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	much better. thanks for that
2011-04-19T22:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	so was that paste from /var/log/dmesg (from ubuntu! because you'd probably also have that on osx
2011-04-19T22:45:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	Yes this was from my ubuntu partition
2011-04-19T22:49:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	do you only get drops on the logitech keyb? and both work in osx?
2011-04-19T22:51:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	the dmesg output would only be for the last boot. did it occur during that time?
2011-04-19T22:51:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	otherwise /var/log/dmesg.0.log or earlier
2011-04-19T22:51:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	yeh it seems to happen every boot.
2011-04-19T22:52:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	I can fix it temporarily by unplugging and replugging the usb
2011-04-19T22:52:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	randomly or at specific times/intervals? Is it consistently reproducable?
2011-04-19T22:53:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	no its pretty random (it doesenÂ´t happen whilst the keyboard is in use usually) and it always happens at login.
2011-04-19T22:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	so your external kb locks at login? and then randomly at other times? but you can use your built in one without issue?
2011-04-19T22:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	not sure if it was asked, but how long does it disable for? is it a consistent amount of time?
2011-04-19T22:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	have you noticed if the "during gnome session" times are when you're prompted for a password?
2011-04-19T23:00:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	The only keyboard i have is the usb keyboard (ie external i suppose...) and it disables until it is unplugged and replugged, It seems to hapen all the time really.
2011-04-19T23:01:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	and always at log-in
2011-04-19T23:01:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	but isn't it a macbook?
2011-04-19T23:02:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	No sorry its a powermac G5 (early 20005) 2.3 ghz
2011-04-19T23:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	look on lines 481 and 490 of the dmesg output that you pasted. Not sure why, but your computer is reporting 2 keyboards
2011-04-19T23:05:00.000Z	dave-_	Seven_Six_Two	thanks i will have a look maybe is the mouse ore something. I've g2g now thanks for all your help :D
2011-04-19T23:06:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	it's reporting it as a mac extended kb, not a mouse. the mouse is down on line 492
2011-04-19T23:06:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dave-_	np.
