2006-12-10T15:42:00.000Z	kerik		hey there..any IBM users in here?
2006-12-10T15:43:00.000Z	kerik		and/or someone who can teach a newb how to actually edit and save changes to files?
2006-12-10T15:44:00.000Z	kerik		without using GUI that is
2006-12-10T15:44:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	"nano" is a user friendly text-mode editor. i use it normally
2006-12-10T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	so, the problem is? :P
2006-12-10T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	alt+x in nano
2006-12-10T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	saves and exits
2006-12-10T15:46:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	that's a nice to know there :)
2006-12-10T15:46:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	you shouldn't by any chance be a ibm user?
2006-12-10T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	as in, user of an IBM manufactured PC? fortunately not :P
2006-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	actually I have been fortunate enough with mine...it has found all drivers and all....only my middle mouse button I need working now...and thats where the problem is with the editor ;)
2006-12-10T15:48:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	but I reckon there has happened a lot with linux since last time I tried to become a user...6 years ago it was absolutely impossible to find drivers :)
2006-12-10T15:48:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	i believe if you run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" one of the option will be related to "3-button mouse emulation" (yes/no). try changing the setting that it gives you as a default
2006-12-10T15:49:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	I will try that :)
2006-12-10T15:49:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	(of course you could also edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly, since that's what "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" does, but then the latter is made to help you with that)
2006-12-10T15:51:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	but that wants me to reconfigure my entire system??
2006-12-10T15:51:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	starts off by asking for my graphics driver
2007-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	sorry what msg?
2007-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	the one that didn't come. the bot is being very laggy, hold on a little while and you'll get the message (hopefully)... sorry
2007-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	hmm...there was supposed to be a msg sometime soon?
2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	LjL	kerik	yes, bot is having serious problems though
2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	obkb :)
2007-05-28T15:53:00.000Z	kerik	LjL	thanks for letting me know
