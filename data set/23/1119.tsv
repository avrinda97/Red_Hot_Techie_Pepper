2010-08-20T18:27:00.000Z	j0hnboy	TiK	ya, it needs a ppa. but that's not my problem. dockbarx requires a specific version of gcc-4.4-base, which i accidentally updated toa newer version a while ago i guess on my work pc. so now that i hav that newer version. i don't know how to get the old version back on w/o uninstalling 238989234 packages
