2006-04-17T12:30:00.000Z	EnterUserName		Kde's printers is far better
2006-04-17T12:31:00.000Z	EnterUserName		Is there a way i can use KDE's printing utility with UBuntus gnome?
2006-04-17T12:31:00.000Z	blake_ubuntu	EnterUserName	whys that?
2006-04-17T12:32:00.000Z	EnterUserName		Well, KDE's printing utility scans the ports for available printers
2006-04-17T12:32:00.000Z	EnterUserName		and automatically see's the correct printer

2006-04-17T12:32:00.000Z	EnterUserName		with gnome i have to edit the url and type the whole one in directly

2006-04-17T12:34:00.000Z	EnterUserName		Blake: I used KDE's utility to add printers and kde is fine finding the printer its just point and click
2006-04-17T12:34:00.000Z	EnterUserName		but Gnomes version of the printing utility I have not been able to do that
2006-04-17T12:34:00.000Z	EnterUserName		and one of my work places is switching to gnome and this is the downfall

2006-04-17T12:38:00.000Z	EnterUserName	blake_ubuntu	I'll give it a try. I gotta figure out what package it is. I'm guessing you'll require qt libraries
