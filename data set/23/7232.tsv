2005-12-06T15:24:00.000Z	psusi		I installed apache2 and mantis but when I try to open the bug tracker in a web browser, I get an error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect()
2005-12-06T15:24:00.000Z	psusi		anyone have any ideas why php wouldn't be able to find mysql_connect()?
2005-12-06T15:24:00.000Z	psusi		well, it seems to be a specific problem with the ubuntu packages
2005-12-06T15:25:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	you need to install either php4-mysql or php5-mysql depending on your php version
2005-12-06T15:25:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	I did that
2005-12-06T15:25:00.000Z	psusi		actually, they are both installed
2005-12-06T15:25:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	um, make a php script that contains only phpinfo() and give me the addie to take a peek
2005-12-06T15:26:00.000Z	psusi		hrm.... let me see...
2005-12-06T15:29:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	so make a file that is like "<% phpinfo() %>" right?
2005-12-06T15:31:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	yeah
2005-12-06T15:36:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	http://pastebin.com/445423 can't seem to get it to show it as html instead of plain text though
2005-12-06T15:41:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	did you get that?
2005-12-06T15:43:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	sorry, was away
2005-12-06T15:45:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	I pasted the output to pastebin, but it forces it to be displayed as text instead of letting the browser render the page
2005-12-06T15:45:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	dont worry
2005-12-06T15:46:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	http://pastebin.com/445434 try that... it isn't pretty, but it's the important information
2005-12-06T15:47:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	um, the mysql extension is not installed
2005-12-06T15:47:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	did you restart apache after you installed php4-mysql?
2005-12-06T15:48:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	hrm.. I'll give that a try... but shouldn't the package manager do that automatically?
2005-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	I dont think the php package restarts apache
2005-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	psusi	La_PaRCa	aha... that seems to be it... it's getting further now... thnks...
2005-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	psusi		silly me
2005-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	psusi	wink
