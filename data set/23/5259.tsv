2008-03-17T11:11:00.000Z	Javid		lenovos are awesome
2008-03-17T11:11:00.000Z	Javid		I want to find a USB hub with all the ports on the same side, plug a bunch of cheap flashdrives into them, then ducttape them together and raid them
2008-03-17T11:11:00.000Z	Javid		ghetto external hd
2008-03-17T11:12:00.000Z	Javid		I wonder if they CAN be raided..
2008-03-17T11:12:00.000Z	Javid		I mostly want capacity
2008-03-17T11:12:00.000Z	Javid		obviously, a real external drive would be cheaper and better, but this line of thought amuses me
2008-03-17T11:13:00.000Z	Javid		for that I could get a 500gb+ external drive though
2008-03-17T11:14:00.000Z	Javid		Anyway. I'm going to replace my current internal drive with a bigger one. I don't want to reinstall, so would I theoretically be safe to just copy the drive image from this one then boot from the new one?
2008-03-17T11:14:00.000Z	Javid		oh god, an offtopic chat, let's shit ourselves in rage
2008-03-17T11:14:00.000Z	Javid		I asked a support question. See?
2008-03-17T11:15:00.000Z	jussi01	Javid	great, please limit your discussion to that
2008-03-17T11:15:00.000Z	Javid		I'm waiting for an answer
2008-03-17T11:15:00.000Z	Javid		^^
2008-03-17T11:16:00.000Z	jussi01	Javid	please repeat your question, the offtopic chat took it away from my scroll back
2008-03-17T11:16:00.000Z	jussi01		!install | Kyro_

2008-03-17T11:17:00.000Z	jussi01	Javid	you may run into some small grub issues though
2008-03-17T11:17:00.000Z	Javid		I can deal with that
2008-03-17T11:17:00.000Z	Javid		My packrat powers have outgrown a mere 60 gigs
2008-03-17T11:17:00.000Z	Javid		thanks
2008-03-17T11:17:00.000Z	jussi01	Javid	just dd it across :)
