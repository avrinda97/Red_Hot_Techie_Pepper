2011-07-04T08:02:00.000Z	fuzzeoly		is there anyway to automatically boot into "failsafe graphics mode" without having to go into recovery?
2011-07-04T08:02:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Automatically? What are you trying to do exactly?
2011-07-04T08:04:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	well, ubuntu won't boot up with my graphics adapter, i've tried everything, except in failsafe graphics mode. I'm wondering if i can edit the boot in some way, like "nomodeset" but so it boots into failsafe graphics mode
2011-07-04T08:04:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	so i don't have to go "start recovery mode" than "boot in failsafe graphics mode"
2011-07-04T08:04:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	ah.. so it works with nomodeset?
2011-07-04T08:05:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	no, it doesn't work with nomodeset. I'm just wondering if there is a boot option like nomodeset but for failsafe graphics mode.
2011-07-04T08:05:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Is it intel?
2011-07-04T08:05:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	matrox?
2011-07-04T08:06:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	2024W i think
2011-07-04T08:06:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Well you could create an xorg.conf with Driver "vesa", assuming it doesn't fail until it goes to start X
2011-07-04T08:07:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	yeah it fails, it never configured a xorg and i tried to do it manually but it won't work.
2011-07-04T08:07:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	What did you try that isn't working?
2011-07-04T08:08:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	well i tried to manually install video drivers when i boot up in failsafe mode but i can't make a xorg.conf to tell the system to use the new drivers
2011-07-04T08:08:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Why not?
2011-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	couldn't connect to x server. I don't even think the install of the os completed properly because it failed on firstboot
2011-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Well did you try creating an xorg.conf with a Device section and Driver "vesa"?
2011-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	That should at least do what you originally asked for
2011-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	i think i did but i couldn't even configure a new xorg.conf in terminal. Maybe i'll try again. I just thought maybe i could add something to the boot kernel. I installed an old ubuntu that works now but i hate it. Maybe i'll end up just getting a new cheap graphics card.
2011-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	I will post an xorg.conf you can use
2011-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	ok, thanks.
2011-07-04T08:16:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	Put this in /etc/X11/xorg.conf http://pastebin.com/VtPZVTRf
2011-07-04T08:17:00.000Z	fuzzeoly	soreau	ok, thanks soreau. Here's hoping it will boot.
2011-07-04T08:17:00.000Z	soreau	fuzzeoly	me too :)
