2009-02-12T13:56:00.000Z	Milkeh		what was the cmd to rename a directory?
2009-02-12T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	mv
2009-02-12T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	try alacarte
2009-02-12T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	only in kde and fluxbox
2009-02-12T14:13:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	well heres the problem
2009-02-12T14:13:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	I replace the scalable folder, the 72x72 folder and the index.theme
2009-02-12T14:13:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	but now a lot of icons arn't there
2009-02-12T14:14:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	because there in the old scalable folder, how can I merge them together?
2009-02-12T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	not sure man, not something ive done
2009-02-12T14:14:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	well do you know what could be going on here? The NetworkManager applet could not find some required resources.  It cannot continue.
2009-02-12T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	i'd find a way to wipe all settings from nm and then try reconfigure it
2009-02-12T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	its not something i use as I simply edit the interfaces file and it goes
2009-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	I found a solution but I can't work out one thing
2009-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	I have 2 folders, one with a lock on it, and one without, how can I move all the contents from the one with the lock to the one without a lock?
2009-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	why does it have a lock?
2009-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	maybe because I took it from usr/share/icons/hicolor
2009-02-12T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	try sudo cp the files over from the locked folder, you will need to chown them once copied
2009-02-12T14:20:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	sudo cp scalable scalable_ if I want files to go from scalable_ to scalable?
2009-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	that will overwrite the folder with the locked one
2009-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	so how am I going to merge them?
2009-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	i think its cp -r /source/* /dest
2009-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Milkeh	i'd check man cp
2009-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	Milkeh	ActionParsnip1	I have no idea what that means
