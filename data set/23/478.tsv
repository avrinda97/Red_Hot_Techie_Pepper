2011-08-05T16:44:00.000Z	quiseal		Hello, I am running ubuntu 10.10 and was working just fine till today. Today when I started the laptop, the network manager applet is gone and also there is no network.
2011-08-05T16:44:00.000Z	quiseal		I try to acces my router...but it just returns can not connect to...
2011-08-05T16:44:00.000Z	quiseal		What seems to be the problem?
2011-08-05T16:46:00.000Z	quiseal		So, can anyone help me troubleshoot this issue?
2011-08-05T16:48:00.000Z	quiseal		Anyone?
2011-08-05T16:48:00.000Z	quiseal		I need some help to restart the network manager applet. Anyone ?
2011-08-05T16:49:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	kill it and restart it?
2011-08-05T16:49:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 Tried, not working
2011-08-05T16:49:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 I can
2011-08-05T16:50:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 I can't be more explicit sorry, because I am on a live cd.
2011-08-05T16:50:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	but you aren currently here with ubuntu?
2011-08-05T16:50:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 On the live cd I can acces my router's ip ...but when I am on my ubuntu...can't.
2011-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 I am currently running a live cd...
2011-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 Any suggestions ?
2011-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	has your internet access ever worked? andif so, what did you change?
2011-08-05T16:52:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 I have changed nothing. The current connection works on a live cd just fine
2011-08-05T16:52:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	I asked about your ubuntu installation
2011-08-05T16:52:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 The problem is that when I started my machine today, network manager applet was no longer in the gnome bar...and I could not acces my router from firefox which is odd.
2011-08-05T16:53:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 Running 10.10 32 bit ubuntu on the machine
2011-08-05T16:53:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	so check logs, the output of ifconfig, your /etc/network/interfaces, etc
2011-08-05T16:53:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 Ok, I'll try. Isn't there some kind of repair of ubuntu?:)
2011-08-05T16:54:00.000Z	wols	quiseal	no there is no magical repair button. next version maybe
2011-08-05T16:54:00.000Z	quiseal	wols	 Thanks so much :)
