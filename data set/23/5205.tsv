2007-05-31T05:49:00.000Z	aaron__		Can anyone help me? An administration application won't open
2007-05-31T05:49:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	did you try running it from the terminal?  could give helpful hints
2007-05-31T05:50:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	how do i do that?
2007-05-31T05:51:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	i don't know the command used to run that program.  maybe you should right click on the ubuntu menu icon, edit the menu, open that application and see what command it runs
2007-05-31T05:53:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	how do i find out the command it uses?
2007-05-31T05:53:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	when you get the edit dialog open, just right click on the program and select properties
2007-05-31T05:53:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	and then, how do i enter that into the terminal, just as is?
2007-05-31T05:53:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	yeah, should work
2007-05-31T05:54:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	it says "no such file or directory"
2007-05-31T05:55:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	did you copy / paste it into the terminal?
2007-05-31T05:55:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	it's easy to make a typo if not...
2007-05-31T05:56:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	copy/pasted it, but it still just opened, then closed
2007-05-31T05:56:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	no extra output in the terminal?
2007-05-31T05:57:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	no, i do get some extra output
2007-05-31T05:58:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	if it's short you could post it here, if not you could use pastebin.ca
2007-05-31T05:58:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	i'm sorry, pastebin.ca?
2007-05-31T05:59:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	if you go to http://pastebin.ca, you can post lengthier output there, it will give you a url which you can post here and we can take a look at it
2007-05-31T05:59:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	sorry, distracted by a fevered chess game...
2007-05-31T06:00:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	no problem, http://pastebin.ca/524076
2007-05-31T06:02:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	i'm a newb myself, i don't think i can help with this.  maybe you can appeal to the gurus here to look at this feedback.
2007-05-31T06:02:00.000Z	aaron__	ghee	alrighty, who's a guru?
2007-05-31T06:03:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	i.e., i don't know that error.  yeah, good question, i'm also looking for an answer to my question!
2007-05-31T06:05:00.000Z	ghee	aaron__	i think you might have more luck mentioning your pastebin url as well
