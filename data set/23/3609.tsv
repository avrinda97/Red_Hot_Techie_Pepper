2008-03-07T15:44:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 .. ThAnKs !! btw which 1 was a good idea ?  :P
2008-03-07T15:44:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	that /usr2
2008-03-07T15:45:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 omg .. i have to shut up .. it was a lucky freaky chance .. i am not even a toddler in unix .. i am here since yesterday because i am so scared to hit that install button to get ubuntu on my hard drive from this Live CD session .. yesterday i almost burnt my fingers with dataloss .. thanks to this channel that i was saved
2008-03-07T15:47:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	i see,maybe your idea is good, i haven't tried /usr2 ,hehe,linux has many choices windows doesn;t have
2008-03-07T15:47:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	  but .. its so easy in windows to change path to install applications .. like if my C:\ is full, i just say D:\ or E:\ or whatever , is it very difficult to achieve in linux ?
2008-03-07T15:48:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	linux is also easy,you know windows records its path in regedit,linux usually in /etc
2008-03-07T15:49:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 yup .. though how so ever hard i try not to, windows concepts refuse to go away from my brain .. this makes learning linux for me difficult .. I have to learn linux as if its the first OS of my life .. then only i will be good at it
2008-03-07T15:50:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	good luck!
2008-03-07T15:50:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 lol hell i surely need it .. thanks :)
2008-03-07T16:41:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	you said 3400$,how is it
2008-03-07T16:42:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 i run a web cafe in partnership .. and cops keep raiding it to find if we use pirated version of windows
2008-03-07T16:43:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 so lots of $s went in to buy official windows XP copies .. dont want to do it all over again for crappy vista =)
2008-03-07T16:44:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 may be in 6 months or so, i plan to convert all my cyber cafe comps onto ubuntu and still run a gamer's cafe .. basically counter strike, warcraft FT, starcraft , warhammer etc  [ and all these games run through wine ]
2008-03-07T16:44:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	good news for you
2008-03-07T16:45:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 ya man, lots of $s which are not spent on M$ is total profit , so i can donate 30% of it to ubuntu if all goes well
2008-03-07T16:46:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	yes,that is very good for open source community
2008-03-07T16:48:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 i hope so .. i know its not at all too much of money  in total but its surely 30% of my own pure profit  .. well, ethically its good i guess .. to give something because i would be getting free OS
2008-03-07T16:49:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 plus all you guys who have been patiently helping a dunce like me, if u have websites, just give me the link in PM and I will make sure that sponcers on those sites get clicked everyday for next 7 days .. so 30 clicks per sponcer per day through my cafe
2008-03-07T16:51:00.000Z	icesword	Linux_Fresher	hehe,thank you ,sir,but i don't have one,
2008-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	icesword	 aww !! u gotta have web presence these days i guess !! actually i dont have one either lol .. brb coffee time with friend
