2005-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	andrewski		can anyone paste a normal /etc/sudoers file?  i can't seem to get it to work without *not* needing a password....
2005-06-09T06:15:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	man sudoers
2005-06-09T06:15:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	there's a specific example pertaining to your question in there; and sudoers is NOT something you should mess with unless you understand what you're doing
2005-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	the freakin' expert install doesn't enable it. :P
2005-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	enable nopasswd? Of course not.
2005-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	huh?
2005-06-09T06:17:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	what's confusing about that? nopasswd in sudoers is a MASSIVE security risk which should only be taken by people who Know What They're Doing... not, ever, by a default OS setting.
2005-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	Guerin		resiak: i should say SANE os...
2005-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	well, i didn't enable it....
2005-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	i don't doubt that i didn't add my user correctly though.
2005-06-09T06:19:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	oo, triple negative. What precisely do you want to do?
2005-06-09T06:21:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	have my sudoers work for my user like it used to on a normal install.
2005-06-09T06:22:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	what's that, then?
2005-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	when i run 'gksudo foomother', it doesn't ask me for my password; it just runs.  i want it to ask me for my password.
2005-06-09T06:25:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	oh. you want to be prompted for a password for ALL actions? what does your line in /etc/sudoers say?
2005-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
2005-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	andrewski		andrew  ALL=(ALL) ALL
2005-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	that WILL prompt for a password the first time, and keep the password for 15 minutes, by default. After 15 minutes without sudo, it'll prompt again. If you want to change the timeout, that's possible too. Not sure whether gksudo has some extra stupid password-keeper in addition.
2005-06-09T06:28:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	well, i'm never asked.
2005-06-09T06:28:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	if you use plain sudo at a shell, do you get asked?
2005-06-09T06:28:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	no.
2005-06-09T06:30:00.000Z	Guerin	andrewski	then this version of sudo is broken and you should probably purge and reinstall it. But I don't believe you; I suggest you wait for it to timeout and then try again; I bet you get prompted.
2005-06-09T06:30:00.000Z	andrewski	Guerin	ok, i'll try that.  thanks.
