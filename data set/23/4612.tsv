2007-06-23T13:54:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Yet when I start it up and beegin the process, it always hangs at 6%, while loading module trm290
2007-06-23T13:54:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Anybody know what is going on/how I can solve the problem?
2007-06-23T13:56:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		So does anyone know what the problem is with my install process?
2007-06-23T13:57:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		I've done that
2007-06-23T13:57:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		It just hangs at the module immediately after it.
2007-06-23T13:58:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		I'm so tired, been trying to install Feisty since midnight last night.
2007-06-23T13:59:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Breezy was never problematic.
