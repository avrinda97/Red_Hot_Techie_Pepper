2010-05-30T02:35:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	when do you get that error?
2010-05-30T02:36:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	when I install ubuntu
2010-05-30T02:37:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	when you boot up from the live disk?
2010-05-30T02:38:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	you tried to install Ubuntu and you got that message on startup?
2010-05-30T02:39:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	yes.. something about corrupt disk, but installation was good
2010-05-30T02:39:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	do you have a usb drive?
2010-05-30T02:40:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	I don't care if the installation sang kum-bah-yah to you, if it says your disk is corrupt.. maybe you should make a new disk..
2010-05-30T02:40:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	no, copy all the files one at a time..
2010-05-30T02:43:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	so... i need to check md5checksum of my cd disk?
2010-05-30T02:44:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	I dunno, read mastahyeti's link
2010-05-30T02:48:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	when I check checksum and burn disk in linux, what i need do?..
2010-05-30T02:49:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	make sure the md5sums match. It's an integrity test.
2010-05-30T02:50:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	i can't understand, for what I need check iso and burn it?
2010-05-30T02:51:00.000Z	aN00B1s	rooob	explain me please..
2010-05-30T02:53:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	use google. I'm not your personal tutorial.
2010-05-30T02:54:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	also try torrenting.. that automatically hash checks download integrity-- is more trustworthy than http/ftp over random_browser
2010-05-30T02:57:00.000Z	rooob	aN00B1s	you really live up to your namesake don't you.
