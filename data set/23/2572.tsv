2009-02-06T09:34:00.000Z	Mood		if i have 8.10 ubuntu server edition, can i install xfce?
2009-02-06T09:35:00.000Z	Mood		what packages should i install for xfce on top of ubuntu 8.10 server edition?
2009-02-06T09:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	sure.. you can sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop for sure. but you might also be able to install xfce4 from the repos.
2009-02-06T09:35:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	so sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop xfce4 ?
2009-02-06T09:36:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	leave the xfce4 off and do the rest
2009-02-06T09:37:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	cool. have you tried it btw?
2009-02-06T09:37:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	yep.. works fine.. now I'm playing with the terminal and screen.. screen lets you have multiple terminals in one..
2009-02-06T09:38:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	nice. thank you kind sir. kind of like xemacs w/ multiple terminals
2009-02-06T09:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	probably..
2009-02-06T09:38:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	i heard if you install xfce4 by itself, there are some dependencies that get munged.
2009-02-06T09:39:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	that one I've never tied by itself
2009-02-06T09:39:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	ok. i'm convinced that xubuntu-desktop's the way to go. thanks again! :-)
2009-02-06T09:40:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	sure.. you could also do ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop.. but xubuntu is lighter weight and faster
2009-02-06T09:40:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	yep- i mostly run a xubuntu myself, but desktop version. i love it.
2009-02-06T09:41:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	when you sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop you actually have the entire desktop version with the exception of the kernel.. that remains the server
2009-02-06T09:42:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	ah... and all the server stuff, i.e. LAMP, ssh, ftp, etc
2009-02-06T09:42:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	if that stuff is already installed it remains
2009-02-06T09:43:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	yup. hence my logic of first installing server edition stuff for all the services. and just xubuntu-desktop for the GUI eye candy
2009-02-06T09:43:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	you could actually do it either way.
2009-02-06T09:44:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	i'll let ya know if it blows up on me over the next day or two ;-)
2009-02-06T09:46:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	after installing xubuntu-desktop, just restart x session with "xinit", right?
2009-02-06T09:47:00.000Z	scunizi	Mood	yep
2009-02-06T09:47:00.000Z	Mood	scunizi	cool
