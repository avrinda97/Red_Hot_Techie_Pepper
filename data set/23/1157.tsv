2011-12-31T17:39:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	I had the same problem with 11.10 Unity. I ended up installing GNOME Shell just because it kept crashing.
2011-12-31T17:39:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	I didn't upgrade to 12.04 though. lol
2011-12-31T17:39:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	I went for 12.04 instead :)
2011-12-31T17:40:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	My first issue with 12.04 was that the Alpha image wouldn't fit on a CD. lol
2011-12-31T17:40:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	It was 20Mb too big
2011-12-31T17:40:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	heh, I just upgraded :)
2011-12-31T18:01:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	that smells like the proprietary driver is setting some flags in the hardware that persist. Ugly.
2011-12-31T18:02:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	It's been fixed since 10.10 AFAIK...
2011-12-31T18:02:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	I haven't had to do anything like that recently at least.
2011-12-31T18:03:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Can you install a desktop on a server and preserve all the server functions?
2011-12-31T18:03:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	of course. There's no difference between a server and a desktop when it comes to 'server functionality'. All you need are the correct packages.
2011-12-31T18:06:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	the terminal is your friend. Learn to love it :)
2011-12-31T18:07:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	I love the terminal!! In fact, I learned to love it more after my fail-server.
2011-12-31T23:04:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	I've scripted that up in the past: https://raw.github.com/seveas/hacks/master/reset_passwords
2011-12-31T23:04:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Grr! he says he's listening... so i start typing. And he leaves before I press Enter!
2011-12-31T23:08:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	neh, his system is in a bit of a bodged state. Best to stick to low level tools :)
2011-12-31T23:09:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Ahh, in that case, never mind what I said crux00
2011-12-31T23:20:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	This is a dirty hack, but if removing /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstatus is a solution, we could mod his .bashrc file so it's done automatically every time he loads CLI.
2011-12-31T23:20:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	eww no, let's fix the actual problem instead
2011-12-31T23:20:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Fixing the actual problem is definitely preferred! I'm just saying...
2011-12-31T23:21:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Also, I'm a bit giddy for running my first .bashrc hack.
2011-12-31T23:40:00.000Z	Seveas	cypher-neo	but you're probably not using a multi-arch system
2011-12-31T23:43:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Seveas	Props to the master!
