2007-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	lovloss	MaTT_Ubuntu	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	lovloss	MaTT_Ubuntu	You'll find it gives you less trouble than the gui one :P
2007-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	lovloss	MaTT_Ubuntu	for one thing, there are packages not listed in adept. Secondly, you can choose other packages to go with the ones you pick, like documentation, source, and so on. Its way better. But adept is a great way to browse around too
2007-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	lovloss	MaTT_Ubuntu	I said id get windows on a different drive when i started, but this keeps me so busy and interested that i have yet to do so
