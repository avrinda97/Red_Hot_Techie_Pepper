2010-10-02T08:35:00.000Z	tejas		can someone please tell me what this means? configure: error: required curses helper header not found
2010-10-02T08:37:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	Can you reply to coz_'s question?
2010-10-02T08:43:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	For me, it looks like you're missing some files.
2010-10-02T08:44:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	when you were compiling.
2010-10-02T08:44:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	"panel.h usability... no"
2010-10-02T08:46:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	I'm guessing it asked you to do the "./configure" commands, right?
2010-10-02T08:47:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	Have you downloaded the build essential?
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	copy and paste this into the terminal. "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	without the quotes.
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	I see.
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	It takes time to get use to Ubuntu ;)
2010-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	Anyway, download the build essential.
2010-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	hmm.
2010-10-02T08:51:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	Then I guess I don't know.
2010-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	go to the channels that coz_ suggested.
2010-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	"i would go over to both the #alsa channel and the #pulsaudio channel and ask there"
2010-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	the last one?
2010-10-02T08:54:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	There's is an easy way to reply. Type in "mooshi" then hit "tab".
2010-10-02T08:54:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tejas	Shortcut ;)
