2007-08-21T10:06:00.000Z	Dunas		I was under the impression most Linux distros (Ubuntu, Mepis, etc) were incredibly secure as long as the user had some sense about them.
2007-08-21T10:07:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	Yes, this is true.But it's amazing how few people have this common sense
2007-08-21T10:08:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	Sad how often the phrase "Common Sense isn't so common" rings true, isn't it? :(
2007-08-22T08:22:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	I usually find that sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist   works
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	whenever you are running make then make install, the first command normally just puts the .o files in the same directories where it finds the .c files to compile. the make install part is when it transfers the binaries etc to places like /usr/bin   and so on
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	X-x Can I get that in dumbed-down-for-the-newbie-speak?
2007-08-22T09:29:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	Ok. Until you run the command "make install" it has not actually installed anything anywhere yet.
2007-08-22T09:30:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	Yes.
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	If you need to uninstall afterwards, try    make uninstall    and if that doesn't work use    make dist-clean
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	Thank you so much. :)
2007-08-22T09:32:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	you're welcome
2007-08-24T08:41:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	Me
2007-08-24T08:41:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	It's not going so hot.
2007-08-24T08:42:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	Maybe try the  linux driver for that chip as per http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=370579
2007-08-24T08:43:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	I tried that before, it didn't work.
2007-08-24T08:55:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	The Linux driver doesn't work for me, but I think the default one that was blacklisted will.
2007-08-24T08:55:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	Certainly seems to, though NetworkManager isn't showing anything.
2007-08-24T08:56:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	network manager not displaying a connection which is known to be working is some issue I have seen mentioned a lot. The fix escapes me however. someone may know it offhand
2007-08-24T08:59:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	I'm just asking about a replacement for it on the offtopic channel; I know that the default driver was known to cause some crashes, but so far it's working perfectly for me.
2007-08-24T09:01:00.000Z	genii	Dunas	Good luck with it
2007-08-24T09:01:00.000Z	Dunas	genii	Thank you.
