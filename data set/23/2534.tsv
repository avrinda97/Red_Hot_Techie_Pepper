2010-09-04T21:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!tty
2010-09-04T21:50:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	wasn't it a feature of LTS to upgrade directly into another lts?
2010-09-04T21:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	agreed yes it's supposed to work, but unfortunately not in all cases ...the server editions seem to be ok
2010-09-12T21:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	not sure but sounconverter might do that
2010-09-12T21:27:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	unfortunatelly, it doesn't handle wma, as there is no plugin that could be installed to handle this type
2010-09-12T21:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	read my post to ChesterX , above
2010-09-12T21:33:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	too bad, I have all partner repos enabled. I guess I'll have to fetch some windows tool

2010-09-12T21:38:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	great, there's even ppa for that! https://launchpad.net/~blca/+archive/published
2010-09-12T21:52:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	nope, it doesn't handle it either. perhaps it only works with lossy wma
2010-09-12T21:52:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	thanks for help anyway
2010-09-12T21:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	same goes for you,\  have you installed ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2010-09-12T21:54:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	no, installing it right now
2010-09-12T21:57:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	well, it messed pretty bad in my system, because I had some packages which I've compiled myself (like libavcodec and etc). also it installs openjdk (I have no idea why should it require that) and nspluginwrapper+flashplugin-installer
2010-09-12T21:57:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	do you recon i actually need openjdk or it just considers it as a "restricted" and just installs it?
2010-09-12T21:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	java is part of the package
2010-09-12T21:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	I'm not a java expert , but for passive use it's requirement on webpages
2010-09-12T21:59:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	but I already have sun-java
2010-09-12T21:59:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	also, it is jdk and not jvm
2010-09-12T22:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janisozaur	dunno sorry
2010-09-12T22:00:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	anyway, it is installed, will try now
2010-09-12T22:02:00.000Z	janisozaur	BluesKaj	the result is still the same - soundkonverter fails without even notifying me
