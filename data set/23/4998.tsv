2007-03-18T16:23:00.000Z	Mirth		Can anyone help me with a networking problem?
2007-03-18T16:25:00.000Z	Mirth		My Wireless Connection isn't detecting any networks on its own.  Anyone know what that might be?
2007-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	Mirth		My Wireless Connection isn't detecting any networks on its own. Anyone know what that might be?
2007-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Mirth		Any Ubuntu chat rooms that aren't busy and I can get some help from?
2007-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Mirth		I did twice :(
2007-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Mirth		There's just too much talking, hehe...
2007-03-18T16:28:00.000Z	Mirth		Okay
2007-03-18T16:29:00.000Z	Mirth		The device says "eth1", but isn't Wireless supposed to be "wlan0"?
2007-03-18T16:29:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	It depends on the driver. Intel comes up as eth1, among ohters.
2007-03-18T16:29:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Does iwconfig give anything useful?
2007-03-18T16:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Run lspci, and look for an Intel Ethernet controller in the list.
2007-03-18T16:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Open up a terminal, under Applications->Accessories
2007-03-18T16:37:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Run `lsmod | grep ipw'
2007-03-18T16:38:00.000Z	Mirth	Fujitsu	it gives me this:
2007-03-18T16:38:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	OK, that's the same one I have.
2007-03-18T16:38:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Can you run `sudo iwlist scan'?
2007-03-18T16:38:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Does that command show you anything?
2007-03-18T16:39:00.000Z	Mirth	Fujitsu	am I allowed to paste what it gave me here, because it's pretty long...
2007-03-18T16:39:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Does it list any networks at all? (please don't paste here)
2007-03-18T16:41:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Is the network in question listed?
2007-03-18T16:42:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	Which application are you using to select the network.
2007-03-26T09:42:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	sudo nautilus, perhaps.
2007-03-26T09:47:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Mirth	gksu is generally safer, and is graphical.
