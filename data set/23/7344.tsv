2005-10-17T09:18:00.000Z	crimsun		*.ubuntu.com, launchpad.net will be down for about 10 minutes.
2005-10-17T05:40:00.000Z	crimsun		Xfce doesn't distribute a sound daemon
2005-10-17T05:40:00.000Z	crimsun		its purpose is to remain lightweight
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun		yes
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun		Xfce doesn't care
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun		it's your applications that care
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun		no, remember the whole "don't care about sound daemon" bit?
2005-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	LoL !
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	but if I use firefox or media players, will I hear sound ?
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	it'll use the Alsa layer or ESD ?
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	There is no Multimedia system selector ?
2005-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	(that's good) becuase Gnome's ESD in hoary crashes on me..
2005-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	:p: !
2005-10-17T06:16:00.000Z	crimsun	LaserLine	then it uses the same amd64 kernel
2005-10-17T06:16:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	not the IA64 ?
2005-10-17T06:16:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	yeah, Itanium...
2005-10-19T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	LaserLine	use java-package from multiverse.
2005-10-19T13:42:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	I have that package, what to do with it ?
2005-10-19T13:45:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	I have that package, what should I do with it ?
2005-10-19T13:50:00.000Z	LaserLine	crimsun	What should I do with java-package ?
2005-10-19T13:50:00.000Z	crimsun	LaserLine	create a deb from the Sun JRE/JDK that you downloaded.
2005-10-19T13:51:00.000Z	crimsun	LaserLine	the deb that you will create handles the symlinks.
2005-10-19T13:53:00.000Z	crimsun	LaserLine	it did for me. I tested IBM's JREs and JDKs, Sun's JREs and JDKs, and Blackdown's JDK.
