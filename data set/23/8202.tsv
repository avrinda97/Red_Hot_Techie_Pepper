2004-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	What's the problem?
2004-12-03T13:33:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Hmm, are the modules for it loaded?

2004-12-03T13:40:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	try `sudo ifup eth0`
2004-12-03T13:41:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Hmm...
2004-12-03T13:41:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	cat /etc/networking/interfaces
2004-12-03T13:41:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Actually that should be `cat /etc/network/interfaces`
2004-12-03T13:43:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Computer -> System Configuration -> Networking if you want to do it the gui way.
2004-12-03T13:43:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Did you restart the network?
2004-12-03T13:44:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Try adding: iface eth0 inet dhcp   as well
2004-12-03T13:47:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Hmm, you on dialup?
2004-12-03T13:47:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Well, then try to ping google.com
2004-12-03T13:48:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Or just visit a website or something. :)
2004-12-03T13:49:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	And have you tried pinging google?
2004-12-03T13:50:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	Sorry, I can't help you there. :/
2004-12-03T14:32:00.000Z	madsen	Iskanje	I think that follows the X setup.
