2007-09-10T08:43:00.000Z	tek-ops		or X crashs and restarts
2007-09-10T08:43:00.000Z	tek-ops	con	which is it?
2007-09-10T08:44:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	2 min to think
2007-09-10T08:44:00.000Z	tek-ops		it's a simple question, does you machine go all the way down and have to go through bios and post then reload the bootloader, thus the kernel etc...
2007-09-10T08:44:00.000Z	tek-ops		or does the pretty graphics stop and restart?
2007-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	reload the bootloader
2007-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	tek-ops		so no one here has any clue about ps?
2007-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	tek-ops	con	what video card do you have?
2007-09-10T08:46:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	nvidea geforce 3 ti 200
2007-09-10T08:46:00.000Z	tek-ops	con	for one, i've never used google earth
2007-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	tek-ops		however, if your OS crashes from it.... it's causing a seg fault, I'm guessing due to a driver improperly loaded
2007-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	i have to install nvidea drivers ??
2007-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	tek-ops	con	you didn't already?
2007-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	tek-ops		how old is the geforce 3?
2007-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	tek-ops		wow
2007-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	yes 4-5 years
2007-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	tek-ops		well con, I'd love to stick around and help you out
2007-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	tek-ops		but I'm actually at work and trying to resolve an issue with data flow mapping of our SAN arrays
2007-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	con	tek-ops	ok nevermind
