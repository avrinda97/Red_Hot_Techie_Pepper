2005-05-03T07:52:00.000Z	transgress		damn it... vlc will not recognize vlc-esd...
2005-05-03T07:53:00.000Z	transgress		it's like i didn't even install it
2005-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	transgress		and vlc seems to be the only thing that plays dvd's worth a damn
2005-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	Dull404	transgress	why not mplayer ?
2005-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	transgress	Dull404	it locks up whenever i try to play a dvd with it
2005-05-03T07:55:00.000Z	Dull404	transgress	change some settings then, as mplayer "is" the player ;)
2005-05-03T07:58:00.000Z	Dull404	transgress	how do you mean?
