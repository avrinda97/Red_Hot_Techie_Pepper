2008-01-28T20:32:00.000Z	bkar		gilda-> fdisk -l   and see if it detects it
2008-01-28T20:33:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	it doesnt at all
2008-01-28T20:33:00.000Z	bkar		gilda-> is the hard driver working?
2008-01-28T20:34:00.000Z	bkar		gilda-> is the hard drive working rather
2008-01-28T20:34:00.000Z	gilda		yes the hard drive works its running an alternate linux distro - with ext 2
2008-01-28T20:34:00.000Z	gilda		and ext3
2008-01-28T20:35:00.000Z	bkar		gilda-> no response at all when you do fdisk -l
2008-01-28T20:35:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	nothing
2008-01-28T20:35:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	just brings me back to root prompt
2008-01-28T20:36:00.000Z	bkar	gilda	 dmesg | grep  sd   or maybe hd
2008-01-28T20:36:00.000Z	bkar		Incompetnce-> mount
2008-01-28T20:37:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	 grepping sd - nothing grepping hd- just my dvd drive
2008-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	bkar		gilda-> i dont know, maybe reboot, make sure it is active in the bios? it should have been detected
2008-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	bkar		!sound
2008-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	it is active in the bios - it works perfectly - i am on the live cd multiple attempts no change
2008-01-28T20:39:00.000Z	bkar	gilda	i dont know, reboot and try liveCD again
2008-01-28T20:40:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	ive rebooted multiple times checked the md5sum of my iso to make sure non corrupted and still no go
2008-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	gilda		the only thing i can think that may be related is that lspci | grep IDE
2008-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	gilda		00:09.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP65 IDE (rev a1)
2008-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	gilda		00:0a.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP65 SATA Controller (rev a3)
2008-01-28T20:43:00.000Z	bkar	gilda	oh sata controller, i think there was an issue of delayed detection, i forgot what the resolution is though
2008-01-28T20:44:00.000Z	gilda	bkar	ya im looking for a workaround cuz im kinda sol at the moment - was testing distros and couldnt stand the one installed =p
2008-01-28T20:48:00.000Z	bkar	gilda	which liveCD are you using to install?
