2010-02-27T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	stop the language please
2010-02-27T14:48:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	are you serious?
2010-02-27T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	yes
2010-04-09T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	a.) you may have it marked as read only b.) ntfs won't support unix based file permissions in the same way
2010-04-09T12:56:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	Orly @ the unix based file permissions.... So... what are my options?
2010-04-09T12:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	well you can change the permissions (if it's mounted read/write) as the root user
2010-04-09T12:57:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	there lies the problem... It's mounted as rw and when i sudo chmod  it doesnt work...
2010-04-09T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	can you show me the output of the command "mount" in a pastebin please
2010-04-09T12:57:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	sure.
2010-04-09T12:59:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	you want my entire mount or just the partition...
2010-04-09T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	just the output of the command "mount" on it's own please
2010-04-09T13:00:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/eWu097pU
2010-04-09T13:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	where is it mounted, I don't see an NTFS mouint on there
2010-04-09T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	oh, it's it the media/DAD005----blah one
2010-04-09T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	I'm wrong http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/installation/296-fat32-ntfs-write-permissions.html
2010-04-09T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	I knew it didn't support permissions, but I thought they could be changeds, they can't
2010-04-09T13:03:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	fuck.
2010-04-09T13:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	hey - control the language, that's not needed
2010-04-09T13:04:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	sorry :S
2010-04-09T13:12:00.000Z	Moral_	ikonia	I guess my next question is this: I needed to chmod that file so apache could read it, as I wanted to watch my movies over my network. What Else can I do besides SSH to watch my movies?
2010-04-09T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	don't need to hear about it in here
2010-10-02T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	drop the attitude
2010-10-02T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Moral_	log the bug - or don't
