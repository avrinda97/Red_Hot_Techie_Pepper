2012-09-22T05:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	In that link you posted for reinstalling grub to the mbr is the bootrepair tool, that tool will generate a bootscript that would probably be our best way of helping you.
2012-09-22T06:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	cool follopw L3top I just happened to look at the channel.
2012-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Do you have a recovery or install disc and what windows version is it?
2012-09-22T08:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	YOU just need if the windows boot is okay the terminal in the booted disc and run. BootRec.exe /fixmbr
2012-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Here is a whole rebuild set if needed if the command above does not due it. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1219922/   Read the posts I said the command from the terminal on the booted windows disc.
2012-09-22T08:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Take a look at the pastebin it has instuctions to getting to the terminal an the disc and a link to show you if needed.
2012-09-22T08:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	I'm not sure what you mean?
2012-09-22T08:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	To boot windows without grub, you have to load the windows bootloader to the mbr, which is what the first command I posted does.
2012-09-22T08:59:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	I'm not sure what is on your HD, in all that commotion earlier it seemed some stuff was missing.  I have the feeling you are grasping at straws here, I don't really help unless I have I a full downlow of what is going on.
2012-09-22T09:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	IN other words I suspect you can not boot the windows disc, this should be mentioned if it is the case.
2012-09-22T09:01:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	I'm  not sure what that means.
2012-09-22T09:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	So am I correct you can't boot the windows disc to get to a recovery terminal?
2012-09-22T09:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Have you looked at the pastebin I posted it tells you how to get to the recovery terminal?
2012-09-22T09:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Is there a W7 install or just a recovery on the HD?
2012-09-22T09:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Ah you need a install to use the command to reload the windows bootloader.
2012-09-22T09:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	If you had run the bootrepair in the beginning as I suggested long ago to get a bootscript posted a lot of this hassle would have been avoided, instead of flailing to fix.
2012-09-22T09:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	Here is a link I'm going to crash soon so I doubt I can be of help, but the ubuntu forum is a great place I would post the script there and your intentions and tools you have. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
2012-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	sam__	No problem I think we all want to see you up and running. ;)
