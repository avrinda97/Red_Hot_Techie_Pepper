2010-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	do you run ubuntu servers?
2010-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	huh. Well, I was experimenting with LAMP at home someday
2010-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	what repos do you typically enable?
2010-05-15T09:03:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	http://paste.ubuntu.com/433666/
2010-05-15T09:03:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	thanks for the info
2010-05-15T09:05:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	naja, latest != best
2010-05-15T09:06:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	Well i dunno... I compiled latest Nmap from source and it is perfect, dunno why we still have that old version :/
2010-05-15T09:07:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	yeah, compiling from source is something I want to avoid as much as possible
2010-05-15T09:08:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	by old, you mean the package in universe?
2010-05-15T09:08:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	Usually sums up to "gzip -d somefile.tar.gz && tar xfjv somefile.tar && cd somefile-folder && ./configure && make && sudo make install", and yeah I mean that
2010-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	--no-install-recommends
2010-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	hmm... I think they had an article on that, but can't remember where
2010-05-15T14:26:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	Found! If you want to avoid this for specific packages,  use apt-get --no-install-recommends; if you  want to make this permanent, set APT::Install-Recommends "false";  in /etc/apt/apt.conf. Be aware that this may  result in missing features in some programs.
2010-05-15T14:26:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	thanks for that flag anyway, it helps
2010-05-15T14:29:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	"town"? I'd say it's totally another country. On another continent, as a matter of fact.
2010-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	I copied the fragment to /etc/apt/apt.conf but install mysql-server still gives a bloated list of packages compared to --no-install-recommends
2010-05-15T14:45:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	do I need to do something to flush the conf changes?
2010-05-15T14:45:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	I dunno, maybe apt-get update or something
2010-05-15T14:46:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	Well, this is what I'm readin' http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004#Recommended%20packages%20installed%20by%20default
2010-05-15T14:47:00.000Z	kerozene	theadmin	it says '(this change was made in 8.10) but I'm running 8.04 :)
2010-05-15T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	uuuh o_O
2010-05-15T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	You never told me
2010-05-15T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin	kerozene	No idea then
