2010-11-03T17:29:00.000Z	rigved	gump	try iwconfig
2010-11-03T17:30:00.000Z	rigved	gump	ifup wlan0
2010-11-03T17:30:00.000Z	rigved	gump	sudo ifup wlan0
2010-11-03T17:31:00.000Z	rigved	gump	same instructions as coz_, except use wlan0
2010-11-03T17:32:00.000Z	rigved	gump	type iwconfig
2010-11-03T17:33:00.000Z	gump	rigved	iwconfig returns wlan0 as the network
2010-11-03T17:33:00.000Z	rigved	gump	and you said that sudo ifup wlan0 does not work, right?
2010-11-03T17:33:00.000Z	rigved	gump	wierd
2010-11-03T17:34:00.000Z	rigved	gump	do you have the LiveCD
2010-11-03T17:34:00.000Z	rigved	gump	yes
2010-11-03T18:36:00.000Z	rigved	gump	i think should try the option: repair broken system (only in alternate cd)
2010-11-03T18:39:00.000Z	rigved	gump	if it is as aeon-ltd says, then you will need to unpack the iso (LiveCD image) to a temporary folder, then you will need to unpak the rootfs (the squashfs) and then you will be able to access all the packages (inside /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-11-03T19:11:00.000Z	rigved	gump	i think apt-get and aptitude both are available (and they are not part of gnome_
2010-11-03T19:11:00.000Z	rigved	gump	they are part of the basic debian system (CLI)
2010-11-03T19:16:00.000Z	rigved	gump	you need to boot into your normal hard disk installation (CLI), then load the LiveCD; then unpack the iso, followed by unpacking the squashfs image, the you can access the /var/cache/apt folder of the cd, then you can install the packages from it that you want
