2011-08-23T06:47:00.000Z	Mankool		Is there anyone here who has run or could help me figure out how to run 2 graphics cards, 1 ati, 1 nvidia? I've been online searching + xorg.conf'ing a lot, but nothing seems to work.
2011-08-23T06:49:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	i have heard of 2 ati's, or 2 nvidia's, but crossing the streams is dangerous lol. i'll take a look for you and see what i can dig up... :)
2011-08-23T06:49:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	thanks.. yeah from what i've heard, few have crossed streams and lived to tell
2011-08-23T06:50:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	I'm not looking to get compiz-amazing results, i just wnat to be able to run 3 montors, 2 on my ati and 1 on my nvidia, and the nvidia can even be a separate X if its easier
2011-08-23T06:51:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	though for starters, just 1 mon ati 1 mon nvidia would be great
2011-08-23T06:52:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	does the second card work at all? (minimalised gfx ofcoarse...)
2011-08-23T06:53:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	i can get my ati to work separate with any driver, and my nvidia same... but together i can't even get them to work using fbdev or vesa
2011-08-23T06:54:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	i've also been trying ati using fglrx and nvidia using vesa, and ati-fglrx and nvidia-fbdev
2011-08-23T07:06:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	any luck?
2011-08-23T07:11:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	sorry, no. i would think this would be dooable, but i know that each driver set comes with controls for .xinitrc, and they probably would collide. my intuition is that it would be possible by installing both drivers, and then setting up x manually.. but i can't say for sure,,,
2011-08-23T07:11:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	know anything about OPtion "MultiHead" in ServerLayout?
2011-08-23T07:13:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	i am afraid i don't i found this on google: http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.1/doc/xorg.conf.5.html, but you probably saw that yourself...
2011-08-27T09:32:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	are you there?
2011-08-27T09:32:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	yes i am.
2011-08-27T09:32:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	do you remember my great journey i was on?
2011-08-27T09:34:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	vaguely, i just came back from a 3 day road trip...
2011-08-27T09:34:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	ah, well anyway, i made miracles... 2 gpus (1 ati 1 nvidia)... and now have 4 mons running, 2 on each
2011-08-27T09:35:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	now i remember, wow. that is dang near impossible on ubuntu, did you figure it out yourself, or did you get some irc or bard help?
2011-08-27T09:36:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	just put in some long hours reading stuff on the web and basically endless trial and error
2011-08-27T09:36:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	it's a pain, but when you succeed it feels amazing...
2011-08-27T09:37:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	very true, it felt so good... and now I want more... always wanting more.. i don't think i should even try for unity... i can't even find remote websites of multiple gpus and attempting unity with success
2011-08-27T09:38:00.000Z	hylian	Mankool	i am with you on the unity thing, i am a xubuntu'er currently myself.
2011-08-27T09:39:00.000Z	Mankool	hylian	yeah, and i don't even have a reason for wanting it, i don't even necessarily think it looks the coolest... i'm my own worst enemy, its like some crazy challenge that for some reason i wanted to do.. but its so not worth the time i'm thinking, i should just be happy with my current setup that i've dubbed 'quadmon'
