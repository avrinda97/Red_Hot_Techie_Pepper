2009-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Tobbe		My install of ubuntu worked fine but when I boot my computer I get Grub Error 17. I've entered a linux environment and has mounted my linux partition so I can read fstab and /grub/menu.lst but I have no idea what the error is
2009-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Tobbe		Can someone help me solve Grub Error 17?
2009-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	google maybe
2009-03-17T21:11:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	what did you do before error 17 came up?
2009-03-17T21:12:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	Installed ubuntu from a USB stick
2009-03-17T21:12:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	so it hasnt been working before...hmm ok
2009-03-17T21:12:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	Exactly. I'm guessing there is some error in either fstab or menu.lst, but I'm not skilled enough to see what the problem is
2009-03-17T21:13:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	or just in the grub config, right...
2009-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	on bootup...you can press ESC key to make grub halt for input....you can edit entries with the 'e' key....verify the settings....google if you dont understand each..or ask here again....
2009-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	another nice tool might be supergrub
2009-03-17T21:15:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	but i guess you are new to linux and the really most important thing to learn at the beggining is: learn to read, learn and understand. sounds common, but its really essential with linux
2009-03-17T21:16:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	Actually, I've used Linux for several years :/ Never had Ubuntus autoinstall of grub fail on me though
2009-03-17T21:17:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	ok :)
2009-03-17T21:17:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	so why not learn grub :)
2009-03-17T21:18:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	To be honest, I'm just not all that comfortable playing around the booting etc. I'm so used to it just working and I really don't want to risk anything
2009-03-17T21:19:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	the risk to do sth. wrong it there, if you dont read and understand...
2009-03-17T21:20:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	someone here could tell you to user \rm -rf /& to fix it.....and then?
2009-03-17T21:20:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	but take a look at http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2009-03-17T21:20:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	Well, I'm not stupid :) I wouldn't just input anything someone told me without checking out what their instructions meant
2009-03-17T21:22:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	then try the supergrub linke i gave you before
2009-03-17T21:22:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	I guess I can try putting supergrub on my USB and see if it helps
2009-03-17T21:23:00.000Z	beli	Tobbe	you need to use it from a bootable device...but just read ;)
2009-03-17T21:24:00.000Z	Tobbe	beli	I know, I installed linux from the USB stick so
