2008-05-04T22:27:00.000Z	matthew_		most of the time
2008-05-04T22:29:00.000Z	matthew_		anyone know how to find the PID of a process bound to a certain port then to kill it by that PID?

2008-05-04T22:32:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	netstat -naltp | grep ':[port]'
2008-05-04T22:33:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	thanks, now how do I pipe that to 'sudo kill <PID>' ?
2008-05-04T22:33:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	you don't... once you see hte pid, then you can 'sudo kill -9 [type in the pid]'
2008-05-04T22:33:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	I need to get a script to do it, so thats not really an option...
2008-05-04T22:34:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	you could pipe in the pid with some regex matching
2008-05-04T22:37:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	also try 'lsof -i tcp:[port]'
2008-05-04T22:37:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	whats that do?
2008-05-04T22:37:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	same thing, but without the | grep
2008-05-04T22:38:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	that dosn't return anything...
2008-05-04T22:38:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	then there's nothing listening on that [port]
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	sry, I forgot to run it with sudo
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	eureka
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	look at hte man page for the command, 'fuser'. It only outputs the PID to stdout, so you can use it to script and pipe to the kill command
2008-05-04T22:40:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	I hate man pages, but I'll do that
2008-05-04T22:45:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	fuser has a -k option to kill the program using the spceified  port, i'm going to use that
2008-05-04T22:45:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	sweet... I'll have to remember that one myself. Does it let you specify the kill type (e.g. -9)?
2008-05-04T22:46:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	using --signal it lets you chose the signal it sends, by default it's SIGKILL
2008-05-04T22:47:00.000Z	stbain	matthew_	very nice... I'll have to add that to my arsenal
2008-05-04T22:47:00.000Z	matthew_	stbain	yes, it is, i'm making a server restart thing for a bunch of server apps, and I need to run it from php, so this should be perfect
