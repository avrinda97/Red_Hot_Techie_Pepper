2007-07-17T05:36:00.000Z	phoenixz		How do I stop the firewall on (k)ubuntu??
2007-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	there is no firewall configured by default.
2007-07-17T05:40:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	So there is also no way to quickly enable and disable the firewall?
2007-07-17T05:40:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	did you ever configure a firewall?
2007-07-17T05:40:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	Yeah, using fwbuilder, nice tool!
2007-07-17T05:41:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	you probably have to dump all the rules.
2007-07-17T05:41:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	also try that question in #linux
2007-07-17T05:41:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	and google.
2007-07-17T05:41:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	lets just say.. on Fedora I could do "service iptables stop" and thats it.. firewall: off
2007-07-17T05:42:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	service firewall start, firewall: on
2007-07-17T05:42:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	yeah I'm familiar with those, but not at all familiar with iptables management.
2007-07-17T05:43:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	I have to say.. that "service" command in fedora really was nice.. Though I love kubuntu (sorry, Im an kde guy) I really miss that command
2007-07-17T05:46:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	service iptables stop will dump all the rules...the rules are saved in a separate file that it uses when you "start" it...
2007-07-17T05:51:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	Exactly.. and its an easy thing to do
2007-07-17T06:02:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	doh! The service command DOES exist.. its only not installed.. typing service in bash tells you exactly what you need to install to get it :) kubuntu rulez!
2007-07-17T06:03:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	interesting...let me know if it works as expected.
2007-07-17T06:07:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	works.. install debian-helper-scripts and "service" command is available
2007-07-17T06:08:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	only bad thing about apt-get is that its kind of bad with conflicts and problem messages.. if there is a conflict, half of what I selected is installed, the other half is not.. and the other half I selected is no longer selected either, and if that were like 20 packages, good luck with finding out which ones I selected again.. and "There is a conflict" is also not too clear, what conflict? with what package? why?
2007-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	NOT that I am complaining :)
2007-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	I have to say, I have always found apt-get very smart...."There is a conflict" has never happened for me.
2007-07-17T06:10:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	When there is a conflict it does not give a whole lot of info about it.. actually, apt-get gives really vague errors, and adept manager only says "a conflict or something"... That could be improved I think
2007-07-17T06:10:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	phoenixz	pastebin an example.
2007-07-17T06:10:00.000Z	phoenixz	RoC_MasterMind	well, when I encounter another conflict, I will :) ATM I have nothing to install
