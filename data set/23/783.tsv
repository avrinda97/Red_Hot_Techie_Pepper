2011-02-07T13:55:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	ubuntu-restricted-extras is a good start
2011-02-07T13:55:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	E: Unable to locate package ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-02-07T13:56:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	Have you run 'apt-get update' yet?
2011-02-07T13:56:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	Then you might not have the right repository enabled.
2011-02-07T13:56:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	how can i fix it
2011-02-07T13:58:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	It's in the multiverse repos...  I'm looking up how to enable them.
2011-02-07T13:58:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	thanks
2011-02-07T13:59:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	i think i got the deb, one sec
2011-02-07T13:59:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	Go to System>Update Manager>Settings.  Under the 'Ubuntu Software' tab, make sure 'Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)' is checked.
2011-02-07T14:09:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	still not working
2011-02-07T14:09:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	Bogus.  Which apps have you tried it in?
2011-02-07T14:09:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	vlc and gnome mplayer
2011-02-07T14:10:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	And you've tried the files on other setups and it works?
2011-02-07T14:12:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	The problem is that avis can be encoded by any one of a large number of codecs, so you don't always know what you're working with.  I'm pretty surprised that VLC can't play them regardless.
2011-02-07T14:12:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	its divx
2011-02-07T14:13:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	I'm pretty sure that the restricted extras cover divx.
2011-02-07T14:14:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	i have it installed but its still not working
2011-02-07T14:14:00.000Z	Niglop	wiseguyxp	maybe its something i accidently unninstalled earlier because they were working lastnight
2011-02-07T14:16:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	If that's the case, then I'm officially stumped.  Sorry I couldn't get it fixed for you, but I need to get to bed.
2011-02-07T14:16:00.000Z	wiseguyxp	Niglop	No problem.
