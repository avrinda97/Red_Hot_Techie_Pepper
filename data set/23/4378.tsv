2007-09-27T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia		thats a good start
2007-09-27T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia		gateway is not listed in ifconfig
2007-09-27T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia		or course there is
2007-09-27T06:32:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- what linux or unix are you using
2007-09-27T06:32:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- any ubuntu fiesty servers? also, can you tell me what your config is
2007-09-27T06:33:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- i was just hoping to find a HOWTO doc and follow that.
2007-09-27T06:34:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- nope
2007-09-27T06:36:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- :) i'm not running gui also. i'll google keepalived
2007-09-27T06:40:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- for lvs, are you using nat,tun, or dr setup?
2007-09-27T06:41:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- tks. i'm looking for the BEST possible scenario as i want to have all bases covered
2007-10-03T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	you need ip vritualisation support (I think thats the option name) its by iptables
2007-10-03T16:47:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- i have iptables support but ipvsadm say that my kernel does not support ivps.
2007-10-03T16:48:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	hang on, I'll see if I can find the option. As its not only the kernel, but your daemon controller (keepalived for example) that needs support
2007-10-03T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	just going through the kernel options
2007-10-03T16:52:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- tks, what ubuntu are you using and do you use lvs?
2007-10-03T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	I'm not using lvs on ubuntu at the moment
2007-10-03T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	I'm getting your options now
2007-11-29T19:15:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	what do you want to do
2008-01-04T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	not wise to stop it mid download/install
2008-01-04T19:54:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- i think i already closed the download package window but the update manager window is still showing with the spinning icon
2008-01-04T19:55:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- trying a restart! ;)
2008-01-10T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	linux4me	jabber
2008-01-10T18:07:00.000Z	linux4me	ikonia	- thanks
