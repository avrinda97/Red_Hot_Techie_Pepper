2010-03-25T08:48:00.000Z	oberdada		hello. An SD card mounts ok on my mini with SD port. However, on my desktop, where i have one of those multiformat USB card readers, the SD card mounts as read only. How can i get it to mount as read/write?
2010-03-25T08:49:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	you sure the mechanical switch on the sd-cardis set to writable?
2010-03-25T08:53:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	is it also ubuntu on the otherpc?samefilesystem?
2010-03-25T08:53:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	mini-8.04 desktop:8.10
2010-03-25T08:57:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	just read some similar problem,have you tried to copy something on it with sudo?
2010-03-25T08:58:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	yes. i've tried chmoding it- it wont let me
2010-03-25T08:58:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	in the text i readit randomly was mountedroor rw, then it was plugged in as another user and it worked
2010-03-25T08:59:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	- i tried mkfs'ing it. it didnt work (cannot format a mounted drive, cannot find the device if its not mounted)
2010-03-25T09:00:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	what d'you mean mounted roor rw?
2010-03-25T09:01:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	in the example the user was able to write to the card with sudo nautilus
2010-03-25T09:02:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	oh i see. i wasnt able to do that
2010-03-25T09:02:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	and he tried it with another normal user account and then the sd-card worked again, odd
2010-03-25T09:11:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	did you try to connect the reader to the mini? if it doesn't work there either, it could be a driver bug, or sth like that, has it ever worked read/writable before with ubuntu?
2010-03-25T09:14:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	I don't have one of those,I'm using a camera in SD-Card Reader modesometimes,maybe this would be a workaround until you find a way to fix your problem
2010-03-25T09:15:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	in = as
2010-03-25T09:17:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	the two computers aren't on a LAN I suggest?
2010-03-25T09:18:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	and the reader has worked before with ubuntu or was it always like that?
2010-03-25T09:20:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	what I mean is, did you manage to use the reader with ubuntu before as intended?
2010-03-25T09:21:00.000Z	oberdada	ubutom2	nope. never could use it as intended on the machine its on. the read-only SD card wont even let me Gparted it
2010-03-25T09:22:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	hm, ok,as I don't know how to fix this, my advice would be to replace the reader, if possible :)
2010-03-25T09:22:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	or maybe you can test a live cd with it
2010-03-25T09:22:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	or even consider an upgrade to 9.10
2010-03-25T09:24:00.000Z	ubutom2	oberdada	there's a chance it could be working with a newer release
