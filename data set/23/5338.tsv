2007-01-05T14:34:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	try playing with import -window id
2007-01-05T14:34:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	isnt it hard to find out a window's id ?
2007-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	so?
2007-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	lol, any other options  yet?
2007-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	you can try typing import -window "gaim"
2007-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	or import -window "Buddy List"
2007-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	I can indeed Try that, but I'm quite sure that will not work from the first Try in many situations...
2007-01-05T14:38:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	the title for this window is #ubuntu, lets try import -window #ubuntu ubuntu_scr.png
2007-01-05T14:38:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	you need quotations
2007-01-05T14:39:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	worked for me
2007-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	not for me :/
2007-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	: what exactly did you enter ?
2007-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	in gaim, i have a window named h3xis, i do import -window "h3xis" h3ix.png
2007-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	it works fine
2007-01-05T14:41:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	here it took a screenshot from entire screen , i did import -window "#ubuntu" screen_2.png
2007-01-05T14:43:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	then just look up the pid and use that
2007-01-05T14:44:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	go get xwininfo
2007-01-05T14:44:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	import: no window with specified ID exists `4819'.
2007-01-05T14:45:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	no, i didn't mean that.. u can use the pid and look it up in xwininfo if u have it
2007-01-05T14:45:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	yes I just found out :p
2007-01-05T14:46:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	then I dont get why import -window "#ubuntu" scr.png returns a full screen shot...
2007-01-05T14:54:00.000Z	seanzer	tim167	then fix it, alt+prnt scrn does whole screen and shift+alt+prtn scrn doesn active window for me
2007-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	tim167	seanzer	the prob i have is: screenshot crashes, it does do the screenshot however, but BugBuddy stalls my system every time i use alt+printsc
