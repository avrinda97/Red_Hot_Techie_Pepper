2009-05-28T12:02:00.000Z	vanita		and what files system &  mount point should I use?
2009-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	vanita		so I click free space and then new partition
2009-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	vanita		first I should create the swap partition, then the main partition?
2009-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	vanita		what should I mount the swap as /swap?
2009-05-28T12:04:00.000Z	vanita		I have 500gb available for ubuntu in the free space
2009-05-28T12:04:00.000Z	vanita		oh
2009-05-28T12:04:00.000Z	vanita		ok
2009-05-28T12:04:00.000Z	vanita		how does ubuntu normally do it?
2009-05-28T12:05:00.000Z	vanita		do you setup / as primary and /swap and /home as logical?
2009-05-28T12:06:00.000Z	vanita		also use ext3 journaling for all?
2009-05-28T12:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	vanita	swap isn't mounted and therfore doesn't use a mount point
2009-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	vanita		you mean, use the largest continous free space?
2009-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	vanita		there's an option like that
2009-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	vanita		if I don't select the manual partition option (advanced)
2009-05-28T12:08:00.000Z	vanita		ok
2009-05-28T12:09:00.000Z	vanita		so if I make one for /home and another for / how does it know where to put swap?
2009-05-28T12:09:00.000Z	vanita		do I have to leave empty space for swap and it automatically creates it?
2009-05-28T12:10:00.000Z	vanita		ok
2009-05-28T12:10:00.000Z	vanita	ubuntu	9.04
2009-05-28T12:10:00.000Z	vanita		x64 desktop
2009-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	vanita		so I'll create one 16000 MB partition for / and the rest for /home
2009-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	vanita		and a 6gb partition for swap
2009-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	vanita	how much ram do you have?
