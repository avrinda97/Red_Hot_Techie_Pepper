2010-10-10T15:57:00.000Z	ehsan		Hi my friends
2010-10-10T15:57:00.000Z	ehsan		I want to upgrade from ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10
2010-10-10T15:58:00.000Z	ehsan		and I did the instructions which said in ubuntu site
2010-10-10T15:59:00.000Z	ehsan		and run update-manager and click on check button to check and download and install updades
2010-10-10T15:59:00.000Z	ehsan		It find some updates and downloaded them and install them
2010-10-10T15:59:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	in update manager, go to settings and change update type to normal, not LTS
2010-10-10T16:00:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	did you change the update type settings?
2010-10-10T16:00:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	it will only check once every 24hrs by itself
2010-10-10T16:01:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	ok, did you click on check for updates and still nothing?
2010-10-10T16:01:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	ok, go to terminal and type in update-manager -d
2010-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	will force it to look for newest version, 10.10 is only new one as no beta of 11.04 yet
2010-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	ehsan	NickyJ101	I'd just to it but it didn't find anything
2010-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	hmmm, seems odd.
2010-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	ok, you may need to download the alternate install cd and do an update that way (no cd needed, just the iso) does the same thing
2010-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	ehsan	NickyJ101	Should we change the repositories to Maverick?
2010-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	you could give that a go
2010-10-10T16:06:00.000Z	ehsan	NickyJ101	how upgrade from ISO?
2010-10-10T16:07:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	get the alternate iso, then you mount it and it can read its iso, will find the link, hold on
2010-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	ehsan	NickyJ101	Do you mean alternate iso the same ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso?
2010-10-10T16:10:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	not the same, there should be an alternate install cd version
2010-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	here the release page for Maverick http://releases.ubuntu.com/maverick/
2010-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	get the alternate version
2010-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ehsan	then follow this page (about halfway down the page) http://hubpages.com/hub/Ubuntu-Offline-Upgrade
