2006-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	Eleaf		hi
2006-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	Eleaf		lol
2006-01-06T15:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	from what I have heard, yes
2006-01-06T15:25:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	ok, I guess that's what I'm getting... lol  Will it be super great?
2006-01-06T15:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	no idea, get a 2nd opinion
2006-03-24T12:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	AllowUsers option in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2006-03-24T12:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	patience :-)
2006-03-24T12:29:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	well I have to leave like right now
2006-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	1 more thing...
2006-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	there are other options too, so try man 'sshd_config' for those
2006-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	that isn't in there
2006-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	there is no "AllowUsers"
2006-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	do 'man sshd_config' and use the appropriate options you need/want
2006-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	;/  not finding anything
2006-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	e.g. 'AllowUsers' ; or 'AllowGroups' ; or 'DenyUsers' ; or 'DenyGroups'; etc.
2006-03-24T12:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	man sshd_config works, yes?
2006-04-04T07:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	sounds like a bad idea
2006-04-04T07:05:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	do you wanna hear my situation and reccomend an option?
2006-04-04T07:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	just ask the channel; what do I know ?  :-)
2006-04-04T07:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	all I can suggest is that there might be a #php channel
2006-04-04T07:09:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	they banned me because I hit 'enter' to much.  (I hit enter less than I am right now...)
2006-04-04T07:09:00.000Z	Xenguy	Eleaf	heh (/msg ubotu enter)
2006-04-04T07:09:00.000Z	Eleaf	Xenguy	yes I know
