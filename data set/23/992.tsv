2010-10-20T07:19:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	Additional Drivers
2010-10-20T07:20:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	Not there, but "hardware drivers" is there
2010-10-20T07:20:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	okay, on that version (10.04) or other, it would be that, yes
2010-10-20T07:21:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	Downloading package indexes failed... Please check your Internet connection
2010-10-20T07:22:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	What do you think?
2010-10-20T07:22:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	can you plug that one online
2010-10-20T07:22:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	Plug what one?
2010-10-20T07:23:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	Can you plug that in to the internet initially to install the proprietary driver?
2010-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	My problem is that im NOT connected to the internet in the first place, so how can I download drivers?
2010-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	you'd need to grab the drivers, depending on what card you have, do you know what wireless card you have?
2010-10-20T07:26:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88w8335 [Libertas] 802.11b/g Wireless (rev 03) ... And how do i "grab" the drivers when the internet ISNT WORKING in the first place
2010-10-20T07:27:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	?
2010-10-20T07:29:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	I'm not familiar with that particular card, but https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs does have a ton of information on that
2010-10-20T07:30:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	On Windows, you'd have the same issue if it didn't include your proprietary driver ;)
2010-10-20T07:30:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	I found a solution on the site but it didn't work
2010-10-20T07:31:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	I completed all steps without error and revolted and everything was the same: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/mrv8k
2010-10-20T07:32:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	I am not sure, perhaps check the forums or someone else is familiar
2010-10-20T07:33:00.000Z	earthshade	h00k	Ok... *reboots into xp*
2010-10-20T08:08:00.000Z	h00k	earthshade	I'm not sure, someone else might know :)
