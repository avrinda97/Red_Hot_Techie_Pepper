2007-07-30T15:27:00.000Z	jqg		How to defend DDOS attack? Help me!!!
2007-07-30T15:27:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	install firestarter and put it to block ping for a moment
2007-07-30T15:31:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	it is same like shorewall? How to define the rule against DDOS???
2007-07-30T15:31:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	it's an GUI for iptables
2007-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	you can block pings and stuff from settings, you don't have to make a rule for it
2007-07-30T15:33:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	my server is ubuntu server no gui support and shorewall installed but I could't use it.
2007-07-30T15:33:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	and I can ping my server well
2007-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	then you have to look for iptables manual
2007-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	but my apache server connection are exhausts by attack
2007-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	but if you are running and server, you shouldn't block ping. (or is it in private use?)
2007-07-30T15:35:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	,a ruuning server shouldn't block ping?
2007-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	,ok ,thanks a lot
2007-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	so you are getting DoS from one IP only?
2007-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/iptables-HOWTO-6.html
2007-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	jqg	Happu	,random IP connections
2007-07-30T15:38:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	you should mark up to some file what commands did you run for IPtables so you can undo them later
2007-07-30T15:39:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	no problem
2007-07-30T15:43:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	yes
2007-07-30T15:44:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	thats why you shouldn't block ping. You just don't have a much options if you are gettind Dossed do you?
2007-07-30T15:44:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	I'm not very good with those things, so I can't really tell how it works :/
2007-07-30T16:04:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	hmm... So you didin't try with command "sudo iptables..."? There must be some file to override the original file
2007-07-30T16:06:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	if running the command trough the terminal doesn't help you, you're on your own :/ I don't know what file rewrites it
2007-07-30T16:06:00.000Z	Happu	jqg	maybe someone knows ;)
