2011-04-17T06:24:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	what exactly happens?
2011-04-17T06:26:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	well i installed ubuntu over win7 and somehow after long hours of trying i added windows 7 to grub.cfg
2011-04-17T06:28:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	i think problem is i don;t know where bootmgr is ?
2011-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	could have been that it was installed on some other partition not on my primary C: windows?
2011-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	the windows boot stuff is on C:\
2011-04-17T06:30:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	so why can't grub find it ? i added it manualy now bootmgr is missing???
2011-04-17T06:30:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	i have no clue what to do next
2011-04-17T06:30:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	have you ever had a working dual-boot with your grub.cfg
2011-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	well not on this pc..
2011-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	can i do something about bootmgr, like install it again witouth reinstalling whole windows 7?
2011-04-17T06:33:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	pastebin you grub.cfg, ill double check for syntax and errors
2011-04-17T06:33:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	im sure window has a rescue system but have no idea how or where to look.
2011-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	http://pastebin.com/DWhNPCWq thanks
2011-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	i cant do rescue with startup disc, like bootrec.exe /fixboot
2011-04-17T06:35:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	btw my windows is in dev/sda3
2011-04-17T06:37:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	try cahanging it to (hd0,3) then
2011-04-17T06:37:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	tried that, but it says wrong signature..
2011-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	what happens when you try the vista option in grub?
2011-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	mladen123	pfifo	its windows recovery mode, with lenovo.. so nothing
2011-04-17T06:39:00.000Z	pfifo	mladen123	i think its simply just a misconfiguration, grub is not looking in the right place for bootmgr
