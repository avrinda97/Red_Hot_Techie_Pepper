2005-08-04T16:04:00.000Z	Nevado		in what way is it 'stripped down'/
2005-08-04T16:06:00.000Z	Nevado		just select 'always open in browser windows'
2005-08-04T16:07:00.000Z	Nevado		having a quick flick through the file system and having 15 windows open as a result is just ridiculous
2005-08-04T16:08:00.000Z	Nevado		it's not a problem though, just need to change 1 option
2005-08-04T16:09:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	clearly your workflow is different from mine or from every single user i have ever had to tech support
2005-08-04T16:09:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	so as an advanced user, exactly you change it
2005-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	i don't know anyone who prefers spatial but really just use whatever works best for you
2005-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	every single user in our company uses their windows file system as a spatial browser
2005-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	odd, as windows default is not spatial
2005-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	it is odd indeed, i never see people browse hieararchically
2005-08-04T16:15:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	you're telling me they didn't know how  to use the back or up buttons/
2005-08-04T16:16:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	indeed i am
2005-08-04T16:16:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	well that was totally unnecessary
2005-08-04T16:20:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	you're not really making sense - windows defaults to hierarchical, and you're saying that users who don't even know how to use a back or up button are 'emulating spatial' by themselves despite an obvious total lack of knowledge about computers? right...
2005-08-04T16:20:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	it doesn't actually
2005-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	what on earth are you talking about, so now you're saying they use hierarchical but "don't capish" that it's hierarchical?
2005-08-04T16:27:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	i'm fairly sure he's not talking about your idealogical interpretations of hierarchical vs spatial but rather the actual implementation that's in gnome... you seem to be (confusingly) wavering between the two
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	I thought you just said that both were spatial
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	well my second point was going to include that statement
2005-08-04T16:32:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	you're really not making sense, i'm fairly sure you're trying to come off as really clever but don't have a clue what you're talking about
2005-08-04T16:33:00.000Z	holycow	Nevado	just shutup already, if the best you can do is simply throw out accusatory statements, there are other channels for that
2005-08-04T16:33:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	lol, just find it funny that you keep defending spatial, then you say that windows default is spatial, then you say that gnome browser is spatial
2005-08-04T16:35:00.000Z	Nevado	holycow	the filesystem is hierarchical, you can't really avoid it however you choose to represent it
