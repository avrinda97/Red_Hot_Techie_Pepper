2010-09-07T01:55:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	is there a password on the Windows share?  I seem to recall that nautilus has issues with passworded shares and another possibility may be the netBIOS port is firewalled somewhere between your two connections.
2010-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	no, because if i type in the location line: smb://<ipaddress> it will connect and I can modify/change files
2010-09-07T01:57:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	have you verified netBIOS is not firewalled then?  That is what windows shares use for names.
2010-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	may I PM you?
2010-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	here's netbios ports -> http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2001-January/023490.html
2010-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	I'd prefer to keep it in the channel so others can double-check what I say.  Sorry.
2010-09-07T01:59:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	you check to make sure that those ports are not firewalled or blocked on all devices your connection passes through from (linux)computer to (windows)computer.
2010-09-07T02:01:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	how do i check this
2010-09-07T02:04:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	first of all take stock of what devices the connection is passing through then in Windows go to it's firewall and specifically allow those ports, say a router is next, depending on the router it's likely different for each one, check those ports, and then in Ubuntu do "sudo apt-get install gufw" then in that (System > Administration > Firewall Configuration) again allow the ports.
2010-09-07T02:09:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	i opened up the firewall config and put allow for ubuntu on both sections.  im basically pretty confused and have no idea what I am installing.  fyi.
2010-09-07T02:10:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	ufw is Ubuntu's default firewall.  gufw is a graphical interface to configure it.  That saves you from having to do it all on the command line.
2010-09-07T02:10:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	well i went to the gui for the firewall and selected "allow" for both incoming and outgoing... is that what you wanted me to do?
2010-09-07T02:11:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	ufw may be disabled so you're Ubuntu machine may not need the ports specifically allowed but gufw will let you easily see this.  I think it's much more likely the ports are blocked either on the Windows machine or in your router between machines.
2010-09-07T02:11:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	yes, allow all the ports that were listed in the link -> http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2001-January/023490.html on both computers and all devices between them.
2010-09-07T02:13:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	but I have like 4 computers im trying to gain access to this one computer... I have to go to every computer and access the ports?
2010-09-07T02:14:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	get one route working first.  From the Ubuntu machine to the Windows server.  It may be that the port is blocked on a router and once you find it the other machines won't need anything else done.
2010-09-07T02:15:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	would i want to "port forward" then?
2010-09-07T02:16:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	I don't believe you want to forward the port as that may lock it into a single machine.  Give me a second with google.
2010-09-07T02:16:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	appears that port forward and port trigger are the two options I havE
2010-09-07T02:21:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	I need to run... work calls.
2010-09-07T02:23:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	see here for a possible solution -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=88206
2010-09-07T02:23:00.000Z	bnixy7	headkase314	thank you for your help.
2010-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	headkase314	bnixy7	you're welcome, good luck if you have to run - try back again when you're back.
