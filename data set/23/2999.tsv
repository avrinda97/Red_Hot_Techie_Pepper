2008-12-23T11:39:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	 i use it
2008-12-23T11:40:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	im looking to setup a windows/ubuntu synergy but im failing quite bad :P  any ideas?
2008-12-23T11:40:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	sorry don't care about windows can't help there
2008-12-23T11:41:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	ok.. how about linux/linux setup? i can adapt for windows as it has a good gui unlike linux
2008-12-23T11:42:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	there is quicksynergy a gui for synergy in the repos if you need a gui. put that on the server. run synergyc HOST on the client.
2008-12-23T11:43:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	so after i have the server setup, i just run synergyc (client side) and voila?
2008-12-23T11:44:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	in the quicksynergy - if you are using the gui - put the client name in the appropriate location. If you don't use the gui, you need to edit the config files yourself. They are pretty straight forward. then yes, it's just a voila. keyboard/mouse/clipboard will be "shared"
2008-12-23T11:45:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	also, how do i get it to start automatically from adding synergy as a session? synergyc right?
2008-12-23T11:45:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	sure, just launch the appropriate commands at startup. "synergyc HOST" will be from the client.
2008-12-23T11:46:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	great thx, il give it a go now!  :)
2008-12-23T11:47:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	good luck!
2008-12-23T11:47:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	ty :P
2008-12-23T12:03:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	im back.. :(
2008-12-23T12:05:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	sure if i can
2008-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	ok... im currently just putting "synergyc" into the terminal
2008-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	im getting a "server name required" back
2008-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	no no ... you have to put "synergyc HOST" where HOST is like 192.168.1.100 or your computer name, or some other thing so the client knows where to look
2008-12-23T12:07:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	.ah ha!!!
2008-12-23T12:07:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	hehe thx.. :)
2008-12-23T12:07:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	for example, my server name is "apollo" .. I can "ping apollo", so I use "synergyc apollo"
2008-12-23T12:08:00.000Z	b3z3rk3r	ushimitsudoki	that seems to be accepted now. thankyou!
2008-12-23T12:09:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	b3z3rk3r	Hooray! quite welcome
