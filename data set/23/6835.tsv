2006-06-03T14:07:00.000Z	nutterpc		but also if there is stuff there which you are never going to need sladen, then why have it there..........that's my opinion
2006-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	nutterpc		and I don't have a need for printing atm
2006-06-03T14:10:00.000Z	nutterpc		and surprisingly, dapper can be made to stretch a fair way dude
2006-06-03T14:11:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	so dapper's looking good? can I recommend it to a cluebie? ;)
2006-06-03T14:11:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	well put it this way man......speed wise for me at least, on 512Mb RAM, its easily compareable to XP if not better
2006-06-03T14:13:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	I was thinking more of how is it is to get up to speed with for someone without much clue
2006-06-03T14:13:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	well you need a little bit of clue, and a little help too :)
2006-06-03T14:14:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	yeah, well I'll have to do support, so I was hoping there'd be little need for it
2006-06-03T14:14:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	_without_ ?
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	yes.......it seems like a lot if I told you all of it involved, but when you sit back and think about it, its not a lot
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	I'm thinking of installing it for a neighbour who is ripe for defenestration ;) I use debian myself
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	they would do fine
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	cool, thanks for your input
2006-06-03T14:16:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	if you want me to give you an idea about what can be done to dapper to give it a boot in the bum, pm me
2006-06-03T14:16:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	openbox? ;)
2006-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	lol
2006-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	its a bit more than that dude ;)
2006-06-03T14:42:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	of 512Mb RAM total, 346Mb free after Ubuntu loaded and desktop ready to go, plus its settled and unloaded everything that's not needed :)
2006-06-03T14:44:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	not too bad, for gnome, I guess
2006-06-03T14:44:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	and that's with everything I use still loading
2006-06-03T14:45:00.000Z	amphi	nutterpc	unused stuff should get paged out fairly quickly in case
2006-06-03T14:45:00.000Z	nutterpc	amphi	that's where sysctl is your friend ;)
