2005-05-13T15:57:00.000Z	ignis		does ubuntu keep the menus nice and separate if you have both desktops installed?
2005-05-13T15:58:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	no, you will have all them K's all over your gnome menus
2005-05-13T16:13:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	was that with xinerama or nvidia's twinview?
2005-05-13T16:14:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	I have ATI so it was some fglrxconfig nonsense.
2005-05-13T16:15:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	strangeness.. when i started it up it was very badly broken but upon switching back to the dual mode with randr is works fine..
2005-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	cool so i guess your maximization problems were gnome based?
2005-05-13T16:18:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	yes, seems to be the case
2005-05-13T16:19:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	though, X is still taking up a little bit too much space at the top and left of the screen. any idea how to adjust this? xvidtune seems to have no effect on a flatscreen..
2005-05-13T16:21:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	my lcd has an auto image adjust that fixes problems like that from its end...?
2005-05-13T16:27:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	sweet!
2005-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	did you say you managed to get different wallpapers for each monitor under kde? (rather than different wallpapers for each workspace)
2005-05-13T16:31:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	yes but it is prolly different than twinview... I have it set up so there is 2 drivers 1 for each screen, so both monitors have applications panels and stuff
2005-05-13T16:34:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	yup, i'm just looking at the nvidia readme now and i may be able to do something similar - two seperate screens rather than twinview.. has the disadvantage of not being able to drag windows between screens though
2005-05-13T16:37:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	true that I cannot drag accross monitors, also when loading some programs like firefox 1 on each screen it chokes about profile mismatching and stuff. need to create a second profile for the second screen etc. but it feels nicer to me than twinview
2005-05-13T16:43:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	yeah, i'm going to give it a try and which i prefer. i'm sure it would solve my gnome problems as well.. heh heh though kde 3.4 is looking better than last time i tried it
2005-05-13T16:45:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	now what i'd *really* like is to be able to specify different font sizes for each screen :) is that possible?
2005-05-13T16:45:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	haha im glad you like 3.4, i wasnt impressed and went immediatly back to gnome then got all mad at all them K's all over the place and had to rebuild my system to get rid of them lol
2005-05-13T16:46:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	maybe im not sure, i have both my screens running at different resolutions already, let me see
2005-05-13T16:48:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	yeah different resoultions should be fine.. the point is that one of my resoutions is 1280x1024 and the other is 1900x1200 so fonts look VERY different!
2005-05-13T16:49:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	doesn't removing kubuntu-desktop get rid of all the associated crap? i'm sure theres something (perhaps kdelibs4) that will certainly take the rest of kde with it if you remove it
2005-05-13T16:50:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	It doesnt look like you can set font for each screen in gnome, but like i said i could set different backgrounds in kde so maybe you can do fonts there too screen based youll have to try it
2005-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	ignis	jbm__	ok, cool, i'm going restart x and give this a whirl. thanks for your help
2005-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	jbm__	ignis	good luck!
