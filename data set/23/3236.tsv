2011-02-25T20:56:00.000Z	lolcatz		the kernels of linux on modern distros will handle anythinogn you would use today realistically, so it is your mobo bus which will determine that
2011-02-25T20:57:00.000Z	lolcatz		chezni
2011-02-25T20:57:00.000Z	lolcatz		oh
2011-02-25T20:57:00.000Z	lolcatz		sorry tits a netbook
2011-02-25T20:58:00.000Z	lolcatz		hmm you will have to ask others.. I helped a friend install ubuntu netbook edition on an atom and it was slower than xp and i felt stupid as she wanted it to go faster for her trip to asia
2011-02-25T20:58:00.000Z	lolcatz		so I am a bit wary on the netbook editions
2011-02-25T20:58:00.000Z	lolcatz		lol drexl, I meant its*
2011-02-25T20:58:00.000Z	lolcatz		or tis*
2011-02-25T20:58:00.000Z	lolcatz		;)
2011-02-25T20:59:00.000Z	lolcatz		chezni.. no, I can't vouch for how well various distros generally run on the netbooks.. but if the size doesnt matter, I would recommend for performance that option yes... but not if the size is paramount for ya :)
2011-02-25T21:00:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Sorry for the OT post, but there is a saying in Danish that translates to "the mouth spills over with what the heart is full of" ;-)
2011-02-25T21:00:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Regarding you "tits"-typo
2011-02-25T21:01:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Just wanted to share it. I'll be quiet now and go to the friday bar instead :-)
2011-02-25T21:08:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	I'll have to be off for the Friday bar right about now, though, but we might run into each other another time :-)
2011-02-25T21:03:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	:-D
2011-02-25T21:05:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	My latest compile was of 1.6.38-rc6 and the dir weighs in at 1,5G so YMMW...
2011-02-25T21:06:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Originally from a outside a small village near the German border, but I've been in Ã…rhus for close to 13 years now. For the sake of others, I keep this in English, but where are you situated?
2011-02-25T21:07:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Ah, ok. That explains your knowledge of the language then :-)
2011-02-25T21:09:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	And ok, I meant, of course 2.6.38-rc6 :-$
2011-02-25T21:10:00.000Z	lolcatz	Fjodor	 but 38 isn't int he maverick line
2011-02-25T21:11:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	just get in from kernel.org and use make-kpkg to build. Works like a charm for me :-)
2011-02-25T21:16:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Just want to finish this, then. Discussion of the kernel is obviously OT, but how to compile it the debian/ubuntu way shouldn't be, so here's what I do: download the source from kernel.org, unpack, copy over the previous .config 'make oldconfig' and then 'make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot --append-to-version -sune-1 --initrd kernel_headers kernel_image'. You *may* want to adjust the argument to the --append-to-version flag, though ;-)
2011-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	Fjodor	lolcatz	Sorry - got caught up
