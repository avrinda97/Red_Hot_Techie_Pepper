2005-11-03T17:00:00.000Z	joh		Guys and Gals, I'm having some trouble getting GL to work on ATI (fglrx). The fgrlx module loads, but `fglrxinfo` shows Mesa as the OpenGL vendor. Also, `glxinfo' shows "direct rendering: No". Any ideas on what could be wrong? Obviously, it's loading mesa's GL libraries instead of ATI's, but as far as I can see, /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 points to the correct library.
