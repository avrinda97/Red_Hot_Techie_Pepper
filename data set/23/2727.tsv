2008-11-30T10:12:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	lspci and then do lspci -n
2008-11-30T10:15:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	what chip is it again?
2008-11-30T10:16:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	Airgo, I already did ndiswrapper -d devid driver and it worked, now what do I do|?
2008-11-30T10:16:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	I think the next step is something to do with modprobe
2008-11-30T10:17:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	I was looking for the guide
2008-11-30T10:18:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	Any luck|?
2008-11-30T10:19:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	try "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
2008-11-30T10:20:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	Module not found
2008-11-30T10:20:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	try "sudo depmod -a"
2008-11-30T10:21:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	if you've already done most of this you can scroll down to 3.4 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#Load%20the%20new%20driver%20module
2008-11-30T10:23:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	Module ndiswrapper not found .. :<
2008-11-30T10:23:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	somewhere you missed a step, try following that guide I sent
2008-11-30T10:26:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	Didn't miss anything, still erroring.
2008-11-30T10:28:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	I don't know, you could try uninstalling everything you've tried so far and restart using the guide step by step
2008-11-30T10:28:00.000Z	iShock	endoubt	F that, I need todo this fast
2008-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	well, forget fast in linux, if you want fast go into windows
2008-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	everything in linux is a slow learning experience
2008-11-30T10:30:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	what's the model on your wireless card?
2008-11-30T10:31:00.000Z	endoubt	iShock	is that an external PCMCIA card?
