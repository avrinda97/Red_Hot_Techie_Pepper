2012-05-17T08:21:00.000Z	bluesnow		I changed my IP address so I can ping my router now, but I still can't connect to sites for some reason
2012-05-17T08:22:00.000Z	bluesnow		How can I get the value that the "gateway" should be set to for manual IPv4?
2012-05-17T08:22:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	What is your /etc/resolv.conf have in it for dns?
2012-05-17T08:23:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	"route"
2012-05-17T08:27:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	also see "route -n"
2012-05-17T08:28:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	route just gives me the gateway I assigned manually
2012-05-17T08:28:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	but I can't connect to any sites. I can only ping myself and my router
2012-05-17T08:30:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	can you post what your /etc/resolv.conf file has in it for DNS servers?
2012-05-17T08:32:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	do a "cat /etc/resolv.conf" and let me know what's in it.
2012-05-17T08:32:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	/etc/resolve.conf has nameserver 4.2.2.5
2012-05-17T08:33:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	change that to your router ip which should handle dns for you.
2012-05-17T08:35:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	I changed the DNS server to my router's ip and it's still not working
2012-05-17T08:36:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	can you pastebin your ifconfig and "cat /etc/resolv.conf" output. I assume your chatting through the same internet connection that your attempting to run this on?
2012-05-17T08:36:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	Can't pastebin, I'm on a separate computer
2012-05-17T08:38:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	I guess you can't type it?
2012-05-17T08:39:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	What's in your routing table?
2012-05-17T08:39:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	I can type it. it will take a bit. is there any specific part of the output I should type?
2012-05-17T08:39:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	no what you gave is fine that's what I wanted to see.
2012-05-17T08:41:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	Just curious what is the ip address, subnet, and gateway of the computer your chatting with currently?
2012-05-17T08:44:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	bingo
2012-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	aot2002	bluesnow	Did you try "dhclient" from the command line?
2012-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	I'll try that.
2012-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	bluesnow	aot2002	dhclient doesn't fix it either
