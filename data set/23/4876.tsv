2008-04-19T19:54:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	what is the AP?
2008-04-19T19:56:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	have you verified the gateway is set in Linux to 192.168.0.1 ?
2008-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	and amendo how do i do this using roaning?
2008-04-19T20:04:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	the laptop should be getting no information from the access point, and it's IP is transparent to the situation
2008-04-19T20:04:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	only DHCP server should be on the router
2008-04-19T20:05:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	this is correct
2008-04-19T20:06:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	windows is getting it's IP and gateway info from the dhcp on the router, for some reason linux is not
2008-04-19T20:07:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	sorry if I'm stating the obvious here ;)
2008-04-19T20:09:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	I honestly haven't used static in a long while... I set my router to give the same IP to paritcular MACs via DHCP
2008-04-19T20:10:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	the AP has one port though doesn't it?
2008-04-19T20:11:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	yes
2008-04-19T20:12:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	did it work in linux via wireless when using dhcp, if you tried that first?
2008-04-19T20:14:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	i did try that first but didnt work, using static now i can access goole by directly putting in the 72.104.***.***
2008-04-19T20:14:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	because you'll have to set dns manually too
2008-04-19T20:14:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	ot would appear i will have to manually put the dns server detasils in
2008-04-19T20:14:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	though depending on router you can just point dns at 192.168.0.1
2008-04-19T20:15:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	so its working using static with the dns manually put in but i cant see why it wont work using dhcp????
2008-04-19T20:16:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	good question
2008-04-19T20:17:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	plugging laptop ethernet into router works with dhcp?
2008-04-19T20:18:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	router or switch
2008-04-19T20:18:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	i suspect ir should but i dont have a patch cable handy at the moment,
2008-04-19T20:22:00.000Z	koshari	astro76	i are beginning to suspect its the ethernet poer attempting to resolve the dns/ip address instead of the wifi
2008-04-19T20:23:00.000Z	astro76	koshari	perhaps... it's definitely something with the laptop's configuration
