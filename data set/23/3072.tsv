2009-04-25T15:26:00.000Z	dman777		what is the difference between tar -cjvp filename.bz2 file and bzip2 file?
2009-04-25T15:27:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	verbosity? :-p
2009-04-25T15:27:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	no, because i was doing it for a man page and the man utility will not work with the tar -cvjf
2009-04-25T15:29:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	strange... very strange, you probably won't get much help in here though, for more command line oriented things I generally go to #bash (alot of jerks will say it's not a bash question, which it really isn't, but the right people to answer are in there) or ##linux
2009-04-25T15:30:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	haha. ya. thanx
2009-04-25T15:30:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	but lately i can't get anwsers to my command line questions on any channel. so i got desperate and came here
2009-04-25T15:31:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	must be *really* desperate lol, erm, have you checked to see if the first 4 bytes (file header) of the two files is the same? it's possible bzip2 uses a different header I suppose.  also aren't man pages generally gzipped anyways?\
2009-04-25T15:34:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	i think the gunzip is old school for man pages. i did the 'file command' and they both said bzip2 files
2009-04-25T15:37:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	hrm, is it possible that bzip2 is creating an archive instead of just a bzipped single file? (like a tar.gz vs just a .gz) ?
2009-04-25T15:39:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	from what i thought they were both containers and compressed. the only thing i can think of is bzip2 file isn't in a 'container'... even though in reality it is.
2009-04-25T15:41:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	have you tried tar -tf <whatever> on both?
2009-04-25T15:42:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	no, good idea.
2009-04-25T15:45:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	i guess there is a diff. when using or not using tar. although the file utility does not see it
2009-04-25T15:45:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	did you figure out what it was?
2009-04-25T15:46:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	naw, it has something to do with diff. formats. i'll have to post on the forums to get a more deeper insight on how the 2 versus each other
2009-04-25T15:47:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	aw, well good luck dude, at least you have a working method though right? using tar?
2009-04-25T15:47:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	ya, for man page it must be done without the tar command(bzip2)
2009-04-25T15:48:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	OH  tar *doesn't* work and bzip2 does?
2009-04-25T15:48:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	yes, although the man utility rejects a file that is bzip2 with tar
2009-04-25T15:50:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	ah, definitely related to container vs not in my opinion (since the tar command implicitly creates a tar container)  the reason why file can't tell the difference is because it would have to decompress each bzip file to see that one contains a tar inside it.  (or at least that's my take)
2009-04-25T15:52:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	ya, i was under the impression 'container' was just a generic term for files contained together....which would be the same for any compression like bzip2 without tar
2009-04-25T15:54:00.000Z	dman777	Ademan	i'm outter here. take care.
2009-04-25T15:54:00.000Z	Ademan	dman777	later, good luck
