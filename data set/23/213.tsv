2012-04-04T17:57:00.000Z	angs		I installed a webserver on ubuntu and I copied index files etc to /etc/www. so I can access the webpage by typing the IP address of the server in my browser (http://192.168.x.x), and my computer and server are in the same network. How can I access to the webserver in another network, http://real.ip:port?
