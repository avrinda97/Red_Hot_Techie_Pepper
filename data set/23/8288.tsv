2009-04-26T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I find it odd that a 'upgrade' would affect any files in the users home dir...
2009-04-26T01:43:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	not during the apt-get upgrade, but the first time the new package is run by the user.
2009-04-26T01:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 you mean the first time amarok runs it deletesw the database?
2009-04-26T01:44:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	jaunty includes amarok2, which seems pretty incompatible with previous amarok in terms of setup and interface.  many users were distressingly surprised.
2009-04-26T01:45:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	also amarok2 has ugly buttons.
2009-04-26T01:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 i rarely use it :)
2009-05-13T07:14:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	a separate display would mean you can't move the mouse or windows from one to another.
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 which is what hes describing as being able to do.. so somone is confused here.
2009-05-13T07:25:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	it's an entirely different thing.  For example if you wanted to run gnome and kde at the same time.  If you wanted two people (with 2 mice and 2 keyboards and 2 monitors) sitting at one PC.
2009-05-13T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 some how i got the gnome desktop across both.
2009-05-13T07:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 they are 2 copies of gnome i guess is what i am looking at.
2009-05-13T07:26:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	Yeah, that would be a common result.   But there are many other things that could be done.
2009-05-13T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 but its working exactly as he described.. :) i think he was actually using twinview by mistake... and dident realize it
2009-05-13T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 but what do we know... We are just morons i guess. heh
2009-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	I had a large cube Wang computer with 10+ serial ports for the terminals... I lost it somewhere.   I don't know how I lost it, because its huge.
2009-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 its under the couch.
2009-05-13T07:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 so as far as i can tell.. without a lot of tweaking the seperate displays is a tad useless..  :)
2009-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	doleyb	Dr_Willis	Yeah fairly, although if you run DISPLAY=:1 mplayer -fs dvd://1
2009-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 allready figured that out. :)
2009-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 i did notice the gnome panels on the 2nd display launch stuff.. that then appears on the wrong display heh
2009-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 and with the gnome desktop i can drag icons to the 2nd display.. they then launch onthe first display also.. heh
2009-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 exactly like we was telling that guy.. but i guess he knows best.
2009-05-13T07:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	doleyb	 yea with out using a custome .xinitrc or somthing.. this is a bit annoying. :) time to reset it back to twinview.
