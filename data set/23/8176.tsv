2004-12-13T17:02:00.000Z	CatDog	dhanish	you mean instead of having to worry about whether you've got the latest version of winxp/ie, just so it won't automatically download the lastest worm that's in vogue?
2004-12-13T17:02:00.000Z	CatDog		:)
2004-12-13T17:04:00.000Z	dhanish	CatDog	nah...nothing like that...i have issue with xp but i then i have issues with linux as well....
2004-12-13T17:10:00.000Z	CatDog	dhanish	you show me someone that doesn't, and i'll show you either a liar or a genius (or linus...)
2004-12-13T17:13:00.000Z	dhanish	CatDog	heh...i suppose....nothing is perfect
2004-12-13T17:14:00.000Z	dhanish		hrm...is there some tool that will help me convert my ubuntu ext3 partition to resier4fs?
2004-12-13T17:16:00.000Z	dhanish		so basically create a new reiserfs parition...copy the contents of ext3 to that and then update grub?
2004-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	dhanish		shucks...i was hoping it would easy as something like partition magic
2004-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	dhanish		since i dont have space to create a new partition
2004-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	dhanish		performance wise which is better ext3 or reiser4fs?
2004-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	dhanish		i dont know i remeber reading something about data journaling and speed....
2004-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	dhanish		i dont even know
2004-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	dhanish		well for now i'll stick with ext3 then
2004-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	CatDog		As long as they both keep the files safe, who cares? :-p
2004-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	dhanish		i used resier with other distros had no issues
2004-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	dhanish		but then i never used them extensively enough to experience data loss
2004-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	dhanish		fat partitions dont support file permissions right both for xp and linux?
2004-12-13T17:21:00.000Z	dhanish		k...i wonder then if there is anyway to share firefox/thunderbird profiles betweek xp and ubuntu....without having to resort to moving profiles onto a fat32 partition
2004-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	dhanish		hrm...maybe usb drive...nah that'll be slow
2004-12-13T17:24:00.000Z	dhanish		i wonder if there is some kind of driver that will read linux partiotions in xp?
2004-12-13T17:24:00.000Z	dhanish		true
2004-12-13T17:27:00.000Z	CatDog	dhanish	there are apps that will read ext partitions, and
2004-12-13T17:28:00.000Z	CatDog	dhanish	damn. I meant to say: ext2fs
