2006-10-02T11:55:00.000Z	gansinho		please could someone help me, I'm helping a friend to install ubuntu dapper in his pc however during the install in the "select keyboard layout" screen it doesn't show any model to select, so we can't select to forwad the instalation...
2006-10-02T11:56:00.000Z	gansinho		In step 3 out of 6
2006-10-02T11:57:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	did you check to make sure the disc is good? I had alot of trouble with ubuntu install discs for some reason my burner didn't likem (which is wierd cause it fine on everything else)
2006-10-02T11:59:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	thanks I'll check!
2006-10-02T12:00:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	yeah its really wierd that it happened too cause my cd burner hasn't botched more then 1 disc in about 3000 burns too till the ubuntu isos
2006-10-02T12:01:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	maybe my powersupplys dying or memory or something hrm I should check that
2006-10-02T12:01:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	wile using the live cd it doesn' use anything from the hd?
2006-10-02T12:02:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	shouldn't have too unless you mount something
2006-10-02T12:03:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	so if he had made a missinstall of ubuntu before, it won't affect anything in a new instalation?
2006-10-02T12:03:00.000Z	gansinho		missinstall
2006-10-02T12:04:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	does he have another os on the machine and did he rewrite the partitions changes on the new install?
2006-10-02T12:05:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	he formated the partition that he installed ubuntu, it used to be a ntfs partition
2006-10-02T12:06:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	you may wanna setup your partitions again and write them to disk just in case (although the missing keyboard stuffs probably have nothing to do with that)
2006-10-02T12:07:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	but he's using the liveCD to install... if he installs via terminal it would output any possible errors? if so, what's the command to start the installation?
2006-10-02T12:13:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	sorry bout that the wife =P uhm installer from live cd I don't recall really I've installed it 3 times in the last week or 2 and I don't remember if I started it from the commandline or the live cd (installed a few others too)
2006-10-02T12:14:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	they're all becoming a blur (gentoo, debian, arch, ubuntu installer cds although the gentoo one looked tasty I must admit)
2006-10-02T12:15:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	ok ^_^ , thanks for the info!
2006-10-02T12:15:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	np I have run into trouble with deb installs w/out rewriting my paritions when they've failed in the past so I suspect ubuntu may have similar issues (tho its just a guess)
2006-10-02T12:16:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	the ubuntu installs I've done came off w/out a hitch once I got a good cd burned
2006-10-02T12:16:00.000Z	iLLf8d	gansinho	good luck =)
2006-10-02T12:17:00.000Z	iLLf8d		terminator font
2006-10-02T12:17:00.000Z	iLLf8d		jk heh
2006-10-02T12:17:00.000Z	gansinho	iLLf8d	thanks, I think that the problem is the CD also
