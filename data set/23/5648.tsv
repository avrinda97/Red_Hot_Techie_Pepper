2006-10-18T06:16:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	search the wiki for a guide on ndiswrapper
2006-10-18T06:17:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	ive followed the guide thats how i got it working
2006-10-18T06:17:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	from memory start at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Driver/Wifi
2006-10-18T06:17:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	its after reboot it doesnt work now?
2006-10-18T06:17:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	is the module loaded on startup? try ndiswrapper -m when its working
2006-10-18T06:18:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	i never did the modprobe -m stuff and i rebooted
2006-10-18T06:18:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	now when i typed before sudo modprobe ndiswrapper - worked and it flashed - now typing it doesnt do anything
2006-10-18T06:18:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	same as now it doesnt list wlan0 like it did before the reboot
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	you needto make sure the ndiswrapper module is loaded on startup and i think the guide covers that
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	ok ill go have a look ...
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	wouldnt sudo modprobe ndiswrapper load it though?
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	can you ge it working by using sudo modprobe ndiswrapper?
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	it worked before i rebooted eah
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	that only loads it now - it wont be loaded next boot
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	after reboot .. that doesnt work
2006-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	but if you type "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" will it work now?
2006-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	nope
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	ok, redo the guide then dont reboot and type in "sudo ndiswrapper -m" to set it to load on startup
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	ok
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	AJR	I dont have that much experiance with it - i just tried it a few days back but in the end used edgy which supported the card
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	AJR	HumanPrototype	ok thanks for your help mate
