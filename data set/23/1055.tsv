2010-09-26T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 for 'ntfs' you can use the 'ntfs-config' command to allow users mounting  and full access to them.
2010-09-26T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 uid and gid are #'s not names..
2010-09-26T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 check the ntfs-3g homepage/Faq for all the examples of  options for the fstab entries for it also.
2010-09-26T15:58:00.000Z	Midler	Dr_Willis	so i changed it
2010-09-26T16:02:00.000Z	Midler	Dr_Willis	when iam on my testuser that should have readrights to the ntfs hd, i cant see anything
2010-09-26T16:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 the ntfs-config tool can set it up where all users have rights. i belive
2010-09-26T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 the ext2/3/4 filesystem saves the permissions and owndership - yes
2010-11-06T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 thers known bugs with synergy where the shift/ctrl/alt keys can get 'held down'
2010-11-06T22:34:00.000Z	Midler	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-11-06T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 its an old bug been around for ages..
2010-11-06T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 t5ry hitting ctrl a few times that may clear it out
2010-11-06T22:36:00.000Z	Midler	Dr_Willis	you know of any likewise application like synergy+, except more stable?
2010-11-06T22:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Midler	 not really seen anything that does the same thing.
