2008-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	dexter		izinucs; opera isnt in my repository
2008-10-22T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	maybe your issue with firefox can be fixed?
2008-10-22T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	I don't know, since I don't know what the issue is yet...
2008-10-22T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	have you got gnash installed as well?
2008-10-22T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	remove gnash. That should stop it crashing.
2008-10-22T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	restart firefox when you're done. Then it should be okay
2008-10-22T06:06:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	if not, come back and ask again
2008-10-22T06:07:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	swiftweasel will have had just the same conflict between flashplugin-nonfree and gnash
2008-10-22T06:07:00.000Z	dexter	soundray	izinucs; now i understand the problem.....
2008-10-22T06:09:00.000Z	dexter	soundray	izinucs; do u know any gud messengers...i used pidgin....but then it doesnt support voice chat...i login with yahoo and gtalk
2008-10-22T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	exit firefox, open a terminal and run   firefox -safe-mode
2008-10-22T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	then see if you can make it crash again
2008-10-22T06:13:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	no, it's just once for diagnostics
2008-10-22T06:14:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	can you provoke the crash?
2008-10-22T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	is firefox still crashing when you run it in safe mode?
2008-10-22T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	that proves that the problem is in one of your addons
2008-10-22T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	exit firefox and start it normally. Open about:plugins as the URL, select the entire page and paste it on http://paste.ubuntu.com
2008-10-22T06:32:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	I never said that
2008-10-22T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	it's about:plugins
2008-10-22T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	dexter	anyway, it's getting too late for me
