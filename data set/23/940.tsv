2010-11-21T04:38:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	I am reviewing the other XChat. What I find confusing is where you say 'paste in this text:http://pastebin.com/QiTN1T1M'. Do you mean to put the line starting with http in the file I am editing?
2010-11-21T04:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	you want those 3 lines in the file, I thought the amount of gap I left I imagined would make that clear....
2010-11-21T04:41:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	not clear, does the pastebin line go in the conf file?
2010-11-21T04:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	i'll repastebin dude, the bits in between the MASSIVE gaps are to go in the files.

2010-11-21T04:43:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	what massive gaps
2010-11-21T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	read the paste
2010-11-21T04:44:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	I will do so
2010-11-21T04:45:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	very clear - I am doing it, thanks, I will let you know!
2010-11-21T04:48:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	how do I restart X?
2010-11-21T04:49:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	thanks
2010-11-21T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	np man
2010-11-21T04:56:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	after reboot - I will try the you tube on Go
2010-11-21T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	put the battery back in, none of the options edit the power stuffs
2010-11-21T04:59:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	sorry, on the small screen synch is ok, but fullscreen is not - and very choppy. Is there something we could test?
2010-11-21T05:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	what video chip are you using?
2010-11-21T05:01:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	where do I find that?
2010-11-21T05:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	run: lspci | grep -i vga
2010-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	the command gives "01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G84M [Quadro FX 570M] (rev a1)"
2010-11-21T05:06:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	I must restart
2010-11-21T05:10:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	I am back, but found a driver not active, but restart again
2010-11-21T05:12:00.000Z	intrader_	ActionParsnip	appears that the 'Additional Drivers' have conflicting drivers . Two of them are fighting.
2010-11-21T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	intrader_	then remove both drivers and reboot, then install one
