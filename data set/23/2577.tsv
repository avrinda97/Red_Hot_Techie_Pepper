2009-02-14T09:26:00.000Z	chu_		hey is it possible to "embed" a terminal on the desktop?
2009-02-14T09:27:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	I believe so with xwinwrap
2009-02-15T15:07:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	#programming, #ubuntu-offtopic #your_language etc..
2010-01-09T13:55:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	gtk theme is for style of the widgets, metacity is for the window borders, and compiz is for the animations
2010-09-02T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	sounds like the files have been corrupted, is this only one document or all of them?
2010-09-02T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	sounds like the files have been corrupted when downloaded. Can you upload one for us to take a look at please?
2010-09-02T12:23:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	Sure, got an email I can send it to? (pm me if you don't want to divulge the information in here)
2010-09-02T12:24:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	no worries, nickhs@nospamubuntu.com
2010-09-02T12:28:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	without sending you this email, I just found out you are correct. It seems sometimes when I download a file it becomes corrupt, but other times it's fine? (Just download one of the previous documents and it works, but I have the same document where it doesn't work).
2010-09-02T12:28:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	it is likely to a problem with your internet connection, I'd recommend you try a download manager such as downthemall which could possibly help
2010-09-02T12:31:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	Yeah, it seems to be downloading the files in parts, just checked the same file in three different versions (all corrupt) and they've all got different gibberish in them.
2010-09-02T12:31:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	what site are you downloading them from? (if you don't mind sharing)
2010-09-02T12:31:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	my university's wattle site.
2010-09-02T12:32:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	http://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/ - but you'd need a login to access the files, so don't try, just wanted to show you the url.
2010-09-02T12:34:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	ah right, well then in that I'm not sure as to why the files are being corrupted on transfer. I'd still recommend using a download manager or even wget from the command line. Oh also ANU is an awesome uni :)
2010-09-02T12:35:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	Cheers, it is a very good place :) Will I still be able to use wget despite the fact that wattle needs a login? I'm not really experienced with command-line stuff sorry (this question could well be retarded :p)
2010-09-02T12:35:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	err not sure actually, but you should be able to use downthemall
2010-09-02T12:36:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	Ahh, I thought I had escaped the necessity of using Firefox! :p
2010-09-02T12:37:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	oh apologies! What browser are you using currently?
2010-09-02T12:37:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	chromium
2010-09-02T12:40:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	It appears the problem is with the chromium daily build though, the files download through Firefox without corruption fine.
2010-09-02T12:41:00.000Z	ziroday	chu_	ah, well then that may be your issue. I can't seem to find a download manager for chromium but you could try gwget
2010-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	chu_	ziroday	Thanks for the help, I just installed DownThemAll for future, just in case. Stale and Aemaeth thanks aswell.
