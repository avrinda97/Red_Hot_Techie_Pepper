2010-10-09T19:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	just creating ~/bin/ and putting your scripts binaries there is enough. ~/bin/ gets automatically added to PATH
2010-10-09T19:45:00.000Z	sten	erUSUL	yes, but i only want to add the path in the bash session
2010-10-09T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	ok
2010-10-09T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	if you set path in a bash session that mod only is valid for that shell and its childern ( if you used export )
2010-10-09T19:56:00.000Z	sten	erUSUL	yeah, but where is it stored?
2010-10-09T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	what device? you are not making any sense... what firmware?
2010-10-09T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	he path is set in /etc/profile ; /etc/environment and ~/.profile
2010-10-09T19:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	and env *does* print correct path
2010-10-09T20:01:00.000Z	sten	erUSUL	ok so iv checked the profile, environement and so forth and they only state the system paths, what i mean is, where is my new PATH stored, that i did SET in the bash session. if im making any sense?
2010-10-09T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	is in memory; i already replied --> 16:58 < erUSUL> sten: and env *does* print current path ( with a typo :) )
2010-10-09T20:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	also Kuehlschrank told you how to show it twice already
2010-10-09T20:05:00.000Z	sten	erUSUL	yes, but i dont think im making my self clear, ofc i can find out what the set path is by echoing it out in the bash. And i think maybe im making it harder for my self, as you explained its stored in memory. What I did wonder was really if i could find the newly set PATH var in some textfile or whatever. If not, thats ok
2010-10-09T20:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	sten	no it is not written to disk. that's why all those init/rc files exist to set up that vars when the shell stars
