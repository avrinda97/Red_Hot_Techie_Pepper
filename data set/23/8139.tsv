2005-01-29T11:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	zenrox	and debian != ubuntu (with all due respect :-)
2005-01-29T11:59:00.000Z	zenrox	Xenguy	 just that ubuntu is newer stuff
2005-01-29T12:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	zenrox	definitely - but if one runs 'sid/unstable' on debian (without breaking stuff - knock on wood), then one gets the latest/greatest also

2005-01-29T12:06:00.000Z	Xenguy	zenrox	a few years ago I got started with RedHat, and later switched to Debian... Ubuntu is the only thing that has made me turn my head to anything else (of course the fact it is based on Debian helps too :-)
