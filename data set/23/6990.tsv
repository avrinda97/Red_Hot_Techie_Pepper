2005-11-09T09:47:00.000Z	Nihil		hallo
2005-11-09T09:48:00.000Z	Nihil		i have a very big problem, not concerning Ubuntu. a damaged HD portatile box has EATEN an hardisk of mine... now it seems not formatted and both windows and linux cannot read it
2005-11-09T09:48:00.000Z	Nihil		can anyone help me?
2005-11-09T09:48:00.000Z	Nihil		a program to rescue hardisk?
2005-11-09T09:49:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	if you put a drive in an external enclosure and now it does not work. does that mean it was dropped?
2005-11-09T09:49:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	or that the enclosure contained a logic board and turned your disk into half of a raid or something.
2005-11-09T09:50:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	no. it means that before the HD worked. Now it's like a poltergeist possess it
2005-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	the HD seems to be not partitioned, even if it was FAT32
2005-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	well if you can attache the disk to an IDE channel, and find it with /dev/hdXY then the drive is probably OK. though might be unparted
2005-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	can we talk in private?
2005-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	just try hitting it with an fdisk or similar, some programs can guess at deleted parts.
2005-11-09T11:09:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	i'm here
2005-11-09T11:09:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	alright, well i guess do a    fsck -N /dev/hdb1
2005-11-09T11:10:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	it will say something like:
2005-11-09T11:11:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	ok, so it said error 2
2005-11-09T11:11:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	man fsck    to see what that means. :|
2005-11-09T11:17:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	a   sudo fsck /dev/hdb1      would probably fix your drive.
2005-11-09T11:17:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	you did it without the -N ?
2005-11-09T11:19:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	i didn't use the -N
2005-11-09T11:20:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	yeah, he thinks that the error 2 is trying to tell you to unmount the partition.
2005-11-09T11:20:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	and i suppose i didnt actually tell you to umount it before fsck. :P
2005-11-09T11:22:00.000Z	Nihil	bjv	what should i do now?
2005-11-09T12:02:00.000Z	bjv	Nihil	 cant fsck the drive im helping him fix
