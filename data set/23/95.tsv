2012-07-20T19:01:00.000Z	plain-person		I am looking for an Ubuntu-Sensei willing to spare me 10 minutes to help me understand what's going on with my Ubuntu. Anyone? *flaps eye-lashes quickly*
2012-07-20T19:02:00.000Z	plain-person		Sensei, anyone? I promise to work hard and understand. Hoi, hoi.
2012-07-20T19:03:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	mebbe try asking a question
2012-07-20T19:04:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	please keep your questions public so everyone can benefit
2012-07-20T19:10:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	I have been suggested to talk to you because my problem might be drivers-related. How is the normal procedure here, I just state my question or how?
2012-07-20T19:10:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	yes, please, just state your question
2012-07-20T19:12:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	Well, I upgraded to 12.04 and my sound, wifi and touchpad werent working properly. I managed to get the wifi to work by forcing the network manager to restart in the console, but it seems very primitive to do that every time I start the computer, plus I would like to understand whats goin on and how to clear the mess a bit.
2012-07-20T19:13:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	First thing to do is copy the contents of /var/log/dmesg to http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2012-07-20T19:14:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	Second thing is to paste the link you create here
2012-07-20T19:14:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	OK, I will do that. Thanks for the guidance!
2012-07-20T19:16:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1101965/
2012-07-20T19:18:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	I am reading the file, thanks
2012-07-20T19:20:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	Well, thanks a lot to you. I probably should say that I am currently logged in on a new user account I created. If I log in with the normal one, I have no sound, no wifi and the touchpad stops working after 20 seconds. So I created a new account and both sounds and touchpad seem to work (I have to restart nm to get wifi)
2012-07-20T19:22:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	Your touch pad appears to be recognized and working: [   34.600373] input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad as /devices/platform/i8042/serio2/input/input8
2012-07-20T19:22:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	What do you mean "the normal one"?
2012-07-20T19:23:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	Until today, I have only used an admin user account with my laptop. Seeing that things didn't work anymore in that profile, and reading people suggesting so in some forums, I created a second account (this one) to be able to connect to internet, understand whats going on, etc.
2012-07-20T19:25:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	What was the user name of the admin user?
2012-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	Not really sure. Either diaz or kymmenen
2012-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	You're not sure? Can you tell us what you get when you run "groups"?
2012-07-20T19:27:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	Also, might as well have a look at the output of "whoami"
2012-07-20T19:27:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	*embarrassed* Yes, not sure since I didnt have to login manually, it was all automatic and I am generally speaking a very confused person. I will run groups and whoami and paste it in the bin thingie.
2012-07-20T19:56:00.000Z	dcullen	plain-person	There's more to Pulse than just a GUI
2012-07-20T19:56:00.000Z	plain-person	dcullen	Considering I am quite green, do you think it would be a good idea to remove pulse as L3top suggests?
