2011-10-20T01:18:00.000Z	[twisti]		so nobody has any idea of how to even get a valid error message out of sshd ?
2011-10-20T01:20:00.000Z	[twisti]		can anyone even read me ?
2011-10-20T01:21:00.000Z	[twisti]		thanks, thats something at least
2011-10-20T01:22:00.000Z	[twisti]		im not saying ssh stopped working on every machine in the world when i put that line in :p
2011-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	[twisti]		then the only advice anyone can give you is: reboot, then write it down, then come back and tell us
2011-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	[twisti]		i dont, i just get the regular login
2011-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	[twisti]		hi, im trying to add a chroot'ed sftp thingy by following the advice of various websites to put something like this in /etc/ssh/sshd_config: "Match group sftpjail ChrootDirectory /home/specialjailhome ForceCommand internal-sftp", however, when i do that, ALL my ssh stuff breaks, even basic login, no error message in any of the logs other than the pointless: Oct 19 23:11:40 Ubuntu-1004-lucid-64-minimal
2011-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	[twisti]		init: ssh main process (22599) terminated with status 255 Oct 19 23:11:40 Ubuntu-1004-lucid-64-minimal init: ssh respawning too fast, stopped, any idea ?
2011-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	[twisti]		did that all get through ?
2011-10-20T01:29:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	looks like it did, though your pointless log msg on 1st line may have got trimmed
2011-10-20T01:33:00.000Z	[twisti]	adminewb	Oct 19 23:11:40 Ubuntu-1004-lucid-64-minimal init: ssh main process (22599) terminated with status 255 Oct 19 23:11:40 Ubuntu-1004-lucid-64-minimal init: ssh respawning too fast, stopped
2011-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	sorry I'd have little insight into what would cause such errors; just pointing out what got through :/
2011-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	[twisti]		ah ok, thanks anyways
2011-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	[twisti]		i guess its just a bug in ubuntu, the same line works fine on normal debians
2011-10-20T01:38:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	debians using the same kernel as your oneiric counterpart?
2011-10-20T01:38:00.000Z	[twisti]		i dont even know that word
2011-10-20T01:39:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	oh, i mean 11.10 release
2011-10-20T01:39:00.000Z	[twisti]		i run 10.04 lts
2011-10-20T01:39:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	lucid, then, I run lucid too
2011-10-20T01:40:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	in any case the principle still applies; your difficulty may relate to a given version of linux, distinct from what the distro does with it
2011-10-20T01:40:00.000Z	[twisti]		possible
2011-10-20T01:41:00.000Z	[twisti]		but i see other people with 10 lts complaining it doesnt work for them either
2011-10-20T01:41:00.000Z	adminewb	[twisti]	maybe you can find some backported version of the sshd package then?
