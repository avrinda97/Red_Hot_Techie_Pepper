2006-06-18T16:21:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		hello, i'm trying to install network manager for gnome. I don't have an internet connection yet and it does not appear to be on the ubuntu cd-rom.
2006-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		How do I install it in another way?
2006-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		depends on what you want to do with it james_xxx
2006-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		it will work fine though
2006-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	from the menu, System ->  administration -> networking that should be there
2006-06-18T16:23:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Why should it be there?
2006-06-18T16:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	cos that is how it is in ubuntu this being the ubuntu help channel
2006-06-18T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	unless there is special info you are keeping from me ;-)
2006-06-18T16:25:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	My network card is detected and work fine, problem is that ubuntu doesn't seem to support wpa native. I need network manager for that, but I have no idea how to install it.
2006-06-18T16:27:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Synaptic install?
2006-06-18T16:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	menu System Administration Synaptic Package Manager
2006-06-18T16:28:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Ah, problem is that it doesn't seem to be on the cd and I don't have internet access. If you are sure about it should be there though, I will go and check. Have to reboot and start Ubuntu :)
2006-06-18T16:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	it is in main and so should be there
2006-06-18T16:35:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Sorry, it's not in the list - for me. Is it for you?
2006-06-18T16:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	yes, which is why I said that
2006-06-18T16:38:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Strange...
2006-06-18T16:38:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	I used the search and looked for network manager, it only found something for pcmcia cards
2006-06-18T16:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	well i got it from main - can you see  wpasupplicant - Client support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i)
2006-06-18T16:39:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	Ah I thought it was just called network manager, let me have a look (rebooting again)
2006-06-18T16:39:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	thanks!
2006-06-18T16:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	network-manager-gnome
2006-06-18T16:40:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	ompaul	There is no network-manager-gnome in the list.
2006-06-18T16:58:00.000Z	ompaul	Sjoerd-	go to packages.ubuntu.com and get the real one
