2006-10-01T11:38:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	read the pages and do what is written
2006-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	there are 3 links in the text ubotu sends you
2006-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	and there it says: Install the package flashplugin-nonfree
2006-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	that's what you should do
2006-10-01T11:43:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	have you closed firefox completely and restarted it?
2006-10-01T11:43:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	 close firefox
2006-10-01T11:43:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	and all ff windows. The run it again
2006-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	just close firefox
2006-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	and then open it
2006-10-01T11:45:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	and does it work now?
2006-10-01T11:46:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	did you install flashplugin-nonfree?
2006-10-01T11:47:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	no, just the package in ubuntu
2006-10-01T11:48:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	hmm that's strange. Did you get any errors when you installed the package?
2006-10-01T11:49:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	are you sure you closed firefox completely, so all windows (like downloads) are closed?
2006-10-01T11:53:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	i have no ideas anymore, maybe a reboot works?
2006-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ricky	maybe you could try installing firefox manually like is written on this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
