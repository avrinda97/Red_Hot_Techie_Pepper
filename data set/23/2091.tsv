2009-07-18T08:10:00.000Z	raziekiel		I had unallocated space on my drive, so I used a live boot to resize my /home partition form 10 to 30gigs, and now it shows it as 30 gigs, but 26gigs full already, I still have the same free space as before. Any ideas?
2009-07-18T08:11:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	are you using VLM?
2009-07-18T08:12:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	I'm not sure what that means :(
2009-07-18T08:13:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	ok, you had to make partitions when installing ubuntu... did you make them automatically or manually? Also, are you dual booting with windows?
2009-07-18T08:14:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	Manually, and yes, windows is on a second harddrive than linux, but I dual boot
2009-07-18T08:15:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	ok, did u make just one big partition or did you make a /boot, swap and ext3 partition/s?
2009-07-18T08:15:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	I have a boot, a swap, a root dir, and a /home partition
2009-07-18T08:16:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	ok, did u install windows first or ubuntu?
2009-07-18T08:16:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	Windows I'm pretty sure
2009-07-18T08:17:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	pretty  sure? lol...
2009-07-18T08:17:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	It's been a long time since I did a fresh install, but windows was first
2009-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	can you type 'df -h' and paste the output on http://pastebin.ca

2009-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	nothing looks wrong there
2009-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	Well, whe nI open up partition editor, my /hom is 29.9 gigs, not 9..
2009-07-18T08:26:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	yes, because you're not looking at your actual /home partition, you're looking at the LVM that CONTAINS your logical /home partition.
2009-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	if you could paste a screenshot of your partition manager i could confirm
2009-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	Nameless_au	raziekiel	first what partition manager are you using?
2009-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	raziekiel	Nameless_au	GParted 0.4.3
