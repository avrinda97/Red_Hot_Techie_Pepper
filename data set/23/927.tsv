2010-12-18T20:29:00.000Z	kcorcoran		okay, i come from a windows background..currently running v10.10 64 and having a video card (ati) issue... if i have an issue like this (in windows) i would go to the vendor site, locate a current driver and install.  in ubuntu it automatically downloaded a driver - this driver i assume does NOT come from the vendor site, but rather a ubuntu repository of tested/approved drivers?  is that a correct assumption?
2010-12-18T20:29:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	yes that is correct
2010-12-18T20:30:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 so, given the downloaded driver is not performing properly i went to ati and found they have a newer version driver.  what is the correct process to load the new version?  do i need to uninstall (how) the old version?  the new version is a .run file - i am not familiar with
2010-12-18T20:31:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	what is the issue you're having with the Ubuntu-supplied driver?
2010-12-18T20:33:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	when running dual monitors the taskbar is not properly displayed.   usually on thetaskbar it displays date/time, user name, and the restart button....mine shows most of the user name and truncates the last few latters and no restart button?  any ideas?
2010-12-18T20:34:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	have you tried removing the panel items and re-adding them?  That doesn't sound like a video card issue to me...
2010-12-18T20:34:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 not sure i understand?
2010-12-18T20:34:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	are both monitors displaying graphics correctly?
2010-12-18T20:35:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	(resolution's ok, no other weirdness)?
2010-12-18T20:35:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 disreagrd...i tihnk i know what you mean
2010-12-18T20:35:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 well so far, but i haven't doen anything else
2010-12-18T20:37:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 i thought i was removing an item from the panel, the entire panel is gone now?
2010-12-18T20:38:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	oops!  well - if the bottom panel is there, you should be able to click on it and create a new panel
2010-12-18T20:40:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	^^
2010-12-18T20:41:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	so far so good! :)
2010-12-18T20:41:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	^^
2010-12-18T20:45:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	i ran gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel && killall gnome-pane and it worked for the most part...however the wireless isn't showing up

2010-12-18T20:52:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 okay, things appear to be as they should...why did you determine it wasn't a video issue?  the display was fine until i went to dual monitors.  trying to follow the logic?  and, should install the vendor supplied (newer) driver?  or is that not a best practice?
2010-12-18T20:57:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	if you have video working, then it's not the video card that's the problem
2010-12-18T20:57:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	video card problems are usually things like flickering, resolution issues, screen goes black, etc.
2010-12-18T21:02:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran	it's also better in general to stick with Ubuntu-supplied software, at least until you learn enough to start customizing your system yourself - installing kernel modules (drivers) is not really a newbie's task ;-)
2010-12-18T21:04:00.000Z	kcorcoran	yeats	 that makes sense, and i am not knowledgeable enough yet....so this will work for now.  really liingthis ability to tweak the panel
