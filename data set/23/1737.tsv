2009-11-09T04:43:00.000Z	davidkarr		(Very first time in IRC) Can someone help me confirm the options on the "Prepare disk space" install step for 9.10?
2009-11-09T04:44:00.000Z	davidkarr		yes, I'm wondering what "install side by side" will do.  Will it pay attention to that slider underneath, if I move the slider?
2009-11-09T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	partitioning
2009-11-09T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	Your on the Ubuntu Live CD right now, yes, and  ran the installer?
2009-11-09T04:47:00.000Z	davidkarr	sebsebseb	Yes, I downloaded the ISO, burned it to a CD, and booted it.
2009-11-09T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	ok so the guided install
2009-11-09T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	you can  do a guided install where it sets things up for you, or a manual install.   or set up partitions in Gparted first and then finnish off in manual install
2009-11-09T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	see above
2009-11-09T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	I just messaged you well tried to,  so  check out what I put
2009-11-09T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	wait
2009-11-09T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	if you haven't told it to to install anything yet,  you can cancel  install,  and do things   my way or Menza's way   which results in you getting a seperate /home as well
2009-11-09T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	well I have helped people  partition new installs,  many times in here and such,  it  would be more interesting for me to see MenZa help you
2009-11-09T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	I think  you can just do it in manual install, but what I would normalley do is make two partitions in Gparted  system > administration > partition editor   12GB or so for /  big seperate home,   put some swap space double the RAM usaulley.   and then finnish it off in manual install in the installer, and tell it which partition to use for / and which to use for /home and install
2009-11-09T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	seperate /home is good, because then if you need to re install, you don't have to move data around   Also if later on you want to install another distro instead you can keep the same stuff.
2009-11-09T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	if you don't want to do a sepeare /home  do one of the guided install optons
2009-11-09T05:04:00.000Z	davidkarr	sebsebseb	I think at this point I'll try to keep it simple.
2009-11-09T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	well that's the guided install then
2009-11-09T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	It can be made afterwoulds the seperate Home, but I have never done that myself
2009-11-09T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	If that's the case,  you should know how to set up a seperate /home install
2009-11-09T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	or  maybe not uh
2009-11-09T05:13:00.000Z	davidkarr	sebsebseb	The "maybe not" is more accurate :) , but I'll investigate that for later.
2009-11-09T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	davidkarr	If you have installed Unix/Linux before, setting up seperate /home shoudn't be that difficult
2009-11-09T05:15:00.000Z	davidkarr	sebsebseb	I didn't say I'd "installed" unix/linux before (except for the box I'm typing on now), I've just used it for a long time.
