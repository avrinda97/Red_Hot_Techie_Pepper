2009-10-22T08:29:00.000Z	GBGames		Does anyone have any experience getting Ekiga to work? As far as I know, the configuration should be fine (using STUN since the Ekiga wiki says I should), but I can't seem to connect to the echo test.
2009-10-22T08:30:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	does it actually connect but you just can't hear anything?
2009-10-22T08:31:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	I finally found the General History which tells me that it says "Remote user is unreachable"
2009-10-22T08:32:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	If there is a place to put in an address for a stun server you can try stun.ekiga.net
2009-10-22T08:32:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Yep, it's already in there.
2009-10-22T08:33:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	then erase it and save.. try to connect without it.... with a stun server you shouldn't need port forwarding.. you could also use stun01.sipphone.com  that's what stun.ekiga.net points to.
2009-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Ok, I'll try it.
2009-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	try it both ways.. without the server listed and with the other one.,
2009-10-22T08:37:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Ok, neither one worked. I'm going to follow BoxMagnet's suggestion and forward the ports anyway.
2009-10-22T08:37:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	k
2009-10-22T08:41:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Huh. Still unreachable. B-(
2009-10-22T08:41:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	wierd...
2009-10-22T08:43:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	I even added my IP to the DMZ on my router, so it can't be a forwarded ports thing...huh.
2009-10-22T08:43:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	did you just install? and did you do all the updates?
2009-10-22T08:44:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Well, I had tried to configure it some time ago, but I found that my old router didn't let me forward ports. Now I have a new router, and I'm trying again.
2009-10-22T08:44:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	which version of ekiga?
2009-10-22T08:45:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	what version of ubuntu?
2009-10-22T08:45:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	When I check the about page, it says "Thank you for your interest in Ubuntu
2009-10-22T08:46:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Ah, here we go. Update Manager says that I can upgrade to 9.04, so I must have the previous version, 8.10, if I remember correctly.
2009-10-22T08:47:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	k.. that's an OLD version of ekiga.. they are up to 3.5.x and it looks MUCH nicer.. I'll see if I can find a ppa link for the download..
2009-10-22T08:52:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	here is it.. read carefully.. there's a link to click for releases prior to 9.10.. https://launchpad.net/~sevmek/+archive/ekiga-stable-prerelease
2009-10-22T08:52:00.000Z	GBGames	scunizi	Thanks!
2009-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	scunizi	GBGames	enjoy!
