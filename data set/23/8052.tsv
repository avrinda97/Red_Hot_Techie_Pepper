2005-02-17T15:03:00.000Z	Dreamer3_		i think i'm going to have to dynamically delete .debs as they are installed to make this work :)
2005-02-17T15:03:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	apt-get clean ?
2005-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	what will delete ALL the packages, yeah?
2005-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	it's still installing from archive...
2005-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	can't do that, i can only dlete the ones alreayd installed
2005-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	Clean with clean anything that you've installed.

2005-04-07T05:07:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	run a cronjob on it
2005-04-07T05:16:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	hrm "apt-get update"....*30 seconds later* *DING!* done. :p
2005-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	if you have packages which are newer than the ones on your system, sure
2005-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	so i can dist-upgrade from a hoary CD?
2005-04-07T05:30:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	I dont see why not, though I would take it from the repos since those packages may be newer than the ones on the CD
2005-04-07T05:30:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	jigdo
2005-04-07T05:31:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	well, obviously i'd add both the CD and repository
2005-04-07T05:32:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	I dont know if Ubuntu has it *yet* but its a Debian thing that does just what you want
2005-04-07T05:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	syn-ack	i want someone to burn a cd and mail it to me ;-)
2005-04-07T05:32:00.000Z	syn-ack	Dreamer3_	You in the states?
