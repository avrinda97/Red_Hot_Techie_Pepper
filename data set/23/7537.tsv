2005-07-03T05:12:00.000Z	twistymcgee		hi everyone
2005-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	twistymcgee		anyone know how i can get rhythmbox to accept mp3 files?  whenever i try to import a folder all my files are greyed out
2005-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	have you enabled universe and multiverse?
2005-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	installed gstreamer0.8-mad?
2005-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	oh no! stay away from ubuntuguide
2005-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	yup...it's installed
2005-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	ubuntuguide will lead to system breakage
2005-07-03T05:17:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	yes, the use of unofficial repositories, for one
2005-07-03T05:18:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	it's only a matter of time
2005-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	so what repos should be enabled?
2005-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	there is nothing wrong with unofficial repos IF YOU USE THEM ONCE for the program you are after, then disable them
2005-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	ok i'll have a read of those
2005-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	any ideas in the meantime as to the rhythmbox issue?
2005-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	i'm not sure, i have every plugin i could find installed on my box
2005-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	and everything i have works (except wmv9/10)
2005-07-03T06:10:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	i have no clue
2005-07-03T06:10:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	but it is evil (as you can see on an hourly basis here)
2005-07-03T06:12:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	Sysace y'all read #3 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUsersNetworkGuidelines
2005-07-03T06:14:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	i read it i just don't remember what all i installed using those instructions
2005-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	Sysace most folks who have followed the ubuntuguide to y'alls postions usually reinstall
2005-07-03T06:31:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	i can get amarok working with gstreamer...which is fine for me...there's no way i'm reinstalling
2005-07-03T06:31:00.000Z	nalioth	twistymcgee	just showing you what is happening
2005-07-03T06:32:00.000Z	twistymcgee	nalioth	appreciate it...everything else is working fine it's just rhythmbox which i can live without
