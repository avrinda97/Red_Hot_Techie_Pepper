2011-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	demox		question, i dont feel my netbook is much faster on ubuntu from windows7, if ill change WM would it make a big difference?
2011-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	p_res	demox	depends on the wm you choose.
2011-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	p_res	demox	i use naked unity with awn, runs great.
2011-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	demox	p_res	whats awn?
2011-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	p_res	demox	avant-window-navigator
2011-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	p_res	demox	fluxbox is old. don't got there,
2011-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	p_res	demox	can be fiddly to setup sometimes.
2011-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	demox	p_res	whats the alternative?
2011-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	p_res	demox	strip unity naked.
2011-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	p_res	demox	remove the panel and launchers and install awn.
2011-07-09T05:30:00.000Z	demox	p_res	is there any easy way to do that?
2011-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	p_res	demox	yeah, just use synaptic to remove unity and then install awn.
2011-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	p_res	demox	then run awn from a terminal and set it to run at startup.
2011-07-09T05:32:00.000Z	p_res	demox	my desktop looks like this http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/705/201107090833381680x1050.jpg

2011-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	p_res	demox	what working?
2011-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	demox	p_res	the little size of the screen
2011-07-09T05:34:00.000Z	p_res	demox	awn is fine for that because you can set it to hide behind windows etc.
2011-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	p_res	demox	no.
2011-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	p_res	demox	that's old and deprecated.
2011-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	demox	p_res	any tweaks or packages or such for netbooks?
2011-07-09T05:37:00.000Z	p_res	demox	nope. just set awn to hide behind open windows.
