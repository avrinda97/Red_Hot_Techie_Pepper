2012-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	pozic	countley	In my experience there is not a single perfect PDF viewer on Linux.
2012-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	pozic	countley	but for most people quite good is good enough.
2012-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	countley	pozic	its just that the page runs away when i start scrolling very annoying
2012-07-06T13:03:00.000Z	pozic	countley	note that you ever said which client you use now.

2012-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	pozic	countley	in my experience they all work.
2012-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	pozic	countley	some of them seem to  be more focussed on embedded applications.
2012-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	countley	pozic	but i like software to work well
2012-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	pozic	countley	so, basically you get a shitty user-interface, but it's blazingly fast.
2012-07-06T13:08:00.000Z	pozic	countley	it's more like advertising.
2012-07-06T13:08:00.000Z	pozic	countley	you will likely like okular.
2012-07-06T13:08:00.000Z	pozic	countley	but it has some issues if you are a very critical user.\
