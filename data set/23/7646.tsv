2005-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	how?
2005-10-22T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	I have a working skype on breezy
2005-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	I went to skype.com, downloaded it and installed it...
2005-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	that doesnt work for me?
2005-10-22T14:04:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	I used this download: http://skype.com/go/getskype-linux-static
2005-10-22T14:04:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	it's the "Static binary tar.bz2 with Qt 3.2 compiled in" version (since I use gnome and don't want to install the smelly Qt libraries centrally)
2005-10-22T14:06:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	I,m downloading it now
2005-10-22T14:06:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	how do I install it?
2005-10-22T14:07:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	I installed it just for my user, like this:
2005-10-22T14:08:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	cd; mkdir -p programs; cd programs; tar xf ~/Desktop/skype_static*.bz2; cd skype *; ./skype
2005-10-22T14:25:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	thanks for your help. Skype starts now, and it look realy nice. but I have two small problems, first is that it takes about a minute to start after I run ./skye and the second thing is that: sound comes from my laptop speakers and not from my usb headset
2005-10-22T14:25:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	it's a KDE app - it uses a different set of libraries than GNOME apps use
2005-10-22T14:26:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	I see
2005-10-22T14:26:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	as for the sound, I don't know about that sorry.
2005-10-22T14:26:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	thanks so far
2005-10-22T14:27:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	in skype, do you see anything interesting in tools->options->headsets ?
2005-10-22T14:28:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	yes it says: /dev/dsp
2005-10-22T14:28:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	do you have a choice there?
2005-10-22T14:29:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	yes, /dev/dsp1
2005-10-22T14:29:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	try that maybe
2005-10-22T14:32:00.000Z	xukun	dooglus	thanks a lot, that works
2005-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	you're welcome.
2005-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	dooglus	xukun	the slow startup shouldn't be a problem - you only start it once, right?  it might be eating a lot of memory though.  shame there's not a gnome version.
