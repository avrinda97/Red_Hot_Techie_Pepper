2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		is there a way I can install Ubuntu via Windows via the hdd?
2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		ie... I can't find a way to boot via CD
2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		and I don't have a floppy
2007-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Have you tried changing the boot order in the bios yeah?
2007-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	some admin password won't let me change the boot order :(
2007-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	To be honest you'd be better off just removing the battery from your mobo..
2007-02-23T11:54:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	the little circular one?
2007-02-23T11:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Yep.
2007-02-23T11:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Is it the case that you put a password on the bios and forgot it?
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	I didn't set a password. It came with one
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Have a look through the docs which came with the PC
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	or google "<manufacturer> bios password"
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	didn't get any docs, just the laptop itself
2007-02-23T11:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Google for it first.
2007-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Whats your laptop brand and manufacturer?
2007-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	Dell Latitude D266XT
2007-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	Enter your service number, it will get you the password: http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~skynet/zips/latitude.exe
2007-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	not sure if I've got a service number
2007-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	I only got the actual laptop and power brick thing
2007-02-23T12:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	It should say it on the laptop somewhere.
2007-02-23T12:03:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	riotkittie: looks like some sticker has been peeled off
2007-02-23T12:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	davidwinter	My last suggestion is 'Dell"
2007-02-23T12:06:00.000Z	davidwinter	Stormx2	a last resort
