2010-07-29T10:01:00.000Z	picard1421		is there a way to lock a computer in ubuntu unless you "swipe" a magnetic strip card or biometric reader
2010-07-29T10:02:00.000Z	picard1421		??
2010-07-29T10:02:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	and disable password? not sure. you can definitely use a fingerprint reader with the screen lock though
2010-07-29T10:02:00.000Z	picard1421	maco	im talking without GNome
2010-07-29T10:02:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	yes...?
2010-07-29T10:03:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	the screenlock on gnome screensaver can use a fingerprint reader. ive seen it done
2010-07-29T10:03:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	oh. dont know about that. not sure how you have gnome with gui either, but....
2010-07-29T10:08:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	itd depend on the exact one i think, but plenty of hackers use linux to hack things with magstripes, rfid, etc. so im sure such devices exist that are linux compatible
2010-07-29T10:11:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	you might have better luck on ubuntuforums.org ... clearly nobody who's ever needed to do what you're doing is on irc right now
2010-07-29T10:43:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	kdm DOES give an option where the session is a plain tty
2010-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	youd need to edit some stuff in /etc to get the graphical sessions out of the list though
2010-07-29T10:54:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	kdm is still graphical, but it has a way to login so that you just get a tty.  its a default option.  if you just remove the graphical options, the users cant screw around and pick non-tty
2010-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	yes the thing you get when you ctrl+alt+f1
2010-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	thats tty1 and the f2 one is tty2 etc

2010-07-29T10:58:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	the login screen used in kde
2010-07-29T10:58:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	as opposed to gdm, the login screen used in gnome
2010-07-29T10:58:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	dm = display manager
2010-07-29T10:59:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	right but if you just install kdm, you can make it work with fingerprint readers and whatnots, and set it up so that it ONLY allows login to CLI/TTY, and then youve got what ou want
2010-07-29T11:00:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	some of the base libraries, yes, but the apps, no
2010-07-29T11:00:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	i'd add --no-install-recommends to that
2010-07-29T11:01:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	so it only pulls actual dependencies not the nice-to-have stuff too
2010-07-29T11:01:00.000Z	maco	picard1421	yeah should work. but im going to bed now. others can take it from here
