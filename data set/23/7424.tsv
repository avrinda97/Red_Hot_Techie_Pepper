2005-09-23T12:48:00.000Z	esac_		i just switched to the nvidia driver, and after restarting X all of my fonts are really big. i assume its using a larger dpi. any idea how to fix it ?
2005-09-23T10:01:00.000Z	esac_		is it possible to mount a directory/cdrom as a .iso file ? (not the reverse of mounting a .iso file as a cdrom) ?
2005-09-23T10:01:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	that would have nothing to do with mount
2005-09-23T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	mkisofs will create an iso image for you
2005-09-23T10:03:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	: but that will create a new byte for byte file, right ? i have a 16 GB partition and i want to reference it as a .iso, but i dont really want to make a .iso out of it
2005-09-23T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	why would you want to do that?
2005-09-23T10:05:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	: qemu
2005-09-23T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	that sounds gross
2005-09-23T10:06:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	why a .iso?
2005-09-23T10:06:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	: well doesn't have to be a .iso, just any format i can pass to "-hda filename"
2005-09-28T06:45:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	if i recall correctly, you are running vmware in breezy, right ?
2005-09-28T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	yes
2005-09-28T06:45:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	whenever i try to go into snapshot manager, vmware dies. do you experience this same problem ?
2005-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	is it oopsing your kernel?
2005-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	nope, haven't had that issue since i installed using any2any
2005-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	ah, dunno then, sorry
2005-09-28T06:47:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	: snapshot manager works just fine for you then i take it ?
2005-09-28T06:50:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	laptop-net does things like that
2005-09-28T06:50:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	ill give it a try, thanks
2005-09-28T06:55:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	yes
2005-09-28T06:56:00.000Z	esac_	bob2	has anybody else reported issues where they run "sudo command" where command can be anything, and it just hangs? i keep getting that intermittently
2005-09-28T07:01:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	launchpad.net
2005-10-04T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	esac_	that drops you into a rot shell without asking for a password
