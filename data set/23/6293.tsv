2006-06-28T14:19:00.000Z	m0gsi		Hey all i have a problem, Last night downloading i accidentally allowed the hard disk to fill , i rebooted and i couldnt log into gnome. I have cleared 500mb and now gnome loads but very very slowly any ideas?
2006-06-28T14:20:00.000Z	m0gsi		Any ideas?
2006-06-28T14:20:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	is it possible to post your output of "df -h"?
2006-06-28T14:27:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	is it possible to post your output of "df -h"?
2006-06-28T14:29:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	well, okay...do you have a seperate /home and /var?
2006-06-28T14:29:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	so, everything is in /
2006-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	well, that is (I hope) not important
2006-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	try to use CLI and say "sudo aptitude clean"
2006-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	who are you talking to?
2006-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	ah, okay...was a bit confused
2006-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	no worries...:)...we are here to learn
2006-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	any changes to "df -h"?
2006-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	okay...one last commad "du -sh /home"
2006-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	okay, fair enough....well then...I hope it will start faster now...
2006-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	with "aptitude --help" you will find out what the command just did...
2006-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	well...my guess was, that gnome was not able to write into your home anymore (there is some space reserved for root on your harddisk), but...well...
2006-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	cant say for sure...if it does NOT fix it, we have to find other solutions and causes
2006-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	okay...just make sure you dont get too far over 90%
2006-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	harddisk usage of course...the download is okay over 90%...;)
2006-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	okay
2006-06-28T14:38:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	welcome
2006-06-28T14:46:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	great...:)
2006-06-28T14:47:00.000Z	scheuri	m0gsi	very welcome
