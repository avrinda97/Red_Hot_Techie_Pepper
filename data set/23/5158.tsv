2007-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	ray_		does anyone know much about grub, and why it wouldn't give me an option to install it when i install ubuntu?
2007-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	it normally installs...
2007-03-04T11:40:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	did you use live install
2007-03-04T11:41:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	in that case, run the live cd again, and see what's up
2007-03-04T11:42:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	can you see the the two partitions in the live cd?
2007-03-04T11:42:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	hmm, that's strange, I don't know why you don't see grub, but I do know something you can try...
2007-03-04T11:43:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	super grub disk: http://adrian15.raulete.net/grub/
2007-03-04T11:44:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	that might fix it, but I don't know why the install doesn't work the way it should
2007-03-04T11:45:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	good luck
2007-03-04T11:47:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	so you have two drives? which startup sequence isn't showing it? BIOS?
2007-03-04T11:48:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	no go there, the wife is a windows user
2007-03-04T11:49:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	no, you can have windows and ubuntu on the same disk, with partitons
2007-03-04T11:49:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	i understand, but the first hard drive is close to capacity as it is
2007-03-04T11:50:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	the computer is a dell and only a year old
2007-03-04T11:51:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	if the pins are not placed correctly would that screw with bios not seeing it?
2007-03-04T11:51:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	how close is it to capacity? because I don't know how to fix bios, but I do know that you can install ubuntu on a pretty small space, and then use the second drive for space
2007-03-04T11:53:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	would a hard drive even work if the pins/jumpers/whatever aren't in the right place?
2007-03-04T11:55:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	check your documentation and see if there's any way to fix bios if it's not working right
2007-03-04T11:56:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	will def be doing that
2007-03-04T11:56:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	you could detect the second drive in the live cd right? if you could, it's probably connected alright
2007-03-04T11:57:00.000Z	ray_	gravemind	it's sad, but i was actually hoping you'd say, nah, you hooked it up wrong. that way it would be an easy fix
2007-03-04T11:58:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	by all means, open up your case and check for loose cables if there's any doubt : )
2007-03-04T12:00:00.000Z	gravemind	ray_	you're welcome
