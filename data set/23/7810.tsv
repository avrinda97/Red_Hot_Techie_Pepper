2005-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	linux-restricted-modules
2005-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	will try, thankyou
2005-04-23T06:55:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	what kernel are you running?
2005-04-23T06:55:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	the newest one that came with hoary. i have to run upstairs to be completly speicifc, do you want me to?
2005-04-23T06:56:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	if you get the linux-restricted-modules that matches that kernel, IMO you should be fine...
2005-04-23T06:56:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	i tried that, says newest version
2005-04-23T06:57:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	do you have nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common?
2005-04-23T06:58:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	nvidia-glx yes, apt-get claims newest version, i'll remove install kernel-common and see if that helps
2005-04-23T07:05:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	i apt-get removed nvidia-kernel-common, which pulled nvidia-glx and linux-restricted. i then installed nvidia-glx which put them all back in (at version 6111). Now i don't get a mismatch, i get a "NVidia module failed to initialize"
2005-04-23T07:08:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	the latest hoary linux-restricted-modules uses the 7174 nvidia module. Which uneverse and multiverse repositories are you using?
2005-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	i have both hoary and warty ones so i could have more version options in synaptic, should i kill th e warty entries, apt-get update and then try again?
2005-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	if i locked a version (i don't think i did, but i might have) in synaptic will that affect apt-get from console? is there a lock version file i can delete?
2005-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	yeah... it looks like you're getting the warty versions of nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common
2005-04-23T07:11:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	since synaptic is a frontend, my best guess would to be to say yes
2005-04-23T07:13:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	know how to turn of the lock wihtout the synaptic gui?
2005-04-23T07:13:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	don't know... sorry :(
2005-04-23T07:14:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	i'll hope i didn't lock them and remove the warty refrences. be back when that's done\
2005-04-23T07:26:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	x loaded; switching to that comp\
2005-04-23T07:32:00.000Z	darkaudit	amonkey	are you on the other machine now?
2005-04-23T07:32:00.000Z	amonkey	darkaudit	yup! thanks!
