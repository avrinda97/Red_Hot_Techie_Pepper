2006-05-30T16:52:00.000Z	GaiaX11		I have tried to connect to another machine through ssh, but without any success. Do i have to change anything in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. All the lines are commented.
2006-05-30T16:52:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	what's the response when you try?
2006-05-30T16:53:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	It hangs
2006-05-30T16:53:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	and don't ask the password
2006-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	GaiaX11		 /etc/ssh/sshd_config - do i have to config this files in the other machine?
2006-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	the remote machine could be slow or packets might be being dropped. if you nc it on pt 22 do you see the ssh server string?
2006-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	how do i see that?
2006-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	sshd doesn't run by default.  This machine is within reach?
2006-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	 /etc/ssh/sshd_config - do i have to config this files in the other machine?
2006-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	all the lines of this file are commented
2006-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	and this one /etc/ssh/ssh_config
2006-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	you might want to change the sshd settings if you want it to run on a diff port, but the default should be ok, is the ssh server actually running on that machine though?
2006-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	i'd like to have a look in the /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config of anyone that ssh is working
2006-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	Yah. But all the lines are commented
2006-05-30T05:02:00.000Z	GaiaX11		Someone told me that in debian all the lines are uncommented.
2006-05-30T05:02:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	Someone told me that in debian all the lines are uncommented. And it works
2006-05-30T05:03:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	you haven't answered the question yet! is the sshd running on the machine you're trying to access?
2006-05-30T05:03:00.000Z	GaiaX11		I even do not know if it is running in my machine
2006-05-30T05:04:00.000Z	GaiaX11		How do i know that
2006-05-30T05:04:00.000Z	GaiaX11		The other machine is outside my intranet
2006-05-30T05:05:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	I have to access it through: ssh username@ipnumber
2006-05-30T05:05:00.000Z	NigelS_	GaiaX11	you don't need the server to be running on your machine to access another with ssh, only if you want someone else to connect to you
2006-05-30T05:06:00.000Z	GaiaX11	NigelS_	right!
