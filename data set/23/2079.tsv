2011-05-11T05:42:00.000Z	plustax		Im running 11.04 how do I hook up my laptop to my TV via hdmi? Cable is already hooked up, I just can't get my screen to pop up on my TV
2011-05-11T05:42:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	xrandr
2011-05-11T05:42:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	what is that?
2011-05-11T05:43:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	lets you set your monitors how you want resolution location compared to others etc
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	the current monitors app isnt even recognizing my TV
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	for example i use xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1024x600 --output VGA1 --mode 1440x900 --right-of LVDS1
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	to get monitor names just type it without arguements
2011-05-11T05:46:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	I have ARandR and multiple screens apps from software center. I have no idea how to set them up so I can connect the TV
2011-05-11T05:46:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	open a terminal and pastebin output of xrandr with no arguements
2011-05-11T05:47:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	make sure your hdmi is plugged in when doing that
2011-05-11T05:49:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	does it see anything is plugged into hdmi? theres nothing there
2011-05-11T05:50:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	the hdmi cable is plugged into the tv and my laptop and my tv is on the correct HDMI source setting.
2011-05-11T05:50:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	does the laptop see the hdmi port?
2011-05-11T05:50:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	cause xrandr doesn't :/
2011-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	can you help me fix it?
2011-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	lspci do you see your hdmi port listed?
2011-05-11T05:52:00.000Z	plustax	celthunder	I dont see it in there, no.
2011-05-11T05:52:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	Fn+ display button (f5 for me)
2011-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	press it again when the lcd is off type xrandr again
2011-05-11T05:55:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	it could not be using a pci connection...though why hdmi would be on anything else?
2011-05-11T06:08:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	try the open source ones...they're usually just as good as the nvidia ones for most things
2011-05-11T06:08:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	and they're not proprietary and dependent on nvidia
2011-06-10T11:05:00.000Z	celthunder	plustax	chromiumos is released on a few devices...sort of a failos though
