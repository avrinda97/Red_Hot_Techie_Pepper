2007-02-16T14:47:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	  sudo mkdir cp -Rv /media/hdc1/"Documents and Settings"/Home/desktop ~/media/hda1/win_desktop

2007-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 please use a !pastebin and paste the contents of /etc/fstab
2007-02-16T14:52:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 gedit /etc/resolv.conf   and use the !pastebin to show me what you have there
2007-02-16T14:55:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 why did you give me /etc/resolv.conf ?? :p
2007-02-16T14:55:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 /etc/fstab dude .. pay attention
2007-02-16T14:56:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 ohh, errm, I apologise, my bad :p
2007-02-16T14:59:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 address the person you are talking to in this channel, its busy and your posts can easily be overlooked/lost
2007-02-16T15:00:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 gedit /etc/fstab
2007-02-16T15:04:00.000Z	cheeseboy16	unop	http://pastebin.ca/359455
2007-02-16T15:06:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 the problem you have right now is that you are trying to copy to /media/hda1 which is a ntfs/windows partition .. ubuntu out of the box does not provide NTFS-Write access
2007-02-16T15:06:00.000Z	unop	cheeseboy16	 why dont you just copy the folder to your own desktop ????
