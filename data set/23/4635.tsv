2008-05-06T05:46:00.000Z	rich1		has anyone had any luck getting ati 200m cards working in hardy.  i got about 800fps in gutsy and only about 400 in hardy.
2008-05-06T05:47:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	glxgears is not a benchmark
2008-05-06T05:47:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	what does 'glxinfo | grep direct' say?
2008-05-06T05:47:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	ok.  it's still visually worse. hold on.
2008-05-06T05:48:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	it says direct rendering no; opengl renderer string mesa glx indirect
2008-05-06T05:49:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	and that's after applying the restricted hardware driver.
2008-05-06T05:49:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	it seems to be broken
2008-05-06T05:49:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	if you look in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log you may see some DRM errors
2008-05-06T05:50:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	 do you know how to fix it?
2008-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	did you use something other than the restricted driver manager on gtusy?
2008-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	i'm not sure what i'm looking for.
2008-05-06T05:55:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	i have drmOpenDevice node name /dev/dri/card 0 - 14 notices.  all say no such device or adrress.
2008-05-06T05:56:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	that means the fglrx kernel module isn't getting loaded
2008-05-06T05:56:00.000Z	crdlb		it's often very hard to fix :/
2008-05-06T05:57:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	do you know how to fix that?
2008-05-06T05:57:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	make sure you don't have anything in DISABLED_MODULES in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2008-05-06T05:59:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	i checked.  not even a disabled_modules section in that file.
2008-05-06T06:00:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	ok, try: sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
2008-05-06T06:00:00.000Z	crdlb		then reboot
2008-05-06T06:04:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	ok.  trying now.
2008-05-06T06:04:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	will it require a restart?
2008-05-06T06:04:00.000Z	crdlb	rich1	yes
2008-05-06T06:05:00.000Z	rich1	crdlb	ok.  i'll get on here again after restart.  thank for the help so far! :)
