2007-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	like my machine has no more CPU/RAM
2007-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	weird, and both gxine and xine-ui work without a problem?
2007-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	any clues ?
2007-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	k, xine == xine-ui.  Have you seen if it happens with a fresh new user?
2007-01-06T06:47:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	gxine is not installed
2007-01-06T06:47:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	I removed the .xine and retried it is the same
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	what should I do ?
2007-01-06T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	try with a new user
2007-01-06T06:56:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	how do you export your display after a su
2007-01-06T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	export DISPLAY=foo
2007-01-06T06:58:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	export DISPLAY=:0.0 didn't work ...
2007-01-06T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	what are you trying to do?
2007-01-06T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	you should login with the new user after logging out with this one for testing.  But you probably need to do 'xhost +local:' as your regular user as well
2007-01-06T07:05:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	I got a lot of things
2007-01-06T07:05:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	i tried sudo -u john totem
2007-01-06T07:05:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	and I got this ALSA lib pcm.c:2146:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM dmixer
2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	and this
2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	franky_	yes, just login with your new user :)
2007-01-06T07:07:00.000Z	franky_	jrib	ok :)
