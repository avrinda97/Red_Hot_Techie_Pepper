2008-07-13T17:39:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood		I have installed Ubuntu 8.04 and want to connect to a D-link WPA-PSK network, I got a inspiron 6000 http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-inspiron-6000/4507-3121_7-31257675.html laptop. When I try to connect the network manager get in a endless loop when it is "Changing interface configuration".. I have googled a little and think my network card is supported, so what is the problem?
2008-07-13T17:41:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood		My networking stadrads is:     IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, are they not supported for WPA-PSK?
2008-07-13T17:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	what is your device...
2008-07-13T17:42:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-inspiron-6000/4507-3121_7-31257675.html
2008-07-13T17:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	ok, so what is the problem, can you not use wpa or what?
2008-07-13T17:43:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	I get in a loop when "Changing Interface configuration"
2008-07-13T17:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	i really don't know much about intel devices, honestly i always thought they kinda "just worked".... try checking the wireless documentation.
2008-07-13T17:45:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	I have googled a bit after problem solving and found nothing of use... but maybe my googling skills are to low :(
2008-07-13T17:46:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	How can I isntall opera when I am not on the net?
2008-07-13T17:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	i wasnt talking to you.
2008-07-13T17:47:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	ahh... okay... just thought you had forgotten to write my name
2008-07-13T17:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	the wpa might be your issue.. just as a test, have you tried turning off your wireless security to see ifyou can connect?
2008-07-13T17:52:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	I don't know how to, I am quite new to ubuntu and Linux...
2008-07-13T17:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	that has nothing tod o w/ Ubuntu or Linux, it has to do w/ the model router you have, logging into it, and turning off wireless security,
2008-07-13T17:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	you won't want ot leave it like that, but i'm guessing wpa is your issue..
2008-07-13T17:54:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	Ahhh... I am not able right now to turn security off, sry
2008-07-13T17:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	understood..
2008-07-13T17:55:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	But have tried to connect to other no-security networks without a problem
2008-07-13T17:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	then that confirms what i believe the problem is.
2008-07-13T17:57:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	Okay... but i have checked http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/ and think my card is WPA supported, but I am not sure I find that site a litle confusing :(
2008-07-13T17:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	i really don't know anything wpa supplicant.. but It would appear wpa is your issue, so you'll need to seek out further helpw/ wpa supplicant.. or switch your wireless settings to WEP
2008-07-13T18:00:00.000Z	RobbingDaHood	IndyGunFreak	hmm... I am not able to switch the security either... but where can I get more help? I will try to write on the forum, but is there other options for me?
2008-07-13T18:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	RobbingDaHood	the forum would be a good start..
