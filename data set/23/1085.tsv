2010-09-11T02:45:00.000Z	Eyes_Only		Im haivng difficulty running a bash command, it outputs that the command isnt found (im not a noob when it comes to basic bash syntax)
2010-09-11T02:45:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	what's the command you're using?
2010-09-11T02:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	paste it if you need to
2010-09-11T02:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	what's the path to the symlink, and what's the command you're using?
2010-09-11T02:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	is adb executable?
2010-09-11T02:50:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	what's the full path to the file you're trying to run?  You haven't specified that
2010-09-11T02:50:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	oh, yeah, and make sure the filesystem it's sitting on isn't mounted noexec
2010-09-11T02:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	no
2010-09-11T02:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	to make it executable, try this:  chmod +x <file>
2010-09-11T03:00:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	what is the full command line you're running, and what is the full error you're using?  Use pastebin if you have to!
2010-09-11T03:03:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	and I am blatantly refusing to read it!
2010-09-11T03:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	paste the full command you're running, plus its output
2010-09-11T03:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	including error message
2010-09-11T03:06:00.000Z	Eyes_Only	ectospasm	that is the error message, bash is refusing to run the executable
2010-09-11T03:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	you're refusing to listen.  Paste the full command, and error, please.
2010-09-11T03:07:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	you've said it yourself, you don't know how to do bash, and the exact error message can give clues as to what's going wrong.
2010-09-11T03:08:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	that was what guntbert was looking for, not what I was looking for
2010-09-11T03:08:00.000Z	Eyes_Only	ectospasm	what exactly do you want me to paste? there is no more output from that command
2010-09-11T03:09:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	select the entire command, plus error message!  How hard is that?
2010-09-11T03:09:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	essentially, does the error start with "bash: adb:..." or "adb:..."?
2010-09-11T03:10:00.000Z	Eyes_Only	ectospasm	http://paste.ubuntu.com/491833/
2010-09-11T03:11:00.000Z	ectospasm	Eyes_Only	devices doesn't exist
2010-09-11T03:11:00.000Z	Eyes_Only	ectospasm	devices does exist, its the syntax of adb
