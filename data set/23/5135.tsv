2007-02-08T09:24:00.000Z	nilsl		How do I run hardware detection after the install?
2007-02-08T09:25:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	what hardware do you need detecting?
2007-02-08T09:25:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	For my NIC
2007-02-08T09:27:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	see if you need to install a special driver for it, is it anything exotic (rare) or just a typical NIC card?
2007-02-08T09:28:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Just a typical NIC, I'd like to use the hardware detection that is used in the installer.
2007-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	what does your lspci command tell you about your NIC?
2007-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	It's not there
2007-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Or rather, nothing happens ...
2007-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	did it ever work with ubuntu or linux before
2007-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Gosh, yes.
2007-02-08T09:34:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	can you post lspci | grep -i net result?
2007-02-08T09:35:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Yes, nothing ...
2007-02-08T09:37:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	try removing the card, restarting, shutting down, install the card, in the bios try to set the 'reset hardware information' (under PCI usually), then restart Ubuntu again
2007-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Reset the BIOS?
2007-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	not sure that will work but it's worth a try before going fishing for drivers,
2007-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Hm ... I don't have any manuals or anything for this motherboard ...
2007-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	not the whole bios!, sometimes there is a switch under the PCI periferals that says 'reset hardware iformation'
2007-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Ah, I see.
2007-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	if you can't find it, don't worry about, it is probably not the problem anyway...
2007-02-08T09:41:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Well, it's worth a shot ... Because this motherboard has been behaving strange concerning other NICs (but mainyl with ubuntu)
2007-02-08T09:41:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	make sure that the irq/dma's under the PCI section are assigned automatically unless you specifically need to access some exotic ISA hardware
2007-02-08T09:42:00.000Z	nilsl	asdfj	Lol, no ISA here ... :))
2007-02-08T09:43:00.000Z	asdfj	nilsl	I don't know of a way to do it, as yellowdart pointed out, it should happen automatically _but_ swapping the hard disk is not something that was tested
