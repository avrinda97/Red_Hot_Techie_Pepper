2011-06-05T21:47:00.000Z	kay_		hi, I just installed ubuntu but it won't recognize my wireless
2011-06-05T21:47:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	What card do you have?
2011-06-05T21:48:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	Do you know how to pastebin?
2011-06-05T21:49:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	That's ok.  paste.ubuntu.com   You go there copy / paste text into it, hit submit, then give me the link so I can see it.  Get it?
2011-06-05T21:50:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	That's a start. I need you to pastebin the output of a command.  Can you do that?
2011-06-05T21:51:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	Yeah.  the command:  sudo lspci -k    put the output in pastebin (it will be long)
2011-06-05T21:53:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	Hit submit, give me the link it goes to  (it's now different than paste.ubuntu.com/
2011-06-05T21:53:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	That's it.  reading...
2011-06-05T21:54:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	You have a BCM4311 chipset.  It's the last thing in that pastebin.  Do you see it?
2011-06-05T21:55:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	I am very confident I can get wireless working with this chipset.  Are you online using the wired interface?
2011-06-05T21:56:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	run this command.  sudo apt-get install firwmare-b43-installer    It installs software that runs on the actual wifi card.
2011-06-05T21:56:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	It is proprietary software so Ubuntu does not like to distribute it with Ubuntu.  They do provide an easy way (this command) to install it.
2011-06-05T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	You don't have to disconnect wireless.  It isn't working yet.  We have to turn on the module (modules are drivers in linux)  sudo modprobe b43
2011-06-05T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	You have a BCM43xx so we use the b43 module
2011-06-05T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	In unix (and linux) 'no news is good news'  That means there were no errors.
2011-06-05T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	Look in the applet in the panel and see if wireless networks are listed.  If not we need to do one more thing.
2011-06-05T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	You're doing fine :)
2011-06-05T22:00:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	If you are confused about what I'm talking about ask more questions and I will explain.
2011-06-05T22:00:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	That icon is the applet.  The bar it is in in the top right is the panel.  The card is now working.
2011-06-05T22:00:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	Click a network and connect to it.
2011-06-05T22:01:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	fixed
2011-06-05T22:01:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	hahaha I'm good.
2011-06-05T22:02:00.000Z	edbian	kay_	cya
