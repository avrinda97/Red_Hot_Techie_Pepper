2007-09-01T12:06:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	basically you download this .deb file, double click it to install, and that's it: http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=30328&d=1177147133
2007-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	after that i keep on the link's manual??
2007-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	I don't understand what you mean by link's manual
2007-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	i mean what do i do after that??
2007-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	download the .deb file to for example your desktop or your home folder, then go to the file so you can see it, then double click it and it should run an installer I think
2007-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	yes it does
2007-09-01T12:11:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	but whats next??
2007-09-01T12:11:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	i don't know if you need to reboot or restart gnome, or go to system->administration->networking to see if wireless is already enabled.  I bet you have to restart though
2007-09-01T12:12:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	ill restart... ill be back in a second if something goes wrong
2007-09-01T12:12:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	thank you
2007-09-03T16:13:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	that thread doesn't seem to be about the broadcom 4318, you mean this thread?: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102
2007-09-03T16:21:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	in the Terminal (command line), you simply type "dmesg" and you can copy (select text and right click and choose copy)
2007-09-03T16:23:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	after copying where do i paste it can you send me the link or whatever i need?
2007-09-03T16:23:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-09-03T16:24:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	thanks i really have to remember that XD
2007-09-03T16:25:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	here's the paste bin "http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36110/"
2007-09-03T16:26:00.000Z	dug_	kolmilludo	macd asked for your dmesg output, i don't see anything bad, i see the "bcm43xx driver" line
2007-09-03T16:27:00.000Z	kolmilludo	dug_	thats the weird thing  i mean it supposed to be working but nothing happens i dont detect any wireless
