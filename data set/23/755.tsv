2011-02-25T04:55:00.000Z	IRChatter		 I set up a cron tab in root (sudo crontab -e) as the following 5 * * * root rm -rf /home/myUsername/.local/share/Trash. Any help?
2011-02-25T04:56:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	You are missing a field
2011-02-25T04:56:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	What field? 0.o
2011-02-25T04:57:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Ah, yes, you are mixing crontab -e with /etc/crontab's syntax
2011-02-25T04:58:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	But there are 5 time fields in both. /etc/crontab has another (sixth) field, a username.
2011-02-25T04:58:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	But sudo didn't work
2011-02-25T05:00:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	What do you need sudo for?
2011-02-25T05:02:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	I couldn't get it to work, so I assumed I need it?
2011-02-25T05:03:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Such assumptions will get you in trouble later. The problem is, cron expects five fields to describe which times the command should run, you only provided four, so it has no idea what to do.
2011-02-25T05:04:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	man 5 crontab
2011-02-25T05:05:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	Aren't these the five fields for time: 0 5 * * *
2011-02-25T05:06:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Yes. Now it says to run it every day at 5 o'clock in the morning.
2011-02-25T05:07:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	Yes, so what's the problem? I had this problem before, but have forgotten how to fix it.
2011-02-25T05:07:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Though, with crontab -e, it's five time fields followed by the command to run. in /etc/crontab, it's 5 time fields, followed by username, followed by the command to run.
2011-02-25T05:08:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Your initial paste didn't have the 0 ...
2011-02-25T05:11:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	Thanks, but I can't seem to get it to work properly. I suppose I'll look online further.
2011-02-25T05:12:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	crontab -e (WITHOUT sudo) -> 0 5 * * * rm -rf ~/.Trash/*
2011-02-25T05:13:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Oh wait, that's the old location. In newer releases, it's ~/.local/share/Trash/*
2011-02-25T05:14:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	Yeah, I was about to say, haha.
2011-02-25T05:20:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	I don't understand. Crontab -e -> 0 5 * * * rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/* -> Still not working
2011-02-25T05:21:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	How do you determine that it does not work?
2011-02-25T05:22:00.000Z	IRChatter	geirha	I have the gnome schedule and I tested it there. Perhaps I'll just set it to 1 minute and see the results. Thanks for everything, but I have to go. Bye :)
2011-02-25T05:22:00.000Z	geirha	IRChatter	Sure, you can use gnome-schedule instead of crontab -e
