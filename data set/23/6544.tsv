2007-04-24T10:00:00.000Z	bryan		hello i need help
2007-04-24T10:00:00.000Z	bryan		i need help installing audio drivers ALSA package to ubuntu
2007-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	bryan		i downloaded the drivers but i do not know how to install them
2007-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	you shouldn't have to do that
2007-04-24T10:02:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	open a terminal and run "aplay -l"
2007-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	"sudo modprobe snd-emu10k1"
2007-04-24T10:07:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	did you do - or _ in the name of the driver
2007-04-24T10:08:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	does your sound work now?
2007-04-24T10:10:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	smbmount is for windows file sharing
2007-04-24T10:11:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	Try going to sound events and selecting alsa for sound playback and hitting test
2007-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	how did you install feisty?
2007-04-24T10:17:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	for the most part, searching and finding drivers isn't the thing to do in linux
2007-04-24T10:18:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	it's just like being accustomed to doing things a certain way in windows
2007-04-24T10:21:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	when you take a bunch of terminal commands and put them in a text file, it's like a little mini program
2007-04-24T10:22:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	if we get this sound thing figured out, you won't really need the terminal that much
2007-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	do you have the terminal open still?
2007-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	run "alsamixer"
2007-04-24T10:30:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	got it open?
2007-04-24T10:37:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	right click on the speaker applet icon and open preferences
2007-04-24T10:44:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	"bash ~/Desktop/alsa-info.sh"
2007-04-24T10:47:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	you'll learn fast this way
2007-04-24T11:02:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	you don't need a firewall or antivirus
2007-04-24T11:04:00.000Z	frantic	bryan	what kind of graphics card do you have
