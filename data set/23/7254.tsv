2005-12-23T08:51:00.000Z	pesco		Hi, how do I blank a DVD-RW with Ubuntu?
2005-12-23T08:51:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	try using k3b
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	there's an option on the menus
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	in k3b
2005-12-23T08:54:00.000Z	pesco	tiglionabbit	Well, I would kind of like to avoid having to install kdebase and so on.
2005-12-23T08:54:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	shame, k3b is fun times.  How about that gnome burning program?  gnomebake
2005-12-23T08:55:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	you wont be able to do this from nautilus I don't think..  just get some burning software
2005-12-23T09:15:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	what does that question even mean?
2005-12-23T09:15:00.000Z	pesco	tiglionabbit	It means, I don't like the look of KDE. Can I change it?
2005-12-23T09:16:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	while using gnome?
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	I'm sure you can change it.  Go to kde-look.org and download different styles, and use the konfigurator to change the way things look
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	pesco	tiglionabbit	Yes, I don't have any magical "change kde theme" button in my gnome menue (afaict).
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	pesco	tiglionabbit	konfigurator?
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	why don't you just go into gnome and do it?
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	I mean kde
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	pesco	tiglionabbit	Because I have this giant session of terminals and other programs running. Also on principle.
2005-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	the configuration thing for kde
2005-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	uhh...   oh I know--  Applications -> system tools -> new login
2005-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	that'll allow you to run kde and gnome at the same time.  Use the control-alt-F# keys to switch between them
2005-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	oh, you want to change the theme on k3b in gnome, I see
2005-12-23T09:19:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	=P sorry, I didn't figure that out
2005-12-23T09:20:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	I'm not sure..   heh sorry
2005-12-23T09:21:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	pesco	if you really care, you could perhaps switch to gnomebake instead, or get the konfigurator and change the settings with that
