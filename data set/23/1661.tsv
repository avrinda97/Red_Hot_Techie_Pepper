2009-12-10T13:27:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	have you looked at System > Admin > Hardware Drivers >
2009-12-10T13:28:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	it says there are no proprietary drivers installed. everything else is blank and empty. only buttons i can press are "help" and "close"
2009-12-10T13:29:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	who makes the wireless chipset in your machine?
2009-12-10T13:30:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	broadcom Corporation BCM4309
2009-12-10T13:30:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	laptop?
2009-12-10T13:31:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	check and make sure you did not diable the wireless by pressing a key combination or a hardware swtich
2009-12-10T13:32:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	look on the function keys or thereabouts. is there a key with a wireless icon? is there an LED for the wireless that is illuminated (or not)?
2009-12-10T13:34:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	there is no LED for wireless, but there is one for bluetooth. there is a Fn key for wireless, but pressing it did nothing.
2009-12-10T13:35:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	look in "Hardware Drivers" now
2009-12-10T13:35:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	no change, still nothing listed.
2009-12-10T13:36:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	you may have to press both the function key and the "Fn" key together
2009-12-10T13:36:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	i know, i did.
2009-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	the wireless card is off. if it was on, the "Hardware drivers" applet would see it and install the firmware for it.
2009-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	would BIOS be able to turn it on?
2009-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	it very well may
2009-12-10T13:38:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	trying that
2009-12-10T13:44:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	turned it on but no dice. still nothing found under "hardware drivers", and "network tools 2.28.0" says state is "inactive"
2009-12-10T13:46:00.000Z	mneptok	newtoubuntu2	do you see it listed when you run lspci ?
2009-12-10T13:47:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	it was always there
2009-12-10T13:54:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	mneptok	any futher help?
