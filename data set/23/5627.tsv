2008-01-29T00:01:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	use chmod 775
2008-01-29T00:02:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	 755 probably safer
2008-01-29T00:02:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	same problem
2008-01-29T00:03:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	is saying that i dont have enough permission to write
2008-01-29T00:03:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	 what are you trying to do exactly?
2008-01-29T00:03:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	i am trying to save my php files under www folder
2008-01-29T00:03:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	or copy
2008-01-29T00:04:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	make sure you use sudo chmod 775 on the php's and the folder
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	i used like this   ' sudo chmod 775 /var/www
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	wrong?
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	 no thats fine
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	so still same
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	 but you might need to do the same for your php files
2008-01-29T00:06:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	hmm. so this is a big problem. coz i am creating them now and testing under localhost
2008-01-29T00:06:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	no, its little
2008-01-29T00:06:00.000Z	bod_	fatih	which ever program your using to make them, load the program with sudo,. eg sudo gedit
2008-01-29T00:07:00.000Z	fatih	bod_	ahh i forgot this totally
