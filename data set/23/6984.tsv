2005-11-06T14:35:00.000Z	dcatdemon		I think you need to lower your resolution. Check this page (http://linux.toshiba-dme.co.jp/linux/eng/pc/tecraM1_report.htm) for more info.
2005-11-06T14:35:00.000Z	_cosonic		its on 800X600
2005-11-06T14:35:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	sorry sorry, the COLORS... not the resolution. :).
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	_cosonic	dcatdemon	and how is that done?
2005-11-06T14:40:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	ok,  I only know the command line way, but if anyone knows how to do using ui that'll be good.  log on as root, change dir to /etc/X11, use any editor to open xorg.conf...
2005-11-06T14:41:00.000Z	_cosonic		problem is i hardly see anything
2005-11-06T14:42:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	needs to go to command mode... type CTRL-ALT-F1.
2005-11-06T14:42:00.000Z	_cosonic		ok
2005-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	_cosonic		and i login as root`
2005-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	dcatdemon		log on as root there, and go to /etc/X11 and edit xorg.conf. MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP the file first.
2005-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	_cosonic		but i dont know what the passwd is
2005-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	_cosonic		i dont think i have a psswd
2005-11-06T14:44:00.000Z	dcatdemon		ok, bob2's right. don't log on as root, log on as your normal user...
2005-11-06T14:45:00.000Z	dcatdemon		 tiglionabbit: _cosonic cannot see anything in X :)... but yes, you are right, should log on as user, sudo .
2005-11-06T14:45:00.000Z	_cosonic		ok im in as user now
2005-11-06T14:49:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	and go to /etc/X11 and edit xorg.conf using your favourite editor, you can try "pico /etc/X11/xorg.conf". MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP the file first by making a copy of it. (cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak).
2005-11-06T14:50:00.000Z	_cosonic	dcatdemon	what do i edit exactly in the file?
2005-11-06T14:50:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	locate the Section "Screen" section and change the DefaultDepth to 16.
2005-11-06T14:51:00.000Z	dcatdemon	_cosonic	sorry, I'm not a fast typer. :(.
