2007-06-25T11:48:00.000Z	jl		hi everybody!
2007-06-25T11:50:00.000Z	jl		hi ShackJack, do i know you?
2007-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	jl		does somebody knows if the intel 915 graphics card is fully supported in ubuntu?
2007-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	i think so. im using the i810
2007-06-25T11:53:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	but glx version reports to be 1.2 not 1.3
2007-06-25T11:54:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	what driver are you using in xorg?
2007-06-25T11:55:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	i'm using the i810 driver
2007-06-25T11:55:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	what i ended up having to do was to force it to use the resolution. i use 1280x768, and it wouldn't support it. i had to delete / coment out the other ones
2007-06-25T11:56:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	it then worked for me after that
2007-06-25T11:57:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	i'm using the same resolution, what version of glx do you have?
2007-06-25T11:58:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	how do i find the version?
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	go to the terminal glxinfo and you will see the line "glx version:"
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	version is 1.2
2007-06-25T12:01:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	is the 1280x768 the only resolution in your xorg? for all the lines?
2007-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	yes but in different depth modes
2007-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	for the depths ,you want each one to be only 1280x768
2007-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	you may also have to do a modline
2007-06-25T12:05:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	the depth is ok is working at 24, the only problem that i have is the glx version thats why i don't have fully 3d support
2007-06-25T12:06:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	can you run glxgears?
2007-06-25T12:07:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	yes i can, its works at 450-550 fps, what about you?
2007-06-25T12:09:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	i get about 520 fps
2007-06-25T12:10:00.000Z	ronzo	jl	so you should be able to run it. i havne't seen it any higher than that
2007-06-25T12:12:00.000Z	jl	ronzo	in other graphics cards it is higher than that
