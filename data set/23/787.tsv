2011-02-05T19:45:00.000Z	lehel_		why i cannot copy in file system it says access denied
2011-02-05T19:46:00.000Z	lehel_		i have permission when i logged in it asked the password and gave it
2011-02-05T19:47:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	ONly folders where you have permissions to write as normal user is /home/yourname and /tmp
2011-02-05T19:48:00.000Z	lehel_		and how can i set so i can copy is usr
2011-02-05T19:49:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	You would have to start nautilus with sudo like 'gksudo natilus' (filemanager) or 'sudo cp yourfile /usr/bin' in a console
2011-02-05T19:49:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	nautilus not natilus ;)
2011-02-05T19:50:00.000Z	lehel_		i want to copy azureus2.jar in /usr/share/java
2011-02-05T19:51:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	'sudo cp azureus2.jar /usr/share/java'
2011-02-05T19:52:00.000Z	lehel_	minimec	i'm relatively new to ubuntu, i wrote in terminal and it says no such file
2011-02-05T19:52:00.000Z	lehel_		the file is on desktop
2011-02-05T19:54:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	Well first, you have to cd into the directory, where the file is located. like 'cd Downloads'
2011-02-05T19:57:00.000Z	lehel_	minimec	could you please guide me step by step
2011-02-05T20:00:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	in what folder did you put the azureus2 file first.
2011-02-05T20:02:00.000Z	lehel_		this is what i want to do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=134958, i downloaded thetar.bz2 file on desktop
2011-02-05T20:02:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	... and why would you want to install azureus manually. sudo apt-get install azureus?
2011-02-05T20:03:00.000Z	lehel_		the file i want to copy is in folder vuze, on desktop
2011-02-05T20:03:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	Your link is a thread dating 2006 ;)
2011-02-05T20:03:00.000Z	lehel_		cause i cannot set the port in vuze that is on ubuntu repository higher then 49000 ,
2011-02-05T20:04:00.000Z	lehel_		and if i set under 49000 is blocked
2011-02-05T20:05:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	what would that have to do with azureus? This would rather be a firewall thing I guess.
2011-02-05T20:05:00.000Z	lehel_		sorry this is what i want http://forum.vuze.com/thread.jspa?messageID=230356
2011-02-05T20:06:00.000Z	lehel_		i messed the links earlier
2011-02-05T20:06:00.000Z	minimec	lehel_	BluesKaj: I would also consider deluge. It's a good tool.
