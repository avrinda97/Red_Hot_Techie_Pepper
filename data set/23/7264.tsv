2006-08-23T05:50:00.000Z	Noah0504		Okay, I'm sure this question has been asked a million times today, but has the broken xserver update been pulled?
2006-08-23T05:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	a newer (fixed) version is out
2006-08-25T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	k7
2006-08-25T16:31:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	I thought so.  Will I notice any real difference?
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	why would you want a BTclient that supports rss feeds? why not a rss reader and a btclient?
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Well, I suppose I can go that route.  I was just looking to combine the two.  Revision3 now offers Torrent feeds.  I thought it would make it easier to download the shows I watch on a regular basis.
2006-10-11T12:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	shrug.  I'm not a torrent person.  Anyway, if you want lightweight torrent clients, there are some built in, with a simple gtk frontend, a curses frontend, and a headless one, at that.  btdownload[tab] [tab]  will show you those options
2006-10-11T12:46:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Thanks.
2006-10-11T12:52:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	As far as RSS readers go, which to you suggest?
2006-10-11T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	no idea
2006-10-11T12:52:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	haha, Thanks anyway.
2006-10-12T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	#ubuntu+1
2007-03-18T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	they both do it.
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	server will get you server kernel, and the lamp pre-install.  You may or may not want the server kernel.
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	Alt. CD has more hardware support
2007-03-18T14:33:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Ahh, okay.  I think the Alt. CD is the way I'll go.  I'm using Debian right now, but I'd like to get Ubuntu installed.  I've got a Compaq Presario 5222 with a 350MHz processor and and 64MB of RAM I'm trying to get up and running.
2007-03-28T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	You'll select the "server" install, instead of the "desktop" install, at the boot menu
2007-03-28T10:40:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Well, I mean, I don't really want the server kernel... I guess I can change it anyway later...
2007-03-28T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	the alt. CD doesn't have the server kernel on it
2007-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	not google desktop
2007-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Oh, why so?
2007-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Noah0504	it's not as feature rich as the native linux solutions.
2007-07-01T16:11:00.000Z	Noah0504	Flannel	Do you use either Beagle or Tracker?
