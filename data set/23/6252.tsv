2009-09-30T09:06:00.000Z	maxxist		Off-topic question for the channel.  What is the state of ubuntu and EXT4?  Anyone using it?  are the performance gains worth it?  I am asking because I know there was some problems with ext4 before.  btw I am on jaunty.
2009-09-30T09:06:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	xfs will get you everything ext4 does
2009-09-30T09:07:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	is xfs available in ubuntu installer?
2009-09-30T09:07:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	yes
2009-09-30T09:12:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	sorry new question.  xfs or zfs?
2009-09-30T09:12:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	i dont think zfs is a common option
2009-09-30T09:13:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	yeah i doesnt seem to be.  but looking at wikipedia says xfs is 64 bit.  and zfs is 128.  seems a few OS's are trying to implement.  even OSX...
2009-09-30T09:15:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	xfs has been a standard part of linux for 6+ years now and does pretty much everything ext4 brags about.. you still have to go out of your way to use zfs
2009-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	do you find xfs any more difficult to setup than ext3 ??  will I have to format my ext3 for xfs?  I find this to be a nice feature of ext4(no need to format)...
2009-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	no, you dont do anyhting different than just picking it from the menu
2009-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	 ty
2009-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	err. if you already HAVE ext3 system, yeah you'd have to format
2009-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	i thought you meant on an install
2009-09-30T09:18:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	do you think the original ext4 kernel stability problems in ubuntu have been fixed?
2009-09-30T09:19:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	i dont know, i dont like the way its so many years behind though, i prefer something more proven
2009-09-30T09:19:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	yet that still has the featurse i want
2009-09-30T09:19:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	agreed.
2009-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	xfs was made by SGI, who make high performance graphic systems for CGI effects in movies
2009-09-30T09:22:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	yeah i read that on wikipedia.
2009-09-30T09:22:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	are you switching or talking about a new install/?
2009-09-30T09:23:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	i am thinking about just switching.  there is pages that describe doing the conversion.  without formatting.
2009-09-30T09:23:00.000Z	kermit	maxxist	oh thast not worth it really
2009-09-30T09:24:00.000Z	maxxist	kermit	why not?  would it not achieve the same in the end?
