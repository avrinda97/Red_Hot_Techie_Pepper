2008-03-22T06:26:00.000Z	ed_ed		Hi all, I was wondering am I able to use my ubuntu network card driver for other linux distros i.e knoppix?
2008-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Maybe.
2008-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Did you compile the driver yourself?
2008-03-22T06:29:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	No I didn't, when I installed ubuntu, the driver was already there.
2008-03-22T06:29:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Well, your other distribution might also auto-detect it.  If not, if your network card is pretty common, there should be drivers available for it.
2008-03-22T06:32:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	Thats the thing, it didn't , and I've searched a fair bit for help with this and haven't had much luck, so I was going to try and use the ubuntu one. What would be the problem with that? Sorry, I'm kinda new to linux.
2008-03-22T06:33:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Well, Ubuntu is just particularly good at being user friendly.  There are other user-friendly distros out there: Try Suse or even Fedora
2008-03-22T06:33:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Who makes your card?
2008-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	piff		KDE beep sounds are horrible
2008-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	piff		cool
2008-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	Sorry, it is intel
2008-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	piff		no problem
2008-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Some distros are more user friendly than others.  If you want to use Noppix, you might have to do a bit more work.
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	piff		lol.  ;)
2008-03-22T06:43:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	Sorry again, ok what type of work would be involved? Like writting your own drivers and stuff?
2008-03-22T06:44:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	God no.  The worst case scenario for any sane person would be to find the most generic drivers for your chip and compile them yourself.
2008-03-22T06:44:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Most probably, though, you'll find a package of some sort.
2008-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	ed_ed		Oh ok, that sounds ok. Basically I'm looking to try out another distro, a bit more hands-on than ubuntu, if you know what I mean. Any recommendations?
2008-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	It really is down to taste.  Fedora is a very good place to start.  Good balance between ease-of-use and high configurability
2008-03-22T06:49:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	Oh ok, I'll look into that. Would slackware be too much of a jump?
2008-03-22T06:50:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	Depends how patient and how much of an aptitude for that kind of thing you have.   Fedora is a good step.  You can learn a great deal from it.
2008-03-22T06:51:00.000Z	ed_ed	piff	Ok cool, I'll try Fedora out. Thanks very much for your help, appreciate it.
2008-03-22T06:52:00.000Z	piff	ed_ed	No problem.  :)  Good luck.
