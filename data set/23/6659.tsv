2006-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1		8-)
2006-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	I was :) lazy me
2006-02-21T17:05:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	cant be done, wav is a non bitrate format, mp3 is bitrate based, so there is always a loss unless you go for insane bitrate
2006-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	oh. but can we keep the drop in audio quality negligibe (not heard in human ears)?
2006-02-21T17:07:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	yeah, probably best done on varbitrate or 192 oe 256
2006-02-21T17:08:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	ok. so how do you suggest converting wav to mp3, and to do it in various bitrates, so i can test what bitrate is optimal for my ears?
2006-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	beauty of var is it adjusts bitrate where needed and has an overall better quality
2006-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	that sounds nice. so Var it will be for me.
2006-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	what program should we use for wav to mp3 conversion?
2006-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	do one on var, and same song on 256, and compare :)
2006-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	I have not made mp3's on ubuntu/linux yet :) but someone suggested one earlier
2006-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	flac ? I dont know it
2006-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	check your application list
2006-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	there is one called SOund Converter there
2006-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	A simple sound converter application for the GNOME environment. It reads anything the GStreamer library can read, and writes WAV, FLAC, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis files.
2006-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	you on fixed ip ? or dhcp ?
2006-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	i'm not sure. why?
2006-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	woops soz
2006-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1	bart___	i thought you were adressing someone else.
2006-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	yup
2006-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	better find a better mp3 of that same thing :)
2006-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	bart___	bigfoot1	I use xmms here
