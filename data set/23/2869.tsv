2008-10-20T00:18:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm		sorry typo. hey why is ther no command line option to disable BLUETOOTH SUPPORT in the installer
2008-10-20T00:20:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	what 3 different versions exactly?
2008-10-20T00:19:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	I wouldn't be so sure this is a bluetooth issue.  Did you 'check the cd for defects'?  Did you try the alternate cd?
2008-10-20T00:19:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	i did. SAME RESULT!
2008-10-20T00:19:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	how would you describe the alternate cd in short
2008-10-20T00:20:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	i tried three different versions of the install cd, same result
2008-10-20T00:20:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	7.10 cd and dvd. and 8.10 cd
2008-10-20T00:21:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	the alternate cd is not the same as the desktop cd
2008-10-20T00:21:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	but it must be bluetooth issue since none of the above worked. no cd error.
2008-10-20T00:21:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	not necessarily.  Just because the last thing you see on your screen is "no bluetooth [OK]" doesn't mean it's a bluetooth issue
2008-10-20T00:22:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	what could it be????
2008-10-20T00:22:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	it sucks
2008-10-20T00:22:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	I don't know.  Try the alternate cd to see if it works
2008-10-20T00:23:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	can you give me the link to the new 8.10 alternate? cant find it
2008-10-20T00:23:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	check cdimage.ubuntu.com
2008-10-20T00:28:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	not sure, but did you see the guide on help.ubuntu.com?
2008-10-20T00:28:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	was trying to do it via the live cd, but cant but it
2008-10-20T00:28:00.000Z	mib_72oxjm	jrib	help on what?
2008-10-20T00:29:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	I think there are instructions there on installing to usb
2008-10-20T00:30:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	yes, that's on the page I linked you to
2008-10-20T00:31:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	unfortunately it seems like it just uses the live cd to copy it over to a usb.  maybe you can find something though
2008-10-20T00:39:00.000Z	jrib	mib_72oxjm	try #ubuntu-offtopic for those type of questions
