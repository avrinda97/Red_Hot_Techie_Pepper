2005-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	logical_mark		Hey is there an easy way to transfer all my settings to another Ubuntu installation?
2005-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	that can be done with the 'dpkg' command IIRC
2005-12-09T15:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	I can look it up, unless someone else knows right now
2005-12-09T15:55:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	Yeah that would be awesome if you could look it up for me. Or tell me where to go...
2005-12-09T15:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	K (this captures the existing apps installed; I don't believe it transfers other files (like config files) tho)
2005-12-09T15:57:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	I might be better off just doing it all over again in that case. It dosn't take to long with SPM
2005-12-09T15:59:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	I would think that in a linux enviroment, where it take significantly more time to get things setup the way you like, there would be such a "Files and Settings Transfer Wizard"
2005-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	I have 4 lines for you (I'll paste 2 + 2)
2005-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	dpkg --get-selections [pattern...] 
2005-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	dpkg --set-selections
2005-12-09T16:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	I think there may be ways to do everything you want; I just don't know what they are :-)
2005-12-09T16:01:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	What replaces "[pattern...] "
2005-12-09T16:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	not sure offhand - what do you think?
2005-12-09T16:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	easy enough to try a few tests
2005-12-09T16:02:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	I will look into it all. Thanks for the headstart!
2005-12-09T16:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	lemmee know how it goes :-)
2005-12-09T16:04:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	Yeah I will let you know how it goes. I won't try anything until tmwo though.
2006-01-27T12:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	there's gftp, which is adequate
2006-01-27T12:13:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	What do I type into console to upgrad to 5.10?
2006-01-27T12:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	logical_mark	there's a factoid for that IIRC
2006-01-27T12:14:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	how do I use factoids?
2006-01-27T12:28:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	I am very frustrated. Maybe you can help. gftp, the only ftp client people recomend for linux, does not transfer completely, if i tell it to move a directory that has directories under it, it will not go down into it...
2006-01-27T12:29:00.000Z	logical_mark	Xenguy	if that makes any sense. I will tell it to move the directory drupal, and it will take drupal and the files inside it, but if there are directories inside drupal it wont take them...
