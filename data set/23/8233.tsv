2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	gloin_		hey, I can't seem to find a deb package for rarutils... am I just doing something stupid?  (entirely possible)
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	gloin_		tools to create and extract .rar files
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	gloin_		?
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	that's the package
2004-11-24T15:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	stable == not changing  in this context
2004-11-24T15:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	just use the mozilla.org binary :)
2004-11-24T15:16:00.000Z	gloin_	thoreauputic	yeah, I just don't want to lose the integration that I have with the overall ubuntu system
2004-11-24T15:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	re. firefox installer - if you install it in your home dir and just link to it, then you can uninstall anytime and not affect the ubuntu packaging system
2004-11-24T15:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	it works - it's no lamer than compiling something :)
2004-11-24T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	grabbing single packages, on the other hand, is almost asking to break things
2004-11-24T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	good luck - compiling firefox is a nightmare
2004-11-29T07:55:00.000Z	gloin_	thoreauputic	counterintuitive name of that howto - i was just there
2004-11-29T07:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	read the bonobo bot URL :)
2004-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	gloin_	thoreauputic	the URL referenced does not show how to install current drivers, which are at 6629 - the deb package is 6111, which is deprecated and a LOT slower
2004-11-29T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	well, sorry I just invoked the bot - I don't know about nvidia drivers, sorry
2004-11-29T08:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	apt-cache search linux-headers
2004-11-29T09:15:00.000Z	gloin_	thoreauputic	I think he's referring to scoon
2004-11-29T10:23:00.000Z	gloin_	thoreauputic	sorry =] 
2004-11-29T10:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    maybe?
2004-11-29T12:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	when you don't want people to find out about your "trade secrets" <g>
2004-11-29T12:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	you could suggest the strategy to MS, for example: all their documents could be run through babelfish a couple of times...
2004-11-29T13:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	debian does it for backward compatibility with old hardware
2004-11-29T13:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gloin_	a good thing for people recycling old computers etc
