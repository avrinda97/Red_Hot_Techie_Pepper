2005-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	SanderD		Hi. How large should my swap partition be, having 1 GiB of memory?
2005-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	the default is fine
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	I'd like to make the partitions manually.. Would 512 KB be good?
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	MB? that's fine.
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	Yes, sorry, MB :-) Thanks
2005-09-10T11:51:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	of course, you can put any thing, any where
2005-09-10T11:52:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	How do I configure that? In /etc/fstab I think I can only choose one mount point per partition.
2005-09-10T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	of course
2005-09-10T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	you make /var a symlink to somewhere in /home
2005-09-10T11:54:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	Okay, thanks, I'll try it. Then I've only got one question left (I hope): Does the Ubuntu installer recognize /home/* folders, so that I can keep my files when re-installing?
2005-09-10T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	if you tell the partitioner to mount it on /home, yes
2005-09-10T11:55:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	So when I make a new user in the installer with the same name as in the old installation, I can use the same files?
2005-09-10T11:55:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	yes
2005-09-10T11:56:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	Okay, great. :-)
2005-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	as long as you read the upgrade noties, no
2005-10-13T15:24:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	beat whoever made the broken backup
2005-10-13T15:24:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	then copy the permissions from another ubuntu machine
2005-10-13T15:25:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	No, I don't do self-chastisement :-)
2005-10-13T15:26:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	second reply: Can't I just do chown sander /var or something?
2005-10-13T15:26:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	ha ha ha.
2005-10-13T15:26:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	the vast majority of things in /var are not owned by random users
2005-10-13T15:27:00.000Z	bob2	SanderD	most is root, but applications create various things under there owned by them
2005-10-13T15:28:00.000Z	SanderD	bob2	okay, thanks
