2009-11-16T20:09:00.000Z	DeeTah		i'm trying to run kubuntu-netbook and it the boot stops at "can not mount /dev/loop1 on /cow". how to figure out what might be wrong?
2009-11-16T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	did you MD5 test the ISO you used?
2009-11-16T20:10:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	nope. should I? :P
2009-11-16T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	yes, you have no idea if the data you have used is complete or error free without checking it
2009-11-16T20:11:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	oh well, i'll try it.
2009-11-16T20:13:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	just remembered that I actually used two iso images and both of them showed the error.
2009-11-16T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	check the files, if they are ok you may need some boot options to get righted
2009-11-16T20:19:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	yeah, the sums are right.
2009-11-16T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	good, use those before attempting to use the data
2009-11-16T20:19:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	what do you mean?
2009-11-16T20:20:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	I just figured out that the md5's are right, so it's not the case.
2009-11-16T20:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	using unchecked data may cause issues as bit errors in the right place will cause the system to go crazy, checking is essential to knowing you have a good file
2009-11-16T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	thats good, i'm just telling you why its a good idea to test
2009-11-16T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	any and all, bootoptions disable functionality in the kernel and system to make the system boot
2009-11-16T20:25:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	doesn't sound reasonable. hm, trying another approach - once the mount fails to run, I get into the initrd shell. any way to save/view whole dmesg from that point?
2009-11-16T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	dmesg | less
2009-11-16T20:25:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	less isn't there yet. more doesn't work.
2009-11-16T20:27:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	less isn't there yet. more doesn't work. any other ideas?
2009-11-16T20:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DeeTah	nano? more?
2009-11-16T20:28:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	nano, gonna see if it's there
2009-11-16T20:30:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	as I said, "more" doesn't work and there is no nano either.
2009-11-16T20:30:00.000Z	DeeTah	ActionParsnip1	oh, since the pendrive's a fat partition, I just could redirect the output.
