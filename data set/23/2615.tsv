2009-01-07T22:54:00.000Z	icqn		is nvidia 180 backported to intrepid? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/180.11-0ubuntu1~intrepid1, are there packages somewhere?
2009-01-07T22:55:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	I don't believe it is... I just installed Ubuntu and I got 173.82 which I believe is still the latest non beta nvidia driver
2009-01-07T22:56:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	what is this then https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/180.11-0ubuntu1~intrepid1 ?
2009-01-07T22:58:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	I haven't seen that but would recommend you check the nvidia website to see what the latest non-beta driver is.  Also I wouldn't worry much about updating unless you're having issues
2009-01-07T23:00:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	yes i am aware of it, that it is beta, but there are problems with title bars on nvidia card geforce 7,6 series (with compiz compositing manager)
2009-01-07T23:01:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	You'll probably have to do a manual install then per the instructions on the Nvidia site.  I do remember seeing them there but haven't tried it myself
2009-01-07T23:02:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	i do not really want to install it with every kernel update
2009-01-07T23:03:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	I sure understand that... but I doubt it's going to be included in the released version of Ubuntu as long as it's beta
2009-01-07T23:04:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	i hope it will be included somewhere as packages :-)
2009-01-07T23:04:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	yeah I was looking for it myself the other day just to try it out.  I didn't see it though
2009-01-07T23:05:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	I even checked out some other distros and they're all using 173.82 as well
2009-01-07T23:05:00.000Z	erica647		177.82 I mean
2009-01-07T23:05:00.000Z	erica647		sorry
2009-01-07T23:09:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	why have you checked that? do you have issues?
2009-01-07T23:09:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	I run Wine and some windows apps... was curious to see if there was any performance difference
2009-01-07T23:10:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	i only have found https://launchpad.net/~thomas-creutz/+archive for intrepid
2009-01-07T23:10:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	it seems to have positive replies https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-177/+bug/297543
2009-01-07T23:11:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	reading that
2009-01-07T23:11:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	at the ending
2009-01-07T23:13:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	wow there's a lot of comments out there concerning that driver
2009-01-07T23:14:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	Looks like it's only going to be released with Jaunty though
2009-01-07T23:15:00.000Z	erica647	icqn	If you have a spare machine to play with, you might want to download the jaunty beta just to see how it works
2009-01-07T23:15:00.000Z	icqn	erica647	it is too boring at the moment :-)
