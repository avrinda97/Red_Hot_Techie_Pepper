2009-06-29T19:56:00.000Z	boo_		i have a 8.x ubuntu server where the root password was maliciously changed, how do i reset it ?
2009-06-29T19:56:00.000Z	boo_		i cant log on to the server
2009-06-29T19:57:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	maybe you can boot with live cd and change the /etc/shadow file, but i dont know if it will work XD
2009-06-29T19:59:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	should be encrypted in /etc/shadows
2009-06-29T20:00:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	john the ripper is a password cracker, and you can get the file with a live cd, then mount hd and copy file
2009-06-29T20:01:00.000Z	boo_	Incarus	can you further explain please? it seems like it might work ?
2009-06-29T20:02:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	john the ripper can crack shadows file -> brute force, could be very slow, and you have to copy the shadows file

2009-06-29T20:03:00.000Z	boo_	Incarus	sorry for being slow, is that file there on the cd ?
2009-06-29T20:03:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	? XD, no, the shadows file is on the hd, in /etc/
2009-06-29T20:03:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	i mean brute force is slow ;-)
2009-06-29T20:05:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	are you in the live cd?
2009-06-29T20:06:00.000Z	Incarus	boo_	ok, mount hd and then cd to /mnt/XXX/etc/
