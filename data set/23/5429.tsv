2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		hey guys i am running a vnc server, but it keeps opening port 5901 display1, i want it to show 5900 display 0 anway to get it to work that way
2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		im using x11vnc
2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 you may want to double check the x11vnc docs.   I recall it taking a little more work thenjust running it.
2008-02-21T04:34:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	it used to work fine
2008-02-29T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 use a lighter desktop, reduce the # of colors of the display. lower the res.
2008-02-29T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 disable wallpaper and any extra effects.
2008-02-29T19:33:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	i am already runningi at the lowest
2008-02-29T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 for a windows vnc server - i tend to use 'ultravnc' it may have more tweaks.
2008-02-29T19:35:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	even when running on my home network it runs the same as how it runs here at work
2008-02-29T19:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 vnc can be sluggish. I agree
2008-02-29T19:38:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	any better alternatives than vnc?
2008-02-29T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 I only use vnc. freenx i hear works great for linux to linux.. but i dont do that.
2008-02-29T19:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 i use the ultravnc server for windows. It  may have some addational speed up tweaks.
2008-02-29T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 ultravnc, vnc4server, theres proberly a dozen vnc variants out.
2008-02-29T19:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 ive found x11vnc to be VERY sluggish compared to the other 'vncservers'
2008-02-29T19:44:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	yeah but its the only thing i can run that i KNOW of that runs my CURRENT display :0
2008-02-29T19:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 i dont share current displays that makes it MUCH more sluggish also. :)
2008-02-29T19:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 i keep my torrent/im/whatever in a nice littke session thats using jwm, for me to remote access
2008-02-29T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 i find it decently quick when doing it that way.
2008-02-29T19:45:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Dr_willis	jwm?
2008-02-29T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 as i suggested earlier - use a very light window manager.
2008-02-29T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 one has to wonder how they get sound...
2008-02-29T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ForzaPalermo	 You could alwasys run xming, and have the x apps appear locally.
