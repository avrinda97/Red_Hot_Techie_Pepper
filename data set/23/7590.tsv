2005-08-13T06:38:00.000Z	vladuz976		does anybody know what zlib.h is?
2005-08-13T06:39:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	it's in zlib1g-dev if you want it. It's the development package for zlib.
2005-09-27T09:55:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	make sure you haven't additional updates pending: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
2005-09-27T09:57:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	where can i find info on setting my sources.list for backports?
2005-09-27T09:57:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	there's definitely info on the forum ; the ubotu bot has some info, too, but I don't know the key
2005-10-03T11:04:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	no
2005-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	sudo aptitude install linux-686
2005-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	that's it? there is so many packages like linux-image-686 the headers
2005-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	that's it.
2005-10-14T10:55:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	so what are the other packages for then
2005-10-14T10:55:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	they're metapackages that pull in the necessary dependencies to ensure smooth {down,up}grades
2005-10-14T10:57:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	so if i install the linux-686 package it will take care of the rest? then synaptic or apt should show me the dependencies that will be installed with it,right?
2005-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	did you compile them manually?
2005-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	no used the package from the repo
2005-10-14T11:05:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	thanks
2005-10-14T11:06:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	but there is no k7 thing of the linux-686 ?
2005-10-14T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	linux-k7?
2005-10-14T11:08:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	sorry, i don't exactly know what k7 stands for i just thought that is for the amd i686 processors
2005-10-14T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	/proc/cpuinfo contains relevant information
2005-10-14T11:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	thanks for the hint, but /proc/cpuinfo doesn't really help me figure out what k7 stands for
2005-10-14T11:12:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	it helps you know whether you need a k7 kernel
2005-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	vladuz976	crimsun	installed the linux-k7 and the stuff that came withit, rebooted, and seems to work just fine
2006-04-05T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	vladuz976	there are a variety of scripts that do that; search the Web
