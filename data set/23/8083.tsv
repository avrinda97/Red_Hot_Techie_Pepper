2005-08-07T06:36:00.000Z	Gorth		MR LINUX DIDN'T LET ME SET A ROOT PASSWORD DURING SETUP :(
2005-08-07T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	So?
2005-08-07T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Why do you thjink you need one?
2005-08-07T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	The idea is you log in as normal user and use 'sudo'.
2005-08-07T06:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	'sudo -s' "your password" - voila, root shell.
2005-08-07T06:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	'sudo -s' "your password" - voila, root shell.
2005-08-07T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Step one is realising you have no need for a root shell.
2005-08-07T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Think outside the box, c'mon.. you can do it.
2005-08-07T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	yeah, sudo is great for that.
2005-08-07T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	And you only need your _own_ password.
2005-08-07T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	You'll be used to it after a day, I promise :-)
2005-08-07T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	YOUR password
2005-08-07T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Not a root password
2005-08-07T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	basically, anything needing to run as root, put sudo in front of it.
2005-08-07T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	if you need a shell, 'sudo -s'
2005-08-07T06:45:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	No, ONLY users in the 'admin' group.
2005-08-07T06:45:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Which by default is ONLY the user you added during install.
2005-08-07T06:45:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	You can fiddle with the config file and say add root access for specific users for only specific commands etc. Very nice.
2005-08-07T09:45:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	gcc is not installed by default; most suers have no need for it.
2005-08-07T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	What are you compiling?
2005-08-07T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	Why?
2005-08-07T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Gorth	apt-get install xmms
