2012-10-12T16:37:00.000Z	ThothCastel		why isn't my wireless not working on ubuntu 12.04 - LAPTOP INSPIRON 1525
2012-10-12T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	which wifi chip?
2012-10-12T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	if you run:  dmesg | grep -i firm     do you see messages about missing firmware?
2012-10-12T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	try using apt-get to install it
2012-10-12T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	not running software centre correctly
2012-10-12T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	updates currently running
2012-10-12T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	sudo apt-get install  b43-fwcutter
2012-10-12T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	not: sudo apt-get b43-fwcutter     you need to give apt-get the operation to do with the package (install, uninstall, reinstall etc)
2012-10-12T17:34:00.000Z	ThothCastel	ActionParsnip	I see... thanks..  I am trying to locate the usb drive throuth the terminal to run the package
2012-10-12T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	is the system a laptop?
2012-10-12T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	then why not move the system close to the router and use a wired connection. Waaay easier
2012-10-12T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	you can also get fully updated too
2012-10-12T17:40:00.000Z	ThothCastel	ActionParsnip	ok, I tryed installing the package b43-fwcutter from the media and it gives me this error:
2012-10-12T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	did you run:  sudo apt-get update     first
2012-10-12T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	you don't need to change directory, apt-get knows where the packages are once you run: sudo apt-get update
2012-10-12T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	I suggest you use the wired connection, its a tonne easier
2012-10-12T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	sure, why do you not have acces to your own router?
2012-10-12T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	what if you need to power it off and on, do you call the ISP?
2012-10-12T17:56:00.000Z	ThothCastel	ActionParsnip	because I share the house with other people and the router is located in somebody else's room...   there is no phone plug in my room  :S
2012-10-12T17:57:00.000Z	ThothCastel	ActionParsnip	I am able to login to the router through my LAN
2012-10-12T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	its a lot easier, you could try transfering deb files, could get messy
2012-10-12T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	I suggest you use http://packages.ubuntu.com
2012-10-20T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThothCastel	echo b43 | sudo tee -a /etc/modules > /dev/null
