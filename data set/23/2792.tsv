2008-11-09T19:36:00.000Z	blue112		I don't know anything about ssh-1, that's why i'm asking for help
2008-11-09T19:38:00.000Z	blue112		!paste
2008-11-09T19:40:00.000Z	blue112		Can I get some help with ssh connection ? This is the connection log : http://paste.ubuntu.com/69646/
2008-11-09T19:41:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	can you paste with ssh -vv this time? that will be more verbose
2008-11-09T19:41:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	It's the ssh -vvv :)
2008-11-09T19:42:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	is this the server log or client?
2008-11-09T19:42:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	Client. I can't access to server
2008-11-09T19:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	are you using password auth or public key
2008-11-09T19:43:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	I want to use password auth.
2008-11-09T19:44:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	you can use that only if the server allows it
2008-11-09T19:45:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	Server admin gives me a password, so I think that it allows it... But maybe i'm asking wrong ?
2008-11-09T19:45:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	what command are you using to connect?
2008-11-09T19:45:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	ssh -vv servrl -1
2008-11-09T19:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	can you do a ssh -vv user@server-ip-address-or-hostname ?
2008-11-09T19:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	pastebin the output of that please
2008-11-09T19:47:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/69652/
2008-11-09T19:50:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	?
2008-11-09T19:50:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	that isnt making sense. your connection attempt isnt going farther than the key exchange; has this worked before?
2008-11-09T19:51:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	It works, but not for me ^^'
2008-11-09T19:52:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	before?
2008-11-09T19:52:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	before it doesn't xD
2008-11-09T19:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi_	blue112	im all confused. do this and try again.. run ssh-keygen to generate your keys. delete known_hosts
2008-11-09T19:54:00.000Z	blue112	outbackwifi_	It doesn't ask me to add it to the knows hosts :/
