2006-09-21T05:39:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN		HELP!!! I chowned a folder as user 'public' , group 'public', then thru the GUI, added my normal user into the 'public' group, when I try to FTP in as this normal user and make a folder or move data in the folder, I get an error, but when I try with the 'public' account everything works fine, how do I make normal user have access to stuff 'public' owns
2006-09-21T05:40:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN		...and how can i make it so normal user, can move data and create new directories in the FTP ?
2006-09-21T05:40:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN		TIA
2006-09-21T05:42:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	add the users to the group, and chown it to that group, ftpusers or whatever.  And, your name is bloody hard to nick complete
2006-09-21T05:45:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	is there a way via terminal to check that certain users are in a certain group? to make sure I didn't mess it up?
2006-09-21T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	'groups'
2006-09-21T05:48:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	ok i did: 'chown ftp:ftp /mnt/hdb1' then did 'groups normaluser' which returned the group 'ftp'
2006-09-21T05:48:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	make sure it's writable by the group too
2006-09-21T05:48:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	how do I go about doing that?
2006-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	ls -l
2006-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	that's not writable by the group, you'll want to change that ;)  (user group everyone)
2006-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	rwx read write execute, you'll notice your second one is r-x which means no writing, you'll want to add that
2006-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	im really new to linux.... how do i do that... lol
2006-09-21T05:51:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	chmod
2006-09-21T05:51:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	ok 1 sec
2006-09-21T05:51:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	sudo chmod o+w file
2006-09-21T05:54:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	how do I apply chmod to an entire folder and everything inside of it? 'chmod o+w /mnt/hdb1 ' ?
2006-09-21T05:54:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	hdb1?  You don't want to do that.
2006-09-21T05:54:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	hehehe i don't!? lol
2006-09-21T05:57:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	ok i think that did the trick
2006-09-21T05:57:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	if it's on an entire mountpoint, you probably want to use the umask in the fstab, instead of chmod/chown
2006-09-21T05:58:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	Flannel	i didn't even think of that!
2007-02-21T07:26:00.000Z	Flannel	L0cKd0wN	no.  #ubuntu-effects is the place to assume that ;)  most people here probably don't.
