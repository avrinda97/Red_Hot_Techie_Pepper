2011-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	what is your problem?
2011-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	iggy	EGuinn	I'm trying to fix a broken icon in my launch bar
2011-05-09T12:41:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	what is wrong with it?
2011-05-09T12:41:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	so you worked Unity how it said to, and just pinned it to the sidebar when it was running?
2011-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	iggy	EGuinn	yep
2011-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	And does it show the icon?
2011-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	and the icon does not work.
2011-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	You, my friend, have a weird problem.
2011-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	Have you tried drag-drop?
2011-05-09T12:43:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	Dang, man. That is an odd problem.
2011-05-09T12:43:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	I could not tell you man, sorry.
2011-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	You can log in as default Gnome desktop...
2011-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	but again, you said without logging out....
2011-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	I think you are done for until they put out a new Unity... Sorry man.
2011-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	I am guessing you went through all the steps of restarting, etc?
2011-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	I would google that Unity --restart thing.
2011-05-09T12:46:00.000Z	EGuinn	iggy	I just did a search on it -- it seems that all sorts of people are having problems with it...
2011-05-09T12:49:00.000Z	iggy	EGuinn	yeah.. I've learned that many people are super pissed with it being part of the new ubuntu
