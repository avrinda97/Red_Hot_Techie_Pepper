2006-06-06T15:56:00.000Z	AJ004		is there a screensaver in ubuntu which shows a picture of an actual satellite and cloud formations?
2006-06-06T15:56:00.000Z	AJ004		i looked at the cosmos dataset but it didnt have one with a picture of an actual satellite
2006-06-06T15:57:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	there's a screensaver in there that you can tell to show your own choice of picture, I've forggent exactly which one it is though
2006-06-06T15:58:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	i was wondering if someone put a screenshot there
2006-06-13T05:56:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	 You need the 3d drivers for ati that are part of easyubuntu
2006-06-13T05:56:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	 With those google earth and ATI are fine
2006-06-13T05:56:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	no, I need nvidia, which I have :)
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	that is a wishful thing, but do you realize how much that might cost!!
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	it's under internet in the menu
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	 For a company like google, not much
2006-06-13T06:02:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	if you didn't request it during the install, use alacarte to modify the menu
2006-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	more often than not, yes
2006-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	it says command not found
2006-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	what is the file, where is it, and is it executable? (the big three questions)
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	try ~/google-earth/googleearth
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	bingo!
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	ok now how do i install an icon for this
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	and just a note: three lines of paste is the max :)
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	i want to add it in the internet section
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	Applications->Alacarte , add a menu entry with that
2006-06-13T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	AJ004	try killall gnome-panel first
2006-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	bingo
2006-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	AJ004	nickrud	thanks :) that solved everything
