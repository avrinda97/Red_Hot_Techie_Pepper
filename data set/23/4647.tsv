2008-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh		yea
2008-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh		that'll break things
2008-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh		like sudo
2008-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh		and freakin EVERYTHING
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		damnit
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		this isn't my machine
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		and i'm making linux look really bad because nothing works
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		hrm
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	arrrghhh	I did that once too
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		well that's not such a big deal
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh		it's backing up all the crap on it, i have nothing to back it up to
2008-01-25T09:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	arrrghhh	After 6 hours I managed to get networking and sudo, iirc
2008-01-25T09:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh		and /home is a separate partition, but i'm betting the permissions are screwed there as well
2008-01-25T09:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	arrrghhh	/home is easier to fix
2008-01-25T09:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Amaranth	so do you think i should reinstall without wiping /home?
2008-01-25T09:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	arrrghhh	yeah
2008-01-25T09:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh		would that be enough i wonder...
2008-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh		i still get an error that others shouldn't have write permissions to $HOME and i should chmod that dir to 644
2008-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh		and networking seems to be broken
2008-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh		ugh
2008-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh		yea i guess at this point a reinstall is the only option
2008-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	arrrghhh	/home is easier to fix though, you can mostly just make all dirs 755 and all files 644
2008-01-25T09:10:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Amaranth	is there an easy command to do tha twith?
