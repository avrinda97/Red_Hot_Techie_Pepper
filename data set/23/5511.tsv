2007-08-26T11:22:00.000Z	Meroigo		hm.. what should I do if the system totally freezes? When I logged out from an user account everything freezed on the screen and the keyboard and mouse stopped working. I had to do a hard shutdown. ;o
2007-08-26T11:23:00.000Z	Meroigo		;o
2007-08-26T11:23:00.000Z	Meroigo		Isn't shh some kind of remote controlling protocol? :P
2007-08-26T11:24:00.000Z	Meroigo		it's too much of an hassle to start using other computers...
2007-08-26T11:24:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	ssh you mean?
2007-08-26T11:25:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	With SSH, you can, for example, access another computer (or your own) over an encrypted channel, but just follow the given link, I'm sure its explained a lot better there..
2007-08-26T11:28:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	A linux freeze? Thats like.. the only time I saw that was when I was heavily screwing around with X.. For the rest, whatever I do with the compu, it wont freeze..
2007-08-26T11:29:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	It usually is yeah..
2007-08-26T11:29:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	If you got an ATI card, it also may be drivers.. ATI is nutoriously bad with linux drivers.. Just check you got the correct driver
2007-08-26T11:29:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	There are 2 different ones.. the ATI one and the open source one
2007-08-26T11:29:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	Dunno which is better
2007-08-26T11:30:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	you mean beryl or compiz?
2007-08-26T11:30:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	Im not the expert on those, but those 2 in combination with ATI ....  I know th ati drivers are bad, let me kee pit at that, but someone correct me if Im wrong on that please
2007-08-26T11:31:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	that would be beryl or compiz yeah.. and Id guess you are using open source drivers then.. you may wish to try the ATI binary drivers..
2007-08-26T11:32:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	If your graphics card stops responding, you would not see anything on your screen actually :) But like I said, ATI drivers for linux suck
2007-08-26T11:33:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	They are, for quality, not even close to the linux drivers..
2007-08-26T11:33:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	And what I heard, even on windows the ati drivers are bad.. :)
2007-08-26T11:34:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	Sounds like a marketing message to me :) I guess what they would really have to say is that your card got too hot for example...
2007-08-26T11:36:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	could be, but then again, it could also be the driver software *@#($ up...
2007-08-26T11:37:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	Linux will kick ass and conquer windows when: A) there are good graphics drivers for it, B) office formats are open so you can always use open office without problem and C) all games will be written with linux in mind as well
2007-08-26T11:40:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	When using linux, currently NVidia is the way to go yeah
2007-08-26T11:40:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	I have an nvidia card, and NO problems at all
2007-08-26T11:43:00.000Z	phoenixz	Meroigo	for those things? yeah.. no prob..  I have used google earth on a standard PCI (NOT PCI express!) nvidia GForce 4.. :)
