2012-09-20T05:49:00.000Z	PatrickJameson		hey all, I'm trying to edit my xorg config to change my monitor setup to shut off my laptop screen if an external monitor is attached.
2012-09-20T05:49:00.000Z	PatrickJameson		it seems to work when I'm on the log in screen, but returns back to the original state when I log in
2012-09-20T05:49:00.000Z	PatrickJameson		anyone know what could be happening?
2012-09-20T05:50:00.000Z	PatrickJameson		on single user?
2012-09-20T05:52:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Recent Ubuntu versions don't really use Xorg.conf. They use different setups which to be honest I'm not 100% familiar with. But you *COULD* use some conditional xrandr settings in your ~/.profile to achieve the effect you're after.
2012-09-20T05:54:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	oh interesting
2012-09-20T05:54:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Godspeed, young paduwan!
2012-09-20T06:10:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	osnap that will work with xrandr -s (0|1) with my metamodes configured in my xorg config
2012-09-20T06:10:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	:D  Figured it would.
2012-09-20T06:11:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	the screen going black is an advanced power control setting.
2012-09-20T06:13:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	[ "$(xrandr | grep '^Screen 1') != "" ]
2012-09-20T06:13:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	[ "$(xrandr | grep '^Screen 1')" != "" ] rather
2012-09-20T06:13:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	yup, I figured that would be an option
2012-09-20T06:14:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Might possibly be a screensaver. You wouldn't by any chance be using LXDE?
2012-09-20T06:16:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	"xset dpms force off" <-- seen that before?
2012-09-20T06:17:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	erm, don't believe so. where would I have?
2012-09-20T06:17:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Try running it, just for shits and grins.
2012-09-20T06:18:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	didn't work.
2012-09-20T06:18:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Was worth a shot.
2012-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	lololo
2012-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	Okay?
2012-09-20T06:23:00.000Z	Logos01	PatrickJameson	More likely more like a limitation than a feature.
2012-09-20T06:26:00.000Z	PatrickJameson	Logos01	thanks for your help
