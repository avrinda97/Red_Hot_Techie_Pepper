2010-04-07T03:09:00.000Z	el_yiyo		hi there
2010-04-07T03:10:00.000Z	el_yiyo		where can I find a tutorial/summary of Linux commands?
2010-04-07T03:11:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 you should be able to google     "bash commands"
2010-04-07T03:11:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 no problem
2010-04-07T03:13:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 however ...although that will give you some information... the combinations of commands are best learned by hanging out in this and other channels like it  ...such as ##linus  to see which and how the commands are combined
2010-04-07T03:23:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 try      ps aux | less
2010-04-07T03:24:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 sorry  try     ps  -A
2010-04-07T03:27:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 did those work for you?
2010-04-07T03:28:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 also you can use    the command      top      and better yet    install htop  for more complete / with options    top
2010-04-07T03:28:00.000Z	el_yiyo	coz_	IsoLnCHiP, igoryonya those worked fine
2010-04-07T03:29:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 well sort of yes... if you    sudo apt-get install  htop   and run  htop  you should have more options available
2010-04-07T03:31:00.000Z	el_yiyo	coz_	what is the most useful info I can get out of htop?
2010-04-07T03:33:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 yeah... well if you look at htop you have nice live readout of running processes along with options at the bottom of the screen for keybindings etc...also if you type    man  htop  you will find how to use the keybindings for it
2010-04-07T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 your keybord
2010-04-07T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 in a terminal type    man  htop  and you will see options available  and keep hitting space bar to read on
2010-04-07T03:35:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 yes
2010-04-07T03:41:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	  click the Add button   name = xchat    command= xchat
2010-04-07T03:42:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 if you dont know the command to start an application  you could go to system/preferences/main menu  find the application  click it and go to properties   the command to open the application should be listed there  disregarding any % sign  generally
2010-04-07T03:45:00.000Z	el_yiyo	coz_	cool
2010-04-07T03:46:00.000Z	el_yiyo	coz_	in Linux, all applications are referenced by only the command that runs them? I mean, I do not ever need to know the path to the "executable" file?
2010-04-07T03:48:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 no ..in general just the command
2010-04-07T03:50:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 I meant  "correct"  just the command is , in general... all you need to execute an application
2010-04-07T03:55:00.000Z	coz_	el_yiyo	 no problem
