2006-12-19T10:21:00.000Z	tuxub		what are the names of the kernels in edgy? i can't find a SMP kernel for my AMD 2x CPU :(
2006-12-19T10:23:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	I think the default kernel has SMP support
2006-12-19T10:23:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+  only one...
2006-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	do cat /proc/cpuinfo | less and see how many processors it shows
2006-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	already did that : one
2006-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	are you running dapper or edgy?
2006-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	edgy (dist-upgraded from dapper)
2006-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	did you have smp support in dapper?
2006-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	i installed this linux-k7-smp and got 2 cpus... but no grahpics because my nvidia driver is for the edgy kernel
2006-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	yes...
2006-12-19T10:26:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	yeah I think you need to switch to the generic edgy kernel
2006-12-19T10:26:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	what is its name?
2006-12-19T10:27:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	http://www.mathbin.net/2536
2006-12-19T10:27:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	err
2006-12-19T10:27:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic
2006-12-19T10:28:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	already installed... i think its the one I have installed Linux maia 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Tue Dec 5 22:26:18 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
2006-12-19T10:29:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	well the generic kernel does have smp support, you just need to make it the default kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-12-19T10:29:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	i think its the dapper 2 edgy upgrade fault... (passed from 3/4 failure to 4/4 failure) :(
2006-12-19T10:29:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	Its the running kernel (i ran uname -a)
2006-12-19T10:30:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	and it only shows one cpu in /proc/cpuinfo?
2006-12-19T10:31:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	yes
2006-12-19T10:33:00.000Z	SeamusLP	tuxub	I'm not sure what the deal is, sorry
2006-12-19T10:34:00.000Z	tuxub	SeamusLP	thanks anyway
