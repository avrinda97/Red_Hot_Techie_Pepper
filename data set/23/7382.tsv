2005-10-31T15:19:00.000Z	budgester	iiiears	and what application are you using to interface with the card ?
2005-10-31T15:19:00.000Z	iiiears	budgester	- gnomeradio, radio and tvtime.
2005-10-31T15:21:00.000Z	iiiears	budgester	- How is radio  added to /dev    so it becomes /dev/radio  ?
2005-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	budgester	iiiears	and you got it set to use v4l drivers ?
2005-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	iiiears	budgester	- yes -  think so how can i make sure?
2005-10-31T15:23:00.000Z	budgester	iiiears	to be honest, its not really my field
