2012-02-21T21:01:00.000Z	gr33n7007h		just bought an alienware m11x with nvidia 540m graphics installed ubuntu 10.04 download nvidia driver binary but won't let you run the binery in X how do get to text only mode??
2012-02-21T21:02:00.000Z	gr33n7007h		ctrl + Alt + F1 is not working for some strange reason
2012-02-21T21:02:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	manually installing nvidia.com's driver is a bad idea (but "might" be required) - ctrl+alt+f1 then "sudo service gdm stop"
2012-02-21T21:03:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	is there any other way than Ctrl +alt +f1 ?
2012-02-21T21:04:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	if you just ran "sudo service gdm stop" from the gui it will stop and spit you out at a VT (ctrl+alt+f1) - but if that doesn't work, you've got a problem
2012-02-21T21:04:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	ok ill try now thanks! ;)
2012-02-21T21:06:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	unrecognized service ?
2012-02-21T21:06:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	you did say 10.04 right?
2012-02-21T21:06:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	1 sec i'll just check

2012-02-21T21:08:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	did you install using a mini cd or something?  "sudo service gdm stop" is what you are running?
2012-02-21T21:09:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	standard dvd what could be the problem?
2012-02-21T21:10:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	gdm not showing in service --status-all
2012-02-21T21:10:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	are you using KDE (KDM) perhaps?
2012-02-21T21:10:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	no gnome
2012-02-21T21:11:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	sorry i don't know what your issue (with *DM is).  Guess i can't help, Good luck.
2012-02-21T21:12:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	ok thanks for your help
2012-02-21T21:39:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	how do you fill a flash drive full off random data ??
2012-02-21T21:40:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	not 100% sure actually, "cat /dev/random > /dev/USBDEVICE" might work?
2012-02-21T21:41:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	cheers i'll try that way ;)
2012-02-21T21:41:00.000Z	zykotic10	gr33n7007h	that's just a guess remember, and be careful to get the device correct
2012-02-21T21:42:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	zykotic10	ok thanks
