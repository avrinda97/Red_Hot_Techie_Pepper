2008-02-15T02:03:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	If you can, you should upgrade to 6.06.
2008-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	Getting xubuntu is as easy as installing xubuntu-desktop, but since you're using an old version (that isn't supported anymore), you'll need to change to a working repository
2008-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	If you haven't installed yet, you ought to download a new version.  And you should obviously get a xubuntu CD
2008-02-15T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	You just need to download/burn a xubuntu CD
2008-02-15T02:09:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install has instructions (the four at the top) just make sure you get a xubuntu iso
2008-02-15T02:10:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	Once you install xubuntu overtop of ubuntu, Ubuntu will disappear (of course, Xubuntu is still Ubuntu, but thats not what you mean)
2008-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	sudo apt-get install perl
2008-04-26T21:57:00.000Z	sanozuke	Flannel	but inst at /urs/perl
2008-04-26T21:58:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	Whats wrong wth that?
2008-04-26T22:02:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	perl works fine from /usr/bin, what problems are you having?
2008-04-26T22:03:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	You need to use /usr/bin/perl in your shebang
2008-04-26T22:04:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	Whats the first line of your perl script?
2008-04-26T22:07:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	type 'which perl' what does it give you?
2008-04-26T22:09:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	What does the 'which perl' command give you?
2008-04-26T22:10:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	what does 'which perl' return?
2008-04-26T22:11:00.000Z	Flannel	sanozuke	alright, its as easy as that command to tell you where perl is.
