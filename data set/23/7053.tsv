2005-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	can I help xenex too?
2005-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	sure.
2005-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	xenex probably the card is not up, ifconfig -a would list also down cards
2005-12-29T08:15:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	he might want to ifdown eth0, no?
2005-12-29T08:15:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	no, it isn't necessary
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	far away ones.
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	the quality is all 0. :S
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	it's probably due to ndiswrapper
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	sometimes it doesn't show real datas
2005-12-29T08:21:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	right?
2005-12-29T08:21:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	I would rather do sudo dhclient wlan0
2005-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	I don't know much about ifup script
2005-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	I don't now much about dhclient. :P
2005-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	:P
2005-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	ispiked	no0tic	did mode managed fix the essid thing?
2005-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	no, sudo I think ;)
2005-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	I launch iwconfig always with essid and channel options
2005-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	mode can be auto
2005-12-29T08:35:00.000Z	no0tic	ispiked	xenex well, it's 3:35 am here, I'm going to sleep, good luck!
