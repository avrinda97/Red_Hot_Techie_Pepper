2009-11-18T04:18:00.000Z	mdaum		Anybody point me to instructions on running Vuze 4.3 in karmic?
2009-11-18T04:20:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	is there a *real* reason you want to use Vuze, since it isnt the most p2p pirate friendly tool if your in MPAA country
2009-11-18T04:20:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	what client do you use?
2009-11-18T04:21:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	torrentflux.. but that might be a bit over the top
2009-11-18T04:21:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	never tried it
2009-11-18T04:22:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	tried transmission once.  V. slow.
2009-11-18T04:22:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	slowness depends on peers, port forwarding and your TCP/IP setup
2009-11-18T04:22:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	well it was an old transmission, but didn't compete side by side with azureus
2009-11-18T04:23:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	but now azureus doesn't handle the tpb magnet links
2009-11-18T04:23:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	side by side, you mean two at once?
2009-11-18T04:23:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	well...alternating, but on the same box
2009-11-18T04:23:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	as a test to see which was faster
2009-11-18T04:24:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	hmmz.. well I have good experience with flux and if you have a box you're going to like the web GUI
2009-11-18T04:24:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	most of the linux guys at your place use transmission / ktorrent on their pc and flux on the box
2009-11-18T04:25:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	my place?
2009-11-18T04:26:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	meant our :P
2009-11-18T04:26:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	I just have my laptop, see.  So I'd run  a server on it?
2009-11-18T04:26:00.000Z	woble	mdaum	no, stick to transmission, ktorrent, etc. unless you plan to do some webeditting :). but you were talking about a box see :)
2009-11-18T04:27:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	someday I'll have one.
2009-11-18T04:27:00.000Z	woble		:)
2009-11-18T04:30:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	transmission seems to choke completely on the magnet link!
2009-11-18T04:30:00.000Z	woble		hmmz, tahts weird
2009-11-18T04:35:00.000Z	mdaum	woble	seems like transmission doesn't support magnet
