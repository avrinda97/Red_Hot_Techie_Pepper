2007-05-13T06:39:00.000Z	Warren2312		My mp3 isn't reconized by feisty fawn
2007-05-13T06:39:00.000Z	Warren2312		he says only "MSCN Sigmatel mp3 device"
2007-05-13T06:39:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	is it recognized on the liveCD?
2007-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	You was obliged to reinstall ubuntu ?
2007-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	i did a reinstall of ubuntu, but it didn't make any changes
2007-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	and now what are you doing with your mp3
2007-05-13T06:43:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	it is in the trash ? ^^
2007-05-13T06:43:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	 whel, i booted up the LiveCD which recognizes the mp3 and i upload my files via that way...
2007-05-13T06:44:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	I must see why the mp3 works on the livecd and not when the os is installed
2007-05-13T06:44:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	it isn't a good solution, but it works...
2007-05-13T06:45:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	Ok, what is your mp3 mark ?
2007-05-13T06:45:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	i too want to know why it works on livecd and not on the installed os... if i know that, it would be a pitty to make it work
2007-05-13T06:45:00.000Z	Zjoske	Warren2312	ipod ^
2007-05-13T06:45:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	Ah ! An ipod doesn't work on ubuntu ???
2007-05-13T06:46:00.000Z	Warren2312	Zjoske	Me, that's a DJIX, simple mp3 who uses Sigmatel MSCN Firmware
