2011-05-16T07:35:00.000Z	squonk		has anyone here used wubi to install?
2011-05-16T07:35:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	i avoided it
2011-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	well this is most the try ubuntu before installing it for real
2011-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	but i started with ubuntu before the live CDs so when live cds came out i stick tieh them :)
2011-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	anyway i'll suggest you to use a dual boot for a while
2011-05-16T07:40:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	unity is built reusing gnome things, it is gtk, either, but, you'll love the classic interface, anyway
2011-05-16T07:42:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	in fact, and to be sincere, i tried unity on my netbook, and tried the classic gnome, classic gnome gives me much more on that small screen that what unity gave me... my sister hates me cause because unity she has no more desktop cube anymore in same netbook xD
2011-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	then you'll love compiz on classic ubuntu too xD
2011-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	be careful, a new system has new challenges and different frustrations, be ready to face them
2011-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	haha
2011-05-16T07:45:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	in brief, i hate when linux makes me have a hard time when i need to dfo simple stuff i aleready know works with ease in windows, but, in the other hand, i feel pretty confident than when i solve a problem i know what i am doing, or at least can research, and fix instead of hack the system
2011-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	if your windows in that toshiba is not vista or win7 you can combine them in some interesting ways
2011-05-16T07:51:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	i used to dualboot and run the real linux in vm whn i needed
2011-05-16T07:52:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	with xp is possible even having different real hard drives
2011-05-16T07:54:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	my setup was dual boot xp and ubuntu, if i needed the ubuntu while on xp then i just started the vm and accessed that linux, win7 has a problem and it is it loads disks in different order each startup making vbox loose reference of the drive ubuntu is on
2011-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	but if you use only one disk, then, it is ok, no way to load it in disorder xD
2011-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	disk size?
2011-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	well, drooling
2011-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	i am running ubuntu using full disk encryption, except for the boot partition, and performance is still nice
2011-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	one step at a time
2011-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	virtualBox creates you a virtual computer inside your operative system, you can run another operative system inside it
2011-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	well, playing hard with virtualbox you can use real disks instead virtual ones, xD so, don't break those ones, but by defasult you use virtual disks
2011-05-16T08:03:00.000Z	cablop	squonk	dunno how vbox do network bridges... but i use a winxp inside a vbox, on top on that ubuntu on that netbook... when i turn on the wireless... i got registered both systems in the WLAN xD, like connectiong two computers but just one WLAN just one WLAN login
