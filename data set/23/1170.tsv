2010-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	why are you making it hard? there's a graphical solution.

2010-08-09T08:26:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	collabra	well now i'm rather confused
2010-08-09T08:26:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	yeah,.. that makes three of us...;-)
2010-08-09T08:31:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	you may have been right,... but, there might be a graphical solution....
2010-08-09T08:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	collabra	the problem is actually rather vague now
2010-08-09T08:32:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	 have her try this.... In a terminal type: gnome-volume-properties     or, possibly under sudo
2010-08-09T08:32:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	collabra	go ahead and ask
2010-08-09T08:37:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	you were right,.. sorry.

2010-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	collabra	I actually made a relevant suggestion. If you have none, try helping someone else.
2010-08-12T08:30:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	what's wrong with you?
2010-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	insult me again.... take time out of your busy day to write a script to me apologizing to me and the room for your arrogance
2010-08-14T16:00:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	it took me two weeks to figure out that i needed to turn on my builtin webcam.
2010-08-14T16:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	collabra	at least we need to find which bus is it attached to!
2010-08-14T16:02:00.000Z	collabra	ilovefairuz	mine cuts the hardware from the bus,... like unplugging it from the usb
