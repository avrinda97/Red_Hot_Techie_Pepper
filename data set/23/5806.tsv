2006-08-30T09:45:00.000Z	burritoortega		i have a usb stick, and the filesystem seems corrupted, so i have to reformat it... problem is gparted can't do it (i get "error" without description), and i can't do it with mkfs either (i get "/dev/sda contains a mounted file system")... what should i do?
2006-08-30T09:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	you need to do sudo umount /path/to/mount/point
2006-08-30T09:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	and then try gksudo gparted
2006-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	you may have to point it to /dev/sda
2006-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	how do i do that exactly?
2006-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	i don't know. look for an option to add an fs
2006-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	i already did mkfs -t msdos /dev/sda
2006-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	while it was unmounted?
2006-08-30T09:48:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	is it the same if i unmount it via gui?
2006-08-30T09:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	i don't know, i don't usually use gui tools if i can avoid it
2006-08-30T09:49:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	that's what i did
2006-08-30T09:49:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	after umounting it
2006-08-30T09:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	is it maybe /dev/sda1? that's what it is on mine (but i don't know)
2006-08-30T09:52:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	mkfs.msdos: unable to open /dev/sda1
2006-08-30T09:52:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	are you sudoing? sorry, i'm kind of making this up as i go along
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	i tried with and without sudo
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	oh...hm. Have you tried the livecd?
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	you can get it off their site
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	nope, but that shouldn't change anything, should it?
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	other than that i haven't the foggiest...sorry
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	burritoortega	ladydoor	thanks anyway
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	i don't know. probably not
2006-08-30T09:54:00.000Z	ladydoor	burritoortega	sorry :-/
