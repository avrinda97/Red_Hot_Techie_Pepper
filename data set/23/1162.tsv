2010-08-02T03:59:00.000Z	wthpr0		I get 5 ips from my isp, i get them from a dhcp server and they are all dyn, is there a way under ubuntu that lets be change the ip without changing the mac adress ?
2010-08-02T04:00:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	cancel the lease on the IP, if you are allowed that control
2010-08-02T04:01:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	all you can do then wthpr0 is release the IP but no guarantees you dont get it right back
2010-08-02T04:01:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	the MAC address is a number burned into the NIC permanantly, like a serial number
2010-08-02T04:02:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	so dont use DHCP, just hard set to one of the 5 ips?
2010-08-02T04:03:00.000Z	wthpr0	Wiesshund	i don't know what they are, they are dynamic
2010-08-02T04:03:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	they are private IPs yes? like 182.168.0.1
2010-08-02T04:03:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	er 192......
2010-08-02T04:04:00.000Z	wthpr0	Wiesshund	it's ips from my isp not from my own dhcp server
2010-08-02T04:04:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	Live or private IP's?
2010-08-02T04:05:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	your sure bout that? usualy you get static when you buy live IP's
2010-08-02T04:07:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	reason i am asking is usualy dynamic IPs are private. if your computers ip is 192. or 10. etc its none live, whats ifconfig show for ip? 1st 3 digits
2010-08-02T04:08:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	the ISP cant see your mac addy, your router does
2010-08-02T04:13:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	no its not, the ubuntu computer is plugged into a router
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	you have an ISP router someplace
2010-08-02T04:11:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	what does ifconfig say on your PC ?
2010-08-02T04:12:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	would you answer the question?
2010-08-02T04:14:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	whats 1st 3 digits from ifconfig on eth0 on ubuntu box?
2010-08-02T04:15:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	192 is NOT a live IP address is a private I address
2010-08-02T04:16:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	oh, my bad, youve got the isp on eth1
2010-08-02T04:17:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	dumb question but why do you need to change the IP its getting?
2010-08-02T04:18:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	and like i said before, just static IP the machine to an address under or over the one it keeps being handed
2010-08-02T04:21:00.000Z	Wiesshund	wthpr0	theres a setting to change reported mac addy in my ubuntu install
