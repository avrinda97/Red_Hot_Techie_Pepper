2011-05-31T13:58:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	oh? nothing you can't do just as good or better on linux
2011-05-31T13:59:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	i'm confused why you're confused...
2011-05-31T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	right-click folder, share..
2011-05-31T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	shows up on network. grab files at will
2011-05-31T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	yes
2011-05-31T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	use samba
2011-05-31T14:02:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	sudo apt-get install system-config-samba
2011-05-31T14:03:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	er... are you sending files both ways? if not, which way?
2011-05-31T14:04:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	then depends on what version. google how to share files on network for your os. ubuntu can navigate windows network via samba
2011-05-31T14:14:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	10.10 is the best so far :P
2011-05-31T14:14:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	upgrade distro via repos?
2011-05-31T14:15:00.000Z	KeKsCoRe	tanath	im just a complete linux newbie ... but i have the skills and the might to google ... and i have a brain ... and ... ^^ im lazy :)
2011-05-31T14:27:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	samba, etc?
2011-05-31T14:28:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	now you got that song stuck in my head. thanks
2011-05-31T14:29:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	...no use crying over every mistake, you just keep on trying 'till you run out of cake!
2011-05-31T14:30:00.000Z	tanath	KeKsCoRe	'sudo do-release-upgrade' i think
