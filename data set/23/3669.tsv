2008-12-04T13:36:00.000Z	jim_p	James296	synaptic and other gtk apps draw their icons depending on the icon theme you use
2008-12-04T14:00:00.000Z	jim_p	James296	yes!
2008-12-04T14:02:00.000Z	jim_p	James296	i think that file shows what icon is applied to what place. removeing it is just... stupid. you will have the icons, but nowhere to put them
2008-12-04T14:02:00.000Z	jim_p	James296	remove the entire icon theme if you dont use it
