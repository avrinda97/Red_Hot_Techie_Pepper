2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	milco		for some reason, i seem to have lost my 'nvidia.ko'
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	milco		the kernel module cannot be found is the message when i try to 'modprobe nvidia'
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	milco		ive purged / reinstalled / uninstalled /reinstalled nvidia-glx, but i dont seem to get my kernel module back
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	milco		what can this be? :(
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	dis you install restricted modules?

2006-09-22T07:44:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	i tried to 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.5-27-386
2006-09-22T07:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	it is 15 not 5 and it is there ubotu is always right ;)
2006-09-22T07:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	maybe you need to enable some extra repos
2006-09-22T07:48:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	is there a way to find out which repro offers this package?
2006-09-22T07:56:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	at least you could tell me what is wrong with it, thanks a lot m8 :-))
2006-09-22T07:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	check the ubotu msg "In component restricted"
2006-09-22T07:49:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	i dont get it, the machine im typing on
2006-09-22T07:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	try  apt-cache search linux-restricted-modules
2006-09-22T07:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	what do you get ??
2006-09-22T07:51:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	a whole list...
2006-09-22T07:52:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	http://pastebin.ca/179758
2006-09-22T07:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	choose the one that maches your kernel...
2006-09-22T07:53:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	this is on the machine on which i have that package isntalled already...
2006-09-22T07:55:00.000Z	milco	erUSUL	as expected apt-cache search linux-restricted-modules, outputs nada
2006-09-22T07:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	milco	in linux-restricted modules is where you have nvidia.ko you have to install it to the nvidia driver to work... i do not know what else to say or do to help you out... you have to install that package matching your kernel. The package is in the repos you may have to enable mare repos in the machine check your sources.list
