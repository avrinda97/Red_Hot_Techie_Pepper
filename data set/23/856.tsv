2011-01-10T11:19:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	I had a computer behave the same way before it died. Now it can only stay running for about 60 seconds before it freezes
2011-01-10T11:20:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	that's promising haha. i just bought this one used.
2011-01-10T11:21:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	Have you tried installing with an alternate cd? Did you run the cd verification program?
2011-01-10T11:22:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	i tried about  6 cds so far haha some 10.10 some 10.04
2011-01-10T11:22:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	and?
2011-01-10T11:23:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	same result with all of them respective to their individual issues
2011-01-10T11:23:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	Oh that's not good. nit-wit was asking if you can boot from a usb pen drive
2011-01-10T11:59:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	I think it's either a bug (try (dis)connecting to the internet) or just a bad disk
2011-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	ive tried disconnecting from the internet and three disks
2011-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	And they all fail in the exact same place?
2011-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	ypu
2011-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	it also fails to boot 10.04 completely
2011-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	Strange. Have you tried any other distro / OS?
2011-01-10T12:07:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	everything worked great until earlier today and none of my programs would open so i went for a quick reboot and it wouldnt reboot properl
2011-01-10T12:09:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	Sounds like it might be a hardware issue. The PSU is prime suspect followed by possible drive failure
2011-01-10T12:10:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	i hope it isnt because i literally just bought it and everything was working just fine until a few hours ago
2011-01-10T12:11:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	If you don't have any spare parts or another pc to test with, your only option might be a repair shop. But first, make sure to test other OS / distro to see
2011-01-10T12:11:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	i dont really care enough about this computer to repair it honestly. i bought it very cheap to play with. ill try to install something else to get it working at least
2011-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	soreau	WhatToDo	DSL has a smaller footprint if I'm not mistaken
2011-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	WhatToDo	soreau	ill download it now then
