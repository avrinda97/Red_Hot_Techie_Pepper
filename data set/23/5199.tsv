2012-09-25T02:25:00.000Z	rufsketch1		though I don't remember it asking me that
2012-09-25T02:27:00.000Z	rufsketch1		err:winediag:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo Direct rendering is disabled, most likely your OpenGL drivers haven't been installed correctly (using GL renderer "GeForce GTX 660/PCIe/SSE2", version "1.4 (2.1.2 NVIDIA 304.43)").
2012-09-25T02:27:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	what spec is you comp ? if you don't mind me asking
2012-09-25T02:27:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	what sort of reply are you looking for?
2012-09-25T02:28:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	preferrably details :) no no.. cpu/ram/gfx etc
2012-09-25T02:30:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	intel core-i5 3570k
2012-09-25T02:30:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	gtx660,  and 16GB RAM
2012-09-25T02:30:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	aaahh.. k series.. fudge
2012-09-25T02:30:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	?
2012-09-25T02:30:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	I was going to suggest xen, but, to get your card really working, you would need vt-d working
2012-09-25T02:31:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	I can play borderlands 2 on the 3770, 7850 radeon no probs
2012-09-25T02:31:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	xen? vt-d?
2012-09-25T02:31:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	yeah, it's like virtualbox/vmware stuff
2012-09-25T02:32:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	ah. What does that have to do with k-series?
2012-09-25T02:33:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	vt-d (which is required to pass the video card through) doesn't work on k class cpu's
2012-09-25T02:33:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	ah, I see
2012-09-25T02:33:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	welp. That decision to splurge sure came to bite me back in the ass :-P
2012-09-25T02:34:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	still, I kind of want wine to work for other reasons
2012-09-25T02:34:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	do you know of any way to check if the 32-bit compat libraries are already installed?
2012-09-25T02:35:00.000Z	rufsketch1	zodiak	actually, I see approximately a fuckton of them
2012-09-25T02:36:00.000Z	zodiak	rufsketch1	then you probably have them .. you looking for a specific one ?
