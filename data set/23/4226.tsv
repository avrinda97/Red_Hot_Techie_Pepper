2007-10-19T12:37:00.000Z	lewis1711		how can I gain permission to copy and paste files?
2007-10-19T12:38:00.000Z	lewis1711		lol
2007-10-19T12:40:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	how is the hard drive mounted?
2007-10-19T12:41:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	my hunch is you're trying to copy files to a windows ntfs partition
2007-10-19T12:41:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	I am able to open files on the windows hard drive, I think it's fat32
2007-10-19T12:41:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	make sure the drive is clean, i.e., chkdsked, clean shutdown
2007-10-19T12:42:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	it is
2007-10-19T12:42:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	one sec
2007-10-19T12:45:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	sorry, got sidetracked
2007-10-19T12:45:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	ntfs?
2007-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	it's fat32 I think.
2007-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	run mount on the terminal, it'll say
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	sorry? type mount into the terminal?
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	yes
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	open a terminal, type mount, and look for the mount point
2007-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	k, reboot into windows, run a scandisk on the drive, reboot cleanly twice, and then boot back up
2007-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	I _think
2007-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	i _think_ there's a chkdsk that you can run under linux, but I'm not dead sure, and if I recall recorrectly, it's not compatible with vista if you're running that
2007-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	win2kpro
2007-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	k, well, safest answer is to reboot into windows like I said, but you might be able to find another option if ithappens again
2007-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	this is not a new problem. I have never been able to copy and paste files. how do I gve myself permission to read and write my disk?
2007-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	lewis1711	cwill1	becaues it says this account can only read
2007-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	cwill1	lewis1711	if its mounted in fstab, add uid=<your username> to the options
