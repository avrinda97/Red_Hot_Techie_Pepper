2006-05-10T11:41:00.000Z	monomaniacpat		anyone know how to switch monitors once ubuntu is loaded on a laptop?
2006-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	I've always done that through the laptop Fn key
2006-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	If I do that I get a big static image on the screen. I can only switch properly during booting
2006-05-13T15:07:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	please give more specific error messages and we can try to give you some help
2006-05-13T15:11:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	try running: killall wineserver && killall wine
2006-05-13T15:12:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	I can easily close wine, but I get the same problem if I try again... I'll give killall wineserver though
2006-05-13T15:13:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	killall doesn't output anythign by default
2006-05-13T15:15:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	yeah, if the debugger loads, wine crashed
2006-05-13T15:16:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	what program are you trying to run?
2006-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	wine sets all that up automatically, in order to use wine you have to run it with a windows exe
2006-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	I was following this howto: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=149585
2006-05-13T15:18:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	are you running the internet explorer installer?
2006-05-13T15:18:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	I don't use winetools so I don't know what to tell you
2006-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	how did YOU get wine to work?
2006-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	it sets itself
2006-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	I install it via apt, then run wine something.exe
2006-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	yeah
2006-05-13T15:21:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	winetools is for getting funky apps like IE to work
2006-05-13T15:21:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	but I have no desire to have IE anywhere near my machine
2006-05-13T15:28:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	do you need IE for anything other than running said browser?
2006-05-13T15:28:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	I don't think so
2006-05-14T14:31:00.000Z	NoUse	monomaniacpat	man mplayer, search for dumpaudio
2006-05-14T14:31:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	NoUse	thanks
