2005-07-15T08:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	there are Spanish/German etc... irc channels for a reason
2005-07-15T08:24:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	oh, and there is no -en for a reason too?
2005-07-15T08:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	english is the default language for Ubuntu and the default for this irc channel. If 100 peopel were speaking different languages in here the channel would be useless.
2005-07-15T08:26:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	says who, whio are you to say this??
2005-07-15T08:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	well, it's just common sense
2005-07-15T08:26:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	not to me.

2005-07-15T08:31:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	where does it say it is forbidden to use other languages?
2005-07-15T08:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	omg just drop it
2005-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	please leave the irc channel !!
2005-07-28T09:39:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	really doesnty have to run it?
2005-07-28T09:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	that's one of the nice things about grub is that you don't have to re-write the information every time a change is made to the config file :)
2005-07-28T09:41:00.000Z	dabaR	LinuxJones	really? I always thought you have to update-grub, I guess another one of those things you laern from the ubuntuguide:)
2005-07-28T09:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	just make your changes to menu.lst and that's it :)
2005-07-28T09:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	dabaR	unless your bootloader get's overwritten by say installing Windows then you would have to update-grub
