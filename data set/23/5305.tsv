2006-12-30T15:39:00.000Z	IBM_t40p_Noteboo		unfortunately i have a problem with my audio driver. i don't have sound anymore for 2 or 3 days, but i don't know why
2006-12-30T15:41:00.000Z	IBM_t40p_Noteboo		what can i do to activate sound again, when the driver is already recognized?
2006-12-30T15:42:00.000Z	n2diy	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	check your mixer settings.

2006-12-30T15:43:00.000Z	n2diy	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	whats that?
2006-12-30T15:44:00.000Z	n2diy	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	what Ubuntu version are you using?

2006-12-30T15:47:00.000Z	n2diy	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	try alsamixer
2006-12-30T15:47:00.000Z	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	n2diy	ok it works
2006-12-30T15:48:00.000Z	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	n2diy	whats "Master M"?
2006-12-30T15:48:00.000Z	n2diy	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	Not sure, but turn it up. :)
2006-12-30T15:51:00.000Z	IBM_t40p_Noteboo	n2diy	cool... now it works.. but i still dont know what "master m" is, because there is a "master" (without m), too
