2005-04-23T09:03:00.000Z	beh	bob2	thanks
2005-04-23T09:04:00.000Z	beh	bob2	actually first im going to compile 2.6.11
2005-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	bob2	beh	if you don't have pc card slots, right
2005-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	bob2	beh	yes
2005-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	bob2	beh	you'd know if your hardware supported it
2005-04-23T09:10:00.000Z	bob2	beh	people who don't want to take down their webserver to put in a NIC, etc
2005-04-23T09:15:00.000Z	bob2	beh	it's guaranteed to corrupt it
2005-04-23T09:15:00.000Z	bob2	beh	it should be marked broken
2005-04-23T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	beh	lots of people have
2005-04-23T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	beh	there's usually no point, tho
2005-04-23T09:49:00.000Z	bob2	beh	sure
2005-04-23T09:49:00.000Z	bob2	beh	if you're building your own kernel, you basically don't want an initrd
2005-04-23T09:49:00.000Z	beh	bob2	can u breifly explain to me what an initrd is
2005-04-23T09:51:00.000Z	bob2	beh	it's a place to store modules so they can be loaded before / is mounted
2005-04-23T09:51:00.000Z	bob2	beh	you only need it if you makde the modules for your IDE controller and root filesystem, well, modular
2005-04-23T09:51:00.000Z	beh	bob2	ohh i see, why is ubuntu like that by default
2005-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	bob2	beh	because you can't build ide modules for every single possible computer into the kernel
2005-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	bob2	beh	why are you building your own, btw?
2005-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	bob2	beh	so, if you're building your own, configure your basic stuff IN the kernel, not as modules
2005-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	bob2	beh	then don't use initrd at all, and you'll be fine
2005-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	beh	bob2	yeah i know now make sure the basic stuff isnt modularized
