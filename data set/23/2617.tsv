2009-06-07T13:52:00.000Z	__8472		hi, is there a way how can I debug, or log somehow a problem with booting of grub? a problem occured to me. I have dual-boot configured in there, one for linux, which works fine without a problem, and the second - windows xp, suddenly stopped to start the boot. but when i change the boot sequence in the BIOS, it works just fine, but when switching it back to the drive with grub, then it simply won't start booting of the windows, and I can't find why.

2009-06-07T13:55:00.000Z	__8472	vigo	why fixmbr? as i know, i haven't screwed up anything
2009-06-07T13:55:00.000Z	vigo	__8472	I found computerhope.com to be a great how to and stuff for windows
2009-06-07T13:56:00.000Z	__8472	vigo	but as i've said before, when i change the boot sequence in bios to the drive with windows to be first, it works fine. so there isn't a problem with the windows itself.

2009-06-07T13:57:00.000Z	__8472	vigo	yes, two phys. drives
2009-06-07T13:59:00.000Z	vigo	__8472	Ok, that is a bit different, sorta. If both HDDs have a Master Loader, or Boot Loader then that can cause confusion, it usually does not with GRUB and WinMBR , but it can, let me search the forums and see if I can find the solution.
2009-06-07T14:00:00.000Z	__8472	vigo	ok, thx
