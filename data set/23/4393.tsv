2007-09-14T13:52:00.000Z	Some_ux		Scenario: One ubuntu server (moderately weak CPU) behind router. A second client running Windows attempting to access the network from a different location. Requirements: Client does not know Linux, wants to connect to a windows system. OK, so what are the best ways to get the Job done. I was thinking Xen+Installing XP on the Ubuntu machine. Is that a good idea ?
2007-09-14T13:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	uhm
2007-09-14T13:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	what *exactly* are you trying to do?
2007-09-14T13:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	oh ok
2007-09-14T13:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	seems a slightly convoluted way to do things
2007-09-14T13:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	well I don't really know what you're trying to do
2007-09-14T13:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	does the user need a particular Windows-only application, or something?
2007-09-14T13:57:00.000Z	Some_ux	gordonjcp	user is unfamiliar with linux, and will take too long to familiarize with + yes probably needs MS word
2007-09-14T13:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	give them an XP desktop then
2007-09-14T13:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	or just give them and Ubuntu desktop and let them get on with it
2007-09-14T13:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	there is no practical difference for normal users
2007-09-14T13:59:00.000Z	Some_ux	gordonjcp	how can i give them an XP desktop from a remote location ?
2007-09-14T13:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	I don't understand your question
2007-09-14T14:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	why are they connecting to a remote machine at all?
2007-09-14T14:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	you haven't really given a clear statement of the problem
2007-09-14T14:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	as I understand it, you have a server that you want to run a bunch of XP virtual machines on, and connect to them remotely from some other machine, is that right?
2007-09-14T14:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	ok, why specifically do you want virtual machines running on the server?
2007-09-14T14:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	incidentally qemu will allow you to do something like that with XP apparently
2007-09-14T14:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	it's possible, it's not even particularly hard to do, but I have a sneaky feeling you're trying to solve the wrong problem
2007-09-14T14:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	why do you want lots of virtual machines on one server?  What is the user running locally?
2007-09-14T14:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	I *think* you're looking for qemu and seamless desktop
2007-09-14T14:08:00.000Z	Some_ux	gordonjcp	I don't want to run specific windows applications on linux. I want the user to be completely oblivious to the fact that a linux machine even exists
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Some_ux	in any case, the chances of anyone getting your password even if it is sent in cleartext is fairly remote
