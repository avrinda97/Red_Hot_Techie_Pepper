2007-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	NemesisD		hey guys, im running feisty but i think this should be pretty universal, i can't seem to get my network card working on my laptop
2007-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	NemesisD		wireless network card*
2007-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	NemesisD		that's not as conforting as you may think
2007-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	NemesisD		for some reason iwconfig wlan0 says no such device
2007-04-19T10:25:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	type only iwconfig to see if it changed interface name.. perhaps
2007-04-19T10:25:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	all i get is lo no wireless extensions; eth0 no wireless extensions
2007-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	ok, i had wlan and eth1 mixing from time to time... thats why i said that...
2007-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	perhaps bad driver?
2007-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	ok how do i wipe the driver and start over?
2007-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	compile it and insmod it /modprobe it
2007-04-19T10:29:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	i have no idea what that means
2007-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	i appears to be B-2 on that page
2007-04-19T10:30:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	did it ever worked? is rt2??? name of module u use?
2007-04-19T10:31:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	what's rt2? and actually this laptop has only had windows up to this point, and it did work there
2007-04-19T10:31:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	i use a broadcom bcm4318
2007-04-19T10:32:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	ok, then... u need to boot live cd on it and to see what is ur wcard; like this:
2007-04-19T10:32:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	after u find out which one is u go for chase of driver perhaps it will work out of the box!
2007-04-19T10:32:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	it didn't work out of the box which is why i went after ndiswrapper
2007-04-19T10:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g Wireless Lan Controller (rev 02)
2007-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	aha, ok, then u need to tell us what is maker of that wireless card chipset so we look up in here http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
2007-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	ok, u can watch i am already helping to Sp4cedOut collegue
2007-04-19T10:35:00.000Z	NemesisD	aldin	yes i see that
2007-04-19T10:37:00.000Z	aldin	NemesisD	before lodaing (sudo modprobe ndiswrapper) u need to rmmod bcm43xx and blacklist it...
