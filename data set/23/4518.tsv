2007-08-06T14:21:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	that would have flushed any firewall rules
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	i don't know what that means
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	it would have removed (flushed out) any active firewall configuration or rules
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	oh
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	does that mean it's not my firewall?
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	I installed a firewall system on my ubuntu box last week and for some reason I had to reset my netgear router before I could get to any web traffic. I have no idea why, but after resetting that it worked
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	it was only web traffic that I was having issues
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	I was on IRC, GAIM, IMAP mail, etc.
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	kk, i'll see what i can do about that.  i'm at work
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie		just no web
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	yeah, same here.  sounds like stupid router hardware
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	you could try rebooting the system if you haven't already.
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Xenoie	ozzloy	start simple before you go unplugging your office lan router ;p
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	heh, ok
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	or connect to another router in the office
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	ozzloy	Xenoie	^_^ it worked!  thank you
