2008-12-12T22:41:00.000Z	scoremeformusic		problems opening /etc/network/interfaces? anyone have any ideas?
2008-12-12T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	what problem
2008-12-12T22:41:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	I'm typing that into terminal to change ip address, it says "no such file or directory"
2008-12-12T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	its "interfaces" not interface
2008-12-12T22:43:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	I went to the directory there is a file "interfaces_old" which I can't do anything with. I used that filename instead, to no avail
2008-12-12T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	why can't you do anything with it
2008-12-12T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	move interfaces_old to interfaces
2008-12-12T22:44:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	sorry yeah I meant interfaces. I right click it to change filename or something, it says root in the permissions tab and is greyed out
2008-12-12T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	you need to launch the editor with gksudo before it, as it needs root permissions to open it
2008-12-12T22:46:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	I don't have an interfaces folder to move it to, is this what you mean? I tried sudo, didn't work. when I use sudo, it kinda pauses, then just gives me a new command line
2008-12-12T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	it's not a "folder" it's a file
2008-12-12T22:47:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	I don't have an interfaces file, just interfaces_old
2008-12-12T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	so move interfaces_old to be called interfaces
2008-12-12T22:48:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	that's what I tried to do-the permissions tab is greyed out. I don't know how else to rename the file
2008-12-12T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	you need to launch the editor with gksudo as I told you to get root permissions
2008-12-12T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	what command are you using
2008-12-12T22:51:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	I type in gksudo /etc/network/interfaces_old
2008-12-12T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	"sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces_old /etc/network/interfaces
2008-12-12T22:51:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	nope, just gave me a new line
2008-12-12T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	it's done it for you
2008-12-12T22:53:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	(thanks) but it gives me this: mv: cannot stat `/etc/network/interfaces_old': No such file or directory
2008-12-12T22:53:00.000Z	ikonia	scoremeformusic	it's moved it for you !
2008-12-12T22:54:00.000Z	scoremeformusic	ikonia	sorry I misread what you wrote....thanks so much!
