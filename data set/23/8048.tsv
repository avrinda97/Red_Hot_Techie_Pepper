2008-07-20T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 you can have several dozen window managers/desktopps installed. the GDM screen has a 'sessions' menu to pick the one you wish to use
2008-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 'openbox' is similer to fluxbox, and it installs a 'openbox/gnome' session in the sessions menu also.
2008-07-20T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 what howto?  :) the desktops normally add theor own entry. You can always make custome entries.
2008-07-24T01:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 totally depends on the errors you get when you run synaptic from a terminal
2008-07-24T01:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 well fromr eading the error message.. DID you do as it suggested?  run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' ?
2008-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 not sure what to try then.  May want to check the forums.  Its possible theres a bad cache file that needs to be deleted.
2008-07-24T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 like the files in /var/cache/apt archives/  pkgcache.bin  srcpkgcache.bin
2008-07-24T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 err.. i pasted the command with sudo in front of it as an example. :) of COURSE it needs sudo. heh heh..  I had to train the guys at work 'System tasks need Sudo' :) User tasks do not.
2008-07-24T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 I had to work hard teaching that class :)
2008-07-24T01:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 :) yep. the ubuntu sudo way.. is not taken into account in the error messages.. of course it sayingyouneeded sudo whenyou diddent would be just as wrong i guess.
2008-07-24T01:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 'super user do' I think. :)
2008-07-24T01:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 'System Uber command Do'
2008-07-24T01:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xidryck	 sudo has some reallyneat features and tricks. its worth reading up on someday
