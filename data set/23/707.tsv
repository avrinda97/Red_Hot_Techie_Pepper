2011-04-29T00:07:00.000Z	[dlp]		Fuck me this place is busy.
2011-04-29T00:07:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	filter all the channel events and its easier to read
2011-04-29T01:28:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	It's complicated.
2011-04-29T01:29:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	thats ok
2011-04-29T01:29:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	You can easily create an encfs filesystem.
2011-04-29T01:29:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	But do you want to use it for authentication and encrypt the whole home directory?
2011-04-29T01:29:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	i just want to enable ubuntus default ecryptfs where it mounts .Private on login in the users home directory
2011-04-29T01:30:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	I don't know how it works throught the GUI,
2011-04-29T01:31:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	I've done it manually.
2011-04-29T01:31:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	You have to set up pam_encfs
2011-04-29T01:32:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	eh k, got a linky somewhere or something?
2011-04-29T01:34:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	Ignore me then. Apparently I don't know what I'm talking about.
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	you need pam_enc to be installed probably to integrated mounting the ecryptfs on login
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	Using it for auth *does* cause problems.
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	ecryptfs is not an authentication mechanism
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	It can be.
2011-04-29T01:41:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	ohsix ecryptfs-setup-private comes with a -a -all-home flag which setups an encrypted home, which is what i wanted
2011-04-29T01:42:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	Be careful.
2011-04-29T01:42:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	I had problems with this. encfs has a timeout
2011-04-29T01:43:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	if it times out while you're logged in, you start getting lots of "Transport endpoint not connected" errors.
2011-04-29T01:44:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	And it doesn't seem to remount on demand.
2011-04-29T01:44:00.000Z	acicula	[dlp]	ohsix ive been using ecryptfs without problems for years, i was just curious about how to enable it for a user that did not use ecryptfs before
2011-04-29T01:44:00.000Z	[dlp]	acicula	Possibly waiting for input (which is impoossible since it won't have a controlling term)
