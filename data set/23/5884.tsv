2007-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	xelados		Can anyone help me figure out why Synaptic is telling me these packages can be auto-removed? http://mystic.de4th.com/stuff/Screenshot.png
2007-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	you probably had a legacy gnome app installed, and you removed it. So, synaptic says you don't need it's support libs anymore
2007-05-11T15:11:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	If I get rid of those packages, I'll be getting rid of things that seem very important.
2007-05-11T15:12:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	what do you have that's still using those? I mean, there's not much left that needs the gnome 1.4 libs now that gnucash has finally been ported
2007-05-11T15:13:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Well, I installed sanduhr earlier but decided it was crap..
2007-05-11T15:14:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	yes, that's exactly what brought those in: look at apt-cache show sanduhr
2007-05-11T15:15:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Ah, seems like you're right; it's depending on old stuff. So it really is safe to remove it all?
2007-05-11T15:15:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	if you had, those wouldn't be ready for removal.
2007-05-11T15:16:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Alright. Thanks for helping a somewhat paranoid user. :)
2007-05-11T15:16:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	paranoia is only perception: understanding is improving perception :)
2007-05-11T15:17:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Great way to look at it.
2007-05-11T15:34:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	~/.backgrounds for your personal ones
2007-05-11T15:34:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	and /usr/share/backgrounds for the system wide ones
2007-05-11T15:34:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Do I just list the directories to use?
2007-05-11T15:35:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	hrm, I just drop the backgrounds I want into ~/.backgrounds, or link them there
2007-05-11T15:36:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	:)
2007-05-11T15:43:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	It doesn't seem to work. I symlinked .backgrounds to my wallpapers folder..
2007-05-11T15:46:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	funny, I know I did that before. It's not working here, either
2007-05-11T15:47:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Perhaps the custom directory name has changed?
2007-05-11T15:47:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	no, I dropped a picture onto the change background dialog, and that's where it ended up
2007-05-11T15:48:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	I also did a killall nautilus.
2007-05-11T15:48:00.000Z	nickrud	xelados	maybe a logout and login is what it takes. Not doing so now, though
2007-05-11T15:52:00.000Z	xelados	nickrud	Logging out and back in didn't seem to work.
