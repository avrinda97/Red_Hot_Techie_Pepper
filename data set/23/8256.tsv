2004-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	sounds like you're in expert mode, I don't think those warnings should be shown normally
2004-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	or that this is after a few rounds of errors
2004-11-06T13:46:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	ah, yes, you said you were in expert mode. The UI of the expert mode is known to be poor; it's not what people are meant to use normally.
2004-11-06T13:46:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	can you ignore those warnings, carry on, and switch to tty2 and find out what it's doing during the 30 seconds when it hangs?
2004-11-06T13:54:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	ah, please file a bug on 'linux' with whatever you can transcribe off alt-f2 and alt-f4
2004-11-06T14:16:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	use the latter URL
2004-11-06T14:16:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	what document gives the preview one?
2004-11-06T14:17:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	ah, thanks, I'll fix that
2004-11-06T14:17:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	use warty-release-install-i386.iso
2004-11-06T14:25:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	fixed, thanks
2004-11-06T14:45:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	as I said, it's a kernel bug, please file it
2004-11-06T14:48:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	component name is 'linux'
2004-11-06T14:48:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	do try to transcribe as much of the error output on alt-f4 as you can
2004-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	Honningmusen	Kamion	I have tried to describe my problem now.. https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2773 .. Is that ok?
2004-11-06T15:09:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	is it possible to transcribe the text that makes no sense to you?
2004-11-06T15:09:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	it may be critical for a developer to figure out where the crash is
2004-11-06T15:10:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	that doesn't matter
2004-11-06T15:11:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	you can add a comment, use the comment box
2004-11-06T15:11:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	I realise it's tedious to copy a crash dump of the screen, but it will probably be necessary here :(
2004-11-06T15:13:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	at least from what I can gather from your report, yes
2004-11-06T15:13:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	the kernel has fallen over in a messy heap, and the call trace says where it went wrong
2004-11-06T15:30:00.000Z	Honningmusen	Kamion	I have added the complete call trace: https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2773
2004-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	Kamion	Honningmusen	thanks, I'll let Herbert take it from here
