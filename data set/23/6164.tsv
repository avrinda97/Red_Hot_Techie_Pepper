2007-02-24T16:39:00.000Z	johnny2		hi folks, anybody here have trouble with the bcm43xx drivers on edgy?
2007-02-24T16:39:00.000Z	johnny2		and also use networkmanager
2007-02-24T16:39:00.000Z	Zaggynl	johnny2	the native broadcam drivers didnt' work well for me either, try the windows drivers with ndiswrapper
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		well..
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		when i was using hoary i did use ndiswrapper
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		and then when i upgraded to dapper, it switched to the native drivers
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		and they worked great
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		including wpa2
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		but since upgrading to edgy.. not so well
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	Zaggynl	johnny2	for me too, but I needed the ISA login support thingy
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		ndiswrapper doesn't support wpa2 does it?
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	johnny2		ISA?
2007-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	Zaggynl	johnny2	yup
2007-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	Zaggynl		Forgot the right name
2007-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	Zaggynl		802 something
2007-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	johnny2		hmm?
2007-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	Zaggynl		I use it at school for logging in with username/passw
2007-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	Zaggynl		:o
2007-02-24T16:42:00.000Z	johnny2		i'd like to fix up the problem with the native drivers if it possible
2007-02-24T16:43:00.000Z	johnny2		i'd think that.. if i hadn't been using the native drivers for the past year with no problems
2007-02-24T16:43:00.000Z	Zaggynl		ndiswrapper is a nice temporary solution until the wireless support for linux catches up
2007-02-24T16:44:00.000Z	johnny2	Zaggynl	like i said.. if it didn't work perfectly before.. i'd still be using it :)
2007-02-24T16:45:00.000Z	Zaggynl	johnny2	personally I'm happy with whatever works (:
