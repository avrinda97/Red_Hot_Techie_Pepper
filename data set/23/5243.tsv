2008-02-04T01:57:00.000Z	robf		ok I just installed a harddisk from a defunct bo=x that broke,   its ide,   now I have my system installed on a sata drive... is there a way to access both drives? or are they mutually exclusive,  using sata  /  ide
2008-02-04T01:57:00.000Z	robf		and if not,  why isn't my sata drive4 showiong up anymore
2008-02-04T01:57:00.000Z	robf		although that makes no sense since my cd drive is ide...and they worked together ><
2008-02-04T01:57:00.000Z	ampex	robf	as long as both drives are cabled properly and the BIOS is identifying the drive(s) there should be no problem using IDE and SATA drives simultaneously
2008-02-04T01:58:00.000Z	ampex	robf	if you boot into linux with the SATA drive, you should see the IDE drive show up as a /dev/hd* device
2008-02-04T01:58:00.000Z	robf	ampex	I'd thought so,m  the sata drive was alread in this box,  and it has my linux system installed...once I installed the ide drive though,  it keeps trying to boot from that and I have no /dev/sd*
2008-02-04T01:58:00.000Z	ampex	robf	your BIOS is probably set to boot to the IDE driver before the SATA
2008-02-04T01:59:00.000Z	robf	ampex	well thats why im on a live cd now :p
2008-02-04T01:59:00.000Z	ampex	robf	IDE drive rather, not driver
2008-02-04T01:59:00.000Z	robf	ampex	but no /dev/sd
2008-02-04T01:59:00.000Z	ampex	robf	no /dev/sd with the livecd?
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	robf	ampex	nope thats why i was asking heh,  see this drive is another linux box,  i just needed to copy whats on it to this box,  so i can wipe that drive out,  cos the computer it was in kinda had an accident involving flames and a psu
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	ampex	robf	what sort of livecd are you using?
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	robf	ampex	amd64 it worked with sata when the ide drive wasn't in here
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	robf	ampex	you think some bios' may be retarded and have a mutual lock on ide/sata hdds?
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	ampex	robf	ubuntu livecd?
2008-02-04T02:00:00.000Z	robf	ampex	yessir
2008-02-04T02:01:00.000Z	ampex	robf	shouldn't be
2008-02-04T02:01:00.000Z	ampex	robf	try changing your boot options to boot to the SATA drive before the IDE drive
2008-02-04T02:01:00.000Z	ampex	robf	and check if the BIOS detects the SATA drive now with the IDE drive plugged in
2008-02-04T02:01:00.000Z	robf	ampex	cos thinkin bout it, it never noticed the sata drive,  the box is a small ...cube,  microatx and annoying cramped... i bet the cable became detatched when i was routing the ide cable to the other drive
2008-02-04T02:02:00.000Z	ampex	robf	not having the drive plugged in would probably cause it not be detected :)
2008-02-04T02:03:00.000Z	robf	ampex	heh yeh,  its just such a chore...i mean the box has about 4 sq inches of free space inside,  im surprised it doesnt run at like 100C...it's just cramped,  prolly not hard for a small sata plug to come dislodged when i was routing the other cables around the case
