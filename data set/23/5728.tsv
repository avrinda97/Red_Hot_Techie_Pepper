2008-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	BAD idea if you need help from people to be sarcastic
2008-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	to check what?
2008-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	cause your router is configured via port80 and it has a very shitty NAT like most of those routers
2008-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	you don't want other people from outside your lan to access your router, so they block the port always
2008-05-18T09:50:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	doyu have more than 1 computer in your LAN?
2008-05-18T09:51:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	go to any of your brother's PCs and try to access your LAN IP:81
2008-05-18T10:02:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	iptables -L output please
2008-05-18T10:02:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	and "sudo netstat -anp |grep LISTEN" too
2008-05-18T10:09:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	stop that real quick
2008-05-18T10:12:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	what is the iptables output I asked about?

2008-06-12T22:33:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	ext3?
2008-06-12T22:35:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	unplug it and don't write to it anymore. you still have a chance to recover some files there
2008-06-12T22:36:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	generally, windows has better undelete tools for FAT than linux tho. so you might want to try under windows
2008-06-12T22:38:00.000Z	wols_	Falling-Inferno	I told you what to do
