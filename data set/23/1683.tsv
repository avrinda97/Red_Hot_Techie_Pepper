2009-12-30T02:16:00.000Z	n00p	iceroot	yes, why is it that I see a support ticket for my wireless drivers that is 2 years old, and undealt with?
2009-12-30T02:17:00.000Z	iceroot	n00p	use a good wireless card
2009-12-30T02:18:00.000Z	n00p	iceroot	it's one of the better wireless cards for laptops ;) nice low battery consumption
2009-12-30T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	n00p	but bad support as it seems
2009-12-30T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	n00p	what chipset is it?
2009-12-30T02:20:00.000Z	n00p	iceroot	did you see the very last message I sent? ;)

2009-12-30T02:21:00.000Z	iceroot	n00p	stop that
2009-12-30T02:21:00.000Z	n00p	iceroot	did you READ that message? it's still there... 30 seconds before your own
2009-12-30T02:37:00.000Z	n00p	iceroot	you know what's helpful? the broadcom bcm43xx drivers ;) you should try them some time! even if you don't have a broadcom bcm43xx wireless card
