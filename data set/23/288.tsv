2012-01-29T22:17:00.000Z	Gnea		has anyone ever encountered a problem where running NetworkManager or wicd causes the computer to completely freeze up?  I have this happen on a consistent basis - the capslock and scroll-lock LEDs wind up blinking until I hit the reset button
2012-01-29T22:18:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	sounds hardware related
2012-01-29T22:18:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	what sucks is that I get absolutely no response in syslog about it, and sysrq is completely unresponsive
2012-01-29T22:19:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	it could be, but I solved some other hardware problems on this system over a year ago... perhaps it needs another bios update
2012-01-29T22:19:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	if it is hardware related and the system locks up, syslogd will never get the chance to write any error messages
2012-01-29T22:19:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	yup
2012-01-29T22:20:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	sounds like a net card that doesn't play nicely with the rest of the hardware
2012-01-29T22:23:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	it's possible.  it's got a wireless-usb type thing on there that shows up, but I have never gotten the wifi to work (it shows up as eth1)
2012-01-29T22:23:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	oh, and the mac address is set to 00:00:00:00:00:01
2012-01-29T22:24:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	well that's definitely a wrong mac address
2012-01-29T22:24:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	I think you uncovered it.... wicd, at least, has been told that eth1 is the wireless interface, and even if it's in the 'down' position, it needs to check on it to get its settings
2012-01-29T22:43:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	if your solution for your eth1 broke X, maybe you could just set it's driver to never load?
2012-01-29T22:44:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	the nvidia driver never got built, this is a whole new problem
2012-01-29T22:44:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	I go to install the nvidia-185 driver packages and it... never builds...
2012-01-29T22:45:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	are you using the opensource nvidia driver or the proprietary one?
2012-01-29T22:45:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	from the repository, I don't use from the website
2012-01-29T22:46:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	but the propietary one
2012-01-29T22:46:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	taking a break for breakfast, be back in a bit :)
2012-01-29T23:08:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	so I discovered a zero-length nvidia-current.ko file
2012-01-29T23:08:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	that would tend to imply to stopped building due to an error
2012-01-29T23:09:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	yes.  so, got it rebuilt.... but now there's still no nvidia.ko anywhere
2012-01-29T23:10:00.000Z	damselfly9	Gnea	don't know. I use an old matrox
2012-01-29T23:12:00.000Z	Gnea	damselfly9	ActionParsnip: I ran this and it seemed to get the zero-length driver taken care of: for i in `dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep nvidia | awk '{print $2}'`; do j=`echo $i`; dpkg-reconfigure "$j"; done
