2008-10-23T21:56:00.000Z	nikitis	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by "escape code"
2009-03-15T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nikitis	you may need a bios upgrade

2010-07-09T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nikitis	is the mouse ok in other systems? Try a different port
2010-07-09T23:28:00.000Z	nikitis	ActionParsnip	in windows this mouse works fine on the same box,  and I've tried on 4 ports already
