2007-01-26T16:05:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	i already tried that it only gives me directions to a method that aint working
2007-01-26T16:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	fine, then tell us what have you tried and what have failed
2007-01-26T16:07:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	ok
2007-01-26T16:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	you can try Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader
2007-01-26T16:10:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	ive tried from a live cd doing "sudo grub" then in grub terminal "find /boot/grub/stage1" then "root (hd0,1)" then "setup (hd0)" then "quit" and reboot

2007-01-26T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	it should have worked... btw where is the win partition? can you try other methods from the how to? the one i used (and worked for me) is: Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader
2007-01-26T16:17:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	i deleted that partition all together
2007-01-26T16:17:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	the win one
2007-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	i see...

2007-01-26T16:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	it should have worked... btw where is the win partition? can you try other methods from the how to? the one i used (and worked for me) is: Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader
2007-01-26T16:26:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	do u have the link
2007-01-26T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	it is the same i already gave you
2007-01-26T16:33:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	I STILL CANT GET THE THING WORKING
2007-01-26T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	shouting at me  will not get you any near to the solution either
2007-01-26T16:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	i do not know whay it is failing at you, it worked for me and this how to have worked for many others
2007-01-26T16:35:00.000Z	briancann	erUSUL	that was by accident
2007-01-26T16:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	briancann	maybe the fact that you deleted the first partition is confusin grub, try creating a blank partition in the empty space and try again
