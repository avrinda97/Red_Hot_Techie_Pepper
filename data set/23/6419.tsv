2006-06-25T12:35:00.000Z	MystaMax		anyone around?
2006-06-25T12:36:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	nah, this channel is -260 right now
2007-06-14T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	look through those kde packages, most of them probably say iA (installed automatically due to dependencies), look for the one(s) that don't have the A
2007-06-14T09:48:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	ok all of them have an "piA" next to them
2007-06-14T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	all? There's a section in the go screen, it says packages to be installed: that's not there, only the section that says something about automatically installed?
2007-06-14T09:52:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	I'm sorry. let me start over. I launched aptitude, and wanted to install vim, so i hit the "plus" sign to add it for install, and then I hit "g" to try and install and now it wants to install some kde packages (ie. kdelibs-data)
2007-06-14T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	odd, vim has no kde dependencies. Try unmarking all the packages in the go screen, and starting over.
2007-06-14T10:20:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	wow, I'm not sure what happen but a lot of packages got uninstalled! I went through the list of removed packages and added them back. I'm really not sure why it happen http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25565/
2007-06-14T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	just sat back down, I'm looking
2007-06-14T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	why some of those are marked is a real brain teaser: if it was myself, I'd suspect PEBKAC based on experience
2007-06-14T10:35:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	PEBKAC?
2007-06-14T10:36:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	I can agree with that
2007-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	i mean, module-assistant depends on build-essential, which depends on a fair amount of that stuff, but xchat-gnome?
2007-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	yea I'm pretty surprised about that one, actually I'm surprised about them all. It didn't say anything about uninstalling any of those packages
2007-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	yeah. I used to run debian unstable a lot, and would run into issues like that when dependencies got changed and the like. that's when I really learned to love aptitude.
2007-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	yea, i gotcha. Thanks for all your help
2007-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	help, ha. I' still as confused as you ;)
2007-06-14T10:43:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	not off hand
2007-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	netbeans is in the repos, you can get it with apt-get
2007-10-10T11:17:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	thx for the reply, but I'm trying to install a beta version, and its asking for the path to jdk? can I use "locate" to find it?
2007-10-10T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	MystaMax	it's under /usr/lib ; depending on which you have activated with update-alternatives --config java, it'll be a subdir under that
2007-10-10T11:19:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	ok, I installed sun-java6-jdk using aptitude. so i'll look and see if I find it...
2007-10-10T11:21:00.000Z	MystaMax	nickrud	found it, its in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-jvm. Thanks for your help
