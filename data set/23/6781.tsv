2008-07-07T19:44:00.000Z	ScaryFast		god I hate ubuntu irc apps. I just want mirc! :P
2008-07-07T19:45:00.000Z	ScaryFast		too bad I installed it and it's crashing
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	have you tried Xchat?
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I'm in xchat now
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	ScaryFast		can it do multiple servers at a time?
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I couldn't find a way :P
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	of course
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	click on the xchat tab ( top left )
2008-07-07T19:48:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I just have to figure it out. This is my first day using linux basically. besides a live-cd.
2008-07-07T19:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	xchat is not "linux" but I see your point.
2008-07-07T19:48:00.000Z	ScaryFast		well this is x-chat gnome
2008-07-07T19:48:00.000Z	ScaryFast		maybe I need the normal xchat
2008-07-07T19:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	sudo apt-get install xchat-common
2008-07-07T19:50:00.000Z	ScaryFast	ubuntu	is way nicer than I thought it would be and way nicer than any other flavor of linux I ever tried before. I keep moving the windows around... :P
2008-07-07T19:51:00.000Z	ScaryFast		yeah, I joined another server
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		in mirc in windows I can hit F1 and it runs a script and joins 2 servers and a dozen channels
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I guess I just miss that :P
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		yes
2008-07-07T19:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	click on Xchat again and then Network List. you can edit your server settings there ( add channels to join and servers to auto connect to )
2008-07-07T19:53:00.000Z	ScaryFast		or I could reboot and see why mirc under wine crashes when I try to use the edit script window :P
2008-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I don't have those options idleone. irc, edit, network, discussion, go, help
2008-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	your time would be better spent helping to make xchat better by writing addons/plugins
2008-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	ScaryFast	install xchat-common from the repositories
