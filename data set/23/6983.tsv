2005-11-19T14:05:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	What about xubuntu?
2005-11-19T14:05:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	i have my media player starting up when i log in, and I want to deactivate that
2005-11-19T14:06:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	do you know how to do this?
2005-11-19T14:06:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Hang on a sec while I log into xubuntu session
2005-11-19T14:06:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	hey thanks!
2005-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	On shutdown/logout the XFCE session has checkbox to remember/save desktop state. Quit MediaPlayer, then quit session and ensure save state/session is checked to make it go away
2005-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Is labeled save session for further logins
2005-11-19T14:12:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	yeah, i actually tried that and it didn't work...
2005-11-19T14:12:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Worked for me
2005-11-19T14:12:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	i tried it a few times actually, and it the xfmedia would consistently pop up...
2005-11-19T14:12:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	i can try again
2005-11-19T14:12:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	brb
2005-11-19T14:14:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	the media starts, and I get a message saying "there is already a system tray running on this screen".  I'm not sure if this helps
2005-11-19T14:15:00.000Z	kcskyl	egon_spengler	any ideas?
2005-11-19T14:15:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Just a sec
2005-11-19T14:19:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Still here, and looking for xfce4 config hiding place
2005-11-19T14:21:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Try rm -rf .config and log back in.
2005-11-19T14:26:00.000Z	egon_spengler	kcskyl	Glad to assist but thoreauputic offered the location for the solution
