2007-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	brophat		I have an 80 gig HD and a 120 gig HD but ubuntu only installed on 7 gigs of one of the disks. Can I get the rest of the space used or do I have to reinstall ubuntu?
2007-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	wols	brophat	create a bigger partition. resize the ubuntu partition
2007-12-15T11:51:00.000Z	brophat	wols	how do I resize?
2007-12-15T11:52:00.000Z	wols	brophat	use a gparted livecd
2007-12-15T11:54:00.000Z	wols	brophat	no
2007-12-15T11:55:00.000Z	brophat	wols	when i create a partition it always wants me to say where I want it moutned
2007-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	wols	brophat	fdisk -l
2007-12-15T12:39:00.000Z	wols	brophat	he uses a liveCD. fstab doesn't really matter
2007-12-16T23:00:00.000Z	wols	brophat	yes. what filesystemn(s) on the disk?
2007-12-16T23:01:00.000Z	brophat	wols	it just says extended
2007-12-16T23:01:00.000Z	wols	brophat	extended is not a filesystem but partitiontype
2007-12-16T23:02:00.000Z	brophat	wols	yeah I dunno what fs is on it
2007-12-16T23:02:00.000Z	wols	brophat	fdisk -l sorta told you
2007-12-16T23:03:00.000Z	brophat	wols	what was weird is that when i installed ubunut it was telling me that it could not mess with the second HD because it already had an os on it and it did not want to break it
2007-12-16T23:04:00.000Z	brophat	wols	well I am gonna install 7.10 right over my 7.04 so hopefully it won't give me the same crap that my first install gave me
2007-12-16T23:05:00.000Z	wols	brophat	what has this to do with what filesystem is on disk two?
2007-12-16T23:05:00.000Z	brophat	wols	dunno, so how do I find out what fs is on disk two?
2007-12-16T23:06:00.000Z	wols	brophat	as I said: fdisk -l gave you a hint
2007-12-16T23:07:00.000Z	brophat	wols	by the size of the sectors and stuff?
2007-12-16T23:07:00.000Z	wols	brophat	no, by partition type
2007-12-16T23:08:00.000Z	wols	brophat	e.g. ntfs, win95 lba, etc
2007-12-16T23:08:00.000Z	wols	brophat	system column
2007-12-16T23:08:00.000Z	brophat	wols	yeah all it says under system is extended
