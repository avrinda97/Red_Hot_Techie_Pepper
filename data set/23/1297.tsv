2010-05-24T01:41:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: Before Jumping to Install Ubuntu through wubi | did you check running it with the CD without installing & did you see the wi-fi

2010-05-24T01:43:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: You are making things more complicated then already it is...try booting from the CD and check for the wi-fi.

2010-05-24T01:47:00.000Z	renodude181	Night_Rider	Ok? now what
2010-05-24T01:47:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: Run  with the CD without installing & did you see the wi-fi
2010-05-24T01:49:00.000Z	renodude181		Night_rider: I wasn't able to launch liveCD, it didn't want to do anything from the Cd but exit when booting from it, but using Wubi, ubuntu runs fine, except for the Wifi. I do however get a icon looking like a wifi icon next to the volume, but no connections
2010-05-24T01:51:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: The only way to find out ; is to boot it from the CD..(At least you will if its having compatibility related issues)
2010-05-24T01:51:00.000Z	renodude181	Night_Rider	it won't boot from it, it freezes, it does it on both my laptops
2010-05-24T01:52:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: Try Ubuntu 9.10 | instead of 10.04
2010-05-24T01:53:00.000Z	renodude181	Night_Rider	whats the difference between the two, shouldn't 10 have what 9 had?
2010-05-24T01:54:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: Hardware issue | 9.10 had no booting issues what so ever.
2010-05-24T01:55:00.000Z	renodude181		Night_rider: could the no CD booting issue be a corrupt ISO, cause when launching Wubi from CD it get an error can't find CD. But launching it from the .iso in windows it runs fine?
2010-05-24T01:57:00.000Z	Night_Rider	renodude181	: Did you try Ubuntu 9.10 ?
