2010-04-11T11:57:00.000Z	darth_grantius		Well I have ubuntu as well
2010-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	darth_grantius		Does Netbook edition only support netbooks?
2010-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 it can install on desktop machines.. or  you can install the Netbook interface on a normal desktop install also.
2010-04-11T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 You can make a flash drive installer..
2010-04-11T11:59:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	I want to burn a CD
2010-04-11T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	  the cd has a 'install' item in the menus..
2010-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	Thank you. I had heard that wasn't possible.
2010-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 not sure why it would be not possible.. unless you had them confused by your question
2010-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 its just starting the instller after X loads up to a minimal desktop.
2010-04-11T12:02:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	the information I had said you had to boot to a fullblown Live Desktop. Which would have killed my ancient PC.
2010-04-11T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	  the netbook desktop is not very fullvblown.. and ive ran full live ubuntu cd/desktops in Much older machines then what you had.
2010-04-11T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 try them out and see.. thats the bottom line
2010-04-11T12:03:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	so would normal ubuntu be fine with it?
2010-04-11T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 ive installed normal ubuntu on a Pent I  100 -  with 128mb of ram.. ages ago.. but the install took like 2 hrs.. :)
2010-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	 it was very slow..but it worked..  I used it as a ssh terminal. :)
2010-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	A P3 should be a bit more usable then :P
2010-04-11T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darth_grantius	ive ran it on a Pent3 befor with deceut success..  You may want eventually use a lighter dektop.
2010-04-11T12:06:00.000Z	darth_grantius	Dr_Willis	ive already downloaded this distro. Ive been out of linux for a while, i have some Ubuntu 5.xx Cds i ordered through shipit years back.
