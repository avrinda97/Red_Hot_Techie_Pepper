2010-08-14T06:20:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	This result isn't from an ubuntu box.. but I got 8 pages of postscript.
2010-08-14T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 yea. i got a screengreab image of the site now.. Still looking for a PRINT button on the site. :0 but cant seem to get the image to print properly.
2010-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 the Print button of tjhe browser prints the 1st page and thats it... rest are blank
2010-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 im finding more and more sites that never print properly these days
2010-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	May I ask which browsers?
2010-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 Firefox so far. Lets try Googles
2010-08-14T06:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 chrome semeed to print it better at least. :_ Not perfect.. but at least i can read the info i need.
2010-08-14T06:36:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	Heh.. your printing issue gave me something new to look at and wonder about :)
2010-08-14T06:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 yea. years ago i had a progrzm from HP that let you preview/tweak the fonts and layout befor printing..  Now a days i notice the browsers not even giveing me a Print Preview optioopn
2010-08-14T06:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	Firefox can preview, and for most browsers I print to pdf or ps first, saves paper and time =P
2010-08-14T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 oddly enough.. i 'see' the print priview button real fast.. then it vanishes for me in firefox.. Sometimes.. :) Somttimes its there...
2010-08-14T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 im not even sure what version of FF i got. :) I may be  using some of the beta ppa's
2010-10-23T23:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 doubtfull.
2010-10-23T23:12:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	I actually use wine already I'm just stating the reason for it's need.
2010-10-24T11:13:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	VLC and MPlayer are probably rivals, though I would say MPlayer has better support for SSA/ASS subs than VLC does, least as for 6 months ago still..
2010-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 any time i see 's3' mentioned in relation with Linux.. its never a good thing.
2010-10-24T11:35:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	I vaguely recall a great deal of frustration the last time this was done..
2010-10-28T06:40:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	Won't "cp -a foo foo.backup" be better since it seems timestamps and users?
2010-10-28T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 ive rarely needed that
2010-11-06T23:48:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	How does ntop remember it's data?
2010-11-06T23:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Diamondcite	 ntop is so complex.. i couldent figure out 1/20th of it..
2010-11-06T23:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	I'm currently using bandwidthd in html mode.. but the graph generation breaks frequently =/
2011-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Dr_Willis	Won't 2 computers over gigabit ethernet be faster then?
