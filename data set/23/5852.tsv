2007-10-27T12:12:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		is there an ati driver? On my laptop running Feisty I have an "ati" driver. A friend running Gutsy has the "fglrx".
2007-10-27T12:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	fglrx is the binary driver supported by AMD, ati is the open source driver
2007-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	ati is usually preferred unless you are wanting to play high performance 3d games
2007-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	Which one should we be using?
2007-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	Okay, here's the problem. I have compiz working on my laptop. We can't get it working on my friends laptop
2007-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	i don't know about your friend, but should probably stick with ati
2007-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	it doesn't work properly with fglrx
2007-10-27T12:16:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	Can't get it working with fglrx
2007-10-27T12:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	it's not supposed to work
2007-10-27T12:16:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	So he should switch to ati?
2007-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	ati may not support his video card
2007-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	and if he wants to play 3d games then fglrx is probably the better choice
2007-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	 x1300
2007-10-27T12:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	hrrm actually 'ati' is the driver for really really old cards, radeon is the other open source driver
2007-10-27T12:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	his card is only supported by fglrx so there is nothing he can do
2007-10-27T12:19:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	So he can't run compiz?
2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	he can if he uses xgl, but there are problems assocaited with that
2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	I see
2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	or if he installst he very latest driver released a few days ago that does support aiglx
2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	You mean the ati drive from ati?
2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	DigitalNinja	the latest fglrx from ati, 8.42.3
2007-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	I see
2007-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	dystopianray	Thanks for the info
