2010-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD		Hi all ! I have a RAID5 server and during booting it says "cannot find "/dev/mapper/raid_name". So it can't boot /  ... Somebody said it was because my kernel is compiled without default raid support.
2010-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD		How do I fix that?
2010-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD		in live CD i can see all 3 disks
2010-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	rebuild the boot-image
2010-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	 how to do that when I can't even boot into OS
2010-05-18T14:28:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	boot in rescue mode..
2010-05-18T14:28:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	from the dvd
2010-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	any chance to loose any data?
2010-05-18T14:30:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	as long as you don't start installing
2010-05-18T14:30:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	 that's why it's called rescue
2010-05-18T14:31:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	just rebuilding to defaults ?
2010-05-18T14:31:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	you have to rebuild the initramfs only
2010-05-18T14:32:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	and make sure md/raid drivers are loaded
2010-05-18T14:33:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	sorry for the noob question, how do I rebuild only initramfs ?
2010-05-18T14:40:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	thanks for navigation
2010-05-18T14:40:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	thanks a lot
2010-05-18T14:41:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	laze as I am I usually simply reinstall the linux-image
2010-05-18T14:42:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	and there's no danger of destroying data?
2010-05-18T14:43:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	at what step are youi afraid you would lose data ?
2010-05-18T14:43:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	 rebuilding the kernel
2010-05-18T14:44:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	it's called reinstalling the kernel, and the initrd which is a ramdisk that is loaded before the system get's started up gets rebuild..
2010-05-18T14:49:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	lapion	thanks dude!
2010-05-18T15:20:00.000Z	lapion	Str82DHeaD	you won't be rebuilding the kernel, reinstaslling the kernel rebuilds the initramfs, which is a file containing a ramdisk file that gets loaded at the startup of the system,
