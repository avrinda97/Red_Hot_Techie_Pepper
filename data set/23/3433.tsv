2008-04-24T14:21:00.000Z	white_eagle		did my question deliver?
2008-04-24T14:21:00.000Z	white_eagle		I had KDE installed as my secondary DE, now after I removed it,(removed every app that had KDE in its description) apps' menus (like SpeedCrunch and Opera) look ugly, they don't look blue'ish like they used to, so I guess I removed the qt libraries, I want them back so the apps' menus to look the same as before, I'm asking now what packages do I need to install?
2008-04-24T14:23:00.000Z	white_eagle		did someone answer my queston?
2008-04-24T14:24:00.000Z	white_eagle		I read it

2008-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	white_eagle		blue'ish like they used to
2008-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	white_eagle		because I removed everything connected to KDE, and they are gone now, and I still use some qt apps
