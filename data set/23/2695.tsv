2009-06-30T05:48:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	in synaptic is package called     openjpeg-tools
2009-06-30T05:50:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	in synaptic is package called     exifprobe
2009-06-30T05:51:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	got exifprobe now
2009-09-14T22:07:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	look in  ~/.local/share/Trash/files  press ctrl+h to show hidden files. is it in there?
2009-09-14T22:08:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	if not its probably in the  root trash
2009-09-14T22:10:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	it wasn't there, but found alot of other things
2009-09-14T22:10:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	can you explain how to do the same with root trash?
2009-09-14T22:11:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	in terminal type gksudo nautilus and browse to  /root/.local/share/Trash/files press ctrl+h
2009-09-14T22:15:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	still no luck, followed everything to the letter, but can only see other stuff I've deleted
2009-09-14T22:16:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	were you perhaps browsing a second hard drive when this happened?
2009-09-14T22:17:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	the drive where the directory got deleted is not the OS drive, if that's what you mean
2009-09-14T22:18:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	ok well if you have another hard drive click on it. it will have its own Trash folders also
2009-09-14T22:19:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	there's nothing in the Lost&Found folder on the drive
2009-09-14T22:20:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	do you have another hard drive besides the primary drive that ubuntu is installed on?
2009-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	yes, I've got 1 more internal, and two via USB... the drive where the dir got deleted is on the internal
2009-09-14T22:22:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	if you click on the internal while in nautilus you should see some Trash folders. perhaps more than one
2009-09-14T22:24:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	holy cow, there it is :D how the hell did I miss that before?
2009-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	to restore the files, I just move them out of .Trash-0 ?
2009-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	yes. do you know where its supposed to go?
2009-09-14T22:27:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	what do you mean "ehre it's supposed to go"?
2009-09-14T22:28:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	depending on what file it is some files belong in certain folders like  /etc or /home
2009-09-14T22:28:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	legend2440	it was just some videofiles
2009-09-14T22:29:00.000Z	legend2440	Platypus-Man	oh ok then just right click and cut /paste
