2010-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	dragonstone		hey guys/gals need some help here. I've installed Ubuntu Maverick on a couple systems and now Linux Mint 10 on another and every single one after restart, Network Manager is not visible in the tray. I have to run "killall NetworkManager" and it pops up. Any ideas?
2010-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	have you tried removing/adding to the panel?
2010-12-23T07:22:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	no I haven't. How would I do that?
2010-12-23T07:23:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	you right-click on it and select remove, then right-click on the panel and select add
2010-12-23T07:25:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	if I right-click on the panel, i can't remove it. If i right-click on the NetworkManager icon I can't remove that either. I am currently testingon Mint.
2010-12-23T07:26:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	do you see the little vertical hash marks on the panel?
2010-12-23T07:27:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	sorry, no vertical hashes on the panel
2010-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	it's just wierd. I have to kill NetworkManager before I can see it.
2010-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	can you pastebin a screen capture with the network manager on the panel?
2010-12-23T07:30:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	sorry it's on another computer. I am not even sure how I would send a screenshot via IRC.
2010-12-23T07:31:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	the notification-applet looks like little speed bumps, it houses several icons...
2010-12-23T07:34:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	I understand what you are reffering to as I see it in Debian but loks like Mint has added some "elegance" so the panel is at the bottom and is completely smooth with no breaks.
2010-12-23T07:37:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	hmmm.... i have lm10 but not on this machine.
2010-12-23T07:38:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	thanx for the info anyway. might have just given me the direction I needed to figure it out.
2010-12-23T07:39:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	i'm gonna go fire up the VM and see for myself...
2010-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	ok
2010-12-23T07:42:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	ok, on mine the network indicator and the update-manager are both in the bottom right corner with three little hash marks to the left of the update-manager.
2010-12-23T07:43:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	hard to see...
2010-12-23T07:47:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	Land of Magic
2010-12-23T07:48:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	????
2010-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	I also notice, on Debian if I run that command the app dies and stays dead. In Ubuntu and Mint it re-launched automatically.
2010-12-23T07:50:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	dragonstone	the only thing I can try to tell you is try ##gnome at this point. I'm still looking aroound.
2010-12-23T07:50:00.000Z	dragonstone	UnholyTerror	I don't have WICD installed but ifdown is possible. This is a fresh install so I have not made any customizations and this seems to be the same behavior for the last thre installs.
