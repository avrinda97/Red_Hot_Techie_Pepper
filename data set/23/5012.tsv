2007-11-01T09:25:00.000Z	bullgard4		Why does Ubuntu 7.10 install several executable Bluetooth programs on my laptop although the laptop manual does not mention Bluetooth?
2007-11-01T09:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	if the bluetooth stuff wasn't included on the CD it wouldn't work out of the box. So, it is included. Just remove it if you don't have bluetooth.
2007-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	I will further enquire before I remove programs.
2009-07-01T10:39:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	my /lib/modules directory gets quite crowded with old kernel versions eventually.
2009-07-01T10:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	And do you need them all?
2009-07-01T10:40:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	no, you don't need more than one kernel, as only one runs at a time.
2009-07-01T10:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	search in synaptic or aptitude for 'linux-' and remove any linux-*-modules packages that aren't the current version. *Bing*, clean /lib/modules dir.
2009-07-01T10:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	of course some dkms modules like nvidia or virtualbox might not be cleaned with that.
2009-07-01T10:44:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	I have deleted all old kernels using Synaptic and deinstalling the image DEB (for example linux-image-2.6.20-16-generic). Still with me there are two unnecessary module directories below /lib/modules/. Why?
2009-07-01T10:45:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	um, it'll be linux-modules-2.6.20-16-generic you want to remove for the /lib/modules.
2009-07-01T10:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	well, what's in those dirs? and have you tried purging the packages instead of just removing?
2009-07-01T10:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	I do not know what your interjection "um" means. --  Yes, I purged instead of just removing.
2009-07-01T10:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	well, look in those directories, and use `dpkg -S /lib/modules/path` to find out which (if any) package provides that file.
2009-07-01T10:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	if no package does, just rm them.
2009-07-01T10:49:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	how's it coming?
2009-07-01T10:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	"if no package does, just rm them." <- I have done so. Hopefully I will not regret what I have done.
2009-07-01T10:55:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	as long as linux-modules-`uname -r` is installed you'll be good.
2009-07-01T10:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	Thank you for your help.
2009-07-01T10:56:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	you're welcome.
2009-07-01T11:06:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	open the pulseaudio volume controller (pavucontroller).
2009-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	cellofellow	This works great! Thank you for your advice.
2009-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	:D glad you like it.
2009-07-01T11:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	bullgard4	you can also use padevchooser (a system tray applet) to launch various PulseAudio GUI tools and choose soundcards (I have a USB headset so that comes in handy).
