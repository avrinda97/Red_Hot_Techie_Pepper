2006-04-08T06:15:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	I am currently using wvdial, I have tried pon/poff and kppp, nothing works.
2006-04-08T06:16:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	oh, you mean hardwarly ? It is a serial modem.
2006-04-08T06:16:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	connected to the serial port of course.
2006-04-08T06:16:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	wvdialconf should tell you what device i found
2006-04-08T06:16:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	what device *it* found
2006-04-08T06:17:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	it says:
2006-04-08T06:17:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	i thought wvdial works dor you?
2006-04-08T06:18:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	no, nothing worked so far, the modem is not responding.
2006-04-08T06:18:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	what model is it?  it might be a *cough* winmodem
2006-04-08T06:19:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	I hope not. I took the care to buy a serial external modem which the vendor claimed it wasn't a crap-modem.
2006-04-08T06:20:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	it is a webeasy modem, by Roper.
2006-04-08T06:22:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	http://www.linmodems.org/ run the scanmodem tool found here
2006-04-08T06:28:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	scanModem doesn't seem to even look for a serial modem.
2006-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	my mistake, it only looks for pci and usb ones
2006-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	have you looked here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com//DialupModemHowto ?
2006-04-08T06:34:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	nothing usefull there.
2006-04-08T06:35:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	what was the model again?
2006-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	try the forum
2006-04-08T06:56:00.000Z	orbin	Pupeno-	dare i say try it in xp?
2006-04-08T06:58:00.000Z	Pupeno-	orbin	I don't use proprietary softawe, I don't have such crap anywhere here.
