2006-01-17T14:26:00.000Z	azion		I got a prob with Gnome theme, can anyone help me?
2006-01-17T14:26:00.000Z	_jason	azion	just ask your question
2006-01-17T14:27:00.000Z	azion	_jason	The background in my tray is gone white, while the main bar is black
2006-01-17T14:28:00.000Z	_jason	azion	press ALT+F2, then enter 'killall gnome-panel'
2006-01-17T14:28:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Why?
2006-01-17T14:28:00.000Z	_jason	azion	that will restart the panel
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	azion	_jason	I've already restarted, and still the same prob
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	azion	_jason	I don't think it's the skin I'm using
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	_jason	azion	not sure, I suppose you can try a different theme to check
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Others are fine, strange thing is the 1st icon after the time is grand, all the rest are in white
2006-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	_jason	azion	is this a custom theme?
2006-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	azion	_jason	one from gnome-look
2006-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	azion	if that is the only one causing trouble, I think you should just assume it is the theme's fault and find another one
2006-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Cheers man, whats CK patchset
2006-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	_jason	azion	no idea
2006-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Thanks
2006-01-19T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	azion	like an icon set you download from gnome-look.org?
2006-01-19T12:41:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Ypu, but I'm already using a theme
2006-01-19T12:41:00.000Z	_jason	azion	just drag it into the theme preferences window and install it.  Then if you go to theme details you should be able to choose it
2006-01-19T12:43:00.000Z	_jason	azion	np
2006-01-24T10:49:00.000Z	azion	_jason	You there man?
2006-01-24T10:49:00.000Z	azion	_jason	Having a bit of bother with kernel 2.6.15.1
2006-01-24T10:54:00.000Z	azion	_jason	You there dude?
