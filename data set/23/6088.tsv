2007-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	goose		how do you figure out which package in ubuntu installed a particular file?
2007-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	goose	dpkg -S
2007-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	goose	jrib	thanks=D
2008-02-28T10:21:00.000Z	jrib	goose	you avoid doing so.  What are you trying to install?
2008-02-28T10:21:00.000Z	goose	jrib	a plugin for pidgin
2008-02-28T10:21:00.000Z	jrib	goose	be more specific
2008-02-28T10:23:00.000Z	goose	jrib	it's a plugin I downloaded from google code that shows my current song in amarok as my status on pidgin (link: http://code.google.com/p/musictracker/ )
2008-02-28T10:25:00.000Z	jrib	goose	read the link ubotu sent you and the INSTALL file inside the tar.bz2 archive you have
2008-02-28T10:25:00.000Z	goose	jrib	thanks a mil
2009-11-12T01:28:00.000Z	jrib	goose	w
2010-02-04T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	goose	zenyatta: wouldn't an infinite loop be easier?  while true; do blah; done
2010-02-04T02:52:00.000Z	goose	jrib	I've sometimes found bad things happening when I launch multiple instances of this program. It'll try and bind itself to non-existent IP addresses if it can't bind to the one it's supposed to.
2010-02-04T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	goose	multiple instances wouldn't be launched
2010-02-04T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	goose	anyway that's what I do when I listen to a radio station with mplayer that likes to disconnect me randomly.  When one mplayer process exits (because I got disconnected) the loop progresses and then starts a new mplayer
2010-02-04T02:56:00.000Z	goose	jrib	could you pastebin your script for me to look at? I've never written bash before, so this is an adventure for me
2010-02-04T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	goose	that's it:  while true; do COMMAND; done
2010-02-04T02:56:00.000Z	goose	jrib	then run it on cron, screen, or...?
2010-02-04T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	goose	wherever you want.  Do you understand why it works?
2010-02-04T02:57:00.000Z	goose	jrib	it's an infinite loop, from what I can see. I don't see how it finds out whether or not the program is running or not, but I can kinda see it's "structure"
2010-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	goose	try putting a command in there, like mplayer somefile
2010-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	goose	jrib	I should mention though, this program forks itself into the background after launching, which is why I'm worried about it re-launching itself
2010-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	goose	ah, then this method won't work
2010-02-04T03:01:00.000Z	jrib	goose	monit looks interesting
