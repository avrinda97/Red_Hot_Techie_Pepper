2006-10-30T16:58:00.000Z	valberg	cge	nope

2006-10-30T17:00:00.000Z	valberg	cge	the underprocess pre-removal script returns a 102
2006-10-30T17:00:00.000Z	valberg	cge	something about a dangling symlink
2006-10-30T17:00:00.000Z	cge	valberg	Blank the prerm script in /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGE-NAME.prerm
2006-10-30T17:01:00.000Z	valberg	cge	just remove or delete contents ?
2006-10-31T17:01:00.000Z	cge	valberg	Delete all the contents except for the #!/bin/sh line
2006-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	valberg	cge	and then what ?
2006-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	cge	valberg	That's it
2006-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	valberg	cge	then just remove it ?
2006-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	cge	valberg	Just do that, and then remove it, yes.
2006-10-31T17:03:00.000Z	valberg	cge	thanks!
2006-10-31T17:04:00.000Z	cge	valberg	There might be some files left over that didn't get removed, but it will at least fix apt.
2006-10-31T17:04:00.000Z	valberg	cge	the package acpid and acpi-support are bothering me as well
2006-10-31T17:04:00.000Z	valberg	cge	are they important ?
2006-10-31T17:04:00.000Z	cge	valberg	You want them installed, probably.
2006-10-31T17:05:00.000Z	valberg	cge	k... it just fails to set them up... :S
2006-10-31T17:05:00.000Z	cge	valberg	You might try reinstalling them
2006-10-31T17:05:00.000Z	cge	valberg	If that fails, you could post the error in #flood
2006-10-31T17:09:00.000Z	valberg	cge	it worked :) thanks a lot... you just saved my sleep :)
