2005-04-09T10:07:00.000Z	saik0		hey, what would be the easiest way to steam audio from my linux box to a mac?
2005-04-09T10:07:00.000Z	saik0		is there an easy way?
2005-04-09T10:07:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	I ended up just using samba
2005-04-09T10:09:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	that would work yes, can you assign different 'profiles' in iTunes. I wouldnt want to scare my roomate with new music
2005-04-22T06:04:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	you can't use random programs, but you can use SA
2005-04-22T06:04:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	random programs, it's evolution for crying out loud. and it's been supported in previous versions
2005-04-22T06:06:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	using any arbitrary program as a filter was supported in warty?
2005-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	according to Guerin he configured it using evolution 2.03
2005-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	spamassassin?  yes, that is supported fine.
2005-04-22T06:09:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	I cant seem to get evolution 2.2.1.1 to send messages to spamd or clamd
2005-04-22T06:10:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	I think you're mixing up what I said
2005-04-22T06:10:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	evolution can use spamassassin just fine, afaik, but you can't configure it to use any random program you like
2005-04-22T06:12:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	Alright so right now with spamd running evolution is filtering messages without any addidional configuration?
2005-04-22T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	as far as I know, it doesn't use spamd at all
2005-04-22T06:14:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	::confused:: so evolution uses spamassassin without spamd?
2005-04-22T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	as far as I know, yes
2005-04-22T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	remember, spamassassin is also just a command line program
2005-04-22T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	spamd is just an optimisation so perl doesn't have to start up all the time
2005-04-22T06:18:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	right. thanks. I guess i'm justnot used to things 'just work'ing in linux yet =)
2005-05-05T09:12:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	say it is'nt so
2005-09-19T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	using backports at this point is silly
2005-09-23T12:10:00.000Z	saik0	bob2	i thought it was oo-boon-too.
2005-09-23T12:10:00.000Z	bob2	saik0	well, it's not the same "boon" as the word boon
