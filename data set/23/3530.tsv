2008-06-13T10:19:00.000Z	s3a		how do i upload a torrent using transmission in ubuntu 8.04
2008-06-13T10:20:00.000Z	negge	s3a	do you mean create a torrent or just seed a torrent?
2008-06-13T10:21:00.000Z	s3a	negge	like my laptop crashed and i backed up its files and i have no removable device large enuf to transfer the data back so i want to use torrent since i just recently got high speed? is transfering via torrent safe? it should be right as long as im the only one who has my created .torrent file, right?
2008-06-13T10:22:00.000Z	negge	s3a	so you mean you're going to create a torrent of all your files and seed it then download it on another computer?
2008-06-13T10:23:00.000Z	s3a	negge	i have like 4 gbs but the largest removable device is like 2gb and i have all night for it to transfer since im gona go sleep right after
2008-06-13T10:24:00.000Z	negge	s3a	it's okay to transfer the files via bittorrent as long as you make sure noone else gets a copy of the torrent file, but a better and faster alternative would be to burn it all to a DVD or alternative hook up another computer to your network and copy the files over
2008-06-13T10:25:00.000Z	s3a	negge	i rely wouldnt wana waste a disk for this and i dont want to keep changing my wires configuration so can u plz tell me how to upload torrents? :)
2008-06-13T10:27:00.000Z	negge	s3a	if your data isn't worth an empty DVD then it certainly can't be worth hustling it to another computer via BT, but anyway. You create the torrent file (I think Transmission can do that), then you open it on the machine with the files and wait for it to finish hashing, then open the same torrent file on the target computer and wait until the transfer is done
2008-06-13T10:29:00.000Z	s3a	negge	wat tracker do i use? and how does it matter?
2008-06-13T10:30:00.000Z	negge	s3a	ah yeah I completely forgot about the trackers...
2008-06-13T10:34:00.000Z	s3a	negge	does private to this tracker mean that it will be private and no1 can leech it?!
2008-06-13T10:34:00.000Z	negge	s3a	no
2008-06-13T10:34:00.000Z	s3a	negge	wat does it mean then?
2008-06-13T10:35:00.000Z	negge	s3a	why don't you just spend 20 cents on a DVD?
2008-06-13T10:35:00.000Z	s3a	negge	cuz my data is not organized the way i want it yet, i like i want to put them in proper folders then burn wen its on other comp and i have alot of things so i want to do it over a period of time
2008-06-13T10:36:00.000Z	negge	s3a	whatever, do it however you want it
2008-06-13T10:39:00.000Z	s3a	negge	ill send it using msn messenger since i have two accounts
2008-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	s3a	negge	as a .zip file
2008-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	negge	s3a	usually that takes forever 'cause MSN transfers are most of the time slow do to some port not being forwarded
2008-06-13T10:41:00.000Z	s3a	negge	well im compressing it all hopefully it should fit in a 2 gb flash drive, then ill try all else but it's still compressing now, anyway..
2008-06-13T10:42:00.000Z	negge	s3a	the compression ratio depends on what kind of files you're compressing
2008-06-13T10:43:00.000Z	s3a	negge	most of them are jpegs (school notes)
2008-06-13T10:45:00.000Z	negge	s3a	okay. I don't think you'll be able to fit it all onto 2 GB but compressing is good anyway
