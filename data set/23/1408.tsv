2010-04-14T09:03:00.000Z	awesome_guest		do you know how to disable a lot of graphical eye candy?
2010-04-14T09:04:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	I have a really candy-free setup, but biggest issue I see is people that have Compiz turned on, check to see if it's enabled
2010-04-14T09:05:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	how?
2010-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	it's in the Settings somewhere...looking now, give me a sec and I'll give exact location
2010-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	System>Preferences>Appearance
2010-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	>Visual Effects: None
2010-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	I actually already did that
2010-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	Yeah, that turns off Compiz GUI-style
2010-04-14T09:10:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	Right about the GUI way, users will never learn about coreutils w/o reading man pages, &c...the GUI hides all that from the user
2010-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	are there any specific utilities for writes to the hard drive?
2010-04-14T09:22:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	Ubuntu is a bonanza for a developer. If you're programming in modern, OO-oriented languages you have access to everything you could possibly need to develop code
2010-04-14T09:24:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	yes, I've had lots of fun developing on unix systems.. maintained by other people, thankfully
2010-04-14T09:25:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	you say "maintained by other people" as if maintenance is a chore :)
2010-04-14T09:25:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	well, I am not actually writing code while doing this :)
2010-04-14T09:26:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	a lot of ppl seem to be holding out on SSDs until there is TRIM support
2010-04-14T09:29:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	mm, intel put out a windows utility that does TRIM
2010-04-14T09:30:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	no I mean in Linux
2010-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	I've seen Ubuntu run on an SSD, and it's pretty snappy. I've no idea about lifespan besides knowing it's less. But the upside is that if you carry a laptop around a lot it's MUCH sturdier with an SSD
2010-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	that is true, and I do have a laptop
2010-04-14T09:36:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	although the number that really counts is how many big writes to the disk there have been
2010-04-14T09:36:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	yep, which is why I've gotta go hunting through this operating system looking for all that crappy code
2010-04-14T09:41:00.000Z	wyclif_	awesome_guest	I would think it would be something that breaks down the contents of /proc/stat for you
2010-04-14T09:45:00.000Z	awesome_guest	wyclif_	thanks
