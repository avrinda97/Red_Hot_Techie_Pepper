2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	jdub		who here is running on a very high resolution display?
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	jdub		> 1600x1200 ?
2005-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	jdub		excellent
2005-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	jdub		either unreadably small or it just looks silly
2005-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	128x126 dpi
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	yes
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	res?
2005-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	giard: can you do a test for me?
2005-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	what's up?
2005-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	giard: first, is the text on your login screen really small?
2005-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	can you define "really small"?
2005-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	nope mine is fine
2005-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	if you type xdpyinfo | grep resolution, what's the dpi?
2005-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	please don't suggest that
2005-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	suggest what?
2005-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	don't suggest 'sudo passwd root'
2005-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	rellik	jdub	that website you refered that guy to has some info but for non-nuubs that just need a fix the answer is simple: sudo passwd root
2005-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	that's not the right answer
2005-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	there is a good reason why the root account is disabled
2005-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	telling people to enable it is not the right solution
2005-02-12T11:34:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	what you need is a netbios resolver for nsswitch
2005-02-12T11:43:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	look at winbind
2005-02-12T11:44:00.000Z	jdub	rellik	it includes an nss module that may help
