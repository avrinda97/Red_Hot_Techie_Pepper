2006-07-15T05:29:00.000Z	Warbo		I'm finally making the switch back to spatial mode now :)
2006-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	is that the mode where nautilus remembers icon positions?
2006-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	"manual" remembers icon positions, spatial opens each folder in a new window and remembers their size and position
2006-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	cool, I've been wanting to try that... Still missing the old Mac System 7 Finder sometimes...
2006-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	I've never used a Mac, but the Amiga Workbench does it
2006-07-31T16:31:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	you could powercycle
2006-07-31T16:32:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	It does it at boot, there's no preventing it unless I uninstall whatever is causing it. I can't uninstall stuff since sudo isn't working (presumably since it is getting no cycles)
2006-07-31T16:34:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	perhaps you need to boot from a live CD and disable the iwlist call from there
2006-07-31T16:37:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	It is to do with my RaLink WiFi card. It did this when I plugged it in and booted (PCI), and I "solved" it by moving everything beginning with "iw" out of /sbin, then moved them back after booting. Since I haven't been at home for a week, this HD was booting fine in another computer without a WiFi card, I just forgot about the problem when I turned it on in my own computer just now. I would prefer to solve the proble
2006-07-31T16:39:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	I've got ralink working - are you on the latest kernel?
2006-07-31T16:39:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	No, 2.6.15-23-k7. Changing my kernel will require the creation of a new boot CD
2006-07-31T16:49:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	if you can't sudo, there is no way you can kill iwlist without forcing a shutdown.
2006-07-31T16:50:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	Do you know if it is essential to my networking (I use wired and wireless)? Otherwise I might just move it out of $PATH from a LiveCD
2006-07-31T16:51:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	I'm not sure, but since it's called automatically on boot, I would assume that it's needed during wireless setup.
2006-07-31T07:46:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	no servers needed, you just have to setup NAT. firestarter is one way to do that
2006-07-31T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	dadgumit: don't feed the troll pls
2006-08-14T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	I get the same here. I'd call it a bug
2006-08-14T13:36:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	OK, just that I wasn't sure due to my third-party reops (but I have disabled them all temporarily)
2006-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	just get rid of ubuntu-desktop. It is merely a metapackage that you don't need in day-to-day running.
2006-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	reinstalling it before the next upgrade will be fully sufficient.
2006-12-10T16:33:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	ernz can't send files to his Bluetooth phone, the passkey doesn't work (I had this problem ages ago, and forgot which /etc file I screwed with)
2006-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	soundray	Warbo	can't you grep in /etc for some string that might be in the changed file?
2007-03-29T10:57:00.000Z	Warbo	soundray	Oops
