2009-07-03T02:05:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	so apt-got libcanberra-gtk0
2009-07-03T02:07:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	please read scrollback; that's not the issue
2009-07-03T02:07:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	sorry too much work
2009-07-03T02:09:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	he might need libc6-dev to build something... but afaik cicada just wanted to install a demo game fro Linux Publishing and who knows what that entails
2009-07-03T02:11:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	try lsmod |grep agpgart
2009-07-03T02:12:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	nothing
2009-07-03T02:12:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	then no 3d
2009-07-03T02:13:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	agp = ?
2009-07-03T02:13:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	and that wasn't really the question. i'm just wondering which driver is in use
2009-07-03T02:13:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	try lsmod and see which video driver is loaded
2009-07-03T02:14:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	i see an intel_agp
2009-07-03T02:15:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	are any other modules listed on the same line that would infer that they depend on intel_agp
2009-07-03T02:15:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	no
2009-07-03T02:21:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	not interested in reconfiguring... just wondering what i'm using
2009-07-03T02:25:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	since ubuntu has weened itself off the dependancy of the /etc/X11/xorg.config file there's no easy way of readily finding that out now unless you do specifically tell it to use a certain driver through reconfiguring... that being said, dmesg might tell you
2009-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	Xorg.0.log: (II) intel: Driver for Intel Integrated Graphics Chipsets: i810,
2009-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	heh.
2009-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	so which driver is that?
2009-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	"Intel" is the name :P
2009-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	i'm just glad i'm not using vesa
2009-07-03T02:27:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	mine is nvidia
2009-07-03T02:28:00.000Z	raylu	bucky	lucky :P
2009-07-03T02:28:00.000Z	bucky	raylu	there have been performance issues with intel video and flash.. wasn't that what started this conversation?
