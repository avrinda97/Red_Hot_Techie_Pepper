2008-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	do you have emerald theme manager installed?
2008-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	search synaptic for it..
2008-06-10T07:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	open synaptic,  go to settings/repositories, make sure all the boxes on the first tab are checked,
2008-06-10T07:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	what versionof ubuntu are you using?
2008-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	ok, did you install it?
2008-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	ok... you just didn't have the right repositories enabled, thats all.
2008-06-10T07:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	indeedo.. most of them you can drag/drop int he emerald window(i believe its under system/prefs)
2008-06-10T07:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	try google, there's a site dedicated to emerald themes, and i think there's also some good ones at gnome-look.org (or kde-look.org if you use kde
2008-06-10T07:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mystery_	add remove programs is specific programs.. synaptic is packages
