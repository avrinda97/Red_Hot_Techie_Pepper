2008-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	zetheroo		hi there,
2008-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	Welcome do you have a question?
2008-03-03T06:01:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	do you have a problem?
2008-03-03T06:04:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	i recently had a client come in for help with their Ubuntu running laptop.... they told me that they had a Dual Boot system with Windows XP and Ubuntu Gutsy. One day she decided to boot into Windows XP instead of Ubuntu and after selecting Windows from the GRUB menu the, GRUB shot out the infamous Error 17.......
2008-03-03T06:05:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	what is error 17?
2008-03-03T06:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	now when booting with the Live CD and checking out the Partitions in Gparted I can no longer see an ext3 partition
2008-03-03T06:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	there is only a huge 60GB NTFS partition, a 7GB Fat32 partition (the compaq recovery partition), and the 600 MB swap
2008-03-03T06:07:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	you said dual boot is that Windows and Linux?
2008-03-03T06:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	any thoughts on the matter? .... seems like linux has just vanished
2008-03-03T06:08:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	I said ... Windows Xp and Gutsy
2008-03-03T06:09:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	maybe have to install gutsy again but when it comes to the format option leave the files as is
2008-03-03T06:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	what do you mean ?.... there was a lot of data on the Linux side..... won't reinstalling Gutsy wipe all that out?
2008-03-03T06:11:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	if you use exsisting Linux partitions then you may not lose the data
2008-03-03T06:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	but there are no existing Linux partitions.... no ext3
2008-03-03T06:13:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	then a Gutsy install will create them
2008-03-03T06:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	is it possible that Gparted is miss-reading the partitions?
2008-03-03T06:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	where did the ext3 partition go?
2008-03-03T06:15:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	Gparted is good I use it myself I think you have lost data
2008-03-03T06:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	how could that happen?.....
2008-03-03T06:17:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	I think it could be too late to ponder on the reason why
2008-03-03T06:19:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	well why would someone continue using Linux if they can loose their entire OS and all their data without explanation....
2008-03-03T06:20:00.000Z	Antkin	zetheroo	I have lost tons of data to Windows crashes over the years
2008-03-03T06:22:00.000Z	zetheroo	Antkin	I am just saying that people have a hard time switching to Linux already ... and then to just tell them that all their data was lost for no reason whatsoever is NOT going to improve relations with Linux
