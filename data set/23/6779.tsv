2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	where do you want this mounted at boot ?
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	?
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	where do you want it mounted ?
2009-08-25T19:54:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	if you answer my question i can tell you exactly what to put in /etc/fstab
2009-08-25T19:55:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	if you wanted it mounted at /media/disk on boot then
2009-08-25T19:55:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	1) make sure /media/disk exists
2009-08-25T19:55:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	2) add the following line to fstab
2009-08-25T19:55:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	/dev/sda6     /media/disk    ext4    defaults    0  0
2009-08-25T19:56:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	have you formatted the partition ?
2009-08-25T19:56:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	just because fdisk says it's ext doesn't mean it's actually formatted
2009-08-25T19:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	cornet	I'm formating again right now
2009-08-25T19:57:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	k
2009-08-25T19:57:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	you don't need the UUID for fstab
2009-08-25T19:58:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	you can just use the device name instead
2009-08-25T19:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	cornet	ok formated and mounted now I see the partition can you give me the the line again to have it auto mounted please
2009-08-25T20:00:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	/dev/sda6     /media/disk    ext4    defaults    0  0
2009-08-25T20:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	cornet	works great thanks. now how do I get my mounted partitions not to display icons on desktop?
2009-08-25T20:06:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	um you can disable completely in gconf
2009-08-25T20:07:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	i think if you mounting outside of /media then it won't
2009-08-25T20:07:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	so say mount it at /store
2009-08-26T03:25:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	sorry
2009-08-26T03:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	cornet	no problem. you got excited lol
2009-08-26T03:26:00.000Z	cornet	IdleOne	too much wine
