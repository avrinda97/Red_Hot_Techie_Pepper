2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	ima-n00b		hey all.... does anyone know about php and ldap
2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	what is the problem
2007-12-19T14:55:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	you can install the "php5-ldap" package
2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	assuming you're using php5
2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	cool... and that will enable ldap support (i mean... i wont have to recompile php with the enable ldap switch)
2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	yeah.. php5
2007-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	yes, take a look in synaptic, there is a whole bunch of packages named php-XXXX or php5-XXX to enable various things
2007-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	thanks... i always forget the little things lol.. and to think they let me use linux ;)
2007-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	its very rare that you need to manually compile stuff in things as common as the LAMP stack
2007-12-19T14:59:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	thanks heaps :)
2007-12-19T15:06:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	and you call yourself a n00b...
2007-12-19T15:17:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	lol... yeah.... i know enough to be  dangerous... and in comparison to some of you guys.. i probably dont know much at all.. i mean.. it took me a few days to figure active directory authentication out so it would link into the windows domain
2007-12-19T15:18:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	that not a trivial thing to figure out at all... you can be proud of yourself
2007-12-19T15:19:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	ill be proud when i can get gutsy to do it
2007-12-19T15:19:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	for some reason gutsy doesnt work the same as feisty, edgy and dapper
2007-12-19T15:21:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	many ways to walk that path, and many different end results, I do wish for once to hear someone trying to auth windows into an openldap domain and not the other way around
2007-12-19T15:22:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	lol... when i have enough time to figure it out it will be done... only prob is im not sure how it will handle group policy
2007-12-19T15:22:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	its... kinda nice to lock all users down lol (or should that be mwahahahahaha)
2007-12-19T15:23:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	I say to hell with group policy, everything it does can be achieved with some startup scripts, or maybe someone ported puppet already
2007-12-19T15:23:00.000Z	ima-n00b	ifireball	puppet???
2007-12-19T15:24:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	google it, thats the best thing to happen in UNIX sysadmin (imo...)
2007-12-19T15:25:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	http://ifireball.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/excited-about-puppet/
2007-12-19T15:26:00.000Z	ifireball	ima-n00b	don't the ususal pam-ldap/pam-kreberos/winbind tricks work with gusty?
