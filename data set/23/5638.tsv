2006-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	rcarr		significant espescially for kubuntu users
2006-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	rcarr		(me!)
2006-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	rcarr		I thought kubuntu dapper was really unpolished
2006-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	rcarr		Yes Brett
2006-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	rcarr		It's at Release Candidate stage now, and is set to come out in 6 days
2006-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	rcarr		NetDog
2006-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	rcarr		unless you login from a console, and run "startx" to start up your xserver
2006-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	rcarr		.xinitrc is not what you are looking for
2006-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	rcarr		Yes Brett
2006-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	rcarr		Heh, no problem
2006-10-20T12:21:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	so then how do i set it to start fluxbox by default?
2006-10-20T12:22:00.000Z	rcarr	NetDog	Do you login via KDM or GDM?
2006-10-20T12:22:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	gdm
2006-10-20T12:23:00.000Z	rcarr	NetDog	And fluxbox doesn't show up under  the list of sessions you can choose?
2006-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	I swear i didnt see that
2006-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	thanks
2006-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	I start fluxbox,but when i right-click there is no menu only the word fluxbox,
2006-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	what are possible reasons for this
2006-10-20T12:32:00.000Z	rcarr	NetDog	I have never used fluxbox, but it's possible it requires manual configuration to add menu stuff
2006-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	how do you change the login or ubuntu greeter?
2006-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	rcarr	NetDog	You mean the login screen theme?
2006-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	rcarr	NetDog	I recall you saying you used GDM, I think you can find gdm themes at www.gnome-look.org
2006-10-20T14:28:00.000Z	NetDog	rcarr	no i mean, using either a console as a greeter or a different gui greeter
