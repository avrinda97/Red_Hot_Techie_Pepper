2008-01-31T01:51:00.000Z	lubos_		how do I select which locale I want to compile if /etc/locale.gen file is missing on ubuntu?
2008-01-31T01:52:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	install and configure the package localeconf. i have no idea why they diverged from the debian way of doing it...
2008-01-31T01:52:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	thanks
2008-01-31T01:57:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	localeconf installed and configured to use debconf.. any more hints pls?
2008-01-31T01:57:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	dpkg-reconfigure localeconf
2008-01-31T01:59:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	it gives me the same configuration windows I had during instalation. Aksing if I want to use debconf to manage
2008-01-31T02:00:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	oh, either something changed or i'm wrong. please try dpkg-reconfigure locales. but i think reconfiguring localeconf did the trick
2008-01-31T02:02:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	it seems that dpkg-reconfigure locales just trigers locale-gen command and generate previous locales but I ned to add more :-)
2008-01-31T02:04:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	yeah, i know what you mean. installing localeconf shoud do the trick. but it does not. sorry - no more ideas. the ubutu devs splitted the locale package in two some time ago
2008-01-31T02:05:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	did you answered affrimatively the debconf question in localeconf?
2008-01-31T02:05:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	yes I did .. do I want to use debconf ?
2008-01-31T02:06:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	yes
2008-01-31T02:06:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	maybe look in /usr/share/doc/localeconf for help. i really have no more ideas
2008-01-31T02:06:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	Replace existing locale configuration files?
2008-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	i don't understand your last question
2008-01-31T02:08:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	that was from localeconf configuration. Now it works... I needed to answer yes for debconf and yes toReplace existing locale configuration files
2008-01-31T02:08:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	oh, glad that it works now
2008-01-31T02:10:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	thanks man but I still think that this is not all I need..:-( this is asking me for default locale
2008-01-31T02:11:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	and it does not offer you a list of possible locales to install? it should
2008-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	NO :-) it was so simple in debian and they say that ubuntu is user friendly !! :-)
2008-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	yep. but i'm not able to help you further because i use debian proper
2008-01-31T02:13:00.000Z	lubos_	velko	thanks anyway..
2008-01-31T02:14:00.000Z	velko	lubos_	np man :-)
