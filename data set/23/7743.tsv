2005-05-10T14:58:00.000Z	confrey		hi everybody
2005-05-10T14:58:00.000Z	confrey		is there a way to run phpgroupware in ubuntu?
2005-05-10T14:59:00.000Z	shoreflyer	confrey	yes, you have to install apache/php/mysql
2005-05-10T14:59:00.000Z	confrey	shoreflyer	oh, I have already installed all them
2005-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	shoreflyer		then follow the instructions for installing groupware on the server
2005-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	confrey	shoreflyer	but at localhost/phpgroupware/setup isn't anything
2005-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	shoreflyer		be sure you have the apache running
2005-05-10T15:01:00.000Z	shoreflyer		and make sure the apache is configured to parse .php .inc files with php
2005-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	confrey		yes, is working, and in http://localhost I can see apache2-default and phpmyadmin
2005-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	confrey	shoreflyer	yes, is working, and in http://localhost I can see apache2-default and phpmyadmin
2005-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	shoreflyer		phpmyadmin is good
2005-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	shoreflyer		then php is definetly configured
2005-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	shoreflyer		all i can tell you is to follow the instructions to install
2005-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	shoreflyer		see if the directory index also has index.php
2005-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	shoreflyer		in the apache conf
2005-05-10T15:04:00.000Z	shoreflyer		anyone here know the fglrx drivers and how to make them work with a ati mobility 9600?
2005-05-10T15:05:00.000Z	confrey	shoreflyer	I can't do it alone, can you guide me?
2005-05-10T15:06:00.000Z	shoreflyer		i haven't installed this in over a year
2005-05-10T15:06:00.000Z	shoreflyer		so i guess they have changed a lot
2005-05-10T15:06:00.000Z	shoreflyer		but it should be really straight forward
2005-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	shoreflyer		anyhow i have to get going
2005-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	shoreflyer		cheers, hope you manage
2005-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	confrey	shoreflyer	apache.conf is very obscure for me... I tried to add to it a .conf found in phpgroupware docs, but it doesn't work
