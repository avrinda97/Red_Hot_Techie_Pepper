2008-09-02T08:45:00.000Z	bluefoxx		err, i just lost my title bars
2008-09-02T08:46:00.000Z	bluefoxx		rebooted after updates and now they're gone.[as if windows eating my data partition when i go to back it up wasnt enough]
2008-09-02T08:46:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	compiz?
2008-09-02T08:46:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	yes. fresh install
2008-09-02T08:46:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	Look for the window decorations extension.
2008-09-02T08:47:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	kk, wait
2008-09-02T08:48:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	Do you keep changing your screen resolution?
2008-09-02T08:49:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	no. keeping it at 1152x864@75[since it wont let me do 1280x960@72 without hacking xorg.conf]
2008-09-02T08:49:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	the window decorations extension is on
2008-09-02T08:51:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	but i still have no borders/title bars
2008-09-02T08:52:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	Not sure, then.  What's the most recent thing you changed?
2008-09-02T08:53:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	i dont recall...installed this afternoon and upraded/customised with a bunch of packages i had stored on my array since its too slow to download
2008-09-02T08:54:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	brb, im praying to the pixels that its just some weird fluke and am restarting x
2008-09-02T08:55:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	didnt work...
2008-09-02T08:56:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	ok, i disabled compiz and they come back
2008-09-02T08:56:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	It used to be necessary to install "emerald", the window decorator.  Try looking for that, but my information might be two years out of date.
2008-09-02T08:57:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	If you can't find emerald, take a look around the settings in the window decoration extension, try a few different themes... just generally poke around.
2008-09-02T08:57:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	but there shouldnt be any reason i cant use compiz...my card is good enough[it costed someone enough]
2008-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	emerald does nothing for me
2008-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	dmwit	bluefoxx	Can you double-check that the window decoration extension is on and running correctly?
2008-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	it is on but i dont know if its 'running correctly'. how should it look[other than having the bloody borders]. also, my transparency is screwed up too, terminals i could see under before now are all-white, or if compiz is off then show the section of my desktop background its over
2008-09-02T09:23:00.000Z	bluefoxx	dmwit	it is on but i dont know if its 'running correctly'. how should it look[other than having the bloody borders]. also, my transparency is screwed up too, terminals i could see under before now are all-white, or if compiz is off then show the section of my desktop background its over
