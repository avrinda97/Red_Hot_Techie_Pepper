2006-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	jadaz87		has anyone had success with installing ndiswrapper in ubuntu?
2006-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	sure
2006-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	i keep running into the cannot find kernel source problem
2006-03-19T16:51:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	in that case - install the kernel source =)
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	oh ok thanks because i was afraid i whould end up not using ubuntu :-Z i am on suse 10.0 right now :-\
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	I haven't used Suse in years so I don't know how easy it is to use, but Ubuntu has so far the best distribution I've tried/used :)
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	what you could do is try "uname -r" in console to find out which kernel version you're using and then do a search for a kernel-headers package for that version :) If you use synaptic or adept that should be easy :)
2006-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	yes i know that is why i wanted to get ndiswrapper to work on ubuntu :-)
2006-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	oh ok so just install all the kernel headers?
2006-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	yes - the one that matches your kernel version
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	because there are a couple i think i have to install the 386 version
2006-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	that is what the kernel messages say when i first boot up before the ubuntu splash screen comes up
2006-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	if you write "uname -r" in a console window, what output does that give you?
2006-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	it says 2.6.12-9-386
2006-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	in that case yes the package you want is linux-headers-2.6.12-9-386 :)
2006-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	so i guess all i will have to install from synaptic is "make" and the "linux-headers-2.6.12-9-386" packages
2006-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	ok thanks :) i will be back once i have loaded UBUNTU and the ndiswrapper and i will be back here to tell you of my success
2006-03-20T17:01:00.000Z	weedar	jadaz87	excellent. I should stay online for about an hour or so. If I should be gone - good luck! :)
2006-03-20T17:01:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	thanks :)
2006-03-20T17:01:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	off i go!!! :)
2006-03-20T10:38:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	i got ndiswrapper install and it says that the driver is install and the device is present
2006-03-20T10:38:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	and i configured the wlan0 with both the network configuration card and iwconfig
2006-03-20T10:39:00.000Z	jadaz87	weedar	but i could not even go to yahoo.com or get on Xirc
