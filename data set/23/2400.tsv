2009-10-27T14:48:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	::  ya i installed virtual box
2009-10-27T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	also have a look at the vbox manpage "nat" and "network-bridge" and decide what you need
2009-10-27T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	and help you will get in #vbox   the freenode-channel of virtualbox
2009-12-06T14:45:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	man wget
2009-12-28T02:57:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	error?
2010-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	you mean hardware-errors?
2010-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	yes...what to do?
2010-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	buy a new drive
2010-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	correcting them will not solve the problem
2010-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	i found a tool known as badblocks and it shows the badblocks
2010-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	yes but ignoring them with that tool is not solving the problem, so buy a new disk
2010-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	i heard that in windows there is something like marking the bad sectors so that the filesystem wont try to access those sectors
2010-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	is there something like that in linux
2010-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	again, that is not solving the problem, the disk still is broken and normally there are coming mor bad sectors, so if you like your files, buy a new harddisc
2010-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	actually can you help me in fixing the things in that way without buying a new one??
2010-06-29T16:37:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	you
2010-06-29T16:40:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	what??
2010-06-29T16:40:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	you are the best for analysing your logs, not a program
2010-06-29T16:41:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	i mean the program which can generate neat html reports
2010-06-29T16:41:00.000Z	iceroot	ranjan	awstats i guess
2010-06-29T16:41:00.000Z	ranjan	iceroot	thank you let me see :)
