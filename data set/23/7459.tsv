2005-07-27T10:35:00.000Z	bob2	vader	yes
2005-07-27T10:28:00.000Z	bob2	vader	?
2005-07-27T10:29:00.000Z	vader	bob2	do you know how to get my battery status to work?
2005-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	vader	bob2	acpi -v gives me 0.07 and the license and the no warranty
2005-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	bob2	vader	you need to be way more specific than that
2005-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	bob2	vader	you mean 'acpi -V'
2005-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	vader	so, paste the output of 'acpi -V' to #flood
2005-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	vader	bob2	url please
2005-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	vader	?
2005-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	vader	the irc channel #flood
2005-07-27T10:35:00.000Z	vader	bob2	is it the freenode #flood?
2005-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	vader	bob2	do you see it there?
2005-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	vader	this will be a very frustrating conversation if you don't read what I say
2005-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	vader	'acpi -V' is not what you just ran
2005-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	vader	bob2	sorry out that
2005-07-27T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	vader	and what does 'uname -r' say?
2005-07-27T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	vader	your kernel is pretty old, perhaps uprading to hoary would give you acpi support
2005-07-27T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	vader	or maybe your computer predates acpi
2005-07-27T10:52:00.000Z	vader	bob2	it is p2 366 with 256 mb ram.....just so you know
2005-07-27T10:52:00.000Z	bob2	vader	then it almost certainly doesn't have acpi
2005-07-27T10:53:00.000Z	vader	bob2	ok, so it won't work even with HOARY then?
2005-07-27T10:53:00.000Z	bob2	vader	you don't have any acpi hardware
2005-07-27T10:11:00.000Z	vader	bob2	when you got me to do the modprobe apm last night.... it will even tell me when the battery is fully charged now, thanx dude
