2004-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	mjr		as such, ndiswrapper is merely ugly, but out of necessity :
2004-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	mjr		:)
2004-12-06T06:31:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	are you happy with ndiswrapper?
2004-12-10T15:12:00.000Z	mjr	king_arthur	computer/system settings/resolution
2004-12-10T15:12:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	yup
2004-12-10T15:13:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	I do it all the time and if I log out or restart the computer, I have to set it again and again and again
2004-12-10T15:13:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	yes it does
2004-12-10T15:14:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 it does ask but it doesn't store... kind of weird
2004-12-10T15:14:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 Actually I was surprised when I created a new user only to find out that this one was logging in all times at the correct screen resolution
2004-12-10T15:15:00.000Z	mjr	king_arthur	ok. Bugger.
2004-12-10T15:16:00.000Z	mjr	king_arthur	then I don't really know what to try next
2004-12-10T15:16:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 I think the problem is with session manager
2004-12-10T15:16:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 I found I have little control over it
2004-12-10T15:17:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 perhaps writing to the package manager could be an idea... :-)
2004-12-10T15:17:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	 interesting... and than?
2004-12-10T15:24:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	you still there?
2004-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	mjr	king_arthur	I am, but you probably mean Treenaks
2004-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	totally frozen to dead in cold lapland?
2004-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	I see :-(
2004-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	must be cold but nice up there
2004-12-10T15:27:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	yup
2004-12-10T15:28:00.000Z	king_arthur	mjr	that's not to bad we have 6 here
2004-12-10T06:56:00.000Z	mjr	king_arthur	yes, yes it is :)
