2005-12-17T17:14:00.000Z	aSt3raL		anyone know how to get lsmod to search for one module?
2005-12-17T17:14:00.000Z	aSt3raL		ok
2005-12-17T17:14:00.000Z	aSt3raL		well my module is loaded

2005-12-17T17:16:00.000Z	aSt3raL		its not detecting the hardware
2005-12-17T17:16:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	in what sense is it not detected?
2005-12-17T17:18:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	ignore it
2005-12-17T17:18:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	because it's of no use
2005-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	great, no need to mess around in /etc/modules.conf
2005-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	define "no device"
2005-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	"not listed in a gui tool" is not a useful piece of information, tho
2005-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	just run "iwconfig"
2005-12-17T17:21:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	ignore the gui tool
2005-12-17T17:21:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	does "iwconfig" see it?
2005-12-17T17:22:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	what are the last ten lines of dmesg? (#flood)
2005-12-17T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	then the driver isn't working
2005-12-17T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	we need the dmesg output
2005-12-17T17:27:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	that's not very useful output
2005-12-17T17:28:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	how many wireless nics do you have?
2005-12-17T17:32:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	no, don't, there's no point
2005-12-17T17:33:00.000Z	bob2	aSt3raL	it is of no use
2005-12-17T17:33:00.000Z	aSt3raL	bob2	why do you say that?
