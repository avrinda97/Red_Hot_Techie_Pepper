2008-05-17T01:56:00.000Z	amenado		ldiamond-> which tool within initrd-tools are you looking for?
2008-05-17T01:57:00.000Z	amenado		ldiamond-> thats been replaced with mkinitramfs
2008-05-17T01:58:00.000Z	amenado		tim167-> not two devices, perhaps two partitions?
2008-05-17T01:58:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	/dev/sda and /dev/sdb
2008-05-17T02:01:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	yep, and one seems like an unmodifiable one
2008-05-17T02:01:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	i feel ripped off
2008-05-17T02:03:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	sda, sda1, sda2, sdb, loop0
2008-05-17T02:47:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	i installed ubuntu to a usb disk, but i did something wrong in previous attempts so i think grub hangs, i want to remove or reinstall it
2008-05-17T02:47:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	i get a black screeen saying 'GRUB _' and nothing more
2008-05-17T02:50:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	 yes, definitely the same usb drive, shows up as /dev/sda and /dev/sdb
2008-05-17T02:51:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	but that is another usb drive, im trying several models (i really want to get a usb install working!)
2008-05-17T02:51:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	booting from Live cdrom
2008-05-17T02:51:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	and after installing i try to boot from sda
2008-05-17T02:52:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	which is the large device on that usb stick, sdb is only 1.5 MB, some kind of 'security' thing...
2008-05-17T02:53:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	one usb stick shows up as /dev/sda of 4.1 Gig, and /dev/sdb of 1.5 MB
2008-05-17T02:53:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	so the larg 'device' is where i installed ubuntu to
2008-05-17T02:55:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	no! :) it is definitely just one usb stick, which shows up as two devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb
2008-05-17T02:55:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	i think this is strange too, but i swear its like that
2008-05-17T02:57:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	its probably some security feature of this usb stick, which is useless to me, so i feel ripped off frankly...i just wanted a usb stick period
2008-05-17T02:58:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	to make matters worse, there is only a windows .exe on this 1.5 MB 'device'
2008-05-17T02:58:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	called 'lock.exe' and a pdf manual
2008-05-17T02:59:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	zMATE PEN, 4GB www.dane-elec.com
2008-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	tim167	amenado	anyway, this other usb stick doesnt have this wierdness, so it should be useable, but as i said, i did something wrong with installing grub on it, do you know how to fix / remove/ reinstall grub ?
