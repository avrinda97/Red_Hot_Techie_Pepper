2006-06-08T14:32:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		googling works wonders for simple queries lilke this :)
2006-06-08T14:32:00.000Z	bernier	shamrock_uk	yes it shows up as a usb device
2006-06-08T14:32:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		in that case, just try opening it up?
2006-06-08T14:32:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		you may have to browse a folder or two
2006-06-08T14:32:00.000Z	bernier	shamrock_uk	i can also open it and there's many files in it which i dont know what they're used to
2006-06-08T14:33:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		but with many mp3 devices, it's simply a matter of dragging and dropping
2006-06-08T14:33:00.000Z	bernier	shamrock_uk	it aint that with the sony's
2006-06-08T14:33:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		hmm...no sign of your music files then bernier? bet that lousy software converts it somehow...aargh, this is why free formats are wonderful ;)
2006-06-08T14:33:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		I'll see what I can look up
2006-06-08T14:34:00.000Z	bernier	shamrock_uk	yes it does convert it to ATRACT3plus
2006-06-08T14:34:00.000Z	bernier		alright

2006-06-08T14:39:00.000Z	bernier		ok shamrock_uk hoep it's good news :P
2006-06-08T14:39:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		well, just wondering if that links to a different Sony programme
2006-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		if not, you could try CrossOver Office - they offer a 30-day trial and might work
2006-06-08T14:42:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		@berner, if you're still here. You have two possible options - 1) You can try encoding the files yourself, as per these instructions:  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=331135&highlight=sony+mp3
2006-06-08T14:43:00.000Z	shamrock_uk		2) Someone has suggested reformatting the thing as FAT...but perhaps not such a good idea as it may end up unusable

2006-06-08T14:45:00.000Z	bernier	shamrock_uk	it didn't work =/ thanks anyway. It's all because of that piece of crap called sonicstage =/ even with windows it sucks
