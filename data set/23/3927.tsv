2008-02-03T05:32:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	did you install any additional codecs after you installed gutsy?
2008-02-03T05:32:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	I've installed 0 codecs. I've simply grabbed Mplayer & VLC from Synaptic today as suggested.
2008-02-03T05:33:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	I've been told continually that .ogg is a natively supported container ootb, but I'm experiencing different :/
2008-02-03T05:34:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	it's in /usr/share/example-content/
2008-02-03T05:35:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	that file also plays but nothing but a blue screen in the player. The progress bar goes along merrily.
2008-02-03T05:36:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	xorp? hehe
2008-02-03T05:37:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	lol np ;) I actually got a chuckle out of that.
2008-02-03T05:37:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	what video card do you have?
2008-02-03T05:37:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	xomp@xomp-laptop:~$ lspci -nn | grep VGA
2008-02-03T05:38:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	are the drivers for the card installed?
2008-02-03T05:39:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	I'm assuming so, I'm capable of running compiz fusion with full effects
2008-02-03T05:39:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	try disabling compiz fusion and play the ogg file again, see how that works
2008-02-03T05:39:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	ok
2008-02-03T05:41:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	any luck yet?
2008-02-03T05:41:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	nope, same thing after disabling compiz
2008-02-03T05:43:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	weird... as for the codec issue ogg is the container format for the actual encoded video. the file you were trying to play before was probably encoded in mpeg but inside and ogg file
2008-02-03T05:43:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	funny thing is, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Istanbul, but when you're finished recording a desktop session you are prompted to save the file, in that box you are able to "preview" the screen recording and the video plays a treat in that but not in a standalone player like Mplayer or VLC lol
2008-02-03T05:44:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	do you have any  issues with music files as well?
2008-02-03T05:45:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	*ogg files*
2008-02-03T05:45:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	I've not tried any audio files, but system sounds play fine.
2008-02-03T05:45:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	so, i'm guessing its a video driver issue, but thats only have the story
2008-02-03T05:46:00.000Z	xomp	knopper67	yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
2008-02-03T05:46:00.000Z	knopper67	xomp	you can keep asking anyone else here, i'll be back in 15 - 20 mins. good luck
