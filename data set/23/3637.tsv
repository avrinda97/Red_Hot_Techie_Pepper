2008-09-20T06:18:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		hi all, I am trying to burn a dvd-r using my laptop (which has ubuntu 8.04 on it) and it cannot get the size of the empty dvd for some reason
2008-09-20T06:18:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		can anyone help?
2008-09-20T06:19:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		*dvd
2008-09-20T06:19:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		(those programs use the same procedures)
2008-09-20T06:19:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	do you have any non cheap blank dvds like a real dvd
2008-09-20T06:20:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	you don't have one single dvd movie or something to verify it can read the size
2008-09-20T06:20:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	oh I see, a written dvd. Let me figure out how it's reading the size and i'll try it on an existing dvd
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	cheap crap did you let them sit in the sun
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	they probly melted or whatever
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	christ man, no
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	put a real dvd in verify your drive can read the size.
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	I put in an already burned Sony DVD and it is able to read the size
2008-09-20T06:22:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	same software program?
2008-09-20T06:23:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	nautilus, but it might use a different method for reading the size of a non-empty media
2008-09-20T06:23:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	how many dvds did you try
2008-09-20T06:23:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	do dvds usually "break" ?
2008-09-20T06:24:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	same problem with another blank dvd
2008-09-20T06:24:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	dvds and cds are intentionally disposable media.  how long have books been around?  you think cds can last that long?  lucky if you get 10 years
2008-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	I meant to say are new dvds usually broken out of the factory sometimes?
2008-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	well have you tried multiple different software tools
2008-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	hwilde	pist0l-fish	so then try a different burning prog
2008-09-20T06:27:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	In k3b it says "Please Insert an empty or appendable Double Layer DVD+R medium"
2008-09-20T06:41:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	hwilde	just tested it on my xubuntu machine and the same dvd is working
