2011-06-23T22:12:00.000Z	jjovereats	fission6	Run System Monitor, the GNOME one, and go to Processes. If there is a drop-down tree, press Ctrl-D. Now click Memory, and see what's at the top. That will advise you about the smartest app decisions.
2011-06-23T22:13:00.000Z	jjovereats	fission6	It is if you can read how much memory is in use.
2011-06-23T22:16:00.000Z	jjovereats	fission6	- Chrome is no good IMO.
