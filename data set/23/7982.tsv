2005-03-21T08:36:00.000Z	PacoBCN		hi guys, I posted this in the forums but let's see if any of you can help me. Whenever I try to burn a data DVD I can never fill it with 4.7 GB but around 3.5. However it is possible with WIndows.
2005-03-21T08:38:00.000Z	PacoBCN		both nautilus burn and graveman can't handle 4.7 Gb
2005-03-21T08:38:00.000Z	PacoBCN		weird
2005-03-21T08:39:00.000Z	PacoBCN		cds are ok
2005-03-21T08:39:00.000Z	PacoBCN		I'm taking about DVDs
2005-03-21T08:40:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	maybe that got something to do with the kernel?
2005-03-21T08:41:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Nekohayo	I have no clue, it's pretty weird.
2005-03-21T08:41:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	you say you asked in the forums?
2005-03-21T08:42:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Nekohayo	I asked 10 mins ago so it's normal noone replied yet :D
2005-03-21T08:43:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	please point me to the thread so I can watch it, I have a dvd burner, it should be of my concern too :)
2005-03-21T08:44:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	I'm on hoary too.
2005-03-21T08:50:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	what does it do with nautilus-burn, does it say the media doesn't have enough space?
2005-03-21T08:51:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	let me know then. Because I have the same issue now :)
2005-03-21T08:53:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	I just tried with a 4.0gb file
2005-03-21T08:54:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Nekohayo	thanks, what was the error you got?
2005-03-21T08:55:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	don't remember exactly, do you need the exact sentence? It just said that the media didn't have enough space
2005-03-21T08:56:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Nekohayo	I was too lazy to write it down too :D
2005-03-21T08:56:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	want me to make a screenshot? XD
2005-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	I uploaded the shot, take a look and tell me if that's the same thing
2005-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	it's a thumbnail, you have to click it no?
2005-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	just put it into the post
2005-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	good then :P let's see if they got an idea as to why
2005-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	Nekohayo	PacoBCN	hoary I think
