2005-12-08T06:59:00.000Z	Nolite		woops... bold :p
2005-12-08T07:00:00.000Z	Nolite		anyone know what might be wrong? I have the actual file on the desktop
2005-12-08T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	do you have binutils installed?
2005-12-08T07:02:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	 if it wasn't installed by default when I installed Ubuntu 5.10; no! :)
2005-12-08T07:02:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	check what "apt-cache policy binutils" returns
2005-12-08T07:03:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	sorry.. it returned "installed: none"
2005-12-08T07:04:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	sudo apt-get install binutils
2005-12-08T07:04:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	o.O dunno how mate :) but now its seems installed
2005-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	that was pure magic imo ;)
2005-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	if you are compiling and such you want to do what erUSUL said: install build-essential
2005-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	I'm only trying to install my graphics drivers atm
2005-12-08T07:06:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	what kind?
2005-12-08T07:06:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	NVIDIA
2005-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	since I can only have my screen refresh rate @ 60Hz atm, I hope new drivers will help that
2005-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	have you been referred to the wiki?
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	about installing drivers, no
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	why?
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	you should try those directions there, they worked well for me
2005-12-08T07:09:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	um... so I won't need those drivers I downloaded?
2005-12-08T07:09:00.000Z	_jason	Nolite	nope
2005-12-08T07:09:00.000Z	Nolite	_jason	 lol... but thanks mate :)
