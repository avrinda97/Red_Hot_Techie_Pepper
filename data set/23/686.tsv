2011-04-02T23:09:00.000Z	ciss	random123	or ls -e if you're using acl's
2011-04-02T23:10:00.000Z	ciss	random123	try ctrl+c
2011-04-02T23:11:00.000Z	ciss	random123	what exactly were you trying to do?
2011-04-02T23:11:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I am trying to use maildirmake with courier
2011-04-02T23:11:00.000Z	random123	ciss	But it said I don't have permission for some reason
2011-04-02T23:11:00.000Z	random123	ciss	But I can't figure out why it says that
2011-04-02T23:12:00.000Z	ciss	random123	did you run it with sudo?
2011-04-02T23:12:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I am in root because I'm in a VPS
2011-04-02T23:12:00.000Z	ciss	random123	can you pastebin the exact error you're getting?
2011-04-02T23:14:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I can't anymore I lost the web page i was on
2011-04-02T23:14:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I am really confused, linux is so unintuitive and you have to be like the rainman to remember all the different keywords...
2011-04-02T23:15:00.000Z	ciss	random123	are you following a guide?
2011-04-02T23:15:00.000Z	random123	ciss	Yes, I have been trying to set up postfix with sasl for about 20 hours now
2011-04-02T23:16:00.000Z	ciss	random123	can you give me a link to that guide?
2011-04-02T23:17:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I lost the specific one, but I've tried like 5 guides now

2011-04-02T23:18:00.000Z	ciss	random123	let's see if i get you right: you were accessing your vps via ssh, then ran some commands, and now you don't have acccess anymore?
2011-04-02T23:19:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I still have access
2011-04-02T23:19:00.000Z	random123	ciss	I am in SSH yes, on Putty
