2010-03-03T08:27:00.000Z	iicsa		I'm looking for a good soundcard (really one that captures decent sound) to record screencasts. Anyone have a recommendation? My onboard audio is terrible, and cant get my SB Audigy card to work.
2010-03-03T08:28:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	I am really partial to the MAudio Delta44 ... a little expensive, but does a really nice job, I use it at a couple of radio stations for streaming
2010-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	how is the quality from the mic input?
2010-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	crystal clear, although it is a line input and requires a preamp
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	ur gonna laugh at me - what is a preamp? is that something i can "turn on"/control with software (via volume control or something)
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	and that is coming from an Audio Engineer with 20 years of professional expierence
2010-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	a preamp takes the Low impedance signal from the microphone and turns it into a higher voltage, any good mini-soundboard will do, you can get one for less than $100
2010-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	ok understand. I'm just doing simple screencasts - not looking to spend more then like $70/80 bucks....
2010-03-03T08:36:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	buy this, my reccommendation .. all in one package http://www.bswusa.com/proditem.asp?item=C-1U
2010-03-03T08:38:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	awesome - and that takes sound card totally out of the picture. Drivers work in ubuntu?
2010-03-03T08:39:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	yes, berhinger has always been good to me
2010-03-03T08:39:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	perfect. thanks so much for your help.
2010-03-03T08:39:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	you might need to uninstall pulseaudio to make it work
2010-03-03T08:40:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	when i removed pulseaudio, and rebooted - none of my apps would work (like even simple sound recorder) cuz it said it did not detect a sound device.
2010-03-03T08:42:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	you can force it to use alsa, you shouldn't have to, however the microphone will detect nicely ,,, the other way would be to record with audacity and cut the audio back together with your screencast in avidemux
2010-03-03T08:44:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	I'm just thinking in regards to trying to get my SB Audigy SE to try to work. would save me $70. After i remove pulseaudio, how do you "force" alsa?
2010-03-03T08:46:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	If I were you I'd look around and do more research, I know I have setup an Audigy, I just don't remember how, I go with the prostuff anyway and consumer stuff drives me crazy, and the last thing you would want is to drive me crazy
2010-03-03T08:47:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	ok thanks :)
2010-03-03T08:50:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	i freaking fixed it! So i just was messing w/ the alsamixer. there is some "shared mic/line in" setting. flipped that to mic in and works now...
2010-03-03T08:50:00.000Z	GeekSquid	iicsa	now that was easy
2010-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	haha not really. only took me a freakin hour :)
2010-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	still doesnt work well. i haev the "boost" all the way up to 100 and its still real quiet.
2010-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	iicsa	GeekSquid	eh just got it. had to keep messing round. "analog s" => "mic", "mic" and "line in" to 100...
