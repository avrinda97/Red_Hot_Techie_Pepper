2009-11-22T23:29:00.000Z	Guest32320		How do I install GIMP Animation Package(gimp plug-in)? "Add/Remove" doesn't have it
2009-11-22T23:30:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	use "sudo apt-get install gimp-gap"
2009-11-22T23:47:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	dpkg -l gimp-gap
2009-11-22T23:47:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	You will also have entries in the GIMP menus re: gimp-gap
2009-11-22T23:51:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	where is re: gimp-gap loacted?
2009-11-22T23:52:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	You can find the files that were installed by typing "dpkg -L gimp-gap". If you mean in the GIMP menus, I can't tell you right now as I don't have it installed. You can go to to Help menu and look up the list of plug-ins/modules.
2009-11-22T23:54:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	I just installed gimp-gap. If you have it installed, you should have a Video menu in the menus across the top of the main window.
2009-11-23T00:12:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Do I need to convert first
2009-11-23T00:14:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	If you have the right program and codecs installed you should be able to play the video without converting it first.
2009-11-23T00:17:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Google does nothing. How can i find out? It doesn't have a wiki. It's an ass to install. It's an ass to deal with and I hate it. Why can't they have this feature by default?
2009-11-23T00:17:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	Can your machine play the mp4 video file outside of GIMP?
2009-11-23T00:18:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	if your computer can't play the video file, GIMP (gap) won't be able to access the file either.
2009-11-23T00:19:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Ach so. But wouldn't that that if I installed odt GIMP could use odt
2009-11-23T00:20:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	odt?
2009-11-23T00:20:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Wouldn't it be easier if I converted the file to a format that xubuntu could read?
2009-11-23T00:21:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Open document text format
2009-11-23T00:21:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	What does odt have to do with a video file?
2009-11-23T00:23:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	Nothing
2009-11-23T00:24:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	Why not just install the codec and/or files you need to play the video?
2009-11-23T00:25:00.000Z	Guest32320	Plugh	and Gadget3000: I'll be heading for #GIMP but thanks for your help so far.
2009-11-23T00:25:00.000Z	Plugh	Guest32320	See you when you arrive. :-)
