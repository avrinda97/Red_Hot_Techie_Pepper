2008-10-22T04:22:00.000Z	Shakedown		How can I found out if my hardware supports 64 bit?
2008-10-22T04:22:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep lm
2008-10-22T04:24:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Then what?
2008-10-22T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	tell me what it says
2008-10-22T04:25:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	it's 64 bit
2008-10-22T04:25:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Tell me how you know?
2008-10-22T04:26:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	it says "lm"
2008-10-22T04:26:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	...
2008-10-22T04:26:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	My crystal ball doesn't have the Linux plug-in
2008-10-22T04:26:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	it stands for "long mode"
2008-10-22T04:27:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	So if those lm's were sm, that would be 'short mode' and it would only support 32 bit?
2008-10-22T04:27:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	no, if it were a 32 bit processor, there would be simply no "lm" flag at all
2008-10-22T04:28:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	if you type "lm 64-bit cpuinfo" into google, you'll see what i'm saying confirmed
2008-10-22T04:28:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Ah, ok. Thanks. So if I wanted to upgrade to 64 bit, is there other hardware I need to check for support?
2008-10-22T04:29:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	possibly some proprietary drivers that only have a 32-bit version, i don't know if there are such things. also, you'll have difficulties using things like Flash
2008-10-22T04:30:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Geez. Do you know of some guide where I can check everything?
2008-10-22T04:30:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	"everything" is a lot of stuff ;)
2008-10-22T04:31:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Yeah...well...damn. I just got my desktop with 4 GB and I didn't realize that 32-bit OS can't use all 4 GB
2008-10-22T04:32:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	And my processor supports 64 bit, so I'm considering making the switch
2008-10-22T04:33:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	you can also use >4Gb in 32-bit mode by enabling a CPU extension that allows that. some people say it's not quite elegant, though, and in any case, that option is only enabled in the Server kernel for Ubuntu (unless you go and roll your own kernel). but i'm saying it just for completeness.
2008-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	Shakedown	LjL	Hm, currently my system monitor tells me I've got 3.2 GB of RAM. I don't know if it's worth the trouble to upgrade to 64 bit for that extra 0.8 GB of RAM.
2008-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	that's up to you
2008-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	LjL	Shakedown	i doubt you'll ever even use 3.2Gb honestly
