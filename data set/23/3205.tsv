2009-06-04T08:12:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	do you have a wifi router?
2009-06-04T08:12:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	are you transfering between linux and linux or is window involved
2009-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	you should google on how to setup an adhoc wireless network
2009-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	deserteagle_	slayton	^
2009-06-04T08:14:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	ya i got that, nothing shows up because neither computer is broadcasting as an network... you need to either setup an adhoc wireless network in ubuntu or in windows and then have the otehr computer connect to that network
2009-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	http://www.google.com/search?q=adhoc+wireless+network+ubuntu
2009-06-04T08:21:00.000Z	deserteagle_	slayton	so if it's working properly, why won't it detect the neighbors wireless? o_O
2009-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	probably b/c the signal isn't strong enough
2009-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	deserteagle_	slayton	i am chatting from my laptop that's right next to the wlan0
2009-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	i thought you said you didn't have a wireless router?
2009-06-04T08:23:00.000Z	deserteagle_	slayton	neighbors wireless
2009-06-04T08:24:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	so you have 2 computers.. the windows computer can see the network but linux cant
2009-06-04T08:24:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	the two computers, are they the exact same model? if not they probably have different wireless cards with different anteneas so they both will pick up the signals with different strengths
2009-06-04T08:27:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	so if your linux computer can't see the access point there isn't much you can do about it
2009-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	i'd suggest creating an adhoc network
2009-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	slayton	deserteagle_	or using a thumb drive to transfer the files if you can (it will be faster)
