2008-08-03T06:51:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	I do not know.  Is it just those 2 programs?
2008-08-03T06:52:00.000Z	Maeva		in my 'system' I got 2 times 'dolphin' is this normal ? maybe because I got kde3 and kde4 installed ?
2008-08-03T06:53:00.000Z	Maeva		that's spam
2008-08-03T06:54:00.000Z	Maeva		it's not a human FloodBot its a pogram that does it automatically
2008-08-03T06:54:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	Is it just the KDE apps that are duplicated?
2008-08-03T06:54:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	in info I see kde 3.5 and the other icon gives kde 4.0
2008-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	yes they are all duplicated! how do I change that
2008-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	I guess it has something to do with both versions of KDE....
2008-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	so its better to delete the old kde3 than ?
2008-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	 If you "apt-get remote <app name>", and then "apt-get install <app name>" does that fix it?
2008-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	Maeva		going to try it
2008-08-03T06:57:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	invalid operation
2008-08-03T06:57:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	i have konsole, dolphin etc 2 times...
2008-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	 You probably have to preface that with sudo.  You might not want to do that though....
2008-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	 Can you live with duplicates?
2008-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	Maeva		it was remove instead of remote
2008-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	Maeva		no rather no duplicates
2008-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	Maeva		i did apt-get remove dolphin ecyrb
2008-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	now there's only one dolphin icon left
2008-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	and he deleted the 3.5 one few
2008-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	ecyrb	Maeva	 Good stuff.  Just do that for the others I guess and you're set.
2008-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	ecyrb		What's all this about python?
2008-08-03T07:03:00.000Z	Maeva	ecyrb	it works fine but not for Konsole
