2007-03-14T15:55:00.000Z	Pollywog		as for sound, you might try Googling for a solution and it might involve compiling drivers if alsaconf does not work
2007-03-14T15:55:00.000Z	Pollywog		module-assistant makes it easier
2007-03-14T15:55:00.000Z	Pollywog		module-assistant is the ticket then
2007-03-14T15:55:00.000Z	Pollywog		what sound card?
2007-03-14T15:56:00.000Z	Pollywog		onboard sound?

2007-03-14T15:58:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	Pollywog	is .xsession invoked even from gdm?
2007-03-14T15:59:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	Pollywog	anything that can be used from  gdm?
2007-03-14T15:59:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	there is but I don't recall specifics
2007-03-14T16:00:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	is this something for a single user or systemwide?
2007-03-14T16:00:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	there are scripts
2007-03-15T16:02:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	Pollywog	single user

2007-03-15T16:03:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	there are scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d for systemwide use
2007-03-15T16:04:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	look at the gdm configs I think they mention the user config files
2007-03-15T16:06:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	Pollywog	seems like there's an option in the gnome control panle
2007-03-15T16:06:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	yes I think there is
2007-03-15T16:19:00.000Z	Pollywog	Knight_Lord	http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/docs/2.8/configuration.html
2007-03-15T16:19:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	Pollywog	thanks a lot i got it working. I think .xsession actually works
