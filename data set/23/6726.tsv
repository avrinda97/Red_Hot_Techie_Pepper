2007-04-13T10:54:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss		can anyone give me a hand with some file premission issues?
2007-04-13T10:55:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	ask your question
2007-04-13T10:55:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I chmod 777 the directory that I'm trying to move to a windows share, but it won't let me move stuff.  I'm trying to do it in shell.
2007-04-13T10:56:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I'm trying to back up my home directory from this server before I nuke it with a fresh install
2007-04-13T10:57:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	do you have write access to the Windows share?
2007-04-13T10:58:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 yes.  I have admin rights on both boxes.  when I launch midnight commander, it shows the files in green with a "*" next to them
2007-04-13T10:58:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	and what's the error msg when you try to copy? Access denied?
2007-04-13T10:59:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 something like that.  I'll know that exact error in 2 mins when it tries to finish the file.
2007-04-13T10:59:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	what do you mean, when it tries to finish the file?
2007-04-13T11:00:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I'd really like to transfer it directly from the shell on the sever becasue it's faster.  And I'm trying to move the file off of the server.  it appiers to copy the file fine, but it won't remove the file.
2007-04-13T11:00:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	so you want to remove the file from your local disk?
2007-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I want to move all the files in the home directory to the remote M$ share.  and the error that I get is "cannot chown target file ..., operation not premitted
2007-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	but the files are copied to the server, you just can't remove them locally, right?
2007-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I think that's the case.

2007-04-13T11:04:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 it looks like the files get copied, but I'd like to just have it moved properly so I can make sure that I don't miss anything
2007-04-13T11:05:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	are you trying to copy the files as root, that might be the problem....
2007-04-13T11:05:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 any ideas?
2007-04-13T11:07:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	try mounting the samba directory as a normal user...
2007-04-13T11:07:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 I tried that as well.  LOL
2007-04-13T11:08:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	is the Samba drive FAT?
2007-04-13T11:08:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	shooters	 the server is Samba, and the M$ box is NTFS.
2007-04-13T11:12:00.000Z	shooters	Jeeves_Moss	I really don't know... there isn't anything helpful on google about this... and I can't figure out the problem... sorry...
