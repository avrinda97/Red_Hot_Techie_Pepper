2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	How experienced are you with Ubuntu?
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	It takes some willpower to "quit" cold turkey
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	bamb00	Kareeser	i know a bit abt programming i know BASIC and Fortran
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	Using Ubuntu requires no knowledge of programming
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	essentially very similar
2009-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	Try linmodems
2009-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	It's a website
2009-05-09T04:05:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	Install "msttcorefonts"
2009-05-09T04:05:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	I also find that Linux fonts are better looking than Windows' equivalents
2009-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	lots have changed in the past 7 years
2009-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	you have to approach Ubuntu with an open mind. And be open to solving your own problems.
2009-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	yeah?
2009-05-09T04:13:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	don't let it get to you.
2009-05-09T04:14:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	I tried arch today. I messed it up real bad. Does that make me a noob? I bet, but I don't really care.
2009-05-09T04:14:00.000Z	bamb00	Kareeser	only a jew would try "arch".
2009-05-09T04:14:00.000Z	Kareeser	bamb00	LOL
