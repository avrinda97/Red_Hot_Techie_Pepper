2009-11-13T03:02:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	hey I think my connection went sour because I stopped seeing any chat for the last 5+ minutes... anyway I typed the command in the terminal and I see the drives and the partitions /sda1 /sdb1
2009-11-13T03:03:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	I did
2009-11-13T03:03:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	and what's new when you type "ls /dev/sd*" ?
2009-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	 /dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sdb  /dev/sdb1
2009-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	and neither of those were present when the drive was unplugged?
2009-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	i think at least /dev/sda1 was ...
2009-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	sdb is the 2nd hd that has my backup   sdb was not present when it was unplugged
2009-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	i thought you said that drive had 2 partitons on it ....
2009-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	gparted made it look that way but it does not. basically I want to mount both drives and then run the dd command to restore the backup on sdb1 to sda1
2009-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	lemme try
2009-11-13T03:07:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	how is /dev/sdb1 formatted?
2009-11-13T03:07:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	both drives are ntfs
2009-11-13T03:07:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	when I unplug sda sdb does not change to sda
2009-11-13T03:08:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	sudo mkdir /media/backup-drive && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/backup-drive
2009-11-13T03:10:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	okay that worked without error and I can now browse the files in file browser
2009-11-13T03:10:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	great
2009-11-13T03:11:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	so now I'm gonna perform the same command for the other drive
2009-11-13T03:13:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	you'll need a different mount point
2009-11-13T03:13:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	great I can browse both thanks a lot. I also just finally learned that the number after the drive represents partitions I was always confused about what sda and sda were
2009-11-13T03:13:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	sudo mkdir /media/ye-olde-other-drive && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/ye-olde-other-drive
2009-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta1	sudo mkdir /media/ye-olde-other-drive && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /media/ye-olde-other-drive
2009-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	yeah it's all good I already mounted it
2009-11-13T03:32:00.000Z	ZenMasta1	mneptok	you too :)
