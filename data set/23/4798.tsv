2007-05-01T06:18:00.000Z	BeRniTo		Does anybody know what the + symbol means in the list of Usplashes when doing "sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so"?
2007-05-01T06:19:00.000Z	Zorlin	BeRniTo	Doesnt it represent a bullet point?
2007-05-01T06:19:00.000Z	BeRniTo	Zorlin	what's a bullet point?
2007-05-01T06:19:00.000Z	Zorlin	BeRniTo	Its meant to seperate information

2007-05-01T06:20:00.000Z	BeRniTo	Zorlin	it doesn't make sense. Are you under Ubuntu?
2007-05-01T06:22:00.000Z	Zorlin	BeRniTo	They are simply symbols used to seperate information: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_point
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		 These
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		 are
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		 bulletpoints
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	Zorlin	BeRniTo	That answer your question?

2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	BeRniTo		The * means that it's the actual Usplash in use.
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	BeRniTo		But don't understand the + symbol.
2007-05-01T06:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		Ah. I think the + actually represents what is currently selected
2007-05-01T06:24:00.000Z	Zorlin	BeRniTo	Not sure, sorry
2007-05-01T06:25:00.000Z	BeRniTo	Zorlin	If I change the Usplash to the second one, the * appears next to the second option but the + sign still remains on the first one.
2007-05-01T06:26:00.000Z	Zorlin		Okay, BeRniTo: The * means what is selected within the dialogue box, and the + means what your usplash is currently set to
2007-05-01T06:26:00.000Z	Zorlin		Select the 2nd option and confirm it, the + will move there next time you open the dialogue
2007-05-01T06:27:00.000Z	Zorlin		have to go man
2007-05-01T06:27:00.000Z	Zorlin		sorry
2007-05-01T06:27:00.000Z	BeRniTo	Zorlin	no, It doesn't. That's why I'm searching for it's meaning. :P
