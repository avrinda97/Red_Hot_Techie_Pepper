2008-11-08T18:11:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Welshman I have read that this is a issue, but have seen no fix info
2008-11-08T18:13:00.000Z	Stoneheart		yes for sure it seems to depend on the hardware configs
2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		so far this one likes it
2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I am running 3 seperate opsys on it from 3 seperate drives

2008-11-08T18:16:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I would love to find some really good at this I have about 60 computers in a school to convert and a server to setup
2008-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	Stoneheart		No I love a challenge and will get it done over time
2008-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	Stoneheart	What do you want to do? Mass-install Ubuntu?
2008-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Yes but this school is poor.
2008-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	Stoneheart		So I am learning quickly
2008-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Microsoft wants about 50000usd to get them upgraded
2008-11-08T18:19:00.000Z	Stoneheart		With ubuntu it will be free
2008-11-08T18:19:00.000Z	Stoneheart		that is with the reductions
2008-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk		Our school got pretty cheap volume licenses for Win XP pro and Win2k3 server. Still, Ubuntu would be way cheaper. :D
2008-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Yes problem is the hardware it older p4 1.8 512 ram 20 gig hd's
2008-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	Stoneheart		most are p3 with 256 ram 20 gig hd's
2008-11-08T18:21:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	Stoneheart	As long as they have netboot, you can easily install *buntu on them all. o.o
2008-11-08T18:21:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I am going to be learning big time over the next few months
2008-11-08T18:23:00.000Z	Stoneheart		that is what I was planning
2008-11-08T18:24:00.000Z	Stoneheart	Mechdave	my problem is net working.   I need to make sure I can still use some windows prog thru wine.
2008-11-08T18:24:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	Stoneheart	Wine is good but not reliable, check the Win apps you want to use with the appDB first.
