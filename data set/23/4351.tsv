2010-07-27T04:36:00.000Z	Stavros		does anyone know all the default configure directories for ubuntu?
2010-07-27T04:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 for what program are you meaning?
2010-07-27T04:38:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	i'm trying to configure varnish
2010-07-27T04:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 check its docs/man pages?  a specific app could have config files most anywhere.. ~/.varnish or similer would be a normal defauilt
2010-07-27T04:39:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	hmm... would these be in the debian package?
2010-07-27T04:39:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	i want to configure it in such a way that it will replace the files in the old version (from the package)
2010-07-27T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 theres 'system' configs.. then theres the 'users personal configs'  -   You need to check out where its confuigs are at  that you want to change i guess. and set the new ones there. if you are compiling from source. you could tell it to use some other location so the old configs are not used at all.
2010-07-27T04:41:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	but i *want* it to use the old config, some are in /etc/varnish and some in /etc/default/varnish and i don't know how to set those
2010-07-27T04:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 back them up. install the new..  see if it changed teh configs.. How are you installing?  the package manager 'should'  ask you what configs you want to use.
2010-07-27T04:43:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	this is on a production server, so i can't really experiment with it. varnish on the repo is 2.1.0 and i want to upgrade to 2.1.2
2010-07-27T04:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 upgrade HOW is the question.. source? you made a deb? what exactly?
2010-07-27T04:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 when in doubt. backup your old configs first also.
2010-07-27T04:44:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	nothing yet, i'm trying to build a package from the source
2010-07-27T04:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 you did look for some PPA's of it?
2010-07-27T04:44:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	there are none :/
2010-07-27T04:44:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	where?
2010-07-27T04:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 ppasearch is a tool i found  the other day. that searches all the ppa's :)
2010-07-27T04:45:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	is that command line?
2010-07-27T04:46:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	oh, that's great, thanks!
2010-07-27T04:46:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	can you paste me the list of the ppas for varnish please?
2010-07-27T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Stavros	 it just mentions a name/title - not very descriptitive.. that first one was the most descriptive
2010-07-27T04:48:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	ah, hmm
2011-01-26T18:51:00.000Z	Stavros	Dr_Willis	i thought you meant ecstasy and i was going to agree
