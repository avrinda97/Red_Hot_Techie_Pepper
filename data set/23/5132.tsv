2007-04-21T06:53:00.000Z	robbie_crash		:-/ I guess it's time to reinstall just to be safe, is the install for beryl on feisty much more difficult than on edgy?
2007-04-21T06:53:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	why reinstall? this is linux...
2007-04-21T06:54:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	Because I have no idea how to get my slave on ide2 working
2007-04-21T06:54:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	then find out how instead of wasting time this is not windows it's a real OS
2007-04-21T06:54:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	check out /etc/fstab
2007-04-21T06:55:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	obviously, I've been trying since I've installed it. It's not an fstab error, it's not hardware
2007-04-21T06:56:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	could you give me the error of the mount command?
2007-04-21T06:56:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	it worked fine under edgy, then after the upgrade to feisty it stopped. The master on that channel works, with either disk that I put on it, so I know it's not the disk. It doesn't show up under sudo fdisk -l, doesn't show up in hardware information, doesn't show up under gparted, it seems that as soon as ubuntu loads, the slave channel just stops
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	there's no error, the disk just doesn't exist
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	do you have another OS to see if it detects it? are you sure the cable is good? is it plugin correctly?
2007-04-21T06:59:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	that last one was for you
2007-04-21T06:59:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	I'll post if you want
2007-04-21T07:01:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	uninstall and reinstall dbus and all dependencies?
2007-04-21T07:03:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	how about searching their tracker for a bug report
2007-04-21T07:19:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	no luck on the bug tracker, and reinstalling dbus didn't help
2007-04-21T07:40:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	I'm trying to get a program compiling here and it did seems that dbus changed something cause it's not working :)
2007-04-21T07:42:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	I guess that's a good sign? At least it means I didn't screw something up beyond repair myself
2007-04-21T07:49:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	just make sure you have /home on a diff partition so you don't have to do backups
2007-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	that's one of the things I learned recently, I'm going to have one partition be / one be /var one be /home and then all the rest set as it is right now
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	I'll probably just keep my /home as it is now, unless there's a reason to not do that?
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	yes indeed just kill / and mount /home back
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	robbie_crash	elpargo	 thanks! Sorry I feel I have to reinstall. but I really have bunged a lot of stuff up due to ignorance
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	elpargo	robbie_crash	yup you have learn your lesson, resintalling is the last option :p
