2006-08-23T15:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dalila	Does it work running the live CD?
2006-08-23T15:49:00.000Z	dalila	Jack_Sparrow	  did not try it with live cd
2006-08-23T15:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dalila	Did it ever work?  Then after an update start having problems
2006-08-23T15:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dalila	Just throwing out some ideas..
2006-08-23T15:49:00.000Z	dalila	Jack_Sparrow	justinstalled ubuntu 3 days ago, it has never worked
2006-08-23T15:50:00.000Z	dalila	Jack_Sparrow	dont see anything in dmesg as being detected
2006-08-23T15:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dalila	A mouse should not be a problem... Have you looked at your /etc/x11/xorg.conf
2006-08-23T15:52:00.000Z	dalila	Jack_Sparrow	yes looks normal
2006-08-23T15:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dalila	Trying the live CD might help find the problem... THere isnt a USB adapter to PS2 or anything else unusual is there?
2006-08-23T15:53:00.000Z	dalila		ido se this when i plug and unplug the device [17180246.064000]  psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 - driver resynched.
