2009-10-02T04:40:00.000Z	queso_		Was there some kind of forced-reboot update today? My home Ubuntu machine was rebooted when I got back from work and, while I was at work, my work Ubuntu machine rebooted *while I was using it*. I window popped up while I was typing a Jabber message and the spacebar "clicked" a button in a dialog box, but I only saw it for a second. Then my whole system went down and rebooted!
2009-10-02T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	You have  the updates to automatiaclly install?
2009-10-02T04:42:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	Only set to notify me of updates, not to download or install automatically.
2009-10-02T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	only major updates such as a new kernel need an update
2009-10-02T04:43:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	It's wierd, the power didn't go out, I don't know why my home machine would have rebooted on its own, no one else touched it.
2009-10-02T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	Maybe  the power did go out,  but only slightly,  enough for it to re boot,  but not enough for you to notice it going out
2009-10-02T04:44:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	Yes, I know kernel updates require reboot, but it doesn't force a reboot even when there's a kernel update. Kinda strange.  Is there a website that keeps track of updates, descriptions, and date/time of release?
2009-10-02T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	don't know
2009-10-02T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	I think someone else had a similar issue not that long ago
2009-10-02T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	Doing stuff on  Ubuntu, and then re boot just like that
2009-10-02T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	I think maybe at least once I have had something like this happen to  my Ubuntu as well
2009-10-02T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	It was probably just some little hardware issue,  that just happended to result in a re boot,  and in that case something that isn't worth worrying about.
2009-10-02T04:46:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	Glad to know I'm not going crazy and that it's happened to others :) but a bit alarming, to be sure.
2009-10-02T04:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	or maybe a bug in Ubuntu that resulted in a re boot
2009-10-02T04:46:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	That it happened to two seperate machines in two different cities made me think it was related to an update.
2009-10-02T04:48:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	Well, anyway, thanks for your help :) have a good evening.
2009-10-02T04:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	not the evening anymore in my time zone
2009-10-02T04:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	np
2009-10-02T04:49:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	aah, sorry. :) then have a good next few hours ;)
2009-10-02T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	thanks
2009-10-18T02:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	Debian Stable is well  stable, meaning a bit behind,   with the kernel and such.   Ubuntu is based on the testing Debian repo and then does it's own changes or something like that.
2009-10-18T02:01:00.000Z	queso_	sebsebseb	Aah, okay, thanks for explaining that
2009-10-18T02:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	queso_	Yeah Debain can't even do  Ext4  yet as far as I know,  unless something special is done to it
