2006-07-02T13:25:00.000Z	Shigun	Healot	nonfree flash installed.  gpl'd flash installed as well, but when I removed the nonfree, I got a message about not having the latest flash
2006-07-02T13:29:00.000Z	Shigun	Healot	Yea, cant use the gpl'd flash (libflash, libflash-mozplugin) as they throw an error about not being the latest version
