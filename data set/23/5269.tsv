2007-01-05T12:56:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	I dunno.

2007-01-05T13:01:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Used it as a number replacer ^^
2007-01-05T13:02:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Yeah, so..
2007-01-05T13:03:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	"Oh my god what the heck is wrong with my PC oh my god"
2007-01-05T13:04:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Uh-oh...
2007-01-05T13:04:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	No, because Windows is on the other side of it.;
2007-01-05T13:06:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Two partitions, yes.
2007-01-05T13:06:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	If i really have to format my drive.. I have to say byebye to good ole windows
2007-01-05T13:06:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	The thing is..... this whole thing happened when i pressed the 'update' button on my computer (figuratively speaking)
2007-01-05T13:07:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	In Arch Linux, that was.
2007-01-05T13:07:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	No, i think the hard drive is doomed
2007-01-05T13:08:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Oh, dang, GRUB is broken too, so i can't check
2007-01-05T13:08:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Weeeeeeeelllllll..... not in that laptop. But yeah, in the PC i am using now...
2007-01-05T13:08:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	On this PC, sometimes, when i turn it on, it makes a HUGE humming noise that makes me jump every time (out of shock)
2007-01-05T13:09:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Yep.
2007-01-05T13:10:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	Acronis server is down
2007-01-05T13:14:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	No, the site isn't up, but that was a google result.
2007-01-05T13:16:00.000Z	Alzi2	purplemunkz	I think i'll fix this another time... I don't have much 'I wanna fix! I wanna fix! OMG COOKIEZZZ!~" feelings now. (I mean, i don't feel like doing it.. I'm dutch, so i didn't know how to explain that in English XD)
