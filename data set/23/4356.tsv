2007-09-19T15:14:00.000Z	amio	test1234	listen to me this what I will write might make others laugh I also dont have good knowledge in linux but tried it and it worked out well I had your trouble exactly same so do these commands install one by one then restart after all are done
2007-09-19T15:14:00.000Z	amio	test1234	are you ready?
2007-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	amio	test1234	type after this command sudo apt-get install -f -y the follwoing things one by one till they complete installing then next (x-*, xserver-*, xserver-*-*, x-window-system, x-window-system-*, xserver, gdm, x-window-system gdm) try them dont forget one after the other ex: sudo apt-get install -f -y x-* then other after this finish downloading and installing
2007-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	amio	test1234	you got it now?
2007-09-19T15:19:00.000Z	amio	test1234	and they are all installed ?
2007-09-19T15:19:00.000Z	amio	test1234	it should take at least an hour installing them
2007-09-19T15:21:00.000Z	amio	test1234	listen did you really try them corrctly? like try now sudo apt-get -f -y install xserver-*
2007-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	amio	test1234	then see how many minutes will take and what it will right? doesnt right something like files already installed and in newly version? 0 files to install something like this?
2007-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	amio	test1234	here is the problem
2007-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	amio	test1234	if you dont have network then nothing can help none of my ways
2007-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	amio	test1234	you said you dont have internet there?
