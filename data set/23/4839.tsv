2007-04-30T09:50:00.000Z	walkintome		hi all. i want to run windows xp x64 through virtualization under feisty, and was wondering if anyone would be willing to help me out as i have no idea how to do this
2007-04-30T09:51:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	try VirtualBox, do a google search and install the deb
2007-04-30T09:51:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	very nice emulator
2007-04-30T09:51:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	excuse me virtualization tool
2007-04-30T09:51:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	will i be able to install apps onto the virtual machine like i would using viertual pc 2007?
2007-04-30T09:54:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	sounds good
2007-04-30T09:54:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	may i ask you questions if i encounter any difficulties?
2007-04-30T09:54:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	yes, yes of course
2007-04-30T09:55:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	thank you!
2007-04-30T09:57:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	if i want to install widnows xp x64 using virtual box on my system will it be able to becasue linux uses ext3? where should i install it?
2007-04-30T09:58:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	im also seeing that virtual box does not support 64 bit systems. does that mean i wont be able to use xp x64?
2007-04-30T09:59:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	I believe it does, I am sorry
2007-04-30T09:59:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	darn
2007-04-30T09:59:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	do you know if there is an alternative to virtual box?
2007-04-30T10:00:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	vmware and qemu
2007-04-30T10:00:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	whcih would you recommend that is decent performance/stability wise
2007-04-30T10:00:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	both are not bad, really
2007-04-30T10:01:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	I really am not sure i even have a preference? virtualbox may work where qemu fails for x64 architecture though
2007-04-30T10:01:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	maybe im misunderstanding, but are you saying virtualbox may be able to run xp x64?
2007-04-30T10:02:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	sorry s/virtualbox/vmware too many "v"s
2007-04-30T10:03:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	well im using synaptics package manager for vmware but i dont realyl know which one to choose. i dont think i see a virtualization package, just a vmware player and server
2007-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	yigal	walkintome	 sorry yes these should be fine. just the player should be enough
2007-04-30T10:08:00.000Z	walkintome	yigal	cool, ill give that a try
