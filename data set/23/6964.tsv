2006-03-08T11:23:00.000Z	Plouj		I don't get this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com//KernelHowto it tells me to apt-get kernel-package and gcc-3.4 but apt can't find those packages: Couldn't find package gcc-3.4 Couldn't find package kernel-package
2006-03-08T11:24:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	tried "sudo apt-get update"?
2006-03-08T11:24:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	I'm actually logged in as root
2006-03-08T11:24:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	yes, I apt-get update(d) first
2006-03-08T11:25:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	hm, well, perhaps you have a problem with your mirrors -- the gcc-3.4 package is there in main for me
2006-03-08T11:25:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	I just installed ubuntu, how can I have a problem?
2006-03-08T11:25:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	dunno, perhaps the mirrors you're using are down or somewhat broken currently? try a simple "apt-get install gcc-3.4"
2006-03-08T11:26:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	E: Couldn't find package gcc-3.4
2006-03-08T11:26:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	can you paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to the pastebin?
2006-03-08T11:27:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	http://paste.opsat.net/?/303/
2006-03-08T11:27:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	your sources.list is broken.
2006-03-08T11:28:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	how did you install ubuntu? expert mode or something?
2006-03-08T11:28:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	no, not expert
2006-03-08T11:28:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	that should help you build a working sources.list
2006-03-08T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	because for some reason you don't have a working one?
2006-03-08T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	it's just a matter of checking the stuff you want and then pasting.
2008-09-02T18:50:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	what's the problem you're having again?
2008-09-02T18:51:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	Well, to have a useful program, I'd like to include stdio.h, but the package that installs that doesn't seem to be a dependency of the gcc package.
2008-09-02T18:52:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	well, that's because a C compiler may also be used with non-standard libraries (just as an example, the EPOC32 operating system uses "C++" but not its standard library). if you do want to use standard C, you need the "build-essential" package.
2008-09-02T18:53:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	there is no reason for gcc to depend on it, though.
2008-09-02T18:54:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	that's most likely because the packagers, being the standards-abiding fellows they are, assume that if you build something *for Ubuntu* (which definitely needs build-essential to build), then you're going to make it into a .deb package.
2008-09-02T18:56:00.000Z	LjL	Plouj	do you have a support question?
2008-09-02T18:56:00.000Z	Plouj	LjL	not anymore
