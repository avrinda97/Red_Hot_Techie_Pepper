2007-01-26T12:46:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	if the package is owned by root, you probably shouldn't be changing permissions
2007-01-26T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	right, and that's exactly the sort of thing you don't solve with chmod or chown, set a umask or owner when mounting
2007-01-28T14:20:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	not in the official repositories, if you add the seveas one, he's got one.
2007-01-28T14:20:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	there's a real-simple-but-not-one-package method (the normal method)
2007-02-26T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	looks like... do you have two httpds?  Or maybe nothing in ports.conf
2007-03-30T15:50:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	users or who
2007-03-30T15:52:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	so whats it mean when "uptime" says 4 users, but "users" just gives my account?
2007-03-30T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	It only gives one of your account? or four of them?
2007-03-30T15:54:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	"users" just gives my account, which i'm obviously using and is logged in
2007-03-30T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	rght, but just a single of your account?
2007-03-30T15:56:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	well, there's two of the users.
2007-03-30T15:56:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	yea, who's the other 2? :) i wanna make sure i havnt been hacked
2007-03-30T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	who -a doesn't list them? (it'll list a bunch of other stuff too)
2007-03-30T15:58:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13024/
2007-03-30T15:58:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	it doesnt look like it, unless the other 2 "users" are system processes or something?
2007-03-30T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	I don't know.  But, I'm no expert.  I agree that it seems odd.  But, that doesn't mean you've been hacked, I just don't know where the others are coming from.
2007-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	oh well... the only reason i'm suspicious, is that i had port 80 open to show some friends a few things, and then last night some process called "gdb" was killing my machine, had to go to run level 1 to kill it
2007-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	gdb is gcc's debugger.
2007-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	or, the real one anyway.
2007-03-31T16:02:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	ah, well at least i know it wasnt some rouge process or something
2007-03-31T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	matt1234	but, apache should be secure, I mean, assuming you're up to date.  Ubuntu does a pretty good job of patching stuff.
2007-03-31T16:02:00.000Z	matt1234	Flannel	yea, i patch as soon as i see the notice
