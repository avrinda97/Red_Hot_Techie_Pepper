2006-11-18T09:00:00.000Z	nick`		Whats the default root password?
2006-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	with the desktop install, it is set to disable root login.  You can set the root password, or you can use sudo
2006-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	 My friend is at my house and im not there, he needs to login and im not giving him my password.  How can he get in?
2006-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	if you can log in remotely, create a new user for him
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	how?
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	with ssh
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	although if you didn't install the ssh server, you can't do that
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	pray tell
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	guess not
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	I'm a bit confused.  You want to give him the root password, but not your own?
2006-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	so is there no way?
2006-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	yep
2006-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	if you did the default install, I think there is no way.
2006-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	if he has the root password, he can become any user on the system, including you.
2006-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	Thats fine and dandy, I just need him on the computer without knowing my password, being as its the same for everything.
2006-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	If I have a ubuntu live cd, would he be able to get on?
2006-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	yes, sure.
2006-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	what would he have to do?
2006-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	as root, and he'll be able to do whatever you don't want him to do as you.
2006-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	I mean, he puts the ubuntu live cd in the drive, then what does he do
2006-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	he turns the machine on, at least that's what I would do next.  :)
2006-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	nick`	sethk	Please, he has to leave soon, just get this one file and hes gone..  What does he do with the livecd after he puts it in?  Does he have to login?  I've never dealt with livecd's before
2006-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	sethk	nick`	I don't know the ubuntu live cd very well.  I assume that he can just do control-alt-f1 and get a console.
