2007-11-02T21:43:00.000Z	Name141		Is it possible to try to get a better 'driver' for a Voodoo 3 3dfx 8 MB card?  I feel as if it is what is slowing me down when maxiumizing windows ?
2007-11-02T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 reduceing your color depth may help a bit with that old a card.
2007-11-02T21:44:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	how is that done
2007-11-02T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 select the default depth in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2007-11-02T21:46:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	I see "DefaultDepth    16"
2007-11-02T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 Hmm. looks like thats about as low as you will want. Could try 8 - but that may be ugly.
2007-11-02T21:47:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	once I try that, I need to ctrl + alt + backspace ?
2007-11-02T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 yep. THat will restart the X server
2007-11-02T21:48:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	OK, BRb
2007-11-02T21:55:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	all that did was make it crash
2007-11-02T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 looke like the card can only handle 16 depth then.
2007-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	OK.
2007-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	any other way to speed it up inside of linux?
2007-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 its a low end card :)  reduce your seceen size, use a lightter window manager. abouit all ya can do.
2007-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	I am on XFCE, and 800x600
2007-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	Would fluxbox be worth trying?
2007-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 shall i point out that WalMart is going to be selling $200 Linux PC's soon. :)
2007-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	LOL.  No, I have no money.
2007-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 why not. :) it cant hurt. Its easy to get fluxbox  going
2007-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	I suppose there is some fancy apt-get command ?
2007-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 fancy? apt-get install   is fancy? :) or use the package manager.
2007-11-02T22:00:00.000Z	Name141	Dr_willis	LOL.  If I had money I'd see a dentist
2007-11-02T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Name141	 Its fall here.. get to raking leaves! :)
