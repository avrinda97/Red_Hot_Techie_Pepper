2008-03-01T22:56:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	it does, you have to have the right plugins installed
2008-03-01T22:58:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	go to terminal and paste this    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2008-03-01T23:00:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	after that installs, you should be able to play mp3s in just about any player
2008-03-01T23:01:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	no problem :)
2008-03-01T23:01:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	there's no itunes for ubuntu, but you can use rhythmbox
2008-03-01T23:01:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	people like amarok as well
2008-03-01T23:04:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	visit that link
2008-03-01T23:06:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	amarok, or so I've heard
2008-03-01T23:07:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	but you can use either, it's your choice
2008-03-01T23:13:00.000Z	efren20	gravemind	i was installing what you told me to for it to play the mp3 files in any media player look what it gave me at the end dpkg> status database area is locked by another process

2008-03-01T23:16:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	you can't be running two package managers at once, that's probably what's happening
2008-03-01T23:16:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	if you're using the terminal, make sure you have closed synaptic
2008-03-01T23:17:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	and make sure any other instances of apt are done working
2008-03-01T23:18:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	try logging out and back it
2008-03-01T23:18:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	wait, just see if it works now
2008-03-01T23:19:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	whatever didn't work before
2008-03-01T23:20:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	tell me what you try, and how it works
2008-03-01T23:21:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	you are trying to install banshee?
2008-03-01T23:24:00.000Z	gravemind	efren20	try logging out, logging back in and trying again
