2006-07-16T07:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abhinay	if you don't have a soundblaster or any other card added to your machine, then you are using the built-in sound card. These cards cannot support multiple streams (more than one thing playing something).  Easy solution - don't listen to music while voice chatting. Difficult solution, see !dmix
2006-07-16T08:00:00.000Z	abhinay	fyrestrtr	but windows supports multiple streams in my system
2006-07-16T08:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abhinay	yes, because it installs a 'virtual mixer' with the windows drivers.
2006-07-16T08:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abhinay	you can do the same with dmix, an extenstion for alsa.

2006-08-06T11:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abhinay	because its not a supported configuration in ubuntu, and leads to future issues.
