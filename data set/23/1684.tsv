2009-11-28T15:36:00.000Z	jozefk		why so many people using ubuntu?
2009-11-28T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 because it works very well  for most people.
2009-11-28T15:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 xubuntu is ubuntu using xfce, instead of gnome. Try both see what you like,
2009-11-28T15:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 i reccomend sticking with Ubuntu however
2009-11-28T15:38:00.000Z	jozefk	Dr_Willis	why ubuntu? is it better? works differently?
2009-11-28T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 it works for their needs.. try it out, try others if you dont like ubuntu.  its all a matter of whats imporntant to you
2009-11-28T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 and your specific needs
2009-11-28T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 stick with the UBUNTU LTS releases then.
2009-11-28T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 the desktop is the only differance in the  ubuntu variants you mentioned.
2009-11-28T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 and if you wanted you can install all 3 of the desktops you mentioned onto a ubuntu system, and select what one to use from the Login screen.
2009-11-28T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 you said you wanted STABLE  not 'cutting edge versions'
2009-11-28T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 have you ever actually tried slackware? its.. odd in ways
2009-11-29T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 i perfer to make bootable flash drives - to install from. For mymachines that can boot from flash drive
2009-12-02T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 privoxy homepage/docs are a must read. :)
2010-05-08T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 mine rerouts to blogger.com/home :)  since i was logged in
2010-05-31T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 thats the reason for LTS and non LTS versions
2010-05-31T12:20:00.000Z	jozefk	Dr_Willis	non LTS is supported 18 months same as LTS desktop version I guess, but new release is every 6 months. I don't understand this anyway :) And personally I think people will not upgrade their system every 6 months.
2010-05-31T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 you dont have to if you dont want to.   'support' for most people is also a vague term :)
2010-05-31T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 lts is suported for 3 years..
2010-05-31T12:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 in thory you can stick to the LTS and just do LTS->LTS upgrades if you wanted.
2010-05-31T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 yes it does mane sence.
2010-05-31T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jozefk	 you want to try out  stuff befor you do BIG changes...
2010-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	jozefk	Dr_Willis	nobody will use ubuntu as it is after fresh install coz in that case there would not be need for installation. Live CD would do.
