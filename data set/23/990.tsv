2012-07-11T11:33:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	you noob
2012-07-11T11:33:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	what are you doing in these parts?
2012-07-11T11:33:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	trolling you, erm, helping :P
2012-07-11T11:34:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	checked /etc/rc.local
2012-07-11T11:35:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	it just says exit 0;
2012-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	sure it's not in rc.local or something weird like that? Only reason I could imagine init caring about it
2012-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	are there any other files to check, rc.local is mostly empty
2012-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	not that I can think of off the top of my head
2012-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	I reconn it has to be starting somewhere abnormal for init to be complaining about it, can't imagine where though
2012-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	neither can i
2012-07-11T11:47:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	still getting the errors?
2012-07-11T11:47:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	i am waiting for it to finish rebooing, i'll check once i can ssh in
2012-07-11T11:48:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	k
2012-07-11T11:48:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	outside of rc.local I don't know where to look, maybe you could grep through the files in /etc looking for any traces of mediatomb
2012-07-11T11:49:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	ls doesn't look inside files
2012-07-11T11:50:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	I imagine it'd be a command in some file making it attempt to run or something
2012-07-11T11:50:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	cat /etc/init.d/* | grep mediatomb ?
2012-07-11T11:51:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	maybe grep mediatomb *
2012-07-11T11:52:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	jmad980	some user and group stuff left behind
2012-07-11T12:01:00.000Z	jmad980	totesmuhgoats	pz
