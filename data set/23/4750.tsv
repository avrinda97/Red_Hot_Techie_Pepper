2007-05-15T07:43:00.000Z	unicornx		hello, i installed some programs but they arn't showing up in the applications menu - were do i find them? Specifically Wine?
2007-05-15T07:44:00.000Z	unicornx		thanks
2007-05-15T07:44:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	try running wineboot.. don't know what it does exactly.. but sometimes it makes shortcuts turn up
2007-05-15T07:45:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	otherwise you're wine stuff is usually located in /usr/home/yourusername/.wine/drive_c  or something along those lines
2007-05-15T07:47:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	it's a terminal command that comes with wine.. try running it in the terminal, when you don't have any wine apps running
2007-05-15T07:53:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	wineboot.. no space.
2007-05-15T07:54:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	that sounds right.. but check your applications menu now.. anything new in there?
2007-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	unicornx	Slart	i couldn't see anything new there
2007-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	hmm..  well.. then you'll just have to find it yourself.. go to a terminal and type "cd ~/.wine" without the quotes
2007-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	then tell me what folders you see when you type "ls"
2007-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	you got that when you type "ls"?
2007-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	no folders? just those files?
2007-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	unicornx	Slart	yeah after i typed: cd ~/.wine
2007-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	hmm.. odd..  run this then "wineprefixcreate"
2007-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	and then try ls again
2007-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	unicornx	Slart	i now get: wine updated successfully.
2007-05-15T08:03:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	ok.. try "ls" again.. you should have at least one folder in there.. mine is named drive_c
2007-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	unicornx	Slart	i get: dosdevices  drive_c  system.reg  userdef.reg  user.reg
2007-05-15T08:05:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	ahh.. there it is.. drive_c is the folder I was looking for.. in there are all the files that in a windows-installation is on drive c
2007-05-15T08:05:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	in there you'll find you "program files" "windows" etc.. also.. all windows programs you install using wine will end up in there
2007-05-15T08:06:00.000Z	unicornx	Slart	Ok does that mean that i have to go to drive c to access those programs?
2007-05-15T08:07:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	my windows programs end up in a wine-menu under the applications menu.. I don't know if it will do that for you.. if it doesn't you'll have to search for the executable file in that folder (drive_c) and run it manually
2007-05-15T08:08:00.000Z	Slart	unicornx	you're welcome
