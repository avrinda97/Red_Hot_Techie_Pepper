2007-05-09T11:58:00.000Z	david		it won't even let me see any shares so I'm clueless what to add in places
2007-05-09T11:58:00.000Z	david		nothing shows anything anyway
2007-05-09T11:59:00.000Z	david		it's "FILESERVER"

2007-05-09T12:00:00.000Z	david		oh wait
2007-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	david		aha!
2007-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	david		I have nothing to resolve the name
2007-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	david		hmm

2007-05-09T12:04:00.000Z	david		Totem Movie Player... that's nothing compared to mplayer - no?
2007-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	shawn34	david	mplayer is much better in 'playability' but totem blends in much better with the rest of your gnome apps
2007-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	david		ok
2007-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	david		it seemed a bit choppy shawn34
2007-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	shawn34	david	what does
2007-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	david		I'll see soon, but it seemed like it had some issues with OggM
2007-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	david	shawn34	totem
2007-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	shawn34	david	depends, totem-xine is much better
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	shawn34	david	are you talking about the totem plugin for firefox?
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	david	shawn34	yep, it's lagging
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	david		Totem Movie Player
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	david		it's decoding poorly
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	david		*ineffectively
2007-05-09T12:07:00.000Z	shawn34	david	sudo apt-get install totem-xine
