2009-08-17T09:46:00.000Z	kamil		hi guys can somebody tell me how to make keyboards shortcuts for arbitrary commands ?
2009-08-17T09:46:00.000Z	kamil		I think it should be possible using compiz
2009-08-17T09:46:00.000Z	maco	kamil	install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-08-17T09:47:00.000Z	kamil	maco	exactly that I found on internet but what package should I instal?
2009-08-17T09:47:00.000Z	maco	kamil	compizconfig-settings-manager is the package
2009-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	kamil	maco	I have it allready on newest vewrsion :) but how can I start it or find it
2009-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	maco	kamil	system -> preferences -> desktop effects
2009-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	maco	kamil	or maybe "advanced desktop effects" ... itll have a green jewel icon
2009-08-17T09:51:00.000Z	maco	kamil	did you get it open? if youre having trouble, just hit alt+f2 and type "ccsm" in the runbox
2009-08-17T09:52:00.000Z	maco	kamil	its in general
2009-08-17T09:52:00.000Z	maco	kamil	there's a "keybindings" tab inside it
2009-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	kamil	maco	bzhang: ok thanks very much :) it's working now
2009-11-22T21:25:00.000Z	maco	kamil	also, itd probably help if you actually described what was wrong
2009-11-22T21:25:00.000Z	maco	kamil	youre still not describing a specific problem which you would like help resolving. please do so.
2009-11-22T21:27:00.000Z	maco	kamil	there is no guarantee that 64bit will fix any of your bugs
2009-11-22T21:27:00.000Z	maco	kamil	by the way, 64bit software requires more memory, so unless youve got 4GiB, your system will likely actually suffer WORSE performance with amd64
2009-11-22T21:31:00.000Z	maco	kamil	the work offline thing...are you using network manager or not?
2009-11-22T21:31:00.000Z	kamil	maco	Yes i have UbuDSL for config my network
2009-11-22T21:32:00.000Z	maco	kamil	well thats why on firefox then. it asks networkmanager "am i online?" if youre not using nm, nm cant answer that quesiton
2009-11-22T21:34:00.000Z	maco	kamil	i dont know. i dont use proprietary graphics.
2009-11-22T21:34:00.000Z	kamil	maco	s*it ;/
2009-11-22T21:34:00.000Z	maco	kamil	no swaring
2009-11-22T21:36:00.000Z	kamil	maco	ok. Is good to reinstall the system into 64 bit version? I have !Gb RAM and i don't know mayby debian or fedora will erase the problem. I heard about ubuntu some things like ubuntu likes crashing sometimes. The best linux is debian yeah?
