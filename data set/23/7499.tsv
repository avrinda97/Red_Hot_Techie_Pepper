2005-07-14T06:16:00.000Z	trebuchet		yeah, i know, but it still ought to work
2005-07-14T06:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	is dma turned on your hard drive ?
2005-07-14T06:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	do sudo hdparm /dev/hda
2005-07-14T06:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	it will say >> using_dma    =  1 (on) ....if it's turned on
2005-07-14T06:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	can you post the output of the command to pastebin.ca ?
2005-07-14T06:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	how mnay hard drives do you have ?
2005-07-14T06:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	that's usually the problem with jerky video, what kind of system do you have like ram/processor ?
2005-07-14T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	that's a good system
2005-07-14T06:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	hdparm -c1 /dev/hdx
2005-07-14T06:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	you don't have 32 bit I/O
2005-07-14T06:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	it's not your fault :)
2005-07-14T06:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	heh
2005-07-14T06:28:00.000Z	trebuchet	LinuxJones	will the 32bit pipe take affect only after reboot?
2005-07-14T06:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	trebuchet	you can add it to a script
