2011-10-12T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Do you have more than one hard drive?
2011-10-12T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Do you have more than one internal hard drive?
2011-10-12T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	How many?
2011-10-12T11:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	How many?
2011-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Try changing the boot order so that a different drive is first (or if your BIOS has a one time boot menu option that would probably be easier/faster). Try with each drive (whether you think it makes sense for that drive to boot Ubuntu or not) until one works. If none work then come back and use my nick (Jordan_U) in your comment so I see it.
2011-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Grub is always installed by default. It just wasn't installed to the drive that your BIOS is currently configured to boot from.
2011-10-12T11:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Your BIOS doesn't give you an option for which of your 4 internal hard drives it boots from?
2011-10-12T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Try changing the boot order so that a different drive is first (or if your BIOS has a one time boot menu option that would probably be easier/faster). Try with each drive (whether you think it makes sense for that drive to boot Ubuntu or not) until one works. If none work then come back and use my nick (Jordan_U) in your comment so I see it. Please trust me on this and just try it.
2011-10-12T11:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	Correct.
2011-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	The portion of grub in question is in the boot sector and post-mbr gap, not in any partition. Please follow my instructions and just trust me. I won't be here much longer but I'd like to help you.
2011-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	If you use the manual partitioning option then you will be asked where to install grub. You can also install grub wherever you want manually after install (from the liveCD).
2011-10-12T12:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	If you follow my instructions Ubuntu will boot. I could have helped you get grub onto whatever drive you wanted but I need to leave now. Good luck.
2011-10-12T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wrenny	If you do decide to select where to install grub manually do *not* select a partition. Grub's boot sector should always be installed to the mbr (e.g. /dev/sda and *not* /dev/sda1).
