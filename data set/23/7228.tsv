2010-09-05T09:26:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	Does that work for you?
2010-09-05T09:27:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	What is the interface name?  (You should have seen it in the output of iwconfig)
2010-09-05T09:27:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	Do you see the network-manager anywhere on the screen?
2010-09-05T09:28:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	Open a terminal window and type:  iwconfig
2010-09-05T09:29:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	Do  you see the interface name there?
2010-09-05T09:29:00.000Z	usr13	guest0001	Tell us what the interface name is.
