2006-03-07T16:44:00.000Z	ryan		how do i install programs i download
2006-03-07T16:44:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	is it a .deb?
2006-03-07T16:45:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	you are using ubuntu right?
2006-03-07T16:45:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	http://www.frostwire.com/static/downloads.html click on the one for ubuntu
2006-03-07T16:47:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	where is it? desktop?
2006-03-07T16:51:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	please don't use enter as punctuation.  I'll talk you through it, just tell me where the file is, desktop?
2006-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	ok, opena terminal by going to applications menu > accessories > terminal
2006-03-07T16:53:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	now type 'ls', does it list FrostWire-4.10.5-0.i586.deb ?
2006-03-07T16:55:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	ok let's assume it went to downloads.  do 'cd downloads' and then 'ls', is it listed now?
2006-03-07T16:56:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	download the file again and put it on your desktop if you don't know where it is
2006-03-07T16:58:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	heh I skipped a step before :), do 'cd ~/Desktop' make sure you use a capital D
2006-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	'cd ~/Desktop', there is a space
2006-03-08T17:01:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	now 'sudo dpkg -i Frost<tab>', and <tab> means press the tab key (watch the magic)
2006-03-08T17:01:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	press enter
2006-03-08T17:02:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	yep
2006-03-08T17:02:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	that's ok, jsut type it
2006-03-08T17:03:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	make sure you read ubotu's link so that you can learn all about the terminal
2006-03-08T17:05:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	np, but it's a good idea now to read those tutorials and understand this stuff on your own
2006-03-08T17:37:00.000Z	_jason	ryan	mplayer imo
