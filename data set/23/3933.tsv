2008-01-19T04:26:00.000Z	RyanPrior		My video applications are screwed up. I can watch Flash movies in Firefox (using flash-restricted), but when I try to watch movies in Totem (or VLC even) the picture is drawn as a bunch of vertical lines. Interestingly, this still happens when I use a LiveCD. How do I fix that?
2008-01-19T04:28:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	what type of graphic card do you have ?
2008-01-19T04:28:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I have an ATI 400 M card.
2008-01-19T04:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I'm using fglrx, dunno if that's supported.
2008-01-19T04:30:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	I dont use ati cards , but afaik support for them is not great atm altho it is improving ?
2008-01-19T04:31:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	Video has worked on this card since I first installed Edgy.
2008-01-19T04:31:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	what are you using to play ?
2008-01-19T04:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I can play flash videos using Firefox (and flash-restricted), but not any kind of videos using Totem or VLC.
2008-01-19T04:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I can't play Ogg Theora, AVI, mpg, anything.
2008-01-19T04:32:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	have you tried reinstalling totem / gstreamer packages ?
2008-01-19T04:34:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I have not tried reinstalling gstreamer or totem. How do I do that?
2008-01-19T04:36:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	openup synaptic and search for gstreamer and reinstall the installed , Have you installed the codecs for the media you are trying to play ?
2008-01-19T04:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	Yes, the codecs are installed and have been working for a year and half now.
2008-01-19T04:38:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	I would try re-install the gst/totem first , have you run totem from the cli ( any output ? )
2008-01-19T04:38:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	Nope, good idea though.
2008-01-19T04:40:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I reinstalled all of my gstreamer packages, including all the codecs, and the problem still persists.
2008-01-19T04:41:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	any output from cli ?
2008-01-19T04:42:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	Nope, no CLI output.
2008-01-19T04:43:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	run gstreamer-properties
2008-01-19T04:45:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	I ran gstreamer-properties, and the video output is set to "Default". The "Test" button shows a video of colourful stripes with static in the corner.
2008-01-19T04:46:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	are you sure the source is not poluted and you have the correct codec
2008-01-19T04:46:00.000Z	RyanPrior	daxroc	Yup, these are all movies that I have played before.
2008-01-19T04:48:00.000Z	daxroc	RyanPrior	so plugin is set to autodetect in gst-prop, find it strange it just stoped working , did you install some new sw ?
