2008-10-14T05:22:00.000Z	Smell		I downloaded the net-install cd and installed the minimum ubuntu system,  and have been hand selecting packages to install. I have the kde/gnome core packages installed, and everything is working fine, except for my sound
2008-10-14T05:22:00.000Z	Smell		is there certain sound packages i should install>?
2008-10-14T05:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	Are you attempting to use integrated sound from a nForce4 chipset?
2008-10-14T05:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	Which chipset is on your motherboard?
2008-10-14T05:25:00.000Z	Smell	BlueEagle	: best way to tell?
2008-10-14T05:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	lspci|grep Multimedia

2008-10-14T05:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	Be sure to un-mute and turn up the volume for both Master and PCM channels
2008-10-14T05:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	M toggles mute/unmute and the up and down arrows adjust the volume while left and right arrows change channels.
2008-10-14T05:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	Did that fix the sound for you?
2008-10-14T05:45:00.000Z	Smell	BlueEagle	: So i turned up the volume on the Master channel in alsamixergui but still no sound
2008-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	Did you also turn up the volume on the PCM channel and un-mute them?
2008-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	Smell	BlueEagle	: I did
2008-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Smell	You were on xubuntu, or am I confusing you with someone else?
