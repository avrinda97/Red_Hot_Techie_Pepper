2006-10-30T11:12:00.000Z	wweasel		I need some help with setting up mice in xorg.conf - I am trying to fix it so that my trackpad's sidescroll works. I managed that, but now my external mouse isn't being recognized...I can pastebin the old and the new if you like.
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	set the device to be /dev/input/mice
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	done. the issue is with the "Protocol" I believe.
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	chang eit to auto
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	auto-dev? When I do that the sidescroll on my trackpad doesn't work
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	to get that to work I needed to make it synps2
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	no, protocal auto
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	ok, you can have multiple entries
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	just copy the entire input device section
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	and make a seperate one iwth synps2
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	ok.
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	wouldn't I need to distinguish between the two somehow?
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	with the device and driver line yes
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	you should be able to use all the devices at the same time
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	can I show you have I have done in #flood?
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	sure
2006-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	Should both entries have Option "CorePointer", or just the touchpad one?
2006-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	good question, try it on just one
2006-10-30T11:35:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	I am trying it. Restarting X...brb.
2006-12-27T08:31:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	you can do ctrl alt + to change resolution, that might reload the colour depth to but i am not sure
2006-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	actualy, aparrantly x doesnt allow changing colour depth without restarting
2006-12-27T08:33:00.000Z	wweasel	variant	Thanks man. That's a pain :P
2006-12-27T08:33:00.000Z	variant	wweasel	indeeed
