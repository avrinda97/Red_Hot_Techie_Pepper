2006-10-10T16:20:00.000Z	Phuzion		I'm having DNS errors
2006-10-10T16:20:00.000Z	Phuzion		Can someone help me diagnose my problem?
2006-10-10T06:52:00.000Z	Phuzion		Hey guys, I have an Ubuntu server that I just set up with bash as my only interface.  I need to properly configure DNS for this machine, because something isn't quite working on it when it comes to the field of domain name resolution, can someone help me out?
2006-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	Phuzion		Router does it for me
2006-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	Phuzion		WRT54G
2006-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	Phuzion		It just acts as a DNS router, it doesn't actually resolve the names
2006-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	Phuzion		1.1
2006-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	Phuzion		And the server's address is 192.168.1.8
2006-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	Phuzion		1.1*
2006-10-10T06:56:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	umm your router gets the DNS from outside
2006-10-10T07:01:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	edit /etc/resolv.conf and put in your router's ip in there
2006-10-10T07:01:00.000Z	Phuzion	kitche	 I have already done that
2006-10-10T07:02:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	make sure the interface is up sudo ifup ethX
2006-10-10T07:02:00.000Z	Phuzion	kitche	 Im sure it is
2006-10-21T05:17:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	I tend to use custom dns servres instead of what my router sends me
2006-10-21T05:41:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	it will search for that then use the dns servers
2006-10-21T05:45:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	didn't you say your gateway is 192.168.1.1?
2006-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	why have a google bot when it will be abused?
2006-11-22T10:24:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	yes firefox 2.0 is in dapper-backports for dapper
2006-11-30T06:19:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	/etc/resolv.conf is read all the time no need to reload your networking, since if your using dhcpcd your resolv.conf would be overwritten
2006-11-30T06:20:00.000Z	Phuzion	kitche	 I'm not using dhcpcd :)
2006-11-30T06:20:00.000Z	kitche	Phuzion	then just use the network like normal it should work without restarting it
2006-11-30T06:20:00.000Z	Phuzion	kitche	 thanks
