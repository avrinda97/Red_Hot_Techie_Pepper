2007-05-05T05:52:00.000Z	Moniker42		hi, i changed the boot splash screen a few weeks ago
2007-05-05T05:52:00.000Z	Moniker42		but i've gone off it
2007-05-05T05:52:00.000Z	Moniker42		how do i change it back to the default? ;)
2007-05-05T05:54:00.000Z	Moniker42		anyways
2007-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	Moniker42		grub fix, anyone?
2007-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	Moniker42		as seen on the popular tshirt "Got Root?"
2007-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	Moniker42		or prefix the command with "sudo" but make sure you know what you're doing, it asks for the root password because it can break the system
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	sudo does not ask for the root pasword.
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Moniker42	Agrajag	it asks for the superuser's password?
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	no.
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Moniker42	Agrajag	root and user password are the same for me...
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	it asks for the password of whoever ran sudo.
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Moniker42		!root | thelostpatrol
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	You added a root password?
2007-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	Moniker42	Agrajag	y'what?
2007-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	Unless you specifically added a root password, root does not have a password.
2007-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	Moniker42	Agrajag	so you could just boot ubuntu and login as root without a password?
2007-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	Moniker42		which isn't the case
2007-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	When you run sudo, sudo asks for your password and checks to see if you have permission to gain root privileges.
2007-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	no. no password means you cannot log in as root.
2007-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	Moniker42	Agrajag	okay..
2007-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	Moniker42		i know what already, i'm not the one with the problem with root here ;)
2007-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	Moniker42	no, but you seem to have the wrong idea of how sudo works. I'm just lettin' you know
