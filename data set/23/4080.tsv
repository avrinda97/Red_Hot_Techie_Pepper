2007-12-25T02:55:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221		Hi, how can I open .package files?
2007-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	.package files are done using Autopackage
2007-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	not sure
2007-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	Then how can I get it?
2007-12-25T02:57:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	hrm..what prog is it?
2007-12-25T02:57:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	It's a emulator I downloaded, It's the linux binary version.
2007-12-25T02:58:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	do they offer any other package formats for the linux binary?
2007-12-25T02:59:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	I don't know, can you check it? http://www.desmume.org/downloads/
2007-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	try the debian packges
2007-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	http://packages.debian.org/desmume
2007-12-25T03:02:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	I tried to go to that link but I can't seem to find a .deb file...
2007-12-25T03:03:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	Oh, I tried the metod on autopackage.org and I think it's working, thanks.
2007-12-25T03:04:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	heh; debian downloads: http://packages.debian.org/sid/i386/desmume/download
2007-12-25T03:13:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	The emulator was installed over Autopackage, where can I run it? Can you help?
2007-12-25T03:14:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	try running it from terminal
2007-12-25T03:14:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	you will probably need to manually add a menu entry once you know the command to start it
2007-12-25T03:16:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	A huge red "FAIL" appeared in the terminal.... I know I have to write package "name here" I think, I wrote package desmume and it doesn't work...
2007-12-25T03:18:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	I have no idea of what to do now... If I only knew the running command...
2007-12-25T03:18:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	it should be $sudo autopackage desmume from the same directory where you downloaded the fiel to
2007-12-25T03:19:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	Didn't work...
2007-12-25T03:20:00.000Z	Bonzodog	DarkSpirit221	or are you having problems running the emulator itself
2007-12-25T03:20:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	Yes, that's it lol
2007-12-25T03:20:00.000Z	DarkSpirit221	Bonzodog	That's what I said, I installed it but I can't run it now...
