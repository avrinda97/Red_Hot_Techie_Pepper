2006-08-20T10:58:00.000Z	Dreamglider		when i watch video files windowed the picture is good, but when i og fullscreen, i see alot of lines as if the picture was split up every other line, anyone know what i can do about this ?
2006-08-20T10:59:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	deinterlace the file... mplayer, xine or vlc can do this during playback, although it eats CPU-time
2006-08-20T10:59:00.000Z	Dreamglider	stefg	how
2006-08-20T11:00:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	check the preferences of your prefereed videoplayer
2006-08-20T11:02:00.000Z	Dreamglider		i dont want deinterlace if it uses so much CPU, is there no other way around this ?
2006-08-20T11:04:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	make sure you use xv as the output device... it might be your system is too slow, when you don't have a + 600 Mhz CPU and a reasonable graphics card (no 'shared mem' video)

2006-08-20T11:07:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	you have the nvidia-driver installed (not the open source 'nv' driver?)
2006-08-20T11:08:00.000Z	Dreamglider	stefg	i dont know
2006-08-20T11:08:00.000Z	Dreamglider		how do i see that ?
2006-08-20T11:10:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	do "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable".. press ctrl-alt-backspace after that to restart the X-server
2006-08-20T11:10:00.000Z	Dreamglider		its a GeForce FX Go5600
2006-08-20T11:11:00.000Z	Dreamglider	stefg	ok ill do that
2006-08-20T11:15:00.000Z	stefg		!enter
2006-08-20T11:20:00.000Z	Dreamglider		no go, i still have the flicker/lines in fullscreen mode
2006-08-20T11:20:00.000Z	stefg		!paste
2006-08-20T11:21:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	what player are you using?
2006-08-20T11:23:00.000Z	Dreamglider	stefg	VLC
2006-08-20T11:24:00.000Z	Dreamglider	stefg	in fullscreen i still see the lines move aroun even if the player is paused
2006-08-20T11:26:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	then it might be a driver or hardware issue. Check in VLC's preferences (advanced options checked), -> output modules is set to XVideo
2006-08-20T11:27:00.000Z	stefg	Dreamglider	save and restart the playback after that
