2004-10-29T15:19:00.000Z	Treenaks		don't forget to escape the !s
2004-10-29T15:20:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	esoace the !s ?
2004-10-29T15:20:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	??
2004-10-29T15:20:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	that's a command to enter in a shell, nothing to escape
2004-10-29T15:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	my shell complains about the "!"s not being escaped..
2004-10-29T15:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	it tells me "event not found"
2004-10-29T15:22:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	what are you doing and where ?
2004-10-29T15:24:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	entering your gst-launch command line in bash in  an xterm
2004-10-29T15:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	try something in bash with only one ! in it..
2004-10-29T15:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	it'll try to find the last command with the word you put after the !
2004-10-29T15:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	try "echo !gst-launch", for example
2004-10-29T15:26:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	why ? The "!" are separator for the gstreamer command ...
2004-10-29T15:26:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	yes I know.. but it's ALSO command repetition in (at least) bash and zsh
2004-10-29T15:27:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	dunno why you're trying to repet stuff, but if you just use the command given some lines earlier it works
2004-10-29T15:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	I know that...
2004-10-29T15:28:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	it's just that it look weird to me, because I only use ! for repetition
2004-11-26T17:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	ah!
2004-11-28T08:32:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	it breaks if you have famd running and gamin installed
2004-11-28T08:32:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	what breaks ?
2004-12-12T12:00:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	how do I build a debug version of the gstreamer 0.8 plugins? does DEB_BUILD_OPTS=debug,nostrip work?
2004-12-12T12:02:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	yes
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128	(I'm debugging an upstream issue with rbultje :))
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks	ok, cool
