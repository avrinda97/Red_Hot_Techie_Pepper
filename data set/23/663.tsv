2011-04-20T03:38:00.000Z	r4ykid		hi everyone. How can i reconfigure/recalibrate my Game Controllers buttons?
2011-04-20T03:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	jscal from the joystick packages is a cli configuration
2011-04-20T03:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	sorry i don't think jscal will do anything for buttons, only calibrates axies
2011-04-20T03:39:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	i tried to use that btw. I had no luck finding out how the device is called.
2011-04-20T03:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	"should" be /dev/input/js0
2011-04-20T03:40:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	thank you, maybe that will be of some use
2011-04-20T03:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	you can "cat /dev/input/js0" and use the joystick to test
2011-04-20T03:41:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	shows wierd signs, turns out it IS the device the js is on. thanks
2011-04-20T03:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	glad to help
2011-04-20T03:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	? i've never had a joystick that didn't work OOTB.  Good luck man.
2011-04-20T03:42:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	yeah :/ its the dualshock 3, i think its because the buttons are pressure sensitive
2011-04-20T03:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	i had a ds3 work for me?  using usb.
2011-04-20T03:43:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	im using usb too. Could it be the game? whats the best way to test?
2011-04-20T03:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	use the cat command and see if all buttons / axis give output to the screen
2011-04-20T03:44:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	thanks again^^
2011-04-20T03:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	glad to help :)
2011-04-20T03:47:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	they all seem to work so its definitely a game problem. Maybe the google can help here^^
2011-04-20T03:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	it isn't dosbox is it?
2011-04-20T03:51:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	no it is not Dosbox. Its aquaria ^^
2011-04-20T03:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	k - just asking.  Dosbox was very limited re-joystick buttons for me
2011-04-20T03:54:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	final question. Do you know by any chance if it is possible with Joy2Key or some other tool to remap a stick to the mouse?
2011-04-20T03:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	r4ykid	i've only played with joy2key for a few minutes, didn't help in my case so i dropped it.  So i really don't know.  I've never had to remap buttons sorry (at least not outside of a game).  Good luck man.
2011-04-20T03:56:00.000Z	r4ykid	ZykoticK9	hm ok, thank you for the help. Maybe i can find something on the internet that helps me. Else i have to play aquaria with mouse i guess. Was just testing stuff anyways :D
