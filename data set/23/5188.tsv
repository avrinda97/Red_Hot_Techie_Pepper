2007-01-23T13:01:00.000Z	Aubade		The love of editing RC files and messing with system-wide configs is a great fetish to have.
2007-01-23T13:02:00.000Z	Aubade		Evil versions of us all with goatees and robes...
2007-01-23T13:03:00.000Z	Aubade		You have no idea how long it took me to get the hang of things, migrating from BeOS to Linux.
2007-01-23T13:04:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	how did you find BeOS?
2007-01-23T13:05:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	I grew up on a Mac IIe and a BeBox.
2007-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	i am really interested in the BeOS experience - was there emphasis in command line too ? I am thinking of trying Haiku in a vmware session
2007-01-23T13:07:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	It's a toss-up, like Linux. You can get by for the most part w/o using a command shell.
2007-01-23T13:08:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	but in the end for something hard you have to revert to cmd don't you ?
2007-01-23T13:08:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	i am not afraid of commandlines, i write scripts myself - i am just curious
2007-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	i personally think that BeOS had the most amazing realtime capabilities after qnx - after things i have seen
2007-01-23T13:10:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	and the fact that they had a _standard_ set of gui widgets was great
2007-01-23T13:11:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	why not, there are so many standards for us to choose. Ultimate user experience ;-)
2007-01-23T13:16:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	even though linux has come a long way there are many _very_ bad things at least from the perspective of the user
2007-01-23T13:17:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	Lies, everything is perfect! X11's tearing and and the wagon of people with their own standards each are features.
2007-01-23T13:18:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	from simply watching the progress of the haiku OS i think that there are things in it that people wnt
2007-01-23T13:19:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	i would install linux in many friends homes - but how to explain to the most ignorant ones that copy-paste does not work the same ? Or that widget sets are totally different ? or ...
2007-01-23T13:20:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	Oh man, C 'n' P is probably the first thing that always comes up when I introduce a GNOME desktop to someone.
2007-01-23T13:24:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	what really annoys me are the _evangelists_ saying that linux is perfect for all things - and hiding  when it comes to things working in a specific way
2007-01-23T13:24:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	mm
2007-01-23T13:25:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	i mean for example the mayhem of X font configuration - this is a major clusterf***  if you want fonts exactly the same along everything related to X: gnome, kde, old apps with athena widgets, old gtk apps etc
2007-01-23T13:26:00.000Z	Aubade	funkdollar	Well, the progress that's been made in 16 years is still there and impressive when considering how futile efforts have been to standardize all the aspects (windowing systems, widget toolkits, package management, etc).
2007-01-23T13:28:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	the really funny thing about standardization in a free operating system is that: people start developing their own standard hoping that it will prevail. When it does not all existing standards are kept and their existence is baptized "choice" and "freedom of speech". Of course now they are features  lol
2007-01-23T13:30:00.000Z	funkdollar	Aubade	yes you are right - i get really sentimental some times :-|
