2008-04-13T05:55:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	Cool, but that wasn't really going to help me was I was trying to do, but it's fine now I did it the long way. lol
2008-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	How good are you with vim? I kind of like but I have another question. lol
2008-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	What's the question?
2008-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	I am using visual mode to copy and paste, any way I can paste in to a new line without hitting o and then pushing esc to get out of inserting text? lol Just to remove 1 step.
2008-04-13T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	Paste from the clipboard or 'put' from the buffer?
2008-04-13T06:01:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	buffer. Sorry. lol Still new.
2008-04-13T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	I am not sure what you mean then, you wouldn't be in insert mode after a put ( I am probably misinterpreting what you asked )
2008-04-13T06:03:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	Well, I am after I hit 'o' to open a new line, than I have to esc again and then use put. I was asking any way I can do that without going into insert mode when putting into a new line.
2008-04-13T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	lowercase 'p' should paste on a new line by default, are you using capital 'P' ?
2008-04-13T06:07:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	No, it actually puts where my cursor is.
2008-04-13T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	That is odd, I just tried it and it puts on a new line for me, you don't have caps lock on?
2008-04-13T06:08:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	No.
2008-04-13T06:09:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	I mean I am sure, it's not on.lol
2008-04-13T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	What does capital 'P' do for you?
2008-04-13T06:11:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	I don't see a difference. lol
2008-04-13T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	Ahh, my mistake, I usually put after doing a 'yy' and that puts a newline in the buffer :)
2008-04-13T06:14:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	Ah, so It's 'yy' and than 'p'? It works that way, Thanks.
2008-04-13T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	np
2008-04-13T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	In case you don't know, 'yy' will yank ( copy ) the entire line
2008-04-13T06:15:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	Okay. :)
2008-10-12T03:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rathel	What issue are you having?
2008-10-12T03:31:00.000Z	rathel	Jordan_U	When I navigate to a long directory, that filles the width of the prompt, and I type a command or something, when I backspace the cursor jumps a line up and when I start typing it again the lines repeat.
