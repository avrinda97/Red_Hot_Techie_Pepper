2005-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	Cashel		impatient one him...
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	Cashel		OSS was good at one point, but they arent keepin up w/ the times...
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	Cashel		ahh congrats... if you find that it's skipping a lot you may want to check that DMA for the drive is on (hdparm -d /dev/????
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	Cashel		yes
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	Cashel		see above :)
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	Cashel		speaking of DMA, hdparm -d 1 /dev/??? isnt perminant, anyone know the way to make it so?
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	add the command to the bottom of /etc/init.d/bootmish.sh
2005-09-12T13:41:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	the command is # sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/xxx
2005-09-12T13:44:00.000Z	Cashel	DrSpin	no such file
2005-09-12T13:44:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	-- interesting
2005-09-12T13:44:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	-- breezy??
2005-09-12T13:45:00.000Z	Cashel	DrSpin	hoary
2005-09-12T13:46:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	-- that's that I said ;)
2005-09-12T13:47:00.000Z	Cashel	DrSpin	so add hdparm -d1 /dev/?? to that?
2005-09-12T13:48:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	I use hdparm -d1c3X69u1m16 /dev/hda
2005-09-12T13:49:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	NOT SAFE FOR ALL HARDWARE
2005-09-12T13:50:00.000Z	Cashel	DrSpin	ok, I have to ask, how the hell did you figure that out ?
2005-09-12T13:50:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	man hdparm
2005-09-12T13:52:00.000Z	Cashel	DrSpin	ahh well, I feel at least a little better having figured out the correct way to turn dma on :P .. /etc/hdparm.conf :)
2005-09-12T13:53:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	that will work for the hard drives but it won't for the CDROM drives ;)
2005-09-12T13:54:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	at least on my box
2005-09-12T13:54:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	so I put them all in one place where I know how to find it
2005-09-12T13:55:00.000Z	DrSpin	Cashel	 and can predict the behavior
