2006-07-10T06:55:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	the choice is yours. My personal experience was that when I upgraded I had hassles. Did a clean install and everything worked fine
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	try "ls /media
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	what's in there?
2006-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	any mention of your usb stick?
2006-07-10T07:01:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	not sure. If you "ls /media/sbd1" is there anything in the results which suggests it's your usb stick?
2006-07-10T07:02:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	when I plug mine in, mine is loaded as /media/Kingston
2006-07-10T07:04:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	what about copying to your floppy?
2006-07-10T07:05:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	yep, you got the idea
2006-07-10T07:09:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	/media is usually the correct place. Are you expecting anything to be on your floppy at this stage?
2006-07-10T07:10:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	The colours refer to whether it is a file, directory etc etc
2006-07-10T07:11:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	IIRC sdb is pan external device. Do you have one?
2006-07-10T07:14:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	it might well be that sdb1 IS your usb drive. Could that be so?
2006-07-10T07:16:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	what message do you get?
2006-07-10T07:19:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	And if you try with a "sudo" in front?
2006-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	Progress!
2006-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	damn!
2006-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	jorvis beat me to it!
2006-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	in your case that should probably read something like "cp -r . /media/sdb1"
2006-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	and maybe with "sudo" in front
2006-07-10T07:28:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	or "cp ./yourfolder /media/sdb1"
2006-07-10T07:32:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	Puzzled too
2006-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	My first thought is that it suggests that sdb1 isn't your usb stick, but rather another device
2006-07-10T07:37:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	landsg	which means sdb1 isn't your USB stick
