2004-11-05T08:08:00.000Z	cef_work		hang on.. you're trying to disable a network card at boot?
2004-11-05T08:08:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	so i just run the command that LinuxJones posted?
2004-11-05T08:04:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	that just tells it to set the defaults for stop, not to disable it
2004-11-05T08:05:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	so after you set that up, you should consider setting up 'stop' scripts so that it doesn't get modified
2004-11-05T08:06:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	this sounds rather complicated
2004-11-05T08:07:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	easiest is just to rm the rc?.d script you don't want it to run
2004-11-05T08:07:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	but i need the script as sometimes I might want to use my network card
2004-11-05T08:07:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	just don't delete it from /etc/init.d
2004-11-05T08:08:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	if so, then that's the wrong way to go about it
2004-11-05T08:08:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	what's the network card? onboard for a lappy?
2004-11-05T08:10:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	then you can still use 'ifup ifname' and 'ifdown ifname' whenever you like
2004-11-05T08:11:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	yes, or look in /etc/rc?.d/ and delete the S##service file (note, not the /etc/init.d/service file, you want to KEEP that)
2004-11-05T08:12:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	debian uses runlevels differently to other distributions.. the default runlevel is 2, and 2,3,4 & 5 are pretty much set up identical
2004-11-05T08:13:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	and controlling the setup of these is a sort of known issue with debian (and ubuntu) that will probably be looked at for the next release
2004-11-05T08:17:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	how do you know it's fully charged?
2004-11-05T08:18:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	i know it is charged because of the light on the front of the computer
2004-11-20T07:29:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	could be, but that's just a guess from what you've said as I'm not using hoary myself
2004-11-20T07:32:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	i don't really know what fam does, but i noticed it has been replace today so just a guess
2004-11-20T07:33:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	you can use grip and ograburn
2004-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	cef_work	Matt|	k3b seems to do all this in one package, but hey.. we'll get there
2004-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	*laughs*
2004-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	i hear rhythmbox will do it. bit weird idea tho
2004-11-20T07:41:00.000Z	Matt|	cef_work	do you think that I should wait on the slow gnome / hoary thing, or report a bug, or mail the list or what?
