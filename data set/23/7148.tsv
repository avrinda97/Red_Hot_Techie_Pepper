2005-10-11T13:27:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	you can build your own java .deb which you then install... people will tell you the better way is to obtain existing debs at some place like where the bot will tell you, but that has legal problems that can get you AND the place where you got it in trouble.
2005-10-11T13:29:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	I've been using Slackware for years, because for a long time it was the _only_ distro where _everything_ worked out of the box (no flame intended). Now I gave Kubuntu 5.04 a try, and I was so impressed that I decided to migrate all my four boxes to it.
2005-10-11T13:30:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	glad it worked out
2005-10-11T13:30:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	now you suggest I build my own java .deb? from sources? with checkinstall?
2005-10-11T13:30:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	no, use java-package
2005-10-11T13:31:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	can you be a bit more explicit please? (remember I only need it for firefox)
2005-10-11T13:32:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	sure I will :) AFTER you install java-package, read man make-jpkg and read /usr/share/doc/java-package/SUPPORTED
2005-10-11T13:33:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	thanks very much... as a slack veteran I'm not a lamer for rtfm:oD
2005-10-11T13:34:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	with kubuntu i feel like driving a honda goldwing after years of enfield bullet:oD
2005-10-11T13:34:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	I'm not sure you'd lack for any understanding after that, but in case you do, people here do know how to use it
2005-10-11T13:34:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	who are they? is this the developer channel mainly?
2005-10-11T13:35:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	read the docs... there's a misconception you have that will be dispelled
2005-10-11T13:36:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	anyway... i especially like the no-bullshit side of it. I installed my main server with ubuntu server, got it up and running in no time. nice.
2005-10-11T13:37:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	well... it's a hell of a lot of a difference to irc.debian.org#debian... ever tried to grasp some info there?
2005-10-11T13:37:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	I'm a dd :P
2005-10-11T13:39:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	I'm here trying to determine why a ubuntu hoary install succeeded where a debian sarge install failed (related to dhcp)
2005-10-11T13:40:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	last time I gave debian a try was when I tried Potato's desktop potential a few years ago. Boy, what a mess...
2005-10-11T13:41:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	but before reinstalling my server I hesitated briefly between Debian Sarge and Ubuntu.
2005-10-11T13:42:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	I think (stupidly) that what made me decide for Ubuntu was the rude tone on irc.debian.org:oD
2005-10-11T13:42:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	maybe "Debian" is the kwazooli word for "shitty attitude towards the rest of humanity" LOL
2005-10-11T13:43:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	some people there do have stinky attitudes, asuffield, mwilson, one or two others, me at times
2005-10-11T13:45:00.000Z	jim	kikinovak	you're ON irc.debian.org NOW :)
2005-10-11T13:46:00.000Z	kikinovak	jim	this is irc.freenode.net
