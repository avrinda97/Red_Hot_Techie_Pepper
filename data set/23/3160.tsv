2008-07-07T15:59:00.000Z	deadsnake		Hi, ive suddenly got a problem with an ntfs3g mount. it says Error opening partition device: Read-only file system
2008-07-07T15:59:00.000Z	deadsnake		Failed to mount '/dev/sde1': Read-only file system
2008-07-07T16:00:00.000Z	unohu	deadsnake	are you dualbooting?
2008-07-07T16:00:00.000Z	deadsnake	unohu	yes i am
2008-07-07T16:01:00.000Z	unohu	deadsnake	so u might have hibernated in vista/xp .... this may sometime mark the ntfs partitions as active or smthing..so it wont mount
2008-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	unohu	deadsnake	so check if you have shutdown......
2008-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	deadsnake	unohu	no, i definately havent hybernated in vista.
2008-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	deadsnake	unohu	plus all other ntfs drives do work

2008-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	deadsnake	unohu	there seems to be irrelevant stuff there
