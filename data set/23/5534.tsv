2007-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	In the meta data or the image itself?
2007-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	i wouldn't know how to make them in the metadata, what does that do and how hard is it?
2007-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	i was trying to think if there is any way to convert the text to text without retyping the whole thing
2007-11-07T09:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	Ahh, I misunderstood, there are OCR tools but all of the ones currently available for Linux suck :(
2007-11-07T09:01:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	but even attaching a sticky note type of things would let me tell myself (and others) what i think
2007-11-07T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	Ok, then just use an image editor like krita or GIMP
2007-11-07T09:03:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	thank you :) where can i go to get help with those? (i'm an adult parent with learning disabilties, my son moved out)
2007-11-07T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	Have you used the "paint" program in windows before?
2007-11-07T09:05:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	sethk i've only had linux. . but mostly command line i have been using vim
2009-09-28T13:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	System > Preferences > Network Connections I would reccommend openDNS
2009-09-28T13:53:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	ty much :))
2009-09-28T13:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	np :)
2009-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	chalcedony	Jordan_U	what does opendns do that a plain dns server won't?
2012-06-28T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	Yes, but you might have better luck in #lubuntu.
2012-06-28T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalcedony	You're welcome :)
