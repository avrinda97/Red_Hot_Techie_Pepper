2009-06-14T23:32:00.000Z	norpan111		Hello can i just reinstall ubuntu easy? i dont want to create another partition or something, just use the same that  its on now
2009-06-14T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	just follow the install
2009-06-14T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	it will install over the top of your existing data
2009-06-14T23:32:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 yes but the installer says "install side by side" i dont want that
2009-06-14T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	chose manual partition and select the same partitions
2009-06-14T23:33:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 is it that easy? choose (advanced)
2009-06-14T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	very common sense stuff
2009-06-14T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	what part is not clear ?
2009-06-14T23:41:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 well i can change partition and stuff tp "journal ext3 " and ext2 and so son, what should i do?
2009-06-14T23:45:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 should i choose my current ubuntu partition as ext3 journal ?
2009-06-14T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	yes
2009-06-14T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	it's common sense stuff -
2009-06-14T23:46:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 well if i dont know all this ext3 and what it means? If you dont contribute then please dont say anything, Dont be a wiseguy
2009-06-14T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	I wasn't being a wise guy
2009-06-14T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	I was trying to explain that if you follow it through with common sense you won't go far wrong - eg: do you want to format this (yes - you want to wipe the disk)
2009-06-14T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	so drop the attitude please.
2009-06-14T23:48:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 I was jusk asking for help what it means, and if its neccessary to format, and if i dont. What happens?
2009-06-14T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	if you don't - it won't wipe the disk, which isn't a good call for a clean install
2009-06-14T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	as I said, common sense stuff, if you want a clean install and wipe the disk = good, if you want a clean install and install over the top of the existing install = confusion
2009-06-14T23:49:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 its common sense for those who know
2009-06-14T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	if you follow the inststurctions on screen it should guide you and explain most of the options at a high level
2009-06-14T23:51:00.000Z	norpan111	ikonia	 thanks for  the help
2009-08-18T00:36:00.000Z	ikonia	norpan111	#ubuntu+1 is the correct channel for 9.10 discussion
