2010-11-25T02:46:00.000Z	Jeruvy		what directory is menu.lst in?
2010-11-25T02:47:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	Yeah you don't edit menu.lst directly anymore
2010-11-25T02:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	how would I edit this then?  It seems the kernel update broke my boot.
2010-11-25T02:49:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	Read up on it.  You can still do it.  It's just a bit more complex unfortunately.  What are you trying to do?
2010-11-25T02:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	make my computer boot once again :)
2010-11-25T02:49:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	what error is grub giving you right now?
2010-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	The easiest way is probably to edit the grub menu live using the e key.
2010-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	I did, it needs rootdelay added to the boot device.
2010-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	can I do this from initramfs?
2010-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	reboot the computer, press shift before Ubuntu starts to load to get to the grub menu, press e on the entry you want to edit, add in rootdelay, then try to boot that kernel.
2010-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	ok thanks I will do that.
2010-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	You can do it with grub.  You cannot do it with busybox
2010-11-25T02:53:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	makes sense I couldn't get anywhere in initramfs.  Trying to boot now.
2010-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	ya, I'm booting again.  Thanks.
2010-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	Awesome
2010-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	Now you have the fun task of fixing grub persistently.  You have to read a lot :)
2010-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	It should be easier though now that you're target system is bootable.

2011-07-23T18:31:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	klipper
2011-07-23T18:31:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	I don't use kde ;)
2011-07-23T18:31:00.000Z	edbian	Jeruvy	I was just being silly
2011-07-23T18:32:00.000Z	Jeruvy	edbian	is all good.
