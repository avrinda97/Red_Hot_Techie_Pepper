2012-06-05T14:09:00.000Z	Saeryn		What's the sound issue deanzod?
2012-06-05T14:10:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	no sound through speakers but working through headphone socket
2012-06-05T14:10:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Is your sound run through a conexant chip?
2012-06-05T14:11:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	I have no idea what that is
2012-06-05T14:13:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	You can also use "aplay -l" to list the playback devices.
2012-06-05T14:14:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	The chip is: realek alc883
2012-06-05T14:15:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Seems to be a few listed issues with that chip, give me a few minutes to look into it.
2012-06-05T14:16:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Try adding "model=laptop-eapd" to the same file ActionParsnip was having you edit earlier, remove the other line he had you add in, reboot and try it then.
2012-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Is your issue still around?
2012-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	Changed the line and rebooted but still no joy
2012-06-05T14:23:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	So you have sound coming from the speakers, but not the headphone jack or vice-versa?
2012-06-05T14:23:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	sound from headphones but not from speakers
2012-06-05T14:24:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	Maybe it's as if the laptop is thinking the headphones are still plugged in when they arent?!?
2012-06-05T14:25:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	If the headphones are never plugged in after boot and you still aren't getting sound it's more likely that the speakers aren't being noticed.
2012-06-05T14:30:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	What model is your machine?
2012-06-05T14:31:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	Acer Aspire 9810
2012-06-05T14:37:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	llutz Is correct
2012-06-05T14:37:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Working on your issue still :)
2012-06-05T14:39:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Have you tried gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf then adding in "options snd-hda-intel model=acer"? (without quotes) You'd save that and reboot again, if that doesn't work then try lenovo. I once got sound to work on my machine by specifying a different brand ironically enough.
2012-06-05T14:53:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	Sorry for the long silence...went to boil the kettle. I will try a few different models and reboots and see what happens thanks!
2012-06-05T14:54:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	Good luck :)
2012-06-05T15:00:00.000Z	deanzod	Saeryn	Thanks a lot! changing model to acer fixed it
2012-06-05T15:00:00.000Z	Saeryn	deanzod	:) Good!
