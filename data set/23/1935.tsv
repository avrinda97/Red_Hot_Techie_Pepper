2009-09-02T01:42:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Check dmesg
2009-09-02T01:42:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	How does it lock up?
2009-09-02T01:35:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	What is your question? Kingly disregard sebsebseb
2009-09-02T01:36:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	how to stop ubuntu 9.04 from trying to scan my disks on startup. i understand the risks, i just want to disable it.
2009-09-02T01:36:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Don't talk to me about risks like I'm some sort of panzy, I don't even have regular users set up.
2009-09-02T01:36:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	lol
2009-09-02T01:39:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Yes?
2009-09-02T01:40:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	oh, thanks. didn't notice you were talking til you highlighted :x
2009-09-02T01:41:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	and it usually does crash. i never shut down my computer unless i'm moving it, but it locks up every few days/weeks/months ;x
2009-09-02T01:43:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	audio/video freezes up, and it doesn't accept input from kb/m. doesn't dmesg only track things starting at boot? or does it carry over?
2009-09-02T01:43:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	it's literally like time freezes as far as my PC is concerned when it locks up. i have to hard-restart
2009-09-02T01:43:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Upgrade kernel and drivers.
2009-09-02T01:44:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	No. Its only X11 and whatever WM you're using
2009-09-02T01:44:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	That means keyboard and mouse too.
2009-09-02T01:44:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	i suck with custom kernel installs, but i upgrade to the highest in the repos. only driver i know to try is graphics, and i've tried with both fglrx and the radeon one. and i figured it was only affecting X, but without kb i can't go to tty to restart it.
2009-09-02T01:45:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	upgrade Xorg
2009-09-02T01:46:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	What about the ati drivers?
2009-09-02T01:46:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Try downgrading X to -server to 1.6.3
2009-09-02T01:46:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	i actually haven't installed them yet (this is a persistent problem between debian and ubuntu installs - it may even be hardware)
2009-09-02T01:47:00.000Z	ceil	cryptopsy	is there a nice apt-friendly way to downgrade? :x
2009-09-02T01:47:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Just select a lower version?
2009-09-02T01:47:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	Package manager pulls in its dependancies
2009-09-02T01:48:00.000Z	cryptopsy	ceil	What program? I don't remember speaking with you.
