2005-05-06T15:46:00.000Z	cens0red	bleezy	I asked that question too.
2005-05-06T15:47:00.000Z	bleezy	cens0red	 and never getting it installed great
2005-05-06T15:49:00.000Z	cens0red	bleezy	I had the rpm from Sun, left over from when I used mandrake linux. I used alien to convert that rpm into a .deb file. It works fine.
2005-05-06T15:51:00.000Z	bleezy	cens0red	 gona try now :)
2005-05-06T15:54:00.000Z	cens0red	bleezy	if you get it installed, remember to alter your /etc/bash.bashrc file so it adds the $JAVA_HOME variable. The instructions for that are at ubuntuguide.org.

2005-05-06T16:10:00.000Z	cens0red	bleezy	you need to go to ubuntuguide.org and start from the top pretty much.
