2009-09-14T07:35:00.000Z	TopCat		keith: i think that's a bios feature...some bioses do not support USB booting
2009-09-14T07:36:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	your right it is a bios feature
2009-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	I can use a live cd but I dont wanna wear out the cd rom cause it will be extremely expensive to replace
2009-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	TopCat		wear it out?
2009-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	its really old and live cd would have to run a lot of processes off the cd wont it?
2009-09-14T07:38:00.000Z	TopCat		keith: what are you trying to accomplish ?
2009-09-14T07:38:00.000Z	TopCat		just run or install linux ?

2009-09-14T07:42:00.000Z	keith1		is there any live cds for xubuntu?
2009-09-14T07:43:00.000Z	TopCat	keith1	have you thought of a network install?
2009-09-14T07:43:00.000Z	TopCat		using the CD just to run the installer, and all the packages are downloaded via network
2009-09-14T07:43:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	there is no hard drive
2009-09-14T07:44:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	I broke the connector to the motherboard
2009-09-14T07:44:00.000Z	TopCat		dude
2009-09-14T07:44:00.000Z	TopCat		it doesn't sound like you have many choices
2009-09-14T07:44:00.000Z	TopCat		if the machine is this old and broken...then use liveCD until it breaks
2009-09-14T07:45:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	hehe ya but I cant even find a xubuntu that includes a live option :(
2009-09-14T07:45:00.000Z	TopCat		Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
2009-09-14T07:46:00.000Z	TopCat		i actually don't even use ubuntu
2009-09-14T07:46:00.000Z	TopCat		i'm a centos user
2009-09-14T07:46:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	ya I think that might be a good idea
2009-09-14T07:46:00.000Z	keith1	TopCat	thanks
