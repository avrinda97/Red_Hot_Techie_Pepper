2011-08-31T23:36:00.000Z	Demon002		Has anyone managed a 11.04 Wubi install on Raid, if so do you know where the tutorial can be found?
2011-08-31T23:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Demon002	..dunno why anyone would put a wubi install on windows on raid , whynot just give ubuntu it's own partition ?
2011-08-31T23:38:00.000Z	Demon002		I am simply just attempting a side by side install, I am trying to avoid messing with the raid itself.
2011-08-31T23:40:00.000Z	Demon002		Blueskaj, besides partitioning a Raid sounds like a pain...
2011-08-31T23:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj		wubi isn't the way to do a sisde by side install , Demon002
2011-08-31T23:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj		wubi installs ubuntu inside windows , Demon002
2011-08-31T23:41:00.000Z	Demon002		Blueskaj, Says Install Ubuntu from Windows.. Sounds like what I am looking for...
2011-08-31T23:42:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	I see what you're saying I am not being as literal as I should be.. I know it is installed inside Windows...
2011-08-31T23:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj		ok, then raid in this case is immaterial, Demon002
2011-08-31T23:43:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	No it isn't...
2011-08-31T23:44:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	just trust me, ubuntu doesn't recognise that Windows is in the same Raid disk and wants to write over the entire 1Tb array.
2011-08-31T23:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj		ok Demon002 , then you're not using wubi
2011-08-31T23:45:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	When I reboot into Ubuntu it doesn't allow for correct installation, it flounders... Yeah I am...
2011-08-31T23:45:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	I installed Wubi in windows, it asks for a reboot, I do so and boot into Ubuntu.. and then I get floudered with errors and am told it was unable to install
2011-08-31T23:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Demon002	it doesn't matter , I wouldn't know how to help you anyway ...maybe someone else can , but what you're doing is rather convoluted. You'd be better to try a virtual install
2011-08-31T23:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!VB
2011-08-31T23:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!VM | Demon002
2011-08-31T23:47:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	I have it installed on a vm already...
2011-08-31T23:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj		ok Demon002 , nevermind ... I guess what you're doing is beyond my help :)
2011-08-31T23:48:00.000Z	Demon002	BluesKaj	I appreciate the offer though =)
2011-08-31T23:49:00.000Z	Demon002		Anyone have a tutorial for Win7 | Wubi 11.04 install on a RAID 0?
2011-08-31T23:51:00.000Z	Demon002		aas I have 2 drives and decided to try it for giggles.
2011-08-31T23:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Demon002	if you already have ubuntu in VM . why wubi ?
