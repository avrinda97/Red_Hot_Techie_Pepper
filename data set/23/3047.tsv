2008-09-04T06:48:00.000Z	speener		anyone?
2008-09-04T06:49:00.000Z	speener		how do i change settings for automount?
2008-09-04T06:50:00.000Z	speener		i added an option to the automount of my usb hd and now it wont mount
2008-09-04T06:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 you mean after it mounted you rightclicked on its iconm and messed wht the properties tabs/mount settings?
2008-09-04T06:52:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	yes
2008-09-04T06:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 seen others that did that.. i forget how they fixed it.. removed some files in .gnome* i belive.. but i dont rember what.
2008-09-04T06:55:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	would deleting .gnome2 affect much?
2008-09-04T06:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 that would reset ALL your gnome settings..
2008-09-04T06:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 well at elast most of them. thers aso the .gtk* dirs and perhaps another one or 2
2008-09-28T08:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 i know google will give a dozen+ examples/pages/hits for fstab vfat linux :)
2008-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	i know man, i know what to put but for some reason ubuntu won't load the partition with normal linux fstab entry
2008-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 you may want to set the umask, dmask, and fmask - thats a common example for vfat mountpoints.
2008-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	i've tried doing umask=0
2008-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	  not syre you really need the 'user' optopmn
2008-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 i think umask=0 does NOTHING...
2008-09-28T08:17:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	this is line: /dev/sda1 /media/hda1 vfat  user,defaults,rw 0 0
2008-09-28T08:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 /media/hda1 does exist dosent it?
2008-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 theres 'users' and 'user' options also.. they differ in what they do.. and i forget what they do. :) one lets users mount/unmount a device.. Ithink.. and  i forget what the other does
2008-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	yeah, i tried with both
2008-09-28T08:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 you may want to descrive to the channel what exactly is it not doing properly
2008-09-28T08:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 i dont think you need  either user, or users option
2008-09-28T08:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	speener	 try just 'defaults' as an option perhaps.. and work from there.
2008-09-28T08:21:00.000Z	speener	dr_willis	ok...let me see
