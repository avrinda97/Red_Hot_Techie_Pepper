2008-06-12T13:52:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	What do you mean "update"?  Just grab newest packages?
2008-06-12T13:53:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	I just enter 'sudo apt-get update'
2008-06-12T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	What are you trying to accomplish?
2008-06-12T13:54:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	i want to know what should i do after terminal finish read the package...
2008-06-12T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	right, what are you trying to *do*?  just get the newest versions of stuff?
2008-06-12T13:55:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	what do u mean? I just want to update via terminal..
2008-06-12T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	"update" could mean a number of things.  I'm just going to presume to know what you want: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-06-12T13:58:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	thanks.. if i want to upgrade now, but i not shutdown my pc before the download finish... could i continue it later if i online back?
2008-06-12T13:58:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	sorry....
2008-06-12T13:59:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	if i want to upgrade now, but i shutdown my pc before the download finish... can i continue it later if i online back?
2008-06-12T13:59:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	Yeah, but don't stop it once the downloads finish and it starts actually doing the upgrade
2008-10-27T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	What are you trying to install though?
2008-10-27T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	That's in the repositories, yeah.
2008-10-27T05:46:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	sudo apt-get install ettercap
2008-10-27T05:46:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	i know about apt-get... just i want to install manually...
2008-10-27T05:49:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	doing it manually won't give you a whole lot of information, instead of sudo apt-get install ettercap, you just configure, make, make install.  one command vs three, not a whole lot of insight.
2008-10-27T05:50:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	i try make form tarball, because, maybe sometime i don;t have connection internet... so i need to install from tarball.
2008-10-27T05:51:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	If you don't have an internet connection, you're not going to magically have the source.
2008-10-27T05:51:00.000Z	beyta	Flannel	i download tarball from somewhre and back to my room then install it..
2008-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	you can do the same with debs, actually.
2008-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	Flannel	beyta	Synaptic will even generate a download script for you
