2006-02-23T12:38:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	blarion, when you activate it.. do you deactivate your ethernet connection if you use it also first?
2006-02-23T12:38:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 i am never plugged in to ethernet, but my ethernet interface is active
2006-02-23T12:39:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	and your wlan0 is active at the same time ?
2006-02-23T12:40:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 my wifi card is configured on eth1, ethernet nic is eth0... dunno why.  both are active but only eth1 is in use
2006-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	its nothing... its the command for another distro not ubuntu.. its the only thing i can find on the net to update gl to turn on rendering
2006-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 will your bios let you boot with an external HD?
2006-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	from what i've seen in the boot order. its not listed...
2006-02-24T13:22:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	is the only way to use linux on ext hd. is if it is able to boot from the BIOS?
2006-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 i dunno...
2006-02-24T15:32:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 you mean extract it?
2006-02-24T15:33:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	yeah

2006-02-25T11:04:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 python is an interpreted language.
2006-02-25T11:07:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	do alot of programs use it currently?
2006-02-25T11:07:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 python is sortof like perl, it's a scripting language.  there are gui toolkits that use python, and it's popular for web programming.  i don't think a lot of linux sw is written in it...
2006-02-27T11:37:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 C was created so people wouldn't have to program in assembly anymore
2006-02-27T11:37:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	whats wrong with assembly that ppl didnt want to program in it anymore?
2006-02-27T11:37:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 it's difficult and tedious
2006-02-28T14:34:00.000Z	wastrel	OmegaAlpha	 there's an update available for tar
2006-02-28T14:36:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	wastrel	yes i know, but it keeps popping up after i installed it
