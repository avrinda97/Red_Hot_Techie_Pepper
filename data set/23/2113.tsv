2009-06-25T22:37:00.000Z	SlimSoldier	kinja-sheep	no this worked fine on hardy last month but then I upgraded to jaunty and no more work
2009-06-25T22:37:00.000Z	SlimSoldier	kinja-sheep	1 montior and 1 card does not turn on
2009-06-25T22:37:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	SlimSoldier	Try --> "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"

2009-06-25T22:38:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	SlimSoldier	Try "sudo nvidia-xconfig -a"
2009-06-25T22:38:00.000Z	SlimSoldier	kinja-sheep	all a reconfigure does is set it to http://paste.ubuntu.com/203696/
2009-06-25T22:39:00.000Z	SlimSoldier	kinja-sheep	Why would I run nvidia config with ati cards that makes no sense
2009-06-25T22:39:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	SlimSoldier	Linux does not care what graphic card you have.
2009-06-25T22:39:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	SlimSoldier	You're on another machine, right?

2009-06-25T22:40:00.000Z	SlimSoldier	kinja-sheep	I dont think xrandr in jaunty will work with 2 cards
