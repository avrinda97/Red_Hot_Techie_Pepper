2010-08-15T14:21:00.000Z	ghufran		hi. can someone help me with pitivi? i rendered a file but there is no video in it.. just audio.
2010-08-15T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 you sure its not your player that dosent have the proper codec/setup for teh video file?
2010-08-15T14:22:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	i exported it to output.avi and used vlc.
2010-08-15T14:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 see what teh file, or ffprobe command say about the file. and run vlc from a terminal and see if it mentions any video codecs.
2010-08-15T14:24:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	tried command prompt. i dont see anything ..
2010-08-15T14:26:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	this is what i get with ffprobe: http://pastie.org/1093372
2010-08-15T14:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 the ffprobe command is a tool ive recently learned about that can give some good info on various video files also.  :) lets see what it sayz
2010-08-15T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 it does seem the avi is either curruptd.. or  a odd codec... that is interesting
2010-08-15T14:27:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	it says unsupported codec. i wonder which codec it is talking about..
2010-11-25T17:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 that makes no sence.
2010-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	why not?
2010-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 you partition 'hard drives' and put filesystems on them...
2010-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	  an archive is a collection of files.....
2010-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	im talking about an archive.
2010-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 so.. what EXACTLY are you trying to do?
2010-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	there are collections where there are multiple archives that when extracted become the complete data
2010-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 you mean make a 'split' rar archive then?
2010-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	yes. if thats what its called
2010-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	check the rar man pages . or use some other archiver format.
2010-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	i tried reading tar man page. didnt see any option
2010-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 tar would be doing it old skool..  via tar, and the split/join/cat commands...
2010-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghufran	 if you want to use 'rar' you would want the rar man pages/docs.
2010-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	ghufran	Dr_Willis	any suggestions for the right tool? command line
