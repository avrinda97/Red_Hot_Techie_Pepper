2009-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	``Cube		hey, I got a question:
2009-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	``Cube		im getting a new laptop, and ima but linux on it. onw if I wanna store music in a smart way, how would I do that? put everything in a folder called MUSIC and then programs like rhythmbox id point them there and they would find it?
2009-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	yes, in settings
2009-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	``Cube		I have, but I never used it, Gen2ly
2009-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	alright, any other ideas and tips on how to store files the smart way on a netbook?
2009-06-12T12:09:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	I usually store the music on an external usb stick if the netbook has limited space such as eeepc 701 4G
2009-06-12T12:09:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	gotcha, though ill get the 1000he with a 160 gb hdd
2009-06-12T12:10:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	depends on the size of your library then as that is big for most netbooks
2009-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	yeah yeah. now, lets say I have my desktop, which is 1tb, and I got most of my music there, how would I let the programs know that they should look there? like, imagine this: I have a "virtual folder", which is basically a network-shared folder on my desktop. now, if im at home in my wifi range, my netbook sees it, and its there just like a normal folder. when im gone, its gone as well. would that be possible?
2009-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	same network? ie nfs sharing or something along those lines? then sure that is possible
2009-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	bazhang		!nfs | ``Cube
2009-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	kk. I just mean like if im in the network, the folder is there, and I can open it just like any other folder. but when im not in my network, its gone.
2009-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	so for traveling purpose (if you wish to conserve netbook disk space) you could also carry along a usb stick with your best tracks for example
2009-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	yeah yeah, I got that part. I just mean. if my desktop is in network range (if im in my wifi), I'd like to have a folder appear somewhere (lets say, my desktop), which I can access. if my desktop is not in range, it should be gone
2009-06-12T12:17:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	sure if you set it up correctly using nfs or the like
2009-06-12T12:17:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	alright. and its not like it's a totally extreme stunt that will require lots of tweaking?
2009-06-12T12:18:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	fairly straightforward and commonly done
2009-06-12T12:18:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	now, look at this. in my music library, lets say the one on rhythmbox, id like to appear just some songs if im on the go, but all of the music I have when im home. how does that sound
2009-06-12T12:18:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	then make some playlists
2009-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	my idea was that the library would DYNAMICALLY expand as soon as I enter my home network. get my idea?
2009-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	sure, you should play around with it, as I have nowhere near that size library :)
2009-06-12T12:22:00.000Z	``Cube	bazhang	haha okay :) and how would that vpn work?
2009-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	bazhang	``Cube	nfs share would be preferable to vpn I would surmise
