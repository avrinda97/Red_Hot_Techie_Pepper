2010-08-10T17:45:00.000Z	ZoZo-		Serious how do you get the "home screen" again? Nothing at all happens when I click the top left icon.. I even reinstalled it..
2010-08-10T17:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	I dont know off hand, whet did you do or were doing when it vanished? Which Home Screen are we talking about?
2010-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	I installed the ubuntu 10.04 netbook edition. Updated everything and restarted my computer and voila.. The home screen that started before wont come up again =(
2010-08-10T17:49:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	ok, I think that's in the sesson manager options you can select at log in, did you check that?
2010-08-10T17:50:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	I dont really know how to open that one =)
2010-08-10T17:51:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	ok, to sacarlson question are you getting no desktop at all or just not the one you had before the upgrade
2010-08-10T17:51:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	no desktop at all I'd say. I can see a desktop background, but that's where the limit is
2010-08-10T17:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	ok, so your not making it into the Gnome or KDE desktop fully then right ?
2010-08-10T17:52:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	right
2010-08-10T17:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	not good
2010-08-10T17:53:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	it's the go-home-applet that's borked =/
2010-08-10T17:53:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	even when purging go-home-applet and reinstalling it nothing happens =/
2010-08-10T17:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	can you get to a terminal at all ?
2010-08-10T17:54:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	I can yea
2010-08-10T17:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	well yo ahve three options I'd say: Reinstall the desktop, remove the desktop & reinstall or dpkg --reconfigre
2010-08-10T17:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	I'd trdpkg --reconfigure -a first
2010-08-10T17:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	command" sudo dpkg --reconfigure -a
2010-08-10T17:56:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	what if reconfigure is an unknown option? ;D
2010-08-10T17:59:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	trying to reinstall again, Ima just reinstall whole ubuntu otherwise :P
2010-08-10T17:59:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	Yes, but not really a discussion fer here.
2010-08-10T18:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	Ok, if that's what ya think is best, it's certinaly easier :-)
2010-08-10T18:00:00.000Z	ZoZo-	KE1HA	Much easier :p 4th time now ;D But.. Why is it not a discussion for here, about the underclocking thing? :p I kinda need to underclock to be able to use the laptop Im installing ubuntu on, as it will get fried if not :p
2010-08-10T18:01:00.000Z	KE1HA	ZoZo-	Yes, clocking, although I do allot of it, and enjoy it, it's somethign that a bit OT really.
