2009-11-13T06:46:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	Linux drivers are usually built into Linux it's self or compiled as a module to be loaded after booting.  Search for what model number your network device is and if Linux has drivers for it.
2009-11-13T06:48:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	How do I do any of that?
2009-11-13T06:50:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	chances are if you are having trouble with something on Linux, someone else has had that problem and has asked questions about it too.  There is still another chance that the issue has a fix
2009-11-13T06:51:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	what did that sentence have to do with anything?
2009-11-14T03:28:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	in order to get support for drivers not included in the linux source code, you will need to have a copy of the source code and the source code of the drivers.  Don't freak out, you don't need to have any programming knowledge to compile and install the linux kernel and drivers
2009-11-14T03:44:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	could you give me a walkthrough for getting the drivers and stuff?
2009-11-14T03:45:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	I'll try, but there are a lot of steps.
2009-11-14T03:45:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	I'll open a dialogue window
2009-11-14T03:48:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	you there?
2009-11-14T10:36:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	how do I check how much RAM I have?
2009-11-14T10:36:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	the system monitor will likely tell you, not sure how to get there from jaunty though
2009-11-14T10:38:00.000Z	Shu	insm0d	Memory is RAM? Because I have 2GB and it says only 994MB... and what's swap?
2009-11-14T10:42:00.000Z	insm0d	Shu	swap is part of your hard drive that linux treats as ram.  It automatically puts memory there that it doesn't need to access regularly, but is vital.
