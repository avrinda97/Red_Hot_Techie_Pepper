2008-10-29T21:30:00.000Z	lbd		hi, i've installed some packages by compiling them and not through apt-get, but now there are other packages which i'd like to install from repositories that try to install the packages i have already compiled, is there some way to avoid this?
2008-10-29T21:31:00.000Z	lbd		anyone?
2008-10-29T21:32:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	the way to avoid that is to NOT compile stuff manually (especially not in /usr, there's /usr/local for that) especially when it's already in the repositories.
2008-10-29T21:32:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	so what about you go and find the files that belong to your manually-compiled stuff, remove them, and then install things the right way?
2008-10-29T21:32:00.000Z	LjL		apache2
2008-10-29T21:33:00.000Z	LjL		!packages > lbd    (lbd, see the private message from Ubottu)
2008-10-29T21:33:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	well, no. I have installed newer versions which weren't available in the repos
2008-10-29T21:33:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	well, you're still on your own if you do that - especially if you don't install to /usr/local
2008-10-29T21:34:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	how do i do that? no problem really, i still have the compiled files (haven't done any make clean), so i only have to do make install
2008-10-29T21:34:00.000Z	lbd		or better, make unistall and then make install again
2008-10-29T21:34:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	you need to ./configure with the right PREFIX (./configure --help). with most programs, that's /usr/local by default, but.
2008-10-29T21:36:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	the problem is that in my case, I needed the bleeding edge version of JACK and there is an app called timemachine which requires jack, but I don't want to uninstall the compiled version for the old version which is in the repos, since JACK is actively developed and many things change version by version
2008-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	uhm, but Hardy comes with JACK version 0.109.2, which according to their website, is the last version
2008-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	forgot to say that i'm still using gutsy
2008-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	then request a backport
2008-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	LjL		!backports > lbd    (lbd, see the private message from Ubottu)
2008-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	anyway stuff that's in /usr/local should take precedence over stuff in /usr, so you might just install the jackd from APT
2008-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	so what you're trying to say is that although the dependencies will be satisfied, i will still be using the newer version of jack?
2008-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	yes, although i cannot really *guarantee* that, but it *should* be the case
2008-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	alright then, thanks
2008-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	you could also grab the source package (but the Ubuntu source package!) from Hardy, and backport it yourself - with most programs, that's easy
2008-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	LjL	lbd	just add the Hardy Universe component to your sources.list, "apt-get update", then "apt-get build-dep jackd" and "apt-get --build source jackd" (then remember to remove the hardy repo when you're finished)
2008-10-29T21:45:00.000Z	lbd	LjL	cheers
