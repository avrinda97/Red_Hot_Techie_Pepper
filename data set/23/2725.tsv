2008-11-30T11:26:00.000Z	cbrunner__		hey, I am trying to mount a samba share which is hosted on my ubuntu server from my mac...
2008-11-30T11:26:00.000Z	cbrunner__		and this same server config used to work completely fine, but now when I try to mount it authenticates but then mount_smbfs fails with a broken pipe
2008-11-30T11:27:00.000Z	cbrunner__		any way for me to figure out what the heck is going on?
2008-11-30T11:27:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	make sure you have smbfs installed before you try the cifs command
2008-11-30T11:29:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	it worked before so I am sure I have it installed
2008-11-30T11:29:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	it is definitely installed, newest version
2008-11-30T11:30:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	it's something along those lines, let me look at my mount script, I got tired of typing it
2008-11-30T11:31:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	sudo mount -t cifs -o user="MSHOME/user%pass" //192.168.1.100/bobo /media/bobo
2008-11-30T11:34:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	are you doing that mount command from ubuntu?
2008-11-30T11:34:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	yea
2008-11-30T11:35:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	I am trying to mount from OS X does that matter?
2008-11-30T11:36:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	is it an ubuntu share you're trying to mount?
2008-11-30T11:36:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	yes
2008-11-30T11:38:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	cbrunner$ sudo mount -t cifs -o user="ccb%mypass" smb://myip/music /Volumes/music
2008-11-30T11:38:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	every time I do that it says no file or directory /Volumes/music
2008-11-30T11:39:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	so you're running a samba share from an ubuntu box and you're trying to mount it in osx?
2008-11-30T11:40:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	yep
2008-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	did you already try this guide? http://docs.huihoo.com/darwin/opendarwin/articles/osx_smb/ar01s02.html
2008-11-30T11:42:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	yea man, this share has worked flawlessly for months and all the sudden out the blue it started doing this, I didnt even update anything
2008-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	"sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart" on the ubuntu box
2008-11-30T11:50:00.000Z	cbrunner__	endoubt	I have restarted the box and restarted samba many times, didnt work
2008-11-30T11:50:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	hmmm
2008-11-30T11:51:00.000Z	endoubt	cbrunner__	what is the error again?
