2011-06-17T07:45:00.000Z	billybigrigger	balt11t	you said eee pc yeah?
2011-06-17T07:46:00.000Z	balt11t	billybigrigger	yeah, and in 10.10, actually it worked in 11.04 too, but i had to reinstall ubuntu
2011-06-17T07:48:00.000Z	balt11t	billybigrigger	then after the reinstall it stopped
2011-06-17T07:48:00.000Z	billybigrigger	balt11t	that's weird
2011-06-17T07:48:00.000Z	balt11t	billybigrigger	any ideas then?
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	billybigrigger	balt11t	is google any help? there are quite a few eee ubuntu users out there...never heard of something like that happening on a re-format though
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	billybigrigger	balt11t	was 10.10 to 11.04 an upgrade?
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	billybigrigger		maybe there's a change in an acpi setting somewhere in 11.04 that breaks it?
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	billybigrigger		that would explain your breakage in a fresh install of 11.04
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	balt11t	billybigrigger	yeah, it was an upgrade than a reinstall. and google is no help
2011-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	billybigrigger		boooo
2011-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	billybigrigger		google is NOT your friend!

2011-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	balt11t	billybigrigger	it never worked in 11.04
