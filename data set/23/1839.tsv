2010-06-08T08:10:00.000Z	ronx		question guys.... i'm downgrading from lucid to karmic, and the most recent kernel didn't seem to want to run on reinstalled karmic... so i changed to GRUB_DEFAULT=4 (from 0) and things are working now...
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	how are you downgrading exactly?
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	ronx		however, when i apt-get upgrade, it doesn't seem to want to upgrade linux-headers-generic
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	ronx	jrib	i used 9.10 install disk
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	ronx		and some instructions i found on a blog somewhere
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	so you are doing a fresh install then?
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	ronx		not quite... i used custom partitions
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	ronx		and didn't change anything
2010-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	what partitions?

2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	ronx		that's what i used
2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	you understand downgrading is not supported?
2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	ronx		my previous setup was really simple... everything on / and then swap
2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	ronx		sure
2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	ronx		looking for "unofficial" support hehe
2010-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	ronx		not complaining at all
2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	ronx		and nothing is really broken
2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	ronx		just looking for the best way to update kernel
2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	ronx		when i apt-get upgrade, it says my linux-headers-generic are kept back
2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	ronx		because i had to modify my grub config to point to an older kernel
2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	update-manager updates the kernel automatically.  If you want to use apt-get, then you need to use "apt-get dist-upgrade"
2010-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	ronx		k so dist-upgrade won't try to take me to lucid
2010-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	ronx	no, take a look at « man apt-get »
