2008-09-21T04:01:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	it's fine now, it started with 480/340 , but i could set it to 1024 now
2008-09-21T04:03:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	yes it's possible to get higher, but it's fine, whene i'm working with many apps, i can set higher def
2008-09-21T04:03:00.000Z	raulh	el3allali	well glad it's working for you, cheers mate.
2008-09-21T04:04:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	but now i have to save the configuration genarated by nvidia utility on the xorg.con, how can it edit it using bash ?
2008-09-21T04:04:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	i'm new to linux, i still don't know lot of commands
2008-09-21T04:06:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	well, the xorg.conf still contain wrong settings, i used nvidia xserver utility to set resolution, but i have to save that on xorg.conf, this way it will start with a good resolution by default
2008-09-21T04:07:00.000Z	el3allali	raulh	nvidia xserver doesn't have permission to write on xorg.conf
