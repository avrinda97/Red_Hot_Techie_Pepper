2008-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	Taso		hey guys, how do I change my updates/installs to unstable like I would in Debian?
2008-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	Taso		I need to download bleeding egde stuff
2008-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	Taso		and gutsy is not doing it
2008-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	Taso		I need sshfs 1.9 and it's grabbing 1.7
2008-03-10T05:29:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	do you want to upgrade to hardy or just install one package?
2008-03-10T05:29:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	to upgrade to hardy, gksu "update-manager -d"
2008-03-10T05:30:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/ and download the deb you want
2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	backports has a few select packages compiled for gutsy. not all of hardy's though
2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	if it's there, you can use that. otherwise, you can download the deb from where i linked
2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	if you do that, youd upgrae to hardy.  they said i shouldnt tell you to go to hardy.
2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	i figure if you can handle Sid, you can handle Hardy just fine
2008-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	Sid is Debian Unstable's name
2008-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	no....
2008-03-10T05:35:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	Debian Unstable is called Sid.  Ubuntu's current unstable is Hardy.  You can install a package from Hardy without upgrading to it if you don't want to be running unstable (because that can involve lots of hair-pulling if you know what you're doing, and more if you don't). If you want to ride the unstable edge, you can, but it'd be easier to just install the one package.  You might be able to get the package from backports.  If you can't, you can g
2008-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	just download from there.  click on hardy, and go the section you want, and download teh deb
2008-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	yes, you can download a deb and double click it
2008-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	umm it is?
2008-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	yep, you're right. go compile it if you need that new of one
2008-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	why?
2008-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	hardy is sync'd with whatever's in the current debian unstable repos
2008-03-10T05:39:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	if debian has 1.9, just download their deb and hope it works
2008-03-10T05:41:00.000Z	macogw	Taso	and really, if you dont know how debs work or about compiling, trying to muck with versions is probably a bad idea
