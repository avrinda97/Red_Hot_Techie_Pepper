2007-04-23T07:08:00.000Z	nny		ok so rausb (the interface name for ralink wireless card) shows up in network manager, but it never connects or shows signal strength. We had to install drivers from source. there seems to be a disconnect between the two, as i can set manually using iwconfig and dhclient. Any Advice???
2007-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	nny		hmm is there an advanced discussion channel for ubuntu?

2007-04-23T07:12:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	So I'm gathering that iwconfig/dhclient works, but ifup doesn't?

2007-04-23T07:15:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	no, it worked though, got an address
2007-04-23T07:16:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	network-manager says no connection thought, even though i hav eone
2007-04-23T07:18:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	you have a doozy there... but wireless networking is still iffy sometimes.
2007-04-23T07:19:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	are both connections supposed to be on roaming?
2007-04-23T07:19:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	both?  You should have only one.
2007-04-23T07:19:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	wired vs. wireless
2007-04-23T07:19:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	oh the wired one shouldn't be roaming, i wouldn't think...
2007-04-23T07:20:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	I'm still figuring out this new network applet myself.
2007-04-23T07:24:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	probably just swap out the minipci wireless card in this laptop anyways
2007-04-23T07:24:00.000Z	nny	chernobylrpgfree	something common, like a broadcom or something
2007-04-23T07:24:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	nny	i have a broadcom - be warned, they're a bit tricky to set up too
