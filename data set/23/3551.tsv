2008-11-29T10:54:00.000Z	joshuah		k3b
2008-11-29T10:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	best bet is  gnomebaker
2008-11-29T10:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	we don't use rpm's here
2008-11-29T10:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	try the apt first
2008-11-29T10:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	you have working repos for 5.04?
2008-11-29T10:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	 I think
2008-11-29T10:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	5.04 is not supported anymore
2008-11-29T10:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	but I try anyway ;)
2008-11-29T11:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	maybe, it was supported in 5.10 as I helped someone earlier using 5.10
2008-11-29T11:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	joot : but the repos are probably gone
2008-11-29T11:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	joot : would need to search for a .deb package if that's the case
2008-11-29T11:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	that would be your login password
2008-11-29T11:05:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	apt-get
2008-11-29T11:09:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	those errors mean your repo doesn't have gnomebaker
2008-11-29T11:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	even  http://www.getdeb.net/  can't find gnomebaker :(
2008-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	as a .tar file?
2008-11-29T11:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	extract it using roller
2008-11-29T11:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	then read the README
2008-11-29T11:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	just extract all contents to a folder
2008-11-29T11:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	it may have a folder structure in it already or you can extract to a clean folder
2008-11-29T11:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	joshuah	the README should tell you the steps to install it
