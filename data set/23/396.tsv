2011-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	but were you using 11.04 when you were using Workstation 7.1.4?
2011-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	yup
2011-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	sounds like a query for the VMWare guys since thats your variable
2011-10-12T18:54:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	I got asked to post this question in OS specific channel, and now u are asking me to post back to vmware channle....lol
2011-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	hahahaha... you could try turning off Unity to see if that is it
2011-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	i am on gnome-classic
2011-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit
2011-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	see if this thread helps http://communities.vmware.com/message/70967
2011-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	okay
2011-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	this thread describe for windows as host
2011-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	im assuming you are running on an intel pc... its hardware specific not OS
2011-10-12T18:59:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	yes, it's Intel
2011-10-12T18:59:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	but how do you explain it works for 7.1.4 and not 8?
2011-10-12T19:00:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	could be a ton of reasons... but probably something to do with graphic card acceleration...
2011-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	yeah, that's what i thought too....
2011-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	no solution....sigh :D
2011-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	sorry... degrade?
2011-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	i need to use 8 features
2011-10-12T19:02:00.000Z	libScout_	sgs2_usr	well crap on a stick... i would go back to VMWare and see if others are having trouble with graphics on WS8
2011-10-12T19:03:00.000Z	sgs2_usr	libScout_	yeah, i think i will open a ticket..
