2007-11-16T19:42:00.000Z	xeer		hi everyone. my gnome panel and desktop wont load. i can't alt+F2 either. what could be wrong?
2007-11-16T19:43:00.000Z	xeer		other applications are acting weird as well, such as firefox crashing unexpectidly
2007-11-16T19:44:00.000Z	xeer		i just installed gutsy. i have to login with failsafe gnome just to pass the login screen
2007-11-16T19:45:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	You've been running this whole time in the failsafe session?
2007-11-16T19:45:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	yes
2007-11-16T19:45:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	What video card do you have? Have you attempted to install restricted drivers?
2007-11-16T19:46:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	and you've never been able to start the regular gnome session?
2007-11-16T19:48:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	Did you install xserver-xgl?
2007-11-16T19:48:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	i reinstalled it and reconfigured
2007-11-16T19:49:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	oh wait.. xgl.. not that i'm aware of. something else could have installed it
2007-11-16T19:49:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	yes it's installed
2007-11-16T19:50:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	If you create a new user, can they login sucessfully?
2007-11-16T19:50:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	i tried creating a guest account. it suffered the same issues.
2007-11-16T19:52:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	is there a way to restart the gutsy update process? it was installing the packages and froze midway. I had to resume it after i restarted, i'm sure something got screwed up
2007-11-16T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	If your sources.list contains gutsy lines, you can just do an `apt-get update` apt-get dist-upgrade`
2007-11-16T19:56:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	it says my dist-upgrade is already complete. how can i force it?
2007-11-16T19:57:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	Does it give you errors, or just says that there are 0 files to upgrade?
2007-11-16T19:57:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	says 0 files to upgrade
2007-11-16T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	Sounds to me that the upgrade is done.
2007-11-16T19:58:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	yes because i finished it after the crash. i'd like to redo it if possible
2007-11-16T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	You cant 'redo' an upgrade if its done. It just doesnt work like that.
2007-11-16T19:59:00.000Z	xeer	Pici	so if files got corrupted when it froze, i'm pretty much screwed on my dist?
2007-11-16T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	xeer	If anything didn't install or configure properly, then it would have said so and prompted you to fix it.
