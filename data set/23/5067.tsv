2009-05-13T19:21:00.000Z	john		is it possible for a computer with an ATI radeon 9200 to work  in linux anywhere near as well as in windows xp? All my flash/3D games/graphics are sloooooooow on linux :(
2009-05-13T19:23:00.000Z	john		can anyone help? I've been trying to migrate to linux for a week now
2009-05-13T19:23:00.000Z	john		the propriatary driver?
2009-05-13T19:24:00.000Z	john		i'll try it tho
2009-05-13T19:24:00.000Z	crdlb	john	don't bother
2009-05-13T19:25:00.000Z	john	crdlb	don't bother installing the driver or migrating :)
2009-05-13T19:25:00.000Z	crdlb	john	the former :)
2009-05-13T19:26:00.000Z	crdlb	john	the linux version of flash is just slow in general, and the radeon driver is not very good at 3d (though that will improve eventually ...)
2009-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	john	crdlb	right.... so this is it for my linux experience with this computer?
2009-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	crdlb	john	did you turn compiz off?
2009-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	crdlb	john	how would I know that? :)
2009-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	john	crdlb	:P
2009-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	john	crdlb	yeah compiz is off
2009-05-13T19:28:00.000Z	john	crdlb	grr ok well at least i know which graphics card to get if i upgrade ever :)
2009-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	john	crdlb	so how would i get to a place where flash videos ran at good speeds?
2009-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	john	crdlb	more ram?
2009-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	john	crdlb	more compatible graphics card?
2009-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	crdlb	john	an alternate reality where adobe made a good flash player for linux
2009-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	john	crdlb	grrrr stubid adobe. In the uk i watch tv online through flash
2009-05-13T19:33:00.000Z	john	crdlb	thanks for helping
2009-05-13T19:56:00.000Z	crdlb	john	if you really want to install the proprietary driver you would have to go back to ubuntu 6.10, which is no longer supported (or 6.06 which is only supported for another month)
2009-05-13T19:57:00.000Z	crdlb	john	no, you'd be using the same driver on all of them
