2012-08-31T03:03:00.000Z	krazyk_work		I'm setting up a ubuntu live distro on a USB and am having trouble setting up persistent properly.  Anyone able to help?
2012-08-31T03:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	if you don't want to install from the liveusb - why not do a proper install onto the USB?
2012-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	hw would I go about doing that and still having it be bootable?
2012-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	just install to the usb - that's it.
2012-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	care if i PM?
2012-08-31T03:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	i'd prefer if you didn't actually.
2012-08-31T03:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	happy to answer questions here ;)
2012-08-31T03:07:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	well I've tried to install from a live usb to another USB and I'm unsure of the partitioning I should be using.  All I know is, in the end.. when I insert USB with installed distro it boots normally instead of booting from USB
2012-08-31T03:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	you need to setup your BIOS to boot from USB first, and/or use the boot selection option in your BIOS
2012-08-31T03:09:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	i can run from a USB.  That's how I'm running the distro now, right?
2012-08-31T03:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	then i can't understand why you can't boot the other install then???
2012-08-31T03:10:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	nor can I.  I have menu.lst to have 2 options.. 1 with persistent and 1 w/o.  The 1 without boots fine, the 1 without does not
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	lol menu.lst - grub1 really?
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	the 1 WITH does not**
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	yessir :-\ *winces*
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	good luck - i don't remember anything about grub-legacy.
2012-08-31T03:13:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	but you agree that after I install directly to a USB, that USB shold be bootable without any other alterations
2012-08-31T03:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	so long as grub is installed onto that USB - yes.
2012-08-31T03:14:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	any suggestions for tools to reinstall grub to USB after the distro is installed?  I think during install it is wiping and repartitioning
2012-08-31T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	for grub-legacy, no idea.
2012-08-31T03:15:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	i dont need grub legacy.. i can use any
2012-08-31T03:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	krazyk_work	for grub2 just chroot into the USB and re-install grub...
2012-08-31T03:16:00.000Z	krazyk_work	zykotick9	ugh.. ok ok thank you
