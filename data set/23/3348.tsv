2008-05-08T16:01:00.000Z	intercom		Can anyone help me mount up my Windows xp NTFS partition? Read-only will be enough
2008-05-08T16:03:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	at boot every time or once only?
2008-05-08T16:03:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	once will do, just so that i can make backups
2008-05-08T16:04:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	you need to know it's place in /dev and make a folder for it in /media
2008-05-08T16:05:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	ok made a folder for it now, but how do i find the place in /dev/ ?  fdisk -l ?
2008-05-08T16:05:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	sudo fdisk -l   to find the place - /dev/sdb1 for e.g. - an d sudo mkdir/ntfs   to make a folder
2008-05-08T16:06:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	ok, seems like its /dev/sda1
2008-05-08T16:06:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /media/foldername
2008-05-08T16:08:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	I get this error: Unexpected clusters per mft record (-1).
2008-05-08T16:09:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	that's a new one for me - I don't know what that means at all - sorry
2008-05-08T16:11:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	try sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/foldername
2008-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	still get the same thing. I have the same problem as this guy: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=596911  Too bad hes gotten no replies:/  I need to get in dos command mode so that i can type FIXMBR, but i cant get there with the winXP cd ive got
2008-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	why does your windows cd not do fixmbr?
2008-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	cause i cant get into recovery mode
2008-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	yeh ok - that happens
2008-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	im trying to find like a small image just containing the recoverymode part
2008-05-08T16:23:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	I don't know what else you did bit it sounds like your filetable for windows might be shot - I'm no expert tho
2008-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	and if thats shot then im screwed right? all data lost? :/
2008-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	I'm no windows expert at all - there may be a solution :)
2008-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	what happend to get you to this stage?
2008-05-08T16:26:00.000Z	intercom	ere4si	I installed ubuntu. Thats all.
2008-05-08T16:27:00.000Z	ere4si	intercom	SoupDragon  suggested testdisk as a solution - worth a shot
