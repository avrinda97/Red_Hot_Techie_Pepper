2008-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		live cd works i am in that currently
2008-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		but from hdd boot it goes directly to busy box
2008-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		I was reading few forums seems that it might be hdd issue becuase my laptop have built in raid on bios
2008-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	Ali_ix	mib_po8yin	ok, so you need to search based on your hardware, this is an installation issue (derivers, setup, ...)
2008-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		but no one never posted a solution.
2008-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	Ali_ix	mib_po8yin	are you sure about raid? on laptop? never seen that!
2008-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		yeah my toshiba have raid in bios
2008-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	Ali_ix	mib_po8yin	if it is really raid, you must have installed some derivers for it in windows too, did you?
2008-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		well it came with windows xp pre installed
2008-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		this is the first time i am installing anything new.
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	Ali_ix	mib_po8yin	sorry, no idea, i have had servers with raid, and they were working just out of box
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		i want the boot to see my hdd
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	mib_po8yin		its not finding it at all.
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	Ali_ix	mib_po8yin	it may be complicated, you may need a raid driver, post in forums, may be some one else done it
