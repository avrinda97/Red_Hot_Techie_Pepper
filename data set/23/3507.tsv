2008-04-01T00:04:00.000Z	gangz		All, one question regarding soundcards. I am running an ubuntu on vmware (that shouldn't matter I guess). I have a conexant soundcard and it is not recognized by the system. I wanted to check if it is just ubuntu that has this problem, or if other distro's also have a similar problem.
2008-04-01T00:05:00.000Z	gangz		i am running 2.6.20.16, ubuntu feisty; and the lspci doesn't show the soundcard ( i guess it is not even recognized)
2008-04-01T00:05:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	your ubuntu is in the vmware?
2008-04-01T00:06:00.000Z	gangz		yes, I have installed it over vmware. ubuntu is my guest-os
2008-04-01T00:06:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	then it matters a lot, hardware detection in your guest os doesnt matter at all. ITs all about your host
2008-04-01T00:07:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	agreed; but i did search for the conexant soundcards and looks like it is not a supported hardware
2008-04-01T00:07:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	let me have a look
2008-04-01T00:08:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	whats the exact name?
2008-04-01T00:08:00.000Z	gangz		also, vmware allows the guest OS to have access to the hardware, albeit via its own drivers, but nevertheless it is possible; else the scsi disk on my machine wouldn't have been detected
2008-04-01T00:08:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	exact name for what ?
2008-04-01T00:08:00.000Z	gangz		the soundcard ?
2008-04-01T00:09:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	vmware is fully dependant on the host OS drivers, hardware access doesnt mean it can its own drivers. The full sound card name
2008-04-01T00:11:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	from the windows device manager i see it as conexant high definition smart audio
2008-04-01T00:11:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	if thats true then it is supported by the default driver
2008-04-01T00:12:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	is there anyway i can check if there are some modules missing or something
2008-04-01T00:12:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	why dont you just put in the livecd and see for yourself?
2008-04-01T00:12:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	see whether the sound is detected ? Is that what you mean ?
2008-04-01T00:12:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	yup
2008-04-01T00:13:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	ok I can check that
2008-04-01T00:13:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	thanks for your help
2008-04-01T00:14:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	which of course will mean i will need to reboot the machine (the host OS too). Will check that and join the channel later if it doesn't work.
2008-04-01T00:14:00.000Z	Svenstaro	gangz	aye, good luck
2008-04-01T00:15:00.000Z	gangz	Svenstaro	thank you and bye
