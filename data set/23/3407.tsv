2008-05-06T02:29:00.000Z	greyspace		Question: I want to learn commands that configure my perfectly set up wireless and install aircrack; however, I am sure to destroy everything, what are all the files that I have to back up? Encase I have to ReConfigure my wireless back to the current configuration.
2008-05-06T02:30:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	network manager relies on there being no settings. /etc/network/interfaces to control the configurations. iwlist, iwconfig, ifconfig, dhclient good to know commands.
2008-05-06T02:31:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	as well as ifup and ifdown
2008-05-06T02:33:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Thanks, so your saying that there isn't a backup and Restore on Ubuntu 804?
2008-05-06T02:33:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	backup and restore is remove everything it is the default
2008-05-06T02:33:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	you have yet to make configurations for your interfaces right?
2008-05-06T02:34:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	 right
2008-05-06T02:35:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	 I have everything working perfect... Cable, and Intel internal and two CardBuss Dlink cards
2008-05-06T02:37:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	However, I am going to mess up stuff while learning... and am wondering what files are controlling the Network Manager... Trust me I have all ready done three reinstalls
2008-05-06T02:37:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	have you done anything yet with dns or iptables?
2008-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	you might be interested in firestarter and dnsmasq
2008-05-06T02:40:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	All that stuff is what I am trying to learn.. so I copied it to my note pad to research before I get started.
2008-05-06T02:41:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	I made a forum post about getting the most surfing speed out of dialup if your interested
2008-05-06T02:42:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Thank you very very much,,, and yes I am
2008-05-06T02:43:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=781964 a few of those tips might make things easier on you
2008-05-06T02:48:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Thank you for all your information, because I had so much installed and configured and lshw would show the interfaces yet I couldn't get Network Manager to connect or find my wireless cards... so I reinstalled many times and lost all my programs and configurations.
2008-05-06T02:49:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	no problem man tell you the truth this my first time using network manager I never used it before it was introduced in like feisty/gutsy version I think
2008-05-06T02:50:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Thats ok I am a MS-Doze expert and it is paying off when using Ubunttttu
2008-05-06T02:51:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	nice to see a fellow cli junkie ;)
2008-05-06T02:52:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Yep I even remember "set dircmd=0 to hide your dos directory and reboot to see your files or set dircmd=1"
2008-05-06T02:54:00.000Z	greyspace	h4mx0r	Thank you, I am going now... to do some research.
2008-05-06T02:54:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	uhh okay..
2008-05-06T02:54:00.000Z	h4mx0r	greyspace	if you want that sort of stuff might want to check into wine
