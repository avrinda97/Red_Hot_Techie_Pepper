2005-12-18T14:54:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		what does middle-clicking on a page in firefox do?
2005-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	depends on the context i believe
2005-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	should be simpole enough to find out though :)
2005-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	when i do it it loads some random page
2005-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	so i want to know what's making it load that page
2005-12-18T14:56:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	look at 'middlemouse.contentLoadURL' in about:config... I think it pastes a url and goes to it by default
2005-12-18T14:56:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	but i havent copied any URLs; it went to some site with tech support jokes
2005-12-18T14:57:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	copy a url and click on the tab, see if it goes to the url you copied
2005-12-18T14:57:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	it doesnt do anything
2005-12-18T14:58:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	click on the actual tab handle up top
2005-12-18T14:58:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	but that wasn't what i was clicking on before. and it also does nothing.
2005-12-18T14:58:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	don;t know then, haven't experienced that
2005-12-18T15:00:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	change that setting and see if it goes away if you wish, middlemouse.contentLoadURL FALSE
2005-12-18T15:00:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	nah i dont really care i was just curious why it was doing that
2006-01-12T09:15:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	does it happen with regular mplayer?
2006-01-12T09:15:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	hold on, i'll check
2006-01-12T09:18:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	no, it doesn't happen in regular mplayer
2006-01-12T09:19:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	if you run firefox from a terminal, do you get any error output to the terminal when you view the video?
2006-01-12T09:24:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	uh, hold on will try that
2006-01-12T09:28:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	i did it and it gave me something about href=null or something but i don't think it's an error message
2006-01-12T09:29:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	not sure then... make sure the options in /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf are the same as in /etc/mplayerplug-in.conf
2006-03-29T12:16:00.000Z	_jason	purplefeltangel	by ``my'' you mean your normal user?
2006-03-29T12:16:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	_jason	i guess
