2008-04-27T14:07:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	incorrect spelling too- it's with an 'a'

2008-04-27T14:08:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	do you speak English? because I'm having difficulty understanding you
2008-04-27T14:09:00.000Z	graingert	CaptainMorgan	no it's an early morining
2008-04-27T14:09:00.000Z	graingert	CaptainMorgan	kde or gnome
2008-04-27T14:09:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	gnome :)
2008-04-27T14:10:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	I got wmv's showing their thumbnails but I can't get mpg's to do the same
2008-04-27T14:12:00.000Z	graingert	CaptainMorgan	remember in gutsy you could change the app that made the preview
2008-04-27T14:12:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	change the app ? I never had to do that... I would've remembered having to do so... :(
2008-04-27T14:12:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	 at least in my gutsy version it was fine- never an issue
2008-04-27T14:13:00.000Z	graingert	CaptainMorgan	no not change it, set it in the first place set it
2008-04-27T14:13:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	sorry.. I'm not understanding you.....
2008-04-27T14:14:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	I never had to set it either....
2008-04-27T14:15:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	in Gutsy, all I had to do was install the respective codecs... which I did for Hardy
2008-04-27T14:15:00.000Z	graingert	CaptainMorgan	heron and giibbon are differnt animals, so to speak
2008-04-27T14:16:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	understood... can you explain how I enable this thumbnail preview for hardy?
2008-04-27T14:17:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	this is a major problem for me, working with video- highly inefficient.... :(
2008-04-27T14:17:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	unless I convert the mass media I have now to .wmv.... which is unrealistic
2008-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	conversion is general- my point, is unrealistic
2008-04-27T14:19:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	graingert	sad to say it... but this should be a default if one or two or three formats are previewing and another one isn't.... :( we dont' have to have all of them previewing- but the majority of *major/popular* ones would be nice
