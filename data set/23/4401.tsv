2007-08-23T15:44:00.000Z	riniver		Jordan-U: Thanks. apache2 is in the list but i still don't know how to stop/restart it
2007-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	riniver		What's a nice FTP/SSH client for Ubuntu?
2007-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	riniver		gFTP looks horrible
2007-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	riniver		on ubuntu
2007-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	riniver		i meant a GUI version so i can drag/drop folders into there
2007-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	nautilus does ftp/ssh (file -> connect to server)
2007-08-23T05:06:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	wow nautilis is great! thanks
2007-08-24T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	it will only run when you login with that user
2007-08-24T05:15:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	Is there a way to get numlock turned on by default?
2007-08-24T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	google for "numlock ubuntu", first hit looks promising
2007-08-24T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	are you using metacity as your window manager (not compiz)?
2007-08-24T05:26:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	How do i tell?
2007-08-24T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	did you install compiz?
2007-08-24T05:26:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	No.
2007-08-24T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	by "doesn't work" do you mean it doesn't let you change things or you change them and then you press the shortcut but it does nothing?
2007-08-24T05:28:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	I  was trying to set lock screen to win+L. As soon as i hit the win key it sets to that key. It won't let me set win+L
2007-08-24T05:34:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	Where it says /apps/metacity is that /usr/lib64/metacity? I just have a single file with a weird icon in there. I don't have a /apps directory
2007-08-24T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	in "gconf-editor"
2007-08-24T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	just type 'gconf-editor' in a terminal
2007-08-24T05:48:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	the lock screen one doesn't appear anywhere in metacity folders. I set it to Super R so i could find it in the lost but none had naything like that
2007-08-24T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	then make a new command (someone was looking for it the other day as well and we couldn't find it) that does 'gnome-screensaver-command --lock'
2007-08-24T05:49:00.000Z	riniver	jrib	Any specific folder? Is this the equivalent of the Windows registry?
2007-08-24T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	riniver	some dir under /apps/metacity lets you setup custom commands and then you can bind run_command_1 in keybindings.  Yes and no
