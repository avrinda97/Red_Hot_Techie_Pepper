2011-06-20T17:55:00.000Z	dr_willis		david__,  i see the same issue here.. got Kubuntu+ Ubuntu + lubuntu installed.. first time ive tried unity since installig kde... panels are not loading
2011-06-20T17:55:00.000Z	dr_willis		david__,  unity --replace   made it come up however..
2011-06-20T17:56:00.000Z	dr_willis		david__,  luckly i had a icon on the desktop to launch a terminal.. alt-f2 was not working either
2011-06-20T17:56:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	ctrl+alt+f2 is always there...
2011-06-20T22:30:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	I don't care about speed. I care about my data and the time needed to restore if it goes tits up. so I rather use a PE or live cd to mangle it than run from the partition I am mangling
2011-06-25T22:53:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	business ones usually do
2011-06-25T22:53:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	it doesn't but uses the same composition api
2011-06-25T23:04:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	but how to do that on the live cd?
2011-07-23T15:24:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	yep
2011-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	optimus
2011-07-23T22:56:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	hacking and helping to is against freenode policies
2011-08-02T09:39:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	a 2007 yahoo client. very doubtful if it even works with yahoo.com
2011-08-02T09:51:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	easy: "Hera is mean to me!" :)
2011-08-06T17:26:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	it's more likely he means another "ultimate"
2011-08-06T17:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	wols_	 yep. but i pretty sure its not  on topic for here. :) but guess we will find out.
2011-08-06T17:29:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	there are tons of those drivers. often only work on specific linux kernels. but most time don't work at all
2012-01-04T23:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	wols_	 you can do that now with 11.10+ images
2012-01-04T23:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	wols_	 so ive totally missed what Y-DNA  issue is..
2012-10-16T20:10:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	mail is under /var and those are certainly user owned

2012-11-04T22:05:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	asus makes eeepcs and acer makes aspire netbooks :P
2012-11-04T22:07:00.000Z	wols_	dr_willis	he wants to boot from an existing usb stick
2012-11-04T22:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	wols_	also doable. ;-)
