2012-04-15T07:27:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Hello!
2012-04-15T07:28:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		I have great talent in screwing my computer up... Long story short I need to save some files from my encrypted home folder via a live CD, anyone got ideas on how to do this?
2012-04-15T07:29:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Tried a few things from googling the matter but nothing has worked so far
2012-04-15T07:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Ubuntu live cd:p
2012-04-15T07:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Could someone that knows what to do please help, it's vital:)
2012-04-15T07:31:00.000Z	lusers	sirriffsalot	Start off by installing lvm2 and cryptsetup...
2012-04-15T07:31:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	on a live cd?
2012-04-15T07:32:00.000Z	lusers	sirriffsalot	If you're talking about full system encryption, then yes, that's lvm2 and cryptsetup on livecd (since they don't come with live cd) -- but if you're talking about home encryption onlyâ€¦ That might be different thing.
2012-04-15T07:32:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	I want to save/copy some files from my encrypted home folder to a usb drive before I reinstall ubuntu:)
2012-04-15T07:33:00.000Z	lusers	sirriffsalot	How did you install encryption on home folder? Just a checkbox (on Ubuntu)?
2012-04-15T07:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	I did it through ubuntu installation cd
2012-04-15T07:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	I can't access ubuntu because I unabled a nvidia graphics driver card without enabling another so...
2012-04-15T07:34:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	been trying to be able to login again but it just goes to power save so I figured I might as well reinstall
2012-04-15T07:34:00.000Z	lusers	sirriffsalot	Just home only? Not the whole system?

2012-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	want me to try doing that?
2012-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	lusers	sirriffsalot	Sure. I'm going away now. Word of disclaimer. I never used that stuff.
2012-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	lusers	ok..:) Cheers
