2008-04-23T01:14:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	yes yes i know of pretty much all media players available. ATM  im not asking about players. can you recomend any plugins or whatever that YOU KNOW has speed/pitch changes?
2008-04-25T01:04:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	in 7.04, you needed to install the compiz extensions from add/remove software
2008-05-08T22:55:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 did you have firefox or epiphany running?
2008-05-08T22:55:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	I don't recall- although I'll keep a mental log of what's running the next time it happens
2008-05-08T23:19:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	are you registered on freenode?
2008-05-08T23:19:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 yes i am, i just replied to you. i might have not identified, let me do that real quick
2008-05-09T00:11:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 also   ls -al /dev/disk/
2008-05-09T03:05:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	you have a perplexing problem. lol
2008-05-09T03:20:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	I was going to say...
2008-05-09T23:26:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	I can't figure out how to capture playing audio either- I only have an option to record from a microphone input. =(
2008-05-09T23:37:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	have you tried other sound-recording programs?
2008-05-09T23:38:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 There are others?!?! :O :O :O  /sarcasm :P
2008-05-09T23:39:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	here's the thing. I know in Windows in order to "record what you hear", the sound card had to support a sort of "loopback interface".
2008-05-09T23:39:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 Yeah, I ONLY have audor, audacity , gtk record my desktop ,  and sound recorder  -  *wink*
2008-05-09T23:39:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 i know how to record sound in windows but im on linux
2008-05-09T23:41:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	right. I don't know how Linux/Ubuntu handles audio. If it passes it to the hardware, the card might need a loopback. If it's handled by the OS, then there may be an option to loop it to an "input".
2008-05-09T23:42:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 I apreciate the sentiment - though  i dont care either way ;p i just want it to work without having to get a degree in Multimedia LOL!
2008-05-10T03:26:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	are you there?
2008-05-10T03:42:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	did you get your drive auto-mount issue fixed? Someone was was in here earlier asking how to accomplish the same thing.
2008-05-10T03:43:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 I gave up and just  reformated to  ext3, sadly, and then it worked without me doing anything *shrug*
2008-05-10T03:43:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	well that's one way to solve it.. >.>
2008-05-10T03:44:00.000Z	Mimi	Fishscene	 sure puts that guy to shame, the one who told me i needed a shorter usb cable lol wtf!
2008-05-10T03:45:00.000Z	Fishscene	Mimi	I guess I missed that part. Although for some drives, that advice could very well have solved it.
