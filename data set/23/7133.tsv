2008-04-15T01:36:00.000Z	Distraught		nothing worked
2008-04-15T01:37:00.000Z	Distraught		i have an 80 GB HDD and i was installing ubuntu. I was in a hurry so i chose automated install
2008-04-15T01:37:00.000Z	Distraught		..
2008-04-15T01:37:00.000Z	Distraught		my seconf partition was lost
2008-04-15T01:37:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	was lost, how ?
2008-04-15T01:40:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	the ubuntu install does not delete partitions unless you tell him to do so :)
2008-04-15T01:40:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	you are refering to 2 partitions on a single disk, or 2 disks ?
2008-04-15T01:41:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	if you dont care about yourt data you just need to create the second partition
2008-04-15T01:41:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	sudo fdisk -l
2008-04-15T01:42:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	sudo fdisk -l
2008-04-15T01:43:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	grrr, do it and pastebin it
2008-04-15T01:44:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	the linux kernel is identifying that disk with a 40 GB capacity
2008-04-15T01:46:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	have you checked your bios options for the disk config ? I remember that were some options that could affect the disk size detection, on older bios
2008-04-15T01:47:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	well, does it report the disk size at boot ?
2008-04-15T01:47:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	I am not aware of any x86 PC from this century without some kind of BIOS config :P
2008-04-15T01:48:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	btw, you mentioned you did a Ubuntu install, so why the only listed partition is NTFS ?
2008-04-15T01:50:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	your issue is not Ubuntu related, since you have windows installed you can also check from it that your disk size is 40 GB, if you do have a physical 80GB disk you probably have a misconfiguration at the BIOS level
2008-04-15T01:52:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	eventually yes
2008-04-15T01:54:00.000Z	Lamego	Distraught	you will need to recreate your partitions
