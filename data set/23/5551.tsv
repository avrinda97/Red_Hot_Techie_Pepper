2006-11-06T16:11:00.000Z	DrNick_		250Gb HDD's are fairly cheap now.  I got one a couple of months back for around 50 quid, including VAT and delivery
2006-11-06T16:11:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	That's what I was just reading.
2006-11-06T16:11:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	I saw one for 59 dollars.
2006-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	yeah, thats very good. around the same price here I think roughly if i've converted to 's correctly
2006-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	Oh man, I never knew it would be that awesome.
2006-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	this particular one I bought was a Seagate as well so a very good drive :)
2006-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	I saw one of those on Tiger.com?
2006-11-06T16:13:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	if its a PC hardware store its bound to have Seagate drives they're very popular, and in my opinion the best hard drives.
2006-11-06T16:14:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	it will mean setting things up agian, but you can with LVM.
2006-11-06T16:15:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	You mean reinstalling everything?
2006-11-06T16:15:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	afraid so yeah.
2006-11-06T16:15:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	Now that's something I don't think I can do again.
2006-11-06T16:15:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	It took pretty much all of yesterday to get winxp and ubuntu installed.
2006-11-06T16:16:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	ah well, whats a day when it all works nicely in the end :p
2006-11-06T16:18:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	I'm teaching myself how to break and repair things. LOL
2006-11-06T16:18:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	yep.  well, with a new CD-ROM being all of about 5 quid though.....
2006-11-06T16:18:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	Well right now even that's too much.
2006-11-06T16:18:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	ah ok - student 'eh?  :p
2006-11-06T16:19:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	Student to the world of computers, yes. LOL
2006-11-06T16:19:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	cool.  well yeah you should be able to use the other CD-ROM drive fine
2006-11-06T16:21:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	should just be able to plug it in replacing the old one.  check the jumper on the old drive though to see if its set as master, slave or cable select.  set the "new" drive to the same as the old one and you should be fine
2006-11-06T16:22:00.000Z	DrNick_	avagant	I'm assuming you're using IDE/ATA drives, not SCSI
2006-11-06T16:22:00.000Z	avagant	DrNick_	You re correct.
