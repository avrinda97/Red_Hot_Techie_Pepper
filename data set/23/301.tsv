2012-03-22T15:56:00.000Z	shwaiil		Q: How to create ALIAS in ubuntu ? I go to "home" but can't find .profile so, the tutorials wont work
2012-03-22T15:56:00.000Z	shwaiil		Any tip ?
2012-03-22T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 .bashrc or .bash_profile can be used.
2012-03-22T15:56:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	tks i'll try :9
2012-03-22T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	I think the use of .profile may be a bit outdated.
2012-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	touch .bashrc in /home ?
2012-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 it should allready be there
2012-03-22T15:59:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	its not there :T
2012-03-22T15:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 you got somthing goofy going on then. ever user should have one by default i belive.
2012-03-22T15:59:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	I'm on a VPS
2012-03-22T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 you are on your own then. sounds like they are doing weird stuff.
2012-03-22T16:00:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	found it in root
2012-03-22T16:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 if you are logging in diretly as root.. that would make sence.. but thats a scary vps that forces you to use root all the time.
2012-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	after trying to put a "alias foo='ls -a" in .bashrc, it doesnt work. Any other tips ?
2012-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 you do realize that will only affect new shells.. or you have to 'source .bashrc' after the change?
2012-03-22T16:17:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	ahh thanks :D
2012-03-22T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 makes sence dont it. :)
2012-03-22T16:18:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	makes sence. works now!
2012-03-22T16:19:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	what's the meaning of "source" command ?
2012-03-22T16:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 'run this script in the terminal' shortcut for source command is '.'  ie:    . .bashrc     (often seen in scripts)
2012-03-22T16:22:00.000Z	shwaiil	Dr_willis	I see :) But "." as other meanings right ? I remember using it as current dir when pushing in git, like "git add ."
2012-03-22T16:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	shwaiil	 things always have different meanings on how they are used.
