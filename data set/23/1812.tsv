2009-10-31T02:23:00.000Z	dan___		CAN SOMEONE TEST THIS: Does it search for driver everytime you go from no effects to normal/advanced...
2009-10-31T02:24:00.000Z	dan___		sorry. the pm rule is kind of dumb.
2009-10-31T02:24:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	it does for me too, it's just seeing if the driver is installed activated
2009-10-31T02:24:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	now when you click cancel, do it again, does it search for driver
2009-10-31T02:25:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	yeah, seems to
2009-10-31T02:25:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	so it doesn't search for driver anymore?
2009-10-31T02:26:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	I meant if I cancel, it searches when I try again?
2009-10-31T02:26:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	yes
2009-10-31T02:26:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	click cancel on search and try again
2009-10-31T02:27:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	It's stopped trying to search for the driver, it now works automatically, maybe it's every time that X is restarted or something?
2009-10-31T02:28:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	I logged out and logged back in. Do you think it is *really* using driver since you canceled search?
2009-10-31T02:28:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	log out and log in restarts X, still doesn't search
2009-10-31T02:28:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	well I know that my video driver is installed and in use anyway, so it should work either way for me
2009-10-31T02:29:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	ok so now you have same bug I do
2009-10-31T02:30:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	we need to find a way to make it search again
2009-10-31T02:30:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	I seem not to have an X log
2009-10-31T02:30:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	that's peculiar
2009-10-31T02:31:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	nevermind, i had quotes arund command
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	using the same driver as me
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	can you use compiz now?
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	dan___	yeah, it's working
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	hmmmmm
2009-10-31T02:33:00.000Z	dan___	dAlfa89_	it is searching for driver again lol
