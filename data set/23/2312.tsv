2009-09-11T19:47:00.000Z	thevdi		Hi. I'm trying to launch Virtualbox (headless) from a script at logon (via /etc/init.d/rc.local). If I "run" /etc/init.d/rc.local, it starts Virtualbox but if I reboot, it doesn't. Anyone suggest what might be wrong?
2009-09-11T19:48:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	did you supply the full path to virtualbox in rc.local?
2009-09-11T19:49:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	no. I can see why that is important ;-)
2009-09-11T19:52:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	which is best to use for startup? Or doesn't it matter ?
2009-09-11T19:52:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	you'll want to use /etc/rc.local
2009-09-11T19:53:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	ok, thanks. I'll try it with the full path, too. Thanks all
2009-09-11T20:01:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	are you still here?
2009-09-11T20:01:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	yep
2009-09-11T20:03:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	I added '/usr/bin/VBoxHeadless -startvm "3b86e497-24fd-4a81-ae5b-4d0a0abd476d"' to my /etc/rc.local and it starts if I "execute" /etc/rc.local but it doesn't start after a reboot. Could you say what is wrong, please?
2009-09-11T20:04:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	could you pastebin the whole /etc/rc.local?
2009-09-11T20:05:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	http://pastebin.com/m1fd2a887
2009-09-11T20:06:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	and the execute permission bit is set for etc/rc.local?
2009-09-11T20:06:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	I was running this command inside another script but I thought I'd 'cut out the middleman'. Also, does it need a "nohup" ?
2009-09-11T20:06:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	you'll have to check the documentation for the preferred means of headless invocation.
2009-09-11T20:06:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	flags are: -rwxr-xr-x
2009-09-11T20:09:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	you might try redirecting stdout and stderr to /dev/null.
2009-09-11T20:09:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	how do I do that? Also, should I have a message in the log as to why it isn't starting?
2009-09-11T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	try sticking a "&> /dev/null" at the end.
2009-09-11T20:12:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	ok thanks. I believe this script is run as root so the permissions are OK, yes? I just find it odd that I can run it via sudo without problems but it never runs at boot up.
2009-09-11T20:12:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	permissions are fine, yes.
2009-09-11T20:13:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	is there any way of starting that 'runlevel' without rebooting each time ?
2009-09-11T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	thevdi	man telinit.
2009-09-11T20:14:00.000Z	thevdi	sipior	ok, thanks
