2006-08-20T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	er, no 's'
2007-05-26T12:30:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	how have you been sir .. i havent been in here in a long time .. been busy
2007-05-26T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	Howdy.  Everyones busy ;)
2008-05-26T05:35:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	for the most part, yeah.  If you have removed your ubuntu-desktop package, it may try and remove some stuff, just keep an eye out for anything that doesn't look like a library.  But its usually good about it
2008-05-26T05:37:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	ooh these are all libs :\ i am just trying to make room here i have the 8g eee and i keep getting disk full errors, so i am trying to clean up
2008-05-26T05:38:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	i can show you the list, but i dont know if that would help, since you dont know what i all have here
2008-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	If they're not programs, then yeah, it won't list anything that has something that depends on it
2008-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	ahh ok
2008-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	also, you might be interested in apt-get clean (or autoclean)
2008-05-26T05:41:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	thanks, i am not used to apt and its tools this is my 1st box with it on in years, so i have to jog my memory
2008-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	and thanks again, anything else that i might like that you can suggest as in command line tools for apt. i just learned of apt-file :P
2008-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	Flannel	richiefrich	apt-get, apt-cache.  Those are the important ones.  apt-cdrom if you're adding a local repository from a CD
2008-05-26T05:43:00.000Z	richiefrich	Flannel	awesome thanks again
