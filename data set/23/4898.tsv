2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	draeath		Hey, I'm happy with my Pentium D 805. only $95
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	draeath		OC to 4ghz! Hoah!
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	draeath		nothing like 2 4ghz cores with 1mb cache each
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	draeath		throw in the dual-channel DRAM...
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	draeath		partay time!
2007-04-16T10:58:00.000Z	draeath		ah
2007-04-16T10:58:00.000Z	wj32	draeath	are there cpus with 4 or 8mb caches?
2007-04-16T10:58:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	yes but after 1mb you start to loose preformance
2007-04-16T10:59:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	the internal addresses get larger etc
2007-04-16T10:59:00.000Z	wj32	draeath	why is that
2007-04-16T10:59:00.000Z	wj32	draeath	but not much. from 2bits to 4bits yes. but the cpus native bit-width is 32 or 64-bits
2007-04-16T10:59:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	seek-time on the transistors gets longer (takes longer to flash through 7mb to than 900k
2007-04-16T11:00:00.000Z	wj32	draeath	thats hardware stuff, i know next to nothing about hardware
2007-04-16T11:00:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	thats on the bus, though. L2 is a bit diff
2007-04-16T11:01:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	just stick to 1mb per core, with todays high cache-accuracy you dont really need more
2007-04-16T11:01:00.000Z	wj32	draeath	i have an intel p4 2.44ghz. so sad.
2007-04-16T11:01:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	bogomips        : 5318.71    per core :P
2007-04-16T11:13:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	reiserfs FTW
2007-04-16T11:14:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	dont buy ATI
2007-04-16T11:14:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	LP
2007-04-16T11:14:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	intel if you enjoy rights, nvidia if you enjoy FPS and features
2007-04-16T11:15:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	hope you have a UPS
2007-04-16T11:15:00.000Z	draeath	wj32	XFS can die nasty on a sudden unclean dismount
