2007-10-09T10:13:00.000Z	WGGMk		does anyone know what the correct path to "smbuser" should be??
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	what is smbuser?
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	samba doesn't use smbuser file
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	how doesnt it?
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	this tutorial says to add Unix user's to the smbuser file
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	because it uses /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb for passwords
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	don't add users manually
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	just type 'sudo smbpasswd -a username'
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	the appropriate files will be created for you
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	your tutorial is outdated
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	did you try without -L
2007-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	yes, same feedback
2007-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	then use sudo pdbedit -a username
2007-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	if that fails, your smb.conf file needs fixing
2007-10-09T10:28:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	thanks.. but im an idiot.. i forgot last night i removed the user
2007-10-09T12:01:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	run: sudo smbd -F
2007-10-09T12:01:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	and see whats the error
2007-10-09T12:01:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	i dont think its an 'error'.. the configuration is not set to what i want to happen.. if that makes sence
2007-10-09T12:02:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	can you explain further?
2007-10-09T12:03:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	I see my work group called "TEST" and i see my server inside the work group, also called "TEST" but it doesnt prompt me to login, nor does it have any action once i double click on the server (from within the workgroup folder)
2007-10-09T12:04:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	you have to pastebin your smb.conf file, though i believe the right place for this is #samba
2007-10-09T12:05:00.000Z	WGGMk	heguru	you dont have to troubleshoot.. should i scoot on over to samba?
2007-10-09T12:05:00.000Z	heguru	WGGMk	that would be a good idea
