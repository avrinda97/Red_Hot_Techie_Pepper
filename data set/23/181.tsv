2012-04-24T23:56:00.000Z	narsil4		Doesn't ubuntu install grub when I elect to use my whole disk?
2012-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	narsil4		What are the possible reasons for an unbootable hard disk after 11.10 install? This has happened twice.
2012-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	multiple hard drives and a grub in the wrong mbr is one.
2012-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	well I have just one HD.
2012-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	you could run the bootscript and post it in a pastebin if you like.
2012-04-25T00:02:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	that seems to need a working ubuntu install? I don't have one.
2012-04-25T00:02:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	no a live cd is what you would use.
2012-04-25T00:02:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	the install CD isn't the live CD?
2012-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	there is a live cd and a alternative cd both install one runs live.
2012-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	can I run bootscript using the regular install CD?
2012-04-25T00:04:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	you can run it from a live ubuntu cd it is a install cd as well.
2012-04-25T00:07:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	I'm asking if I can run the boot info script from ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso -- I can't make another CD because I blew away Windows from the machine that had the burner.
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	if it is the live cd yes.
2012-04-25T00:19:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	Is ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso the live cd? I don't understand the difference between that install cd and the live cd, if any.
2012-04-25T00:20:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	if you decide to run the scrip[t the file name has changed you would download it put it on your desktop and run this command.  sudo bash ~/Desktop/bootinfoscript
2012-04-25T00:21:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	after extracting to the desktop that is.
2012-04-25T00:43:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	copy and paste the whole script to a pastebin.
2012-04-25T00:45:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	then give us the url of that paste
2012-04-25T00:51:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	I suspect you had gpt partitioning setup originally it is mentioned in the script, otherwise it looks good, use this script and post on the ubuntu forums while you wait here for help as well. I'm not sure on cleaning out any gpt remanents if that is what is needed.
2012-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	narsil4	Fyodorovna	thanks for info. what do you mean "had gpt partitioning setup originally"? I had selected the "use whole hard drive" option, does that match what it says?
2012-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	gpt is a type of partitioning. It looks like from the script that part of it remains, the ubuntu forums and some on here will know the drill to remove this data. I think this is the problem I'm just not familiar with gpt and how to wipe it.
2012-04-25T00:57:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	narsil4	here is a wiki on gpt. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table
