2005-09-07T12:18:00.000Z	tritium	puff	try apt-cache search thinkpad.  There may be some packages
2005-09-07T12:22:00.000Z	puff	tritium	Only a few packages showed up with thinkpad as a keyword.
2005-09-07T12:22:00.000Z	tritium	puff	okay, just a suggestion
2005-09-07T12:23:00.000Z	puff	tritium	Cool.  I don't really mind "did you check to see if it's plugged in" type suggestions, I've made mistakes like that in the past :-).

2005-10-01T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	puff	configure it in /etc/network/interfaces
2005-10-01T09:54:00.000Z	puff	tritium	nothing in /etc/network/interfaces mentions eth1.
2005-10-01T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	puff	man interfaces for some good documentation.  I'll give you a quick example too.
2005-10-01T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	puff	auto eth1
2005-10-04T10:37:00.000Z	tritium	puff	you sure you want to do lossy-to-lossy format conversion?
2005-10-04T10:45:00.000Z	puff	tritium	Well, I can re-rip some of them, but others I loaned the CD to a friend.
2007-06-14T12:07:00.000Z	tritium	puff	or, apt-cache policy bluez
2007-06-14T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	puff	that's not a -dev library
2007-06-14T12:14:00.000Z	puff	tritium	Come again?
2007-06-14T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	puff	you don't have a development library with headers installed.  You only have the shared libs installed.
2007-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	tritium	puff	i.e., get the -dev version of the library package
2007-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	puff	tritium	Ah-hah... now I see it.
2007-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	puff	tritium	will libbluetooth-dev and libbluetooth2-dev confict?
2007-06-14T12:17:00.000Z	tritium	puff	they may.  You'd have to investigate
