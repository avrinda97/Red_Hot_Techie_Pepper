2011-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	Rowen		I've never had the problem because I only use one monitor, with the multi desktops on one screen thing, I felt no need for dual monitor anymore
2011-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	edwardteach	Rowen	 its called flashvideoreplacer
2011-01-23T16:26:00.000Z	Rowen	edwardteach	whould it let it display dualmonitors properly in full screen
2011-01-23T16:27:00.000Z	edwardteach	Rowen	i dont know but it maybe worth a shot!
2011-01-23T16:28:00.000Z	Rowen		Ok, well.. .some how my friends wired mouse died... So I'll give it a shot the moment the mouse wants to work again..
2011-01-23T16:40:00.000Z	Rowen		Awesome, I found a flash plugin that fixed my issue.
2011-01-23T16:41:00.000Z	Rowen		I uninstalled the Adobe plugin and installed Gnash SWF Viewer
2011-01-23T16:42:00.000Z	Rowen		Bit of lag when first loading the YT page but then it runs fine
2011-01-23T16:43:00.000Z	Rowen		meh

2011-01-23T16:46:00.000Z	Rowen		Also, Dr_Willis: My friend is used to Firefox, I don't think he will use Chrome...
2011-01-23T16:48:00.000Z	Rowen		Bleh, I'm just not in the mood... I've been working on this beast for 3 days now...
2011-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	Rowen		because a ton of issues because of dual monitors came at once and had to reinstall 3 seprate times for 3 seprate issues
2011-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	Rowen		so it was easier to jsut reinstall than fix because there was nothing installed
2011-01-23T16:50:00.000Z	Rowen		Well twinview didn't work how we wanted it, when a program went fullscreen it took both monitors
2011-01-23T16:51:00.000Z	edwardteach	Rowen	how did you fix it ?
