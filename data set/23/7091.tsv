2005-12-19T16:11:00.000Z	Skidoo		got a problem - i just installed hoary and everything was working fine. then i ran Synaptic updates and now my machine won't boot. gets as far as uncompressing the kernel, then automatically reboots. i don't know what the problem could be. any idea?
2005-12-19T16:12:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	have you tried with the previous kernel images in the boot list
2005-12-19T16:13:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	there aren't any previous kernel images in the menu, unfortunately
2005-12-19T16:14:00.000Z	Skidoo		i'm just wondering if it could perhaps be a hardware issue
2005-12-19T16:14:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	it could indeed, but more likely is that hoary just fucked up :)
2005-12-19T16:14:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	you could always boot up using the live cd, chroot to your installation and try upgrading again
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	mz2		or at least you could look at bootup logs
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	mz2		oh but it probably doesn't get far enough to even start loggin?
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	mz2		logging
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	yup. there won't be a boot log, and i already tried the live cd and chroot thing, but it did the same thing
2005-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	bugger. do you have /home on a separate partition?
2005-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	yep. sure do
2005-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	Skidoo		hmm. it may not be the kernel itself, cos it crashes at the uncompressing stage. could it be a grub issue?
2005-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	kill the bastard, and just reinstall and hope for the best? :)
2005-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	if you suspect that, put the livecd in and boot up using the boot menu on the cd?
2005-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	unfortunately, that's what i've just done! i had installed previously, but a similar thing happened, and i've just got around to reinstalling tonight :(
2005-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	i can boot from the live cd ok
2005-12-19T16:19:00.000Z	mz2	Skidoo	no, but as in boot from the live cd using the initrd and kernel image from your hd?
2005-12-19T16:19:00.000Z	mz2		the boot cd has grub, too? or is it isolinux or the like? then that probably doesn't work, or am not sure how
2005-12-19T16:20:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	hmm. not sure if i'd be able to boot from the hd using the live cd
2005-12-19T16:20:00.000Z	Skidoo		grub has to know where the kernel image lives
2005-12-19T16:21:00.000Z	mz2		yes, but have you noticed you can edit those things on the fly when booting up? the place that's used as root, the lpace where initrd is, the kernel image and so oin
2005-12-19T16:22:00.000Z	Skidoo	mz2	right. ok. but wouldn't i need to know the exact location on the hard disk?
