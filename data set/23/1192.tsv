2010-07-14T05:16:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	it's at the windows xp server
2010-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	you can't add permission to files on window shares
2010-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	Try connecting to your window server as Administrator
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	but I must be able to put files to there so that that user can open them ; as for now even the windows os doesn't have access ; the file can't even be copied to another location
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	try to connect to it as Administrator every time I want to access it?
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	no, only when you want to modify it
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	Gryllida		...
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	or use FTP
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	I can modify it fine now
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	but the files I make are not openable by the windows user
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	he gets Access denied
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Gryllida		...
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Gryllida		hi
2010-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	Can you access your windows server? you have to give permissions from there
2010-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	I can log in to this shared dir and moify all files
2010-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	the file permissions for that dir are set to 'everyone: full control'
2010-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	however the new files that I make do not have access for the windows user
2010-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	anything you can suggest?
2010-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	It's a windows problem that's for sure. Let me check how I have the share configuration on my windows server
2010-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	ok
2010-07-14T05:52:00.000Z	baltane	Gryllida	Sorry I didn't find anything useful, but I can tell you that it's a sharing problem on your windows server.
2010-07-14T05:54:00.000Z	Gryllida	baltane	No, this is a problem with linux OS unable to set the permissions for the files it puts to the shared location. It should. A dozen of Windows users access that shared dir on that windows xp server just fine.
