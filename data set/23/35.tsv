2012-10-15T19:23:00.000Z	NaZZaX		sudo -H bash is easier
2012-10-15T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	sudo -i
2012-10-15T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	depends on what you mean by "precise image"
2012-10-15T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	can you reach 91.189.91.26 ?
2012-10-15T19:48:00.000Z	NaZZaX	jrib	just like a wget on the cli to 91.189.91.26 ?
2012-10-15T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	sure
2012-10-15T19:49:00.000Z	NaZZaX	jrib	yes i get a successful wget of index.html
2012-10-15T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	that's pretty weird.  You don't have some sort of proxy setup, right?
2012-10-15T19:50:00.000Z	NaZZaX	jrib	is there a way to set one in the cli just to see if its any different?
2012-10-15T19:51:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	apparently apt-get respects the http_proxy variable.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto
2012-10-15T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	can you hit http://91.189.91.26/ubuntu/dists/precise-backports/main/source/Sources.gz
2012-10-15T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	and .bz2 as well since I'm not sure what it actually uses
2012-10-15T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	you can try a mirror to see if something different happens I guess...
2012-10-15T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change us.archive.ubuntu.com.  Yeah, live cd would provide a useful data point
2012-10-15T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	maybe the admin of that other repository dislikes your lab
2012-10-15T20:03:00.000Z	NaZZaX	jrib	you don't understand how pisssed my team was trying to get openstack folsom running last minute when all they had to do was change 3 lil things in that file.
2012-10-15T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	NaZZaX	us. is actually a pool of servers
2012-10-15T20:12:00.000Z	NaZZaX	jrib	yes I'm sure it is
