2011-12-30T14:01:00.000Z	thechris		I've noticed that other ra2800usb devices seem to have a dmesg line about requesting firmware, while this one doesn't
2011-12-30T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	is it not provided by the linux-firmware package
2011-12-30T14:02:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	that's not my point.  I've installed all of the firmware, but I have no way to determine if any of it is actually being used.
2011-12-30T14:03:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	it doens't claim that it failed to find firmware, or sucessfully loaded it
2011-12-30T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	dmesg should say what firmware was used
2011-12-30T14:04:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	it should, shouldn't it.
2011-12-30T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	should is a wonderful word.  sudo lshw -C network    will show some firmware info
2011-12-30T14:05:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	and that one does.  but dmesg never reported it.
2011-12-30T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	does:  sudo iwlist scan   show SSIDs?
2011-12-30T14:06:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	nope, "no results found"
2011-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	if you unload and reload the module in terminal, does it give any interesting output?
2011-12-30T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	is it usb based?
2011-12-30T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	are there bugs reported?
2011-12-30T14:16:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	it is usb based
2011-12-30T15:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	could go to ralink's page and compile the driver if code is available
2011-12-30T15:09:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	I've attempted that for the rt2870sta module.  I'm not convinced that the kernel people know what the device is.  its listed as rt2800 unknown
2011-12-30T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	its a usb thing, they are cheap
2011-12-30T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	try get a broadcom based one or intel
2012-08-25T12:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	what video chip do you use?
2012-08-25T12:45:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	nvidia gt260M
2012-08-25T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	try the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	thechris	ActionParsnip	is that a grub option?
2012-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thechris	yes
