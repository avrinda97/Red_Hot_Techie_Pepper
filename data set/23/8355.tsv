2004-10-21T07:26:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	why? if someone likes and knows k3b, why should we deliberately steer them away from it?
2004-10-21T07:26:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	would you recommend Nero on linux using wine? no... same thing, both will run, neither will work...
2004-10-21T07:27:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	oh is the k3b package actually broken then? fair enough
2004-10-21T07:28:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	its not supported, and the kde debian guys are here, so there not paying much attention to it really... 400+ kde bugs right now...
2004-10-21T07:29:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	would you use a product that the maintainers don't even care about?
2004-10-21T07:29:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	I'm not sure what that's got to do with anything.
2004-10-21T07:29:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	why would you install buggy software?
2004-10-21T07:30:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	there is no software that isn't buggy.
2004-10-21T07:30:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	I'm saying the Debian packages of KDE are badly maintained... 400+ bugs is rediculous...
2004-10-21T07:31:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	in comparison, gnome has about 40.
2004-10-21T07:34:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	you probably have universe at least  :/
2004-10-21T07:34:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	yes...
2004-10-21T07:36:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	I haven't been paying attention to him...
2004-10-21T07:36:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	oh, how helpful of you to comment despite that.
2004-10-21T07:39:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	he would get errors if the dir didn't exist... he's not complaining of this...
2004-10-21T07:39:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	I thought you weren't paying attention...
2004-10-21T07:43:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	just noticed that, even less reason as to why he can't find it  :/
2004-10-21T07:46:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	wow. you're a longterm debian user, right?
2004-10-21T07:46:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	3+ years, yeah
2004-10-21T07:46:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	that explains the abrasiveness then ;)
2004-10-21T07:48:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	hah, I suppose... frustrates me to see people not getting it  :(
2004-10-21T07:52:00.000Z	|trey|	jkg	hopefully you're kidding... but its an Integrated Developement Environment... basically a GUI meant to simplify programming  :)
2004-10-21T07:52:00.000Z	jkg	|trey|	oh, yet another IDE
