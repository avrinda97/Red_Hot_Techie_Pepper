2006-05-01T10:20:00.000Z	no_no_no		i dunno anything and im following these directions : https://wiki.edubuntu.org/ThinClientHowtoNAT
2006-05-01T10:20:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	in terminal type in sudo gedit, and open it up with gedit
2006-05-01T10:20:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	thats why i told you to type 'sudo gedit'
2006-05-01T10:22:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	have you done something stupid like create a root account and are using that?
2006-05-01T10:23:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	 your messing something up ... your shell is the program you start from applications / accessories / terminal by the way
2006-05-01T10:25:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	of course it did
2006-05-01T10:27:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	once you give the command permission, it remembers it for that session.  when you log out it will forget it because the session is reset
2006-05-01T11:11:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	put the floppy in, select places/computer
2006-05-01T11:11:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	that script is trying to create a node in /dev ... why are you running that? what will it accomplish?
2006-05-01T11:12:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	what? it should just write to floppy, i think somethings messed up.  no need for priviledge escelation
2006-05-01T11:13:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	are you sure you have an image to write to a floppy? thats what tombrt usually comes in, use something else to write image to floppy
2006-05-01T11:13:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	why are you using tombsrta anyway? that sounds weird
2006-05-01T11:15:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	ah so whats the problem? just follow th einstructions ... they seem correct.  don't forget sudo
2006-05-01T11:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	the same way any kid learns anyone, just osmosis
2006-05-01T11:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	you are mistaken about how much you need to know, it seems overwhelming at first
2006-05-01T11:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	you don't need to knkow too much more than on windows, its just that everyone has 15 years of training on win
2006-05-01T11:17:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	but you do need to know a little bit more than on windows to not remain a tard and do stupid things like install spyware deliberately
2006-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	what re you trying to do exactly? i'm confused now
2006-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	i've not setup thinclients my self so i cant help you, closest i did something like that was setting up remote access to xsessions via nomachine.com software
2006-05-01T11:28:00.000Z	holy_cow	no_no_no	plug away at it, the biggest problem is just having the network card driver for your thinclients available on the bootdisk ... which is what you are trying to do, those instructions look right to me
