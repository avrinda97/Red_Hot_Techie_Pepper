2009-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	benjamin_		Hi can someone help me, I just get Ubuntu Server working and I need help setting things up.
2009-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	benjamin_		Sorry.  Can someone help me set up my Ubuntu Server to support a website?
2009-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	so -- just a simple Apache installation?
2009-02-09T08:43:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	or something fancier?
2009-02-09T08:44:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	this is the tutorial (of sorts) that i've been following http://howtoforge.com/perfect-server-ubuntu-8.10-p4http://howtoforge.com/perfect-server-ubuntu-8.10-p4

2009-02-09T08:45:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	OK -- where are you having trouble with it?
2009-02-09T08:47:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	...well, depending on what kind of connectivity you have, IP allocation and DNS setup may be out of your hands.
2009-02-09T08:47:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	how can i tell you what connectivity I have
2009-02-09T08:47:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	I'm not running wireless and connected through ethernet.  Does that help?
2009-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	the config file controlling your server's local IP address is /etc/network/interfaces, but any static IP you set in there needs to be valid for the network you're on, and not be something the local DHCP server might hand to someone else.
2009-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	who's your local network administrator?
2009-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	 I don't know.
2009-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	where do you get your Internet service from?
2009-02-09T08:52:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	 Can I tell you my IP address?
2009-02-09T08:53:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	...well, you *can*, and I can do a traceback to see who your provider is, but that's not really enough information. Are you plugged into a corporate network, or a home network?
2009-02-09T08:54:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	home network
2009-02-09T08:55:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	that being the case, you can log into your router and configure the IP range used for DHCP (and, thus, which IPs *aren't*)
2009-02-09T08:55:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	Would you mind walking me though?
2009-02-09T08:55:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	...so, pick one of the IPs that aren't in the DHCP range, and set it up in /etc/network/interfaces (see the output from "man interfaces" for documentation on that file)
2009-02-09T08:56:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	I can't help you with your router -- that's well beyond the scope of supporting Ubuntu, and there are too many different models for me to know them all.
2009-02-09T08:56:00.000Z	benjamin_	nDuff	Can you explain more in depth
2009-02-09T09:00:00.000Z	nDuff	benjamin_	see my PM.
