2010-04-13T21:10:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	even on nfs, if you move files *between* filesystems, the copy is obliged to download to your client and then back up to the server so better to ssh in and do the move locally. Files moved *within* a filesystem over nfs simply get renamed however...
2010-04-13T21:11:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	hmmm, is there anything that will let me remotely execute a move between file systems without sending the files all over the network?
2010-04-13T21:12:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	well, you can always execute mv commands on the server via ssh...
2010-04-13T21:14:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	yes, well, I would like to work with the files graphically; actually, if I used an sftp client, would that work?
2010-04-13T21:18:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	sftp does have a rename file command, I don't know if it understands all the nuances of filesystem to filesystem copies. You'd need to experiment. Also consider using remote desktop/vnc to execute gui stuff remotely on the server...
2010-04-13T21:19:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	I'm trying to avoid installing anything graphical on the server, since it is old; I guess I'll just use ssh for now
2010-04-13T21:23:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	as far as I know, you have to keep track of it manually, unless you have an app that does it for you (don't know of one offhand, usually the manufacturer would supply or recommend something) since it depends on the recording density (bits per inch) and the length of the tape...
2010-04-13T21:38:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	well, it's just like a VCR or a cassette player (remember those?). If you had 2 things recorded, you could overwrite the first as long as you knew exactly where and when it started and stopped, but it would leave a gap. In practice, whether you can do this on a tape device depends on whether it can distinguish the end of one recording from the start of the next. I remember sun cassette drives could do this, so you could skip over archives
2010-04-13T22:08:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	I thought I recalled reading that SATA drives were hotpluggable (You'd need to check this before attempting). External drives in usb enclosures are generally hotpluggable...
2010-04-13T22:19:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	do you know if there is a way for me to write random bits to a tape until it fails, and to know how many bits were written before the failure?  as a way to determine the size
2010-04-13T22:24:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	yes, something like this should work: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/tapedevice     See also the 'dump' command (no use for ntfs though) and the 'mt' command. What program will you be using for the actual backups?
2010-04-13T22:47:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	I was going to use mt and tar, but I'm also looking into dump/restore; as for the size of the tape, I googled the letters and numbers on the tape; who would have thought of that :P
2010-04-13T22:48:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	do either tar or dump/restore make it easier to pull individual files/diretories from the backup?
2010-04-13T22:48:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	I use dump/restore a lot, but did you not say your drives were ntfs. I don't think dump will work with ntfs filesystems at all...
2010-04-13T22:49:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	oh, but I could use tar to backup all the files from it still, right?
2010-04-13T22:51:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	will dump/restore work for hfsplus?
2010-04-13T22:52:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	dump/restore are excellent because they store a directory of files at the beginning of the tape, and you can mark everything you want to retrieve, then just let it run, but I believe it's for ext2/ext3 filesystems only. You should be able to use tar, and it will allow you to pull individual files/directories from the tape, but I'm not sure if all the ntfs filesystem semantics are captured faithfully by tar, since ntfs is, in the end, a pro
2010-04-13T22:57:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	I'm not too concerned about anything but the files being stored from the ntfs drives, since its just data
2010-04-13T22:58:00.000Z	bondiblueos9	Losha	thank you a lot
2010-04-13T22:58:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	you're welcome. Also checkout https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem for other options...
2010-04-16T22:17:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	you need to install a mail backend first. Does your ISP provide an smtp server?
2010-04-17T00:04:00.000Z	Losha	bondiblueos9	I don't think tar sorts the files, so if you name them members explicitly they will get tar-ed in the order on the command line. Try it and see...
