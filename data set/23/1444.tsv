2010-07-30T09:41:00.000Z	picard1421		installing automake now (;
2010-07-30T09:43:00.000Z	picard1421		still says
2010-07-30T09:43:00.000Z	picard1421		./configure command not found?
2010-07-30T09:43:00.000Z	picard1421		i have build essentials
2010-07-30T09:43:00.000Z	picard1421		and automake installed
2010-07-30T09:44:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	You have to be in a directory that has a configure script
2010-07-30T09:46:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	When you're in the source directory where configure exists, ./configure will run that configure script in that directory
2010-07-30T09:47:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	The key is, you have to be in the same directory that configure script is in when you run ./configure
2010-07-30T09:47:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	And you should never use root to build source
2010-07-30T09:47:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	or to do any user tasks (such as configuring building source)
2010-07-30T09:48:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	You probably screwed up the permissions by using root in the first place
2010-07-30T09:48:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	It's a really bad idea
2010-07-30T09:49:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	For one thing, it's a security issue. And you should not form a habit of using sudo or root because linux is permissions based
2010-07-30T09:49:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	If you start running user apps as root, it could foil your permissions and then you can have other problems latert
2010-07-30T09:50:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	configuring and building source are not administrative tasks. Installing the built project into standard prefix on the filesystem is however
2010-07-30T09:51:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	You shouldn't run anything as root unless you understand why you need superuser privileges
2010-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	soreau	picard1421	When did this start happening?
2010-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	picard1421	soreau	i just installed Karmic
