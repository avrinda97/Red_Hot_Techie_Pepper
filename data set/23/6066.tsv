2006-07-21T07:19:00.000Z	Pupeno		mmhh... I am having trouble finding my own access point and my neighbors', that is, in one scan I see one, then I see the other, then I see none for a couple of scans and this is driving me crazy. Maybe it is possible that something is causing a major interference around here ?
2006-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	Sounds like a 2.4 ghz portable phone
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	Thay can really mess things up
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	maybe... in Germany ?
2006-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	at 30 or 40 meters it would need to be a BIG generator
2006-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	it is a construction, I haven't seen it but I can hear it.
2006-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	there's one of those big things to break the streets... those nasty things... and I hear a steady humming... maybe it is just the engine of the thing.
2006-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	if they shut it down at night or lunch do you see a difference?
2006-07-21T07:27:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	I don't know... I'll have to wait till that. I've been having trouble to connect for some days, but I thought it was a problem with the wpa implementation.
2006-07-21T07:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	SOme of those const generators are really really bad about RF control
2008-05-28T20:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	You can give her a dd conmmand in a launcher...
2008-08-06T02:18:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	why bs=2k?
2008-08-06T02:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	Create ISO of CD Rom... dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/$USER/Desktop/file.iso bs=2k
2008-08-06T02:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	a big block is faster but a small error will ruin a larger amount of data
2008-08-06T02:19:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	why 2 and no other number?
2008-08-06T02:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	man dd                     or make it 4
2008-08-06T02:20:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	you are missing my point, but no problem.
2008-08-06T02:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	HOw many times are you going to ask the same question and ignore the answer
2008-08-06T02:40:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not ignoring the answers. There was no convincing answer. According to what I read, you can't really make iso images out of audio cds.
2008-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	that was the first I saw that you were trying to do audio cd's
2008-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	what?
2008-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pupeno	YOu are correct, audio cds are not going to work like that
2008-08-06T02:43:00.000Z	Pupeno	Jack_Sparrow	so, my question is, how do I save to HD an Audio CD for latter duplication (as an iso image doesn't seem to do it)?
