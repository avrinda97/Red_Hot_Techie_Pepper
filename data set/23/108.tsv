2012-07-07T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-07-07T13:23:00.000Z	foobaar	ActionParsnip	lucid
2012-07-07T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install grub-customizer
2012-07-07T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	please don't flood
2012-07-07T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	do you have software centre open, or are updates installing?
2012-07-07T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	then that's what is causing the issue
2012-07-07T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	close both, then  retry
2012-07-07T13:29:00.000Z	foobaar	ActionParsnip	done
2012-07-07T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	ok, rerun the command (use up cursor in terminal)
2012-07-07T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	you do know Lucid's life is quie short now...
2012-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	ok, then run:  sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade     to get all those updates
2012-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	did the PPA get added ok?
2012-07-07T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	proably need: gksudo /usr/bin/grub-customizer
2012-07-07T14:06:00.000Z	foobaar	ActionParsnip	gksudo didn't do anything either but gksudo grub-cutomizer worked i think because i have now in terminal "iinitializing (w/o specified bootloader type)… * reading partition info…"
2012-07-07T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	give it time.
2012-07-07T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	I sugest you contact the PPA maintainer with any issues
2012-07-07T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	what do you actually want to do with grub?
2012-07-07T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	its probably really easy to do without a 3rd party app
2012-07-07T14:07:00.000Z	foobaar	ActionParsnip	i want to remove some older versions of ubuntu from the menu for start
2012-07-07T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	you can do that in software centre, or even CLI
2012-07-07T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	uname -a   shows the running kernel,  dpkg -l | grep linux-image     shows installed kernels. You can remove any kernel you want just not the metapackage or the running kernel
2012-07-07T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foobaar	most things you don't need an app, just ask and we can advise and you wont need to bloat your OS with weird apps
