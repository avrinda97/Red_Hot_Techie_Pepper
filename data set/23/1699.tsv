2011-05-01T04:39:00.000Z	SerialMDK		anyone here help me with a problem?
2011-05-01T04:39:00.000Z	SerialMDK		i try to install 11.04 and get a black screen
2011-05-01T04:40:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	how come?
2011-05-01T04:43:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	write the nicks of ppl you are talking to so they are highlighted... is that an 11.04 ISO?
2011-05-01T04:43:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	what happens?
2011-05-01T04:44:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	besides the monitor being off :)
2011-05-01T04:44:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	how do you click install?
2011-05-01T04:44:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	i was kidding, bro
2011-05-01T04:45:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	how did you load that iso image to the flash?
2011-05-01T04:46:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	format the flash and load the image with unetbootin. format the drive you are going to install with ext4.
2011-05-01T04:48:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	CD or FLASH?
2011-05-01T04:49:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	always with the same ISO image?
2011-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	if your computer handles booting from flash you don't need to haste CDs
2011-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	that's weird and first time seeing something like that. better trying what i told you. download the ISO from ubuntu official
2011-05-01T04:53:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	try gurning the flash with unetbootin. if so you'll get more options to check if is a monitor or graphics falt
2011-05-01T05:20:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	i'm really sorry and i understand how you are. from my side i'm out of ideas :(
2011-05-01T05:26:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	just occurs to me. do you have on that laptop a reset "hole"?
2011-05-01T05:27:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	hmmm so the other option is resetting CMO
2011-05-01T05:27:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	did you ever do that? is the pc case open?
2011-05-01T05:27:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	no, that's not that one, in this situation
2011-05-01T05:30:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	resetting the CMO. you need to find (manual/user guide) a jumper to reset it. also you need to remove the battery from the motherboard.
2011-05-01T05:31:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	so try it. but look at the manual to see the exact procedure
2011-05-01T05:32:00.000Z	lcb	SerialMDK	on a last case scenario remove the HD and at least we know if is or not a 11.04 issue. i'm pretty sure isn't
