2009-03-25T20:47:00.000Z	nameless`		i've got a friend who is myopath and he needs a virtual keyboard at login screen (gdm) do you ever heard about that stuff ?
2009-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	not sure about that. There is autologin though for gdm
2009-03-25T20:53:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	still there?
2009-03-25T20:54:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	yes
2009-03-25T20:54:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	ok. I found something that might help with a virtual kb on login
2009-03-25T20:54:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	cool what is it ?
2009-03-25T20:55:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	in System > Admin > login window, on Accessibility tab, one can enable "Accessible login", which provides a variety of extra tools
2009-03-25T20:56:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	i'll take a look
2009-03-25T20:56:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	I have no experience with that, but see this post: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9166, which describes how to enable GOK (onscreen keyboard)
2009-03-25T20:58:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	what it is supposed to provide ?
2009-03-25T20:58:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	it didn't change anything for me
2009-03-25T20:59:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	I think you have to follow steps from this post: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9166, under "Setting Up Assistive Technology Support"
2009-03-25T21:00:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	I'll give it a try also... be right back
2009-03-25T21:05:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	hm, didn't work for me either :(
2009-03-25T21:07:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	:(
2009-03-25T21:08:00.000Z	nameless`		hi thewrath
2009-03-25T21:08:00.000Z	nameless`		hi sjokkis
2009-03-25T21:12:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	Hm, seems a little more has to be done to activate controls during login. Might be a little harder then I thought. See http://snoringbeagle.net/gnome-access-guide/x234.html
2009-03-25T21:16:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	in fact i tried to launch xvkbd as the same time as gdm but it didn't works
2009-03-25T21:17:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	well, that link I send before was actually for Solaris... I figure it should match...
2009-03-25T21:18:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	i already tried one hour ago, it fails miserably :(
2009-03-25T21:21:00.000Z	oCean_	nameless`	you tried editing /etc/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents ?
2009-03-25T21:22:00.000Z	nameless`	oCean_	not yet, i'll give a look
