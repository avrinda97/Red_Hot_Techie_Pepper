2008-03-24T02:44:00.000Z	unop__	DeadLy_sp_	i'm not really sure what you want to do -- can you explain a little more on that?
2008-03-24T02:45:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	i noob with bash scripting :( i want put the roms and run it from zenity
2008-03-24T02:45:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	hm a little script for plays to xmame without gui
2008-03-24T02:46:00.000Z	unop__	DeadLy_sp_	you mean you want to execute something on a bunch of filenames after listing those filenames in a zenity dialog?
2008-03-24T02:47:00.000Z	unop__	DeadLy_sp_	but why do you want them listed in the zenity dialog? why don't you execute them directly?
2008-03-24T02:47:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	i dont know much as is it :/
2008-03-24T02:48:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	i want load the roms dir and list it on zenity with --radiolist and exec xmame with the selected rom
2008-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	unop__	DeadLy_sp_	  command_to_exec_rom $(zenity --list --radiolist --column "#" --column "file" *zip)
2008-03-24T02:51:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	what! hahaha is all code that i need for it?
2008-03-24T02:52:00.000Z	unop__	DeadLy_sp_	well essentially yes -- you might like to add your grep/awk code around it
2008-03-24T02:56:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	i dont understand ur code :(
2008-03-24T03:04:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	thanks for ur help but i can't complete the script
2008-03-24T03:08:00.000Z	DeadLy_sp_	unop__	hehe sorry, hm, i put 30 roms in a dir, install the xmame and run a script and run zenity for select my rom and go to play
