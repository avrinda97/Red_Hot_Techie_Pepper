2004-11-22T11:16:00.000Z	mirak		hem in fact ubuntu doesn't install a full gnome desktop isn't it ?
2004-11-22T11:17:00.000Z	mirak		sudo apasswd root
2004-11-22T11:17:00.000Z	mirak		or sudo -s
2004-11-22T11:17:00.000Z	mirak		to have a root consol
2004-11-22T11:19:00.000Z	mirak		in synaptic, what means the orange circle of people near some packages ?
2004-11-22T11:19:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	it means it's an Ubuntu supported package
2004-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	ok
2004-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	why isn't the gnome package not supproted by ubuntu ???
2004-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	it's just a meta-package
2004-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	it contains no files, and just drags various other packages in via dependencies
2004-11-22T11:21:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	can I install it ?
2004-11-22T11:21:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	the supported set of GNOME packages are already depended on by ubuntu-desktop
2004-11-22T11:21:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	if you like.
2004-11-22T11:32:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	If I try to install gnome, it ask to remove ubuntu-desktop , is it ok to do that ?
2004-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	sure, but it means when you upgrade to hoary later it won't automatically install any new packages
2004-11-22T11:43:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	I am already in hoary
2004-11-22T11:44:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	why can't gnome and ubuntu-desktop coexists ?
2004-11-22T11:44:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	gnome probably depends on totem-xine
2004-11-23T17:15:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	suid = setuid ... running the binary makes you "become" the user that owns it
2004-11-23T17:17:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	so if an application is suid , you are considered as root using it or is there something else ?
2004-11-23T17:17:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	pretty much, yes ... assuming is setuid root
2004-11-23T17:18:00.000Z	mirak	Keybuk	so I want to use shfsmount as a user, so I setted it as suid whith dpkg-reconfigure, that's ok ?
2004-11-23T17:18:00.000Z	Keybuk	mirak	it's ok, provided that binary doesn't have any security holes, yes
