2011-04-11T19:07:00.000Z	misha		hey guys. sorry for the newbie question, how can I add cronjob?
2011-04-11T19:08:00.000Z	misha		it's opens me a text editor, I need to add cron from shell script that i wrote
2011-04-11T19:08:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	but it in /etc/cron.d/
2011-04-11T19:09:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	same syntax as with crontab -e but you have to give a username after the time-part
2011-04-11T19:16:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	i told you how to do without crontab -e
2011-04-11T19:17:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	echo "* * * * * /home/misha/image.png" | crontab -e -u root not working too
2011-04-11T19:17:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	no crontab for root - using an empty one
2011-04-11T19:18:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	echo "* * * * * root command" > /etc/cron.d/mycron
2011-04-11T19:19:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	not gived me an error, but it writes me "no crontab for root"
2011-04-11T19:24:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	i told you three times how to do it
2011-04-11T19:24:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	nothing worked from what you told
2011-04-11T19:24:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	of your that is working
2011-04-11T19:25:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	I tried every thing you sent me, nothing worked for me
2011-04-11T19:26:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	echo "* * * * * root command" > /etc/cron.d/mycron    what is not working here?
2011-04-11T19:27:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	when I do crontab -l it's shows me that the cron list is empty
2011-04-11T19:27:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	crontab has nothing to do with /etc/cron.d/
2011-04-11T19:28:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	crontab and /etc/cron.d/ are different things
2011-04-11T19:28:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	sorry, didn't knew it
2011-04-11T19:28:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	no problem
2011-04-11T19:28:00.000Z	iceroot	misha	every file in /etc/cron.d/ is a cronjob
2011-04-11T19:29:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	you know some command that i can run to see if everything is aright?
2011-04-11T19:29:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	from the cron.d
2011-04-11T19:35:00.000Z	misha	iceroot	i've did what you wrote to me with the command "* * * * * root php /home/misha/localhost/1.php", the file update my db and i've checked the file everything works when I run the command by myself, so i'm guessing that the cron.d not works
