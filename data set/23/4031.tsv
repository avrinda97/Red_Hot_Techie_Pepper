2007-12-02T15:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	u still here?
2007-12-02T15:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	i can't really find a way to do it,.. what *I* would do, is right click the panel, Add to panel, Add a "Drawer" then add shortcuts to the folders you want, int he drawer.
2007-12-02T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	sorta
2007-12-02T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	just add the drawer panel applet, then drag the folder you want to have a shortcut into there,
2007-12-02T15:52:00.000Z	rohan12121	IndyGunFreak	c the whole idea was to have common places, that the os would recognise as default!! sorta like how windows identifies my documents  and all the rest as the default location for documents and the like
2007-12-02T15:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	yeah, i see what you wanted, but i don't see how to make that happen, w/o actually using the folders assigned.
2007-12-02T15:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	i'm sure there's a way to do it, i'm jus tnot sure how.
2007-12-02T15:54:00.000Z	rohan12121	IndyGunFreak	yeah i reckon ur right
2007-12-02T15:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	you can *try* going through gconf-editor, and see if there's a way to modify the target of those folders, but that could take you a while... open a terminal and type gconf-editor
2007-12-02T16:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	did you figure it out?.. cuz i've wondered this before to.
2007-12-02T16:08:00.000Z	rohan12121	IndyGunFreak	change ur nautilus bookmarks to point to wherever u want them to!
2007-12-02T16:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	lmao, that was simple.
2007-12-02T16:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rohan12121	well, i knew what nautilus was, and it didn't dawn on me to check nautilus bookmarks.
