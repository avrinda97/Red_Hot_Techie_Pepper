2009-07-29T16:22:00.000Z	hosoka1		Benste: yes
2009-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	hosoka1		Benste: it was working fine before.
2009-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	hosoka1		I believe since I have made some last updates, it doesn't open again.
2009-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	hosoka1		Benste: ok, thanks for your assist.
2009-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	hosoka1		Is there anyone here that can inform me why my Mplayer doesn't open anymore ?
2009-07-29T16:26:00.000Z	hosoka1		do not see this opening the program
2009-07-29T16:28:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	perhaps this doesnt work as it did before but.. Try reinstalling package mplayer-skins
2009-07-29T16:29:00.000Z	hosoka1	Dextorion	and iceroot here the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/235872/
2009-07-29T16:31:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	that only tells that you have mplayer installed. As you should gmplayer is just a graphical front end for mplayer, and thats where your problem is.
2009-07-29T16:31:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	the problem is that gmplayer can not find any default skin to use.
2009-07-29T16:32:00.000Z	hosoka1	Dextorion	how to have the default skin installed ?
2009-07-29T16:32:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	so.. mplayer works fine. gmplayer will use mplayer just fine. but gmplayer cant find any skin in /usr/share/mplayer/skins/default/skin
2009-07-29T16:33:00.000Z	hosoka1	Dextorion	how to have this solved ?
2009-07-29T16:33:00.000Z	hosoka1	Dextorion	is gmplayer and mplayer all the same tool ?
2009-07-29T16:34:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	try sudo apt-get install mplayer-skins, or sudo apt-get install gmplayer
2009-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	yes. mplayer and gmplayer is the same. mplayer for console, and gmplayer for graphical frontend.
2009-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	when yoiu installed gmplayer, did you use "sudo apt-get" ?
2009-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	hosoka1		I installed the mplayer skin and it works again.
2009-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	hosoka1		I must have removed this by mistake
2009-07-29T16:37:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	great
2009-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	hosoka1	Dextorion	so I will skip to install the gmplayer
2009-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	hosoka1		I installed the Mplayer via the GUI
2009-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	Dextorion	hosoka1	yes. the problem was the skin.
