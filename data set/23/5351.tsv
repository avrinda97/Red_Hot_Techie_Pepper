2006-12-24T12:42:00.000Z	fbc		Will ubuntu work well as an enterprise server for filesharing and roaming profiles for other ubuntu workstations???
2006-12-24T12:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	sure
2006-12-24T12:47:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	have you ever used it as a server?
2006-12-24T12:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	I have indeed yes
2006-12-24T12:49:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	How would you describe that experience? Are there wizards that coach you through doing common administration stuff? Did you have go through a lot of docs just to get some of the simplest things done?
2006-12-24T12:59:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	still there?
2006-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	its lighter and takes up less space than gnome or kde
2006-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	How would you describe that experience? Are there wizards that coach you through doing common administration stuff? Did you have go through a lot of docs just to get some of the simplest things done?
2006-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	you mean the xfce experience? how to get things done under xfce?
2006-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	No with setting up ubuntu as a server?
2006-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	No with setting up ubuntu as a server, and administering it.
2006-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	well, the experience is what i call enlightening -- it teaches you a lot about how networking happens, why choosing better strategies works better in some situations and not others -- it can get frustrating at first because it's all done manually without much help from automating tools -- but definitely fullfilling at the end
2006-12-24T13:29:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	 cool.. I'll be attempting it soon.. thanks..
2006-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	have you ever setup servers before?
2006-12-24T13:31:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	 Yup, just windows 200x and NT based servers as an MCSE, but I'm really liking ubuntu alot, and having to edit text files to configure things has not discouraged me.
2006-12-24T13:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	that'll definitely help you -- teach you more about LDAP directories (the hands on) manually setting up different services like FTP or WWW, manually tweaking networking and firewalling etc -- i'd say, just go with it (with good documentation in hand) :)
2006-12-24T13:33:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	I also have noticed that there are alot of gui's for administering those text files, so I may install some of those to ease the transition.
2006-12-24T13:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	it's totally upto you -- but as an administrator it might be better to do the canonical way i.e. editing files, etc -- install the GUI tools to help you but make it a point to not rely on them
2006-12-24T13:35:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	 funny... http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/ does not talk much about the LDAP process.
2006-12-24T13:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	the LDAP thing (openLDAP) is not very exclusive to ubuntu -- it's for general linux and works the same regardless of distro
2006-12-24T13:37:00.000Z	fbc	un_operateur	If that built in to NFS or something totally different?
2006-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	NFS is more the filesharing side to it all -- like the windows SMB
2006-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	fbc	like, you can setup a file server on windows that doesnt need to exist within active directory -- same way, NFS exists independently of LDAP
