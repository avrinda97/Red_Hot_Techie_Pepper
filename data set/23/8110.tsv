2005-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	dk0r		Anyone know what dir I can find the "XF86Config-4" file on the ubuntu live cd? Or better yet, does anyone have a working XFree86 config for a 17" G4 Powerbook (ati)?  Cant get my display working & I think the values for my HorizSync nd VertSync parameters are incorrect.
2005-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	dk0r		any help for dk0r?
2005-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	dk0r	you might be looking for xorg.conf, if it's a newer cd
2005-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	dk0r	look in /etc/X11
2005-07-15T08:47:00.000Z	dk0r	Bubbling_Zombie	The only thing in /etc/X11 in the pcc ubuntu live cd is yaboot.conf
2005-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	dk0r		?
2005-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	dk0r	i'm not that familiar with the live cd, and not at all familiar with ppc, but that sounds wrong
2005-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	dk0r		happy_fool: fresh download from ubunut
2005-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	dk0r	you have booted off the live CD and there's no config file in /etc/X11 ?
