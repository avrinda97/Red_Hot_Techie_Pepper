2005-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	pc		hi. i cant delete files via nautilus anymore (error). rm still works. anyone has a clue?
2005-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	levander	pc	check free space on your disk, nautilus doesn't delete files, it moves them to trash can
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	pc	levander	hm was a good idea. 450M free though, should do it
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	levander	pc	how much you have in trash now?
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	pc	levander	0
2005-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	levander	pc	what's the error message when you try to delete?
2005-07-16T11:12:00.000Z	pc	levander	well translated its something like: not on same filesystem while deleting "/home/pc/blah.gif" Continue? (skip,cancel,again)
2005-07-16T11:12:00.000Z	pc	levander	oh and skip or again does nothing. errormessage still shows
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	levander	pc	i'm looking at preferences that can be set for nautilus
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	levander	pc	you do have that partition mounted with write permissions yes?  maybe try deleting a file on another partition
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	pc	levander	the only things i could think of are users (not too smart) and automatic apt-get update and dist-upgrade
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	pc	levander	home is on the / partition. i'll try another though
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	levander	pc	if you can delete a file with rm on the same partition, that's not it actually...
2005-07-16T11:15:00.000Z	pc	levander	what do you mean, that's not it?
2005-07-16T11:15:00.000Z	pc	levander	oh permissions you mean. yeah you're right
2005-07-16T11:15:00.000Z	pc	levander	it's just one of those things that always worked and for some reason not anymore now..
2005-07-16T11:16:00.000Z	pc	levander	interesting. deleting something from hda2 does work without errors
2005-07-16T11:16:00.000Z	levander	pc	yeah, i know what you mean, i'm trying to find that gconf program I think it was called that lets you view a bunch of preferences you can set.  Can't find it.
2005-07-16T11:17:00.000Z	pc	levander	i never remember the name either. just type gconf and TAB :)
2005-07-16T11:19:00.000Z	levander	pc	i can't find anything, i'd just try googling your exact error message, all in quotes.  But, you've have to leave out anything machine specific.  Like hdd, a partition name.  You tried google.com/linux also?
2005-07-16T11:19:00.000Z	pc	levander	i translated the error, it's probably wrong :) if i know the original i
2005-07-16T11:19:00.000Z	pc	levander	i'd search for it too
2005-07-16T11:25:00.000Z	pc	levander	it's an error from gnome-vfs. rings any bells?
