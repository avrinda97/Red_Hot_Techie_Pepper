2006-04-07T11:09:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	you'd use the chainloader directive for windows
2006-04-07T11:09:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	appears you already had it.
2006-04-07T11:10:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	what's it do exactly when you try and boot that grub entry?
2006-04-07T11:11:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	uh...you said that.  that's your grub configuration?  or what?  why are  you pasting that?'
2006-04-07T11:14:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	ah, that's it.  been a whiles since I've done this.  you want rootnoverify
2006-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	where do you get that?  you want that in your grub configuration.  you need to simply read the dual boot howto that's floating around.  lemme see if I can hook it up here...
2006-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	read that junk.  the first one.
2006-04-07T11:29:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	well as I said, you want rootnoverify.  change the root thingy to something like so: rootnoverify (hd0,0)
2006-04-07T11:30:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	really you oughta read that dual boot tutorial though...
2006-04-07T11:31:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	nevermind.  that dual boot tutorial has nothing about grub it seems.  so here's the deal.  open up /boot/grub/menu.lst.  find the windows section.  make it say rootnoverify.
2006-04-07T11:32:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	oh, and (hd0,0), assuming /dev/hda1 is windows.
2006-04-07T12:57:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	well gee, don't you think you could open it again and see if the changes are present?  can't believe you're still confused by this...
2006-04-07T12:59:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	then next time you oughta hit "save".
2006-04-07T12:59:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	or what have you.  if this is really that confusing to you though, you could install gst (gnome system tool or something like that) and edit your grub configuration that way.
2006-04-07T13:00:00.000Z	Codename_V	reaps	if it's not already installed that is.
