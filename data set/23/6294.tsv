2006-05-21T05:00:00.000Z	pyrotic		I am trying to play wolfenstein: enemy territory and have been for a few days now, but I've been sorting through errors and trying to get it to work, the error I am on now, is this.. 'cannot write to hunkusage.dat' when I join a server, OR, it won't download the packs...any ideas?
2006-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	pyrotic		sanne apt-get --help maybe?
2006-05-21T05:02:00.000Z	pyrotic		Waves*
2006-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	pyrotic		guessing nobody is in the smarts of WolfET...
2006-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	yeah, that helps mostly, or man apt. I thought pyrotic should know about those commands, so I didn't mention those. I'm sure he/she will be back if not ;)
2006-05-21T05:05:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	about ET: it sounds like it wants to write files somewhere but can't, maybe a permission problem? I had ET working in my Debian time and there was a dir under home for that where packs got downloaded to.
2006-05-21T05:05:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	do you have a link anywhere that I could look up to have it explain to me what needs to be done?
2006-05-21T05:06:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	not really, because it worked for me from the start. *Do* you have a dorectory like .etwolf (or so) in your home directory?
2006-05-21T05:08:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	hmm.. no I don't
2006-05-21T05:08:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	that may be the problem. How did you install ET?
2006-05-21T05:09:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	had a .run file downloaded, I installed it, and updated it to 2.60, it runs fine, but just won't join the servers due to that error.
2006-05-21T05:10:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	sounds just like what I did. I'm trying to remember if it created the .etwolf folder by itself or if I had to do something. I will search around in my archives if there's some notes, hang on a sec if you have time.
2006-05-21T05:11:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	I've got plenty of time.. :)
2006-05-21T05:23:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	(nothing in my archives about ET but) I just read on a website about possible problems running ET involving the ownership of ~/.etwolf. Have a look: http://cs.unk.edu/~lowry/wiki/doku.php?id=ubuntu_enemy_territory_howto
2006-05-21T05:24:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	Ok THanks I'll have a look at that site!...
2006-05-21T05:32:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	ah, good you're back. Are you german? The link was http://cs.unk.edu/~lowry/wiki/doku.php?id=ubuntu_enemy_territory_howto
2006-05-21T05:32:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	Yes I am German, but I do not know very much German :P
2006-05-21T05:32:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	THank you for the link by the way :)
2006-05-21T05:32:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	why do you ask? (german)
2006-05-21T05:33:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	ah. In case you would understand german, I would recommend *the* german linux gaming site http://www.holarse-linuxgaming.de, maybe there are some tutorials on ET.
2006-05-21T05:33:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	Ahh.. I could translate most of it.. but I'm from the States.. :P thanks anyway!..
2006-05-21T05:34:00.000Z	Sanne	pyrotic	good luck :)
2006-05-21T05:34:00.000Z	pyrotic	Sanne	thanks I'll need it :)
