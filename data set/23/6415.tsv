2006-08-25T13:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Folks, there is an update flashing on my desktop
2006-08-25T13:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Is it safe to implement?
2006-08-25T13:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight		or will it break my computer again?
2006-08-25T13:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	yes, the one that broke stuff really was a fluke (we hope...)
2006-08-25T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	I really hope so too!! :D
2006-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	scribus is a DTP app; OOo is just a word processor
2006-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	thx, how is it going with the pamphlet?
2006-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	the Ubuntu pamphlet? was done ages ago - not sure anyone's done anything further with it
2006-11-20T17:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	i just remember you doing that work
2006-11-20T17:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	did you see jenda's poster?
2006-11-20T17:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	yes, I've ordered 5, actually. Very cool design
2006-11-20T17:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	yea, me too :)
2006-11-20T17:19:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	i showd jenda your ubuntu adaptation of the kubuntu flyer  - he reckoned it needed borders but i think it is fine
2007-03-09T16:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	which version of Ubuntu are you running?
2007-03-09T16:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	: edgy eft
2007-03-09T16:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	and you got a "New Version Available" button on your update manager?
2007-03-09T16:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	: noits just saying i can't install all updates. That i would have to upgrade distro
2007-03-09T16:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	got an unofficial/non-standard repositories enabled?
2007-03-09T16:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	: i see...maybe
2007-03-09T16:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	reset your sources.list to official repos only. "cannot update all packages" seems to be apt-get's why of saying, "I'm confused..."
2007-03-09T16:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	livingdaylight	'way of saying', not 'why...'
2007-03-09T16:06:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	: ok, thx
2007-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Madpilot	told me it could be Apt was confused because updater was telling me i required a distro upgrade to be able to implement all the updates
