2010-10-13T07:01:00.000Z	Chaos2358		could someone PLEASE tell me if ubuntu has a multi account chat/im client similar to empathy but with voice and video chat?
2010-10-13T07:03:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	pidgin?.. don't think so.
2010-10-13T07:04:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	only thing i'm aware of, is aMSN.. if you guys want to create MSN accounts
2010-10-13T07:05:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	good luck...
2010-10-13T08:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	? neither? it's ubuntu 10.04
2010-10-13T08:54:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	ok sorry for the dumb question i didn't know as i'm only three weeks into using linux/ubuntu
2010-10-13T08:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	well what exactly are you trying to download?... you should really try to use the package manager
2010-10-13T08:55:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	package manager doesnt have what i'm looking for. http://www.technixupdate.com/download-yahoo-messenger-for-ubuntu-linux-with-webcam-voice-chat-photo-sharing-support/ it's supposed to be yahoo messenger
2010-10-13T08:56:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	hmm, i guess if i was gonna try one of those, I'd try the Jaunty package
2010-10-13T08:57:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	ok thank you
2010-10-13T08:57:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	hang on a sec...
2010-10-13T08:57:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	ok
2010-10-13T08:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	hmm, seems the jaunty packages ar emissing.
2010-10-13T08:59:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	so i'm guessing there is going to be no way i can get yahoo voice and video chat on ubuntu then
2010-10-13T08:59:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	there has to be an ubuntu package around somewhere
2010-10-13T09:00:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	Reason it's so important is my brother and alot of my old squad are still in afghan and all use yahoo vid chat
2010-10-13T09:00:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	yeah, i understand
2010-10-13T09:01:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	i've been searching for two weeks and thats all i can find though. any ideas on where else to look?
2010-10-13T09:02:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	https://launchpad.net/~loell/+archive/ppa
2010-10-13T09:03:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	ok i'm not exactlly sure what that is?
2010-10-13T09:03:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	PPA repository for gyachi...
2010-10-13T09:04:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Ken8521	thank you so much. you seriouslly dont know how much that means
2010-10-13T09:04:00.000Z	Ken8521	Chaos2358	no problem
