2007-08-17T07:15:00.000Z	Smegzor		no I am reformatting it.  It did exactly the same to my last install which was a clean drive (320 gigs)
2007-08-17T07:16:00.000Z	Smegzor		I selected manual partition during install as I wanted to set my own partition sizes.
2007-08-17T07:16:00.000Z	Smegzor		I know it will use the entire drive without a problem if I let it, but I don't want that.
2007-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	Smegzor		I have the swap partition still.  I'll remove it and try again
2007-08-17T07:19:00.000Z	Smegzor		Its still doing it and free space is the last thing on the drive
2007-08-17T07:19:00.000Z	Smegzor		I'll whipe the drive completely and start over
2007-08-17T07:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	COuld you restate your problem when you get a chance.. Just woke up here and trying to catch up
2007-08-17T07:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	First partition for XP or something?
2007-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	Are you crteating an extended partition and putting logical swap into that?
2007-08-17T07:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	What error are you getting?
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	I try to use gparted from the live cd and not feed it through the installer
2007-12-18T03:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	Use Terminal and type gconf-editor browse to /apps/nautilus/desktop
2008-02-14T04:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	Is that an intel hda card?
2008-02-14T04:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	If interested, here is what I used this am, to get mine going  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55921/
2008-02-14T04:14:00.000Z	Smegzor	Jack_Sparrow	I see from a quick google that its a bug.
2008-02-14T04:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	post a link please...  I know works for me is not a good answer but  I have a 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 03) card
2008-02-14T04:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	What does lspci show for yours
2008-02-14T04:17:00.000Z	Smegzor	Jack_Sparrow	 I solved it.  For some reason hibernating lowers one of the sound controls to zero.  Easily fixed in the sound panel.
2008-02-14T04:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	great
2008-06-26T19:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	I am busy, but I would have him run livecd and sudo fdisk -l  first
2008-06-26T19:20:00.000Z	Smegzor	Jack_Sparrow	http://pastebin.org/46305  This is the output from sudo fdisk -l  His damaged boot partition is on sda3
2008-06-26T19:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	Sorry, but I am not taking on other questions at this time. just pointing you in the right direction
2009-02-12T04:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Smegzor	It requires a special vice modem and special windows software.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no equivalent.  If you find one.. Please msg me here so I can check it out.. thanks
