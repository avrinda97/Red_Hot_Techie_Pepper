2010-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	use ssh-add key.pem
2010-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	ok wait i'll tell u what command i'm using
2010-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	use ssh-add -l to check if it was added properly, might want to temporarily remove other ssh keys
2010-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	could also try ssh -i key.pem user@host
2010-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	that works
2010-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	great, it can be picky when more than one key get used
2010-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	no there is only one key atm
2010-06-10T12:37:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	hmm well thats weird
2010-06-10T12:38:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	this is amazon EC2 running a ubuntu server
2010-06-10T12:38:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	would u know anything ?
2010-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	my experience was that multiple keys could cause authentication denials
2010-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	did ssh -i work?
2010-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	yea ssh -i works
2010-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	it's only sshfs which seems not to play well
2010-06-10T12:40:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	is it a different protocol?
2010-06-10T12:40:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	but ssh-add -l only shows the one, correct key?
2010-06-10T12:40:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	yes
2010-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	same protocol, they should both work the same way
2010-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	:(
2010-06-10T12:46:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	ah i see the problem. probably sftp isn't enabled in the sshd
2010-06-10T12:47:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	-i might work with sshfs too
2010-06-10T13:14:00.000Z	trupheenix	MikeChelen	it works! :) i removed the .ssh/known_hosts entry
2010-06-10T13:28:00.000Z	MikeChelen	trupheenix	ah great, nice catch :)
