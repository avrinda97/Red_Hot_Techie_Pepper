2012-09-27T12:05:00.000Z	devios__		http://pastebin.com/pbEZ9T7f - more on my network woes - network manager sees the wireless network, and when i connect, it seems to authenticate, then disconnect. driving me CRAZY
2012-09-27T12:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devios__	if you scan for networks, are there lots of SSIDs on the same channel?
2012-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	devios__	ActionParsnip	how can i tell if they are on same channel, and if it works in windoze, shouldn't it work in linux (Even if they are all on the same channel?)
2012-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devios__	sudo iwlist scan | egrep  'ESSID|Channel'
2012-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devios__	you'll see the SSID and channel, if lots of networks are on the same channel it kills connections
2012-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	devios__	ActionParsnip	thanks!  there's not a lot of networks on the same channel, but again, i do not have any problems with wireless connectivity when i have vista loaded on this machine - why would it be a problem in linux and not windows?
2012-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devios__	if you run  sudo lshw -C network      what is the product line and driver for the wireless device (I bet its some centrino garbage)
