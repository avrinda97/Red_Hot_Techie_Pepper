2007-11-14T22:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	they did
2007-11-14T22:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	you just need a very specific PC
2007-11-14T22:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	nope
2007-11-14T22:09:00.000Z	timewriter	gordonjcp	what you mean by <gordonjcp> timewriter: you just need a very specific PC
2007-11-14T22:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	an intel mac is basically very very very similar to a PC
2007-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	get a cheap off-the-shelf PC motherboard with the same chipset and it's trivially easy to install Mac OSX onit
2007-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	what protection?
2007-11-14T22:11:00.000Z	timewriter	gordonjcp	, genuine osx has a protection on it , which wont allow the installation on a normal pc
2007-11-14T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	depends on the PC, doesn't it
2007-11-14T22:27:00.000Z	timewriter	gordonjcp	what do you mean ?
2007-11-14T22:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	exactly
2007-11-14T22:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	timewriter	which is why Mac OSX will work perfectly well on certain PCs
2007-11-14T22:29:00.000Z	timewriter	gordonjcp	and what pc would you suggest ?
