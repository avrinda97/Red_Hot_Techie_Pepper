2005-07-15T08:00:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		is it true what I've been hearing about ubuntu?
2005-07-15T08:00:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	that depends what you've been hearing.  If you've heard it's awesome, then yes
2005-07-15T10:05:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	here's the officially supported repos
2005-07-15T10:08:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	which file?  /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-07-15T10:14:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	don't expect ubotu to know everything, just topics we've put in it
2005-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	you want to play mp3s?  Get gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-07-15T11:12:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	beep-media-player is better than xmms anyway.  But yeah, you can get that if you want
2005-07-15T12:58:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	I think w32codecs includes it
2005-07-15T12:58:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	try xine-ui
2005-07-15T15:59:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	how'd you switch it?
2005-07-15T16:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	wouldn't it be easier for you to find the original png on the web?
2005-07-15T16:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	it's got alpha transparency.  Getting anything good out of it will be hard
2005-07-15T16:54:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	what linked to that page?
2005-07-15T16:55:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	uh, firefox can do java.
2005-07-15T16:55:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	I mean what linked directly to it...
2005-07-15T16:57:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	that link doesn't work for me, takes me to an empty search
2005-07-15T05:26:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	by drawing it.  Same way as in inkscape, but in inkscape you can make it an awesome SVG file instead
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	alpha generally refers to the opacity of something
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	low alpha means you can see through it, it'll be translucent
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	in what?
2005-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	use synaptic, search for and remove it
2005-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	don't worry about getting rid of ubuntu-desktop.  There is actually nothing in it, and it's just meant t oround up the general packages.
2005-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	spanglesontoast	you should get it back when you upgrade to breezy though
