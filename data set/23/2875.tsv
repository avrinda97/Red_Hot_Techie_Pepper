2008-12-30T10:19:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	Its actually a diff file.. Its actually a patch file for ethernet driver stuff.. now the article i read asked me to "apply the patch: patch<>" i tried the patch command and it gave me some hunk errors.. i think i m not able to use the command in the right format.. help please..
2008-12-30T10:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	patch -p0 < pathtofile is thee syntax of the command IIRC
2008-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	kk let me try it..
2008-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	it says that the "#1 hunk failed at 942"
2008-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Are you sure the patch is against the correct source?
2008-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	ya, i think so.. it was about resolving some ethernet problem with dell vostro 1510 in Ubuntu hardy.. i link to the patch was given in the article.. so i think.. that its correct..
2008-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Could you give me the path to the patch?
2008-12-30T10:31:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	  http://www.martinhenze.de/extern/r8168-8.006.00.hardy.diff this is the patch to the patchfile.. and this is the article i referred...   http://www.martinhenze.de/2008/05/24/ubuntu-linux-on-dell-vostro-1510/
2008-12-30T10:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	And the directory you are sitting in, has the r8168.h right?
2008-12-30T10:33:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	yes it has
2008-12-30T10:34:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Try patch -p1 < path.to.file
2008-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	same error.. "ing file r8168.h #1 failed at 942"
2008-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Ok, open the r8168.h in gedit/leafpad
2008-12-30T10:38:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	And tell me what do you see at line number 943
2008-12-30T10:39:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	this is line 943  CSIAR_Addr_Mask = 0x0fff,
2008-12-30T10:39:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	 and this one is 942 "CSIAR_ByteEn_shift = 12,"
2008-12-30T10:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Yup, that source is not the same as the one with which this patch was generated
2008-12-30T10:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	You can open up the patch file and see that it is completely different from what the patch file is expecting... that is why it is failing
2008-12-30T10:43:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	Ya i can see.. but i have downloaded the latest version of realtek driver.. is it because of it..
2008-12-30T10:43:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	i mean because of the latest version
2008-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	Highly likely
2008-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	shredder12	WebcamWonder	may be i should consult the writer of the article.. newaz.. thanks for ur help..
2008-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	shredder12	No problems. Glad to help
