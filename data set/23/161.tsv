2012-05-30T16:09:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	ATI cards aren't supported nearly as well for Linux compared to NVidea card. I avoid ATI like nuts for any computer that might be running Linux.
2012-05-30T16:09:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	Are there any Linux drivers for this card on the ATI website.
2012-05-30T16:09:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	Why can't you install Windows anymore?
2012-05-30T16:10:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	You can use GRUB to boot Windows instead of bootmgr
2012-05-30T16:18:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	I do
2012-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	What happens when you execute "sudo which mysql"?
2012-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	Oh you're using XAMPP, I hate that thing lol, I have issues like that too and end up just messing around to get things to work. Have you considered installing each package individually and not using XAMPP?
2012-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server mysql-client
2012-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	Those names might be wrong, it was a best effort but you get the idea right?
2012-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	From there your server root will be '/var/www/'
2012-05-30T16:22:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	This is a "REAL" LAMPP server, where XAMPP is more of a simulation. Great if not better for developing in certain respects, but nobody uses XAMPP for production.
2012-05-30T16:23:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	TO make things easier on you just fully remove XAMPP to avoid such things.
2012-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Deathslycer	You'll learn a lot more this way as it's not some simulated enviroment. I had to use XAMPP for a course once and hated every moment of it lol. Was nice I could just bring around my whole production enviroment on a USB though. I'd say that's it's only advantage.
