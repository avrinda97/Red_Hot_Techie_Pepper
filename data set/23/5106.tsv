2007-03-06T12:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	edit  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2007-03-06T12:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	oh, sorry - iptables ?
2007-03-06T12:26:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	i edited the port there already, but for iptables
2007-03-06T12:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	right
2007-03-06T12:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	hang on a second
2007-03-06T12:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	I have a rule like this
2007-03-06T12:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	umm- where the ip of the source is as you see on that line - you won't need that part
2007-03-06T12:28:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	?
2007-03-06T12:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	the rule would look like iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
2007-03-06T12:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	just change from 22 to your port
2007-03-06T12:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	this assumes that your default policy is "DROP"
2007-03-06T12:33:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	ok thanks, and if i want to delete one of the entries in iptables?
2007-03-06T12:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	you use the -D switch
2007-03-06T12:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
2007-03-06T12:34:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	thanks man, lemme check if i did it right =)
2007-03-06T12:47:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	thanks for your help, just wondering, do you think its bad to keep ssh on its default port 22?
2007-03-06T12:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	no, not really - but look at tcp wrappers and the options in the sshd config to restrict access
2007-03-06T13:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	with putty and an X server maybe :)
2007-03-06T13:02:00.000Z	sm0k3d	thoreauputic	sounds like a lot of work... ill stick to command line =)
2007-03-06T13:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sm0k3d	I don't run Windows - but you can do that kind of thing from Windows with Cygwin IIRC
