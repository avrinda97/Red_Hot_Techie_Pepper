2009-11-09T07:40:00.000Z	epinky	jose	:(
2009-11-09T07:41:00.000Z	jose	epinky	I was reading for a intel graphics driver upgrade, but I not sure if is it the problem
2009-11-09T07:41:00.000Z	epinky	jose	in the page you've posted someone tells about reinstalling nvidia drivers https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/309776/comments/49
2009-11-09T07:42:00.000Z	jose		but my card is Intel Mobile Graphics 965
2009-11-09T07:42:00.000Z	epinky	jose	maybe it's the next step :(
2009-11-09T07:42:00.000Z	epinky	jose	I mean reinstalling drivers :(
2009-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	jose		xorg?
2009-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	jose	epinky	xorg?
2009-11-09T07:44:00.000Z	epinky	jose	not xorg, I mean video card drivers
2009-11-09T07:44:00.000Z	jose	epinky	can I do it with apt-get?
2009-11-09T07:45:00.000Z	epinky	jose	not very sure, I think you've got to recompile drivers from source
2009-11-09T07:46:00.000Z	jose	epinky	do you know where I can find them. I look on intel website but I can't found
2009-11-09T07:54:00.000Z	epinky	jose	you can try at http://intellinuxgraphics.org/
2009-11-09T07:56:00.000Z	jose	epinky	hum...this appears very complicated
