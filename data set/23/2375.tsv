2009-06-16T09:46:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	is that the desktop that comes with it? can i just have the regular desktop if i want?  the interface seems kina strange to me
2009-06-16T09:47:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Do you have any Ubuntu running -- the one not associated with your netbook?
2009-06-16T09:47:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	no, currently my netbook is running xp only
2009-06-16T09:48:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	You can have a regular Desktop on your netbook though.  I have a netbook myself and UNR weren't for me. :)
2009-06-16T09:49:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	but the regular desktop eats through the eeepc battery doent it
2009-06-16T09:51:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	When you install Ubuntu for first time, there [may] be some glicks to work with.  After you are done with that, you'll be fine.  Heck, the glicks may be long gone already since many people probably have same netbook as yours... running Ubuntu already.
2009-06-16T09:51:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Nothing you can do about battery drain except trying to trim down services and lower monitor display and such.
2009-06-16T09:51:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	so i can run regular ubuntu jaunty on my netbook?
2009-06-16T09:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Yes.
2009-06-16T13:10:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	What ISO?
2009-06-16T13:11:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	You could use UNR.img -- It's much easier to work with than ISO when it comes to USB.  UNR also have the option of "Classic Desktop' where you can have a normal desktop.
2009-06-16T13:12:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	i am using the unr img file
2009-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Are you running Ubuntu right now?  Or you're on XP?
2009-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	im running xp
2009-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	i made the usb stick from my ubuntu desktop machine
2009-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Did you ran the md5sum?  Let
2009-06-16T13:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	md5sum your UNR image --> "md5sum your-ubuntu-unr.img"
2009-06-16T13:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	It should be --> 8f921e001aebc3e98e8e8e7d29ee1dd4
2009-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	glicks	mobi-sheep	md5sum checks out
2009-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	glicks	Do you see Ubuntu USB Startup under System --> Administration?
