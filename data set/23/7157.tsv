2006-02-20T10:49:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		man
2006-02-20T10:49:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		that's nuts
2006-02-20T10:49:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		I don't want to resize them all
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		I just want it smaller by default, thanks tho
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		my screen is 1280x768 10.6"
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		I don't need icons the size of my thumb
2006-02-20T10:51:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	are you talking about the desktop or in folders?
2006-02-20T10:51:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	desktop
2006-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	the folder view is bearable, though I still miss windows style list view
2006-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	I'm looking into desktop icons, you have a list view in folders
2006-02-20T10:53:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	I would like multiple columns, not just one
2006-02-20T10:53:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	my movies folder has 600 movies, it takes a long time to view with one column
2006-02-20T10:53:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	try zooming out
2006-02-20T10:53:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		that dodesn't work
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	in icon view
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	LaptopZZ		but my bigger issue is the desktop
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	looking into that
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	the icon view zoom out works somewhat, but it still gives a huge icon separation
2006-02-20T10:57:00.000Z	anto9us	LaptopZZ	"Applications | System Tools | Configuration Editor, Apps | Nautilus | Icon View" has a few settings to tweak
2006-02-20T10:59:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	I'll look into that thanks
2006-02-20T11:06:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	I Found it
2006-02-20T11:06:00.000Z	LaptopZZ	anto9us	nautilus --> pref change 'default icon zoom'
