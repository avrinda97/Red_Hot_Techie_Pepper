2011-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	orethrius		I don't suppose anyone's had any luck configuring a WMP300N from CLI on Lucid...?
2011-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	orethrius		Nope. ;)
2011-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	orethrius		Okay, I should clarify; I had the WMP300N working under the full Gnome environment, but XBMClive relies on the Server install.  Is there any way around ndisgtk?
2011-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	bazhang	orethrius	whats the chipset
2011-07-09T12:35:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	I feel I should also mention that the system has no LAN conn (14e4:4329, incidentally)
2011-07-09T12:35:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Gotta love Broadcom... or not. ;)
2011-07-09T12:36:00.000Z	bazhang	orethrius	thats broadcom? then install the broadcom drivers;
2011-07-09T12:36:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	b43, b44, and b43legacy don't work.  STA doesn't work.  ndiswrapper doesn't bring up the card.
2011-07-09T12:37:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	If I had a GUI, this would be simple, but it's a stripped down Server install, so I'll probably have to pull packages from kernel.org and ferry them over flash drive...
2011-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	If I sound frustrated, it's because I am.  What's so different about the GUI utils that this would all work in full Ubuntu, but not in a Server install? *rhetorical question*
2011-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	bazhang	orethrius	a server with wireless? no experience with that sorry. just installing the broadcom drivers should do it
2011-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Yeah, I know, it's unusual... but the problem is that it's meant to be a wireless HTPC, so it has no LAN conn.  Also, that's unlikely to change; let's just say the landlord did some stupid, stupid things to the CAT5 here.
2011-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Actually, I shouldn't blame her for what the hired help did, lol
2011-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	bazhang	orethrius	it is indeed hard to install the wireless drivers with no internet connection at all
2011-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	I thought I had it, but I obviously missed something in either the ndiswrapper or b43-fwcutter stages, and it's come back to bite me.
2011-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	That's an either/or proposition, btw; I tried both avenues.
2011-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	I guess I'm just wondering what ndisgtk and network-manager do that's so special that it can't be replicated from CLI.
2011-07-09T12:46:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	The ironic part is that I had all this working in full Ubuntu, but XBMC and Natty don't play nice with my Intel graphics.
2011-07-09T12:47:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Picture a flashing that'd make Electric Soldier Porygon look tame, and that's about why I abandoned that idea.
2011-07-09T12:52:00.000Z	bazhang	orethrius	I'm using that PPA so no
2011-07-09T12:52:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Okay, well, just putting that out there.  ;)
2011-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	I guess I only have myself to blame for cheaping out on the WLAN... I'll have to wait till morning to find a decent LAN conn.
2011-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	orethrius	bazhang	Kinda defeats the purpose of a media center if you can't get details about your media, but meh, it's workable.
