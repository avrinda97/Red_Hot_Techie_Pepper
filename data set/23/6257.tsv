2006-05-27T11:40:00.000Z	meherenOS-X		*help
2006-05-27T11:41:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	see line 163?
2006-05-27T11:41:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	try making that say EndSection instead
2006-05-27T11:42:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	sorry, leave it. ADD an EndSection after it
2006-05-27T12:39:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	still?
2006-05-27T12:39:00.000Z	meherenOS-X	YoussefAssad	only 1 week of wasted time on this damn machine
2006-05-27T12:40:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	what kind of video card is it? Lappie, I assume?
2006-05-27T12:41:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	erm...
2006-05-27T12:41:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	what is the output of this command?   lspci -vvv | grep "VGA\ "
2006-05-27T12:42:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	I think it isn't mandatory
2006-05-27T12:47:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	Okay. Can you tell me what kind of screen you have?
2006-05-27T12:49:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	Alright. I suggest you try disabling in your xorg.conf file the generic monitor. That'd mean commenting out lines 111-140 in your xorg.conf and then seeing how it goes
2006-05-27T12:50:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	I know it's nice to have the other working too, but let's get X up first
2006-05-27T12:52:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	try the reverse. Uncomment 111-140, then coment out 147-156
2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	glad to help :)
2006-05-27T13:03:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	erm. What were you trying to accomplish to begin with? :)
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	Oh, I see... I've never done that. Isn't that called xinerama?
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	meherenOS-X	sorry, I had no idea what you were aiming for :)
