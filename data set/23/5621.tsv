2006-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	MasseR		How do I install modules/drivers?
2006-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	lupine_85	MasseR	most of them come installed with the kernel by default
2006-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	lupine_85		you might need to "modprobe" them to load them into the kernel, tough. What are you trying to get running?
2006-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	lupine_85		though*
2006-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	I know, but one site recommended that b44 is buggy and instead use the old bcm4400
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	lupine_85	MasseR	then you'll likely have to build it manually
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	I know, but how
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	lupine_85		I'd imagine
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	MasseR		the module-assistant build bcm4400 doesn't work
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	MasseR		And "make" doesn't work
2006-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	lupine_85	MasseR	depends on the module. usually you read INSTALL
2006-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	It doesn't have INSTALL
2006-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	lupine_85		do you have the headers installed?
2006-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	lupine_85		e.g. linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
2006-10-26T14:09:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	It sais to "cd src ; make"
2006-10-26T14:09:00.000Z	MasseR		But it complains erorrs
2006-10-26T14:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		then interpret the errors and fix the problems from there
2006-10-26T14:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		if you can't do that, pastebin the errors and I;ll see what I can do
2006-10-26T14:10:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	Hold on. Trying to find out how to get the errors
2006-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28500/
2006-10-26T14:15:00.000Z	lupine_85	MasseR	you don't have the kernel headers installed....
2006-10-26T14:15:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	Yes I do
2006-10-26T14:15:00.000Z	MasseR	lupine_85	Uhm, I have the source at least
