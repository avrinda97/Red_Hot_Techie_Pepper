2006-11-26T14:01:00.000Z	Phuzion		there's everything you need to know about man apt-get
2006-11-26T14:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		which is why I need someone to walk me through it
2006-11-26T14:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		yeah, but I don't get how to get a specific driver for a card from the repositories
2006-11-26T14:04:00.000Z	Phuzion		Yeah, but the bots should be required to notice or PM
2006-11-26T14:06:00.000Z	Phuzion		I think that all bots should be required to always stick to msg or notice
2006-11-26T14:06:00.000Z	Phuzion		So, is someone going to help me out with my video card driver issue?  I'm running an ATI Rage Mobility and apparently I don't have drivers for it yet.
2006-11-26T14:07:00.000Z	Phuzion		hmm
2006-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	Phuzion		whats the url you're clicking on?
2006-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	what type of card do you have?
2006-11-26T14:09:00.000Z	Phuzion	concept10	 ati rage mobility inside a sony vaio pcg-9e1l
2006-11-26T14:09:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	are you using linux right now?
2006-11-26T14:10:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	I think the driver is called 'r128'  You hsould get a better response if you detail what exact problem you are having (what are you trying to fix)
2006-11-26T14:20:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	it maybe installed already ... do a lsmod  and see if its listed
2006-11-26T14:21:00.000Z	Phuzion	concept10	 I don't see it there
2006-11-26T14:22:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	you may be using the radeon driver
2006-11-26T14:22:00.000Z	Phuzion	concept10	 if I am, I'm unaware
2006-11-26T14:22:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	do a lsmod | grep r128
2006-11-26T14:23:00.000Z	Phuzion	concept10	nada
2006-11-26T14:23:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	try to grep ati and then radeon
2006-11-26T14:24:00.000Z	Phuzion	concept10	 please join #flood so I can show you what the other grep returns
2006-11-26T14:34:00.000Z	concept10	Phuzion	im going to try and install it
