2006-11-06T06:55:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		is he asking for edgy packages on dapper?
2006-11-06T06:55:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		is edgy worth the hassle
2006-11-06T06:56:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		im happy in dapper

2006-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		haha
2006-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		NEW STARTUP!
2006-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		no wai.
2006-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		:P
2006-11-06T06:58:00.000Z	dom_f	mikeymike-linux	  I was also happy in Dapper but upgraded to Edgy.  Following a real horrible time I reinstalled Edgy from scratch - despite this I continued to have a number of problems which I worked thro - eventually however I gave up and am now back in Dapper.  I've decided to leave it a while for those with more knowledge wthan me to work through the issues.
2006-11-06T06:58:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	dom_f	i dont think i'd have a problem fixing the issues
2006-11-06T06:58:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		/var/log is your friend
2006-11-06T06:58:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		:)
2006-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	dom_f	mikeymike-linux	 Nor did I - however the one that beat me was "hard" hangs whenever the machine was left overnight.  Serveral people suggested hardware problems but it hasn't happened since I moved back to dapper.
2006-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		hardware problems in edgy
2006-11-06T07:00:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	dom_f	that sucks
2006-11-06T07:00:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		there should be a community of linux hardware users where you input all your parts and it creates a profile... then you compare with other linux users in a database and they all report bugs and fixes.....
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		that would be insanely awesome
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	dom_f		also, strangely, I had to boot with the IRQPOLL option in Edgy (caused by the newer kernel?) or I had no USB - again I don't see this in Dapper.
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		like oyu can find people who have the same hardware as you... or the majority of the same hardware.....
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux		that owuld be so cool
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	dom_f	ah that bites
