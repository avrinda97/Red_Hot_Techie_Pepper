2008-12-17T03:44:00.000Z	Qrikko	Alpert	burn the iso on a CD (probbaly your burning program have some option for it)
2008-12-17T03:44:00.000Z	Alpert	Qrikko	So, don't unzip/unpack it?
2008-12-17T03:45:00.000Z	Qrikko	Alpert	no, you want it to autostart just like any windows CD you may have once burned.. when you didn't find a original one.. and had your key you bought from ms :P
