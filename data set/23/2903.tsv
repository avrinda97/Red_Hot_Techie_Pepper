2008-10-06T06:09:00.000Z	luminrd		I don't see how that's possible.. I reformatted the partition and still there's stuff on the drive!!
2008-10-06T06:11:00.000Z	luminrd		Should I sudo rm -rf /media/drive if I want to get rid of EVERYTHING on it?
2008-10-06T06:12:00.000Z	luminrd		Yes I'm aware of its effects
2008-10-06T06:13:00.000Z	luminrd		But no other method seems to be workin
2008-10-06T06:14:00.000Z	luminrd		OK, WTF! Seriously DOUBLEYOO TEE EFF????  sudo rm -rf /media/disk/*  admin@integrity-client01:/media/disk$ ls -a.   ._20080821 Taming the CC Beast.wav  .Trash-1002  ._.Trashes ..  .Spotlight-V100                     .Trashes

2008-10-06T06:15:00.000Z	luminrd		I asked a minute ago and someone said it did.. ok anyway what do I need? rm -rfa?
2008-10-06T06:16:00.000Z	luminrd		Lol. makes sense. thank you
2008-10-06T06:17:00.000Z	luminrd		Holy balls.  A whole lot of "you can't do that"
2008-10-06T06:17:00.000Z	luminrd		"Read only filesystem". WTF
2008-10-06T06:19:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	with rm .* you've just deleted the . and .. I'm not sure what will work now...
2008-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	It didn't let me delete anything
2008-10-06T06:22:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	sudo rm -r /media/drive/.[^.]* will delete anything on that folder in a safe way so it won't delete . and ..
2008-10-06T06:23:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	No, it won't let me delete it at all. It won't let me.  it says read only filesystem.
2008-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	can you tell me using a pastebin what the mount command say?
2008-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	 just "mount"?
2008-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	http://pastebin.com/m67f8aeb7
2008-10-06T06:28:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	so can you cd to your drive? i see no /media/drive
2008-10-06T06:40:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	It's not /media/drive, it's /media/disk
2008-10-06T06:40:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	disk-2 actually
2008-10-06T06:40:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	ok, and did you managed to cd in it? and to rm -r * ?
2008-10-06T06:41:00.000Z	luminrd	root0	Yes I can cd into it. But no, I cannot rm -r, that is the entire problem here.
2008-10-06T06:44:00.000Z	root0	luminrd	it may be your environment or something. i just can't figure it out. sorry, is over my knowledge.
