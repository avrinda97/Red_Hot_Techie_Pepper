2007-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	Burningmace		hey, got a quick question regarding GCC
2007-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	Burningmace		I'm new to linux, so bear with me :P
2007-07-24T07:11:00.000Z	Burningmace		basically, when I go to compile using "gcc iwrandom.c -o iwrandom" it throws up a bunch of errors regarding missing header files
2007-07-24T07:11:00.000Z	Burningmace		so it looks like the compiler needs a path setting or something
2007-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	Burningmace		but I don't know how to fix it :/
2007-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	Have you installed the build-essential package?
2007-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- nope, but I have no idea how either...
2007-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-07-24T07:15:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- I ran that command, and it said nothing. tried gcc again and still the same issue.
2007-07-24T07:15:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	It didnt do anything? Did it give you an error?
2007-07-24T07:22:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	That is very odd.
2007-07-24T07:23:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- well, I'm glad in a way that it's not just my newbiness at Linux that's screwing with theings :P
2007-07-24T07:24:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	You do have an internet connection on that computer, correct?
2007-07-24T07:25:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- yup
2007-07-24T07:25:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	Shouldnt make a difference.
2007-07-24T07:26:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	try doing `sudo apt-get update` first then retry the build-essential insall
2007-07-24T07:27:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- nope, same issue.
2007-07-24T07:28:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- you think auto-apt is worth a try?
2007-07-24T07:30:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	Are you by chance on the LiveCD?
2007-07-24T07:31:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- I am.
2007-07-24T07:32:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- you think that's the problem, that I need to do a full install?
2007-07-24T07:32:00.000Z	Pici	Burningmace	I'm sure thats part of the problem.  I thought you could install packages on the LiveCD though.
2007-07-24T07:33:00.000Z	Burningmace	Pici	- it must be that. I'll attempt a proper install :)
