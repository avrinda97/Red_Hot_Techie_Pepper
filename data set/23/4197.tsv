2008-06-18T09:17:00.000Z	xiaden		anyone want to tell me why My mount is lying to me?
2008-06-18T09:17:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	IIRC, mount gets its information from wtmp, which could theoretically be out of date. What problem are you having?
2008-06-18T09:18:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Excuse me, not wtmp, but another file.
2008-06-18T09:18:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	http://pastebin.com/d76b186b9
2008-06-18T09:19:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	The filesystem was not mounted ro but the filesystem driver is a read-only drive.
2008-06-18T09:19:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Use the ntfs-3g driver.
2008-06-18T09:20:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	s/read-only drive/read-only driver/
2008-06-18T09:20:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	i'm kinda sorta, really noob. baby steps please.  just put that in a sudo command?
2008-06-18T09:21:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	You need to edit /etc/fstab and replace ntfs with ntfs-3g.
2008-06-18T09:23:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	i'm on a live cd. everything i've done so far has been through mount. no fstab entry at all. if you could tell me an exact entry, that would be wonderful.
2008-06-18T09:23:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Which live cd?
2008-06-18T09:26:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	 kubu, from around two weeks ago. what i am ultamently doing is deleting a single file from my drivers folder so this computer will boot back to its origanal POS os.(repost)
2008-06-18T09:28:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Try umount /dev/sda1, and then mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt
2008-06-18T09:30:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	i don't have that filesystem
2008-06-18T09:30:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	ntfs-3g
2008-06-18T09:30:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Strange. Maybe the live cd doesn't have ntfs-3g then.
2008-06-18T09:31:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	i'm thinking not. apt-get doesn't show it either. any specific package??
2008-06-18T09:32:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	I don't know. apt-cache search ntfs-3g?
2008-06-18T09:32:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	no output on that command =P
2008-06-18T09:34:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	I recommend dumping kubuntu and getting a copy of sysrescuecd.
2008-06-18T09:35:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	only have one system =P live cd dun write cd's, seeing as how it's in the cd drive.
2008-06-18T09:35:00.000Z	erpo	xiaden	Do you have any friends perchance? ;)
2008-06-18T09:43:00.000Z	xiaden	erpo	does 7.04 have ntfs-3g in it's repo?
