2006-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	monzie		anyone here who use icewm or fluxbox?
2006-01-25T11:29:00.000Z	monzie		which is better icewm or fluxbox bnD ?
2006-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	monzie		i want the coolest looking configurable desktop possible
2006-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- use gnome :)
2006-01-25T11:31:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- that's because X is only just allowing for "MacOS like stuff" GNOME is the most Mac-like of the major desktop environments
2006-01-25T11:32:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- try the gdesklets dock thingy - or use a clone of the Dock that apple based theirs on - gnustep!
2006-01-25T11:33:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- Gnustep is a clone of NextStep, which is what apple based OSX on
2006-01-25T11:38:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- check these (old) videos - this is where gnome visuals could go: http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/xshots
2006-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- it's not less configurable - it's just that the settings that most people need are the only ones directly presented to the user - that's a good thing.
2006-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	what gnome stuff do you work on?
2006-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- it's called "usability testing"
2006-01-25T11:46:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	good luck with it. It's actually more than a WM - it's an entire framework and environment
2006-01-25T11:46:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- it's not as visually slick as certain newer WMs, but it's a great system
2006-01-25T11:48:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- It's worthy of a livecd of its own.
2006-01-25T11:49:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- careful when setting it up - there are system services it needs to run properly that you might have to add to your init scripts
2006-01-25T11:49:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- It IS under active development.

2006-01-25T11:51:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- thing to remember is, GNUstep's priorities are not on visual polish at this time. They've basically cloned the old NeXTstep UI and stopped there. If you use it for a week, you'll never go back to GNOME
2006-01-25T11:53:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- it's very popular with people who understand why it is so good technically.
2006-01-25T11:53:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- this quote sums it up: "One could say that GNUstep is a very nice woman, but without proper make-up and with a shabby dress. Although the expert eye could see the star sparkle, the average person maybe would prefer a more normal female with choosen make-up and dress."
2006-01-25T11:53:00.000Z	monzie	neiras	lol!
2006-01-25T11:55:00.000Z	neiras	monzie	- I'll help if you like - gbauman@gmail.com
