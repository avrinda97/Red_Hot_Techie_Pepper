2012-06-09T17:01:00.000Z	mino123		thats the output though
2012-06-09T17:01:00.000Z	mino123		mount: /dev/sda6 already mounted or /mnt busy
2012-06-09T17:01:00.000Z	mino123		even though I have already unmounted it
2012-06-09T17:01:00.000Z	mino123		it was originally mounted on /cdrom
2012-06-09T17:02:00.000Z	mino123		I have unmounted it with umount -l /cdrom
2012-06-09T17:02:00.000Z	mino123		nope
2012-06-09T17:02:00.000Z	mino123		I am from live usb
2012-06-09T17:03:00.000Z	mino123		alright
2012-06-09T17:03:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	it isn't a good idea to copy a livecd to a partition and run it from there
2012-06-09T17:04:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	its not designed to be run as a frugal install
2012-06-09T17:04:00.000Z	mino123	auronandace	oh ok
2012-06-09T17:12:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	what is the output of: df -h
2012-06-09T17:13:00.000Z	mino123	auronandace	http://nopaste.info/474a195fec.html
2012-06-09T17:15:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	and the output of: sudo fdisk -l
2012-06-09T17:16:00.000Z	mino123	auronandace	http://nopaste.info/3c7a1cacbb.html
2012-06-09T17:18:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	are you root by default?
2012-06-09T17:18:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	so you logged in as root?
2012-06-09T17:19:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	not the best of ideas
2012-06-09T17:22:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	are you starting to see why frugal installs are not supported?
2012-06-09T17:22:00.000Z	mino123	auronandace	I guess ..
2012-06-09T17:23:00.000Z	auronandace	mino123	no need for that
