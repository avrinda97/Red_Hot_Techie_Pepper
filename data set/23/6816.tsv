2005-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	ssstormy		cause the linux media players just don't wanna handle the obscure formats
2005-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	ssstormy		in fact, totem dosn't seem to want to handle any formats
2005-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	ssstormy		XP
2005-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	ssstormy		avi, asf, mp4
2005-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	ssstormy		oh and wmv
2005-12-24T17:10:00.000Z	ssstormy		I've added win32 codecs
2005-12-24T17:10:00.000Z	ssstormy		yeah I have mplayer and it works great
2005-12-24T17:10:00.000Z	ssstormy		except it's got bugs
2005-12-24T17:10:00.000Z	ssstormy		involving the kind of mp4 files I'm playing
2005-12-24T17:11:00.000Z	ssstormy		they have this encoding that's like a newer form of xvid
2005-12-24T17:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	It's a matter of what extras you've installed, not the player.   I've used rhythmbox, vlc, totem, and mplayer to play those formats.
2005-12-24T17:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	Had you done the step Viper12 mentioned?
2005-12-24T17:17:00.000Z	ssstormy	tonyyarusso	I'm trying that right nwo
2005-12-24T17:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	I've heard it's possible to write to ntfs, but very strongly discouraged (as in, chances are the drive will jump onto the floor, squeal a bit, and die).
2005-12-24T17:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	Reading shouldn't be a problem though, check the mounting permissions in fstab perhaps?
2005-12-24T17:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	There is resize support in the installer, however.
2005-12-24T17:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	Try reinstalling the players after the codecs have been copied there.  I think they have to look for and find them in the installation process for the new codecs to be recognized.
2005-12-24T17:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	Just found this: gstreamer0.8-mad - Add MP3 support for Rhythmbox; do you have that package?
2006-01-27T07:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	/proc is RAM, I believe.
2006-01-27T07:07:00.000Z	ssstormy	tonyyarusso	really?  cool.  How much space?  unlimited?
2006-01-27T07:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	Well no, you only have so much RAM.
2006-01-27T07:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ssstormy	cafuego knows more than me, so mind his warning.
2006-04-24T13:02:00.000Z	ssstormy	tonyyarusso	install it and do a df -h?
