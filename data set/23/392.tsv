2011-10-21T18:21:00.000Z	cheshair		Hi! When I search for Skype on Ubuntu Software Center I am told there are two versions of Skype available, both called "Skype:i386". I wonder why there are two of them and neither of them is marked as already installed on my system. (Ubuntu 11.10 and Skype already installed)
2011-10-21T18:22:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	maybe you have two repos who have the same software in it? Try apt-get purge skype, then apt-get install skype
2011-10-21T18:23:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	i'll check it out. where am i supposed to find my repos? are those the same i found in my /etc/apt/sources.list?
2011-10-21T18:23:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	yes. Paste it to pastebin and paste the link here
2011-10-21T18:30:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	here is the content of my sources.list along with a brief summary of my problem

2011-10-21T18:31:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	try apt-get update
2011-10-21T18:32:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	I already tried with apt-get update
2011-10-21T18:41:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	I tried purging and reinstalling Skype with apt-get, it seems it's now retrieving 2.2.0.35-0oneiric2 version
2011-10-21T18:41:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	it's weird apt-cache policy didn't mention anything about this oneiric version before the purge
2011-10-21T18:41:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	thanks
2011-10-21T18:47:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	what's the output after apt-get install skype?
2011-10-21T18:47:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	what output? policy?
2011-10-21T18:48:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	yes
2011-10-21T18:50:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	try "locate / -iname 'skype'", post the output without permission errors to pastebin. Do you have the bin?
2011-10-21T18:52:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	locate? do you mean "find"?
2011-10-21T18:52:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	just check if you have the bin in "/usr/bin"
2011-10-21T18:52:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	it's there
2011-10-21T18:54:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	so it is installed but it doesn't show on package list as installed?
2011-10-21T18:56:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	skype was installed and is currently installed after the purge/reinstall. the problem is some sort of (apparent) inconsistency between apt-get and ubuntu software center
2011-10-21T18:57:00.000Z	Pessimist	cheshair	restart ubuntu software center. Maybe you should report a bug
2011-10-21T18:58:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	at the end of the day ubuntu software center realizes skype is installed but two same versions of skype are found
2011-10-21T18:58:00.000Z	cheshair	Pessimist	ok i will
