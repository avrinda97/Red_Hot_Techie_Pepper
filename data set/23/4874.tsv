2007-05-28T12:54:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	how do you download? Bittorrent?
2007-05-28T12:55:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	its everything from bittorrents to http downloads. it is just slow. i download the same thing in windows with 3x the speed
2007-05-28T12:57:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	could you be more specific? any info on what might cause the problem. what kind of connection are we talking about?
2007-05-28T12:58:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	i have a cable modem but have not exceeded over 40 kbs. its just in linux
2007-05-28T12:59:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	how is your comp connected to the cable modem?
2007-05-28T12:59:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	i have a router
2007-05-28T13:00:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	so, its like this? PC| ethernet card <eth cable> router <eth cable> cable modem?
2007-05-28T13:01:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	yes
2007-05-28T13:01:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	pc->router->modem
2007-05-28T13:02:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	are you using a wireless card or a wired one?
2007-05-28T13:02:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	this pc is hardwired
2007-05-28T13:04:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	did you open a port for bittorrent in your router?
2007-05-28T13:04:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	yes and it has a static ip
2007-05-28T13:05:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	is your bittorrent client configured to bind to that open port?
2007-05-28T13:05:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	yes and its not just bittorrent it happens with all downloads
2007-05-28T13:07:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	i cannot think of any settings in Ubuntu that could possibly make downloads slower, or any other software issues that could relate to your problem
2007-05-28T13:07:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	im going to look into java. thats what the forums are saying
2007-05-28T13:08:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	so you are using azureus? try another BT client
2007-05-28T13:09:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	ive used azureus and utorrent
2007-05-28T13:10:00.000Z	magnetron	josh__	are you sure that you just did not have bad luck with the swarm at the time you were using ubuntu?
2007-05-28T13:10:00.000Z	josh__	magnetron	knowing me it is just my luck. just wanted to make sure
