2009-10-17T09:24:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	No No No! using compiz can that problem
2009-10-17T09:26:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	what's your video card?
2009-10-17T09:28:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	well, I hope not. But if you've got an old card (like a radeon) that might be the problem
2009-10-17T09:28:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	*old* radeon I mean
2009-10-17T09:29:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	What card is It???
2009-10-17T09:29:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	you probably don't have to reinstall drivers
2009-10-17T09:30:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	try running this in a terminal: glxinfo | grep direct
2009-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	alright, now try glxinfo | grep vendor
2009-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	Ah, SGI means that your card is not using drivers...they're using the generic mesa drivers.
2009-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	So you might need to reinstall
2009-10-17T09:34:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	What card do you have!!!
2009-10-17T09:35:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	'cause where you get the drivers depends on your type of card
2009-10-17T09:36:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	Hmmm...I've never have to set up Intel graphics before.
2009-10-17T09:36:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	Let me take a little look
2009-10-17T09:37:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	I can answer that...not really. They would be in a repository, so you would install through built in ubuntu tools
2009-10-17T09:40:00.000Z	Magnesium	brian1	I gotta go...but there's other folks who can help you out.
