2008-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	Are you compiling it yourself?
2008-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	if I wanted to compile the stuff, I'd run gentoo :)
2008-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	Well anderswc compiled apache from source.
2008-01-18T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	then he should be asking for help on #apache
2008-01-18T09:55:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	He did it because universe wasn't enabled in his sources, so he installed it that way.
2008-01-18T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	anderswc then you should run the make uninstall in the apache source dir and switch :)
2008-01-18T09:56:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	Exactly where we're going right now. =)
2008-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	you might want him to run a find as well, Just In Case
2008-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	agreed.
2008-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	maybe you could have him put the results of the find up on pastebin, you could look it over and if it's selective enough have the find rm {}
2008-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	I'm not familiar enough with apache's libs, etc to say what's supposed to be there. So take my advice advisedly
2008-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	Aye, it's a good idea though, and safer.
2008-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	if he deleted the /etc/apache2 directory, he'll have to purge libapache2-mod-php5 to get back the php5.conf & load
2008-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	--reinstall install should cover that, correct?
2008-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	no, dpkg assumes that a conffile in /etc is missing because the sysadmin did it on purpose, so it won't put it back
2008-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	That's good to know.  Thank you. =)
2008-01-18T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	one more thing: purging apache2 won't do the trick, you have to purge the packages that apache2 installs.  dpkg -l '*apache* | grep ^ii gives you a list
2008-01-18T10:37:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	you don't think purging apache won't cause an install to recreate /etc/init.d/apache2?   He had compiled it in the first place before he used apt.
2008-01-18T10:38:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	So all the packages listed with dpkg -l need to be purged, correct?
2008-01-18T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	the stuff that goes into /etc/apache2 is provided by apache2-common . And apache2 isn't really the web server, it installs one of apache2-mpm-event , apache2-mpm-prefork, or apache2-worker . prefork is the preferred one, if you don't specify
2008-01-18T10:39:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	nickrud	Gotcha, so common is getting us.
2008-01-18T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	another useful command is   dpkg -L <packagename> , it lists the files in the package.
2008-01-18T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	ZionPsyfer	keep coming back, persistent help can be hard to find :)
