2009-12-24T18:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 or you could actually do a 'normal' install to a pendrive.
2009-12-24T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 pendrivelinux.com   or use the unetbootin tool. or the usb-disk-creator tool
2009-12-24T18:31:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	thank you I'm looking to setup a portable usb thumbdrive seedbox.
2009-12-24T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 define the term 'seedbox'
2009-12-24T18:32:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	Something that can share downloaded torrents during high traffic times to earn extra upload ratio.
2009-12-24T18:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 you can set up a pendrive with a 'persistant' save file and use it as you would a normal system.
2009-12-24T18:33:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	Dont worry I wont be telling anyone you told me how to fix this up :P :)
2009-12-24T18:34:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	well I plan on trying to install rtorrent and an init.d script and openssh thats about it on this thumbdrive.  So that I can go to another computer thats running a totally different OS leave it alone and use the thumbdrives OS to seed off a portable drive.
2009-12-24T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 You can install thise extras on a persistant-save file enabled flash drive installed ubuntu.  the usb-creator tool in ubuntu lets you set one up easially
2009-12-24T18:36:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	I allways thought that only did bootable install keys, hmm I'll have to look into this for sure...
2009-12-24T18:38:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	this is going to end up another one of those geeking too hard to get a good days sleep again.
2009-12-24T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 setting up a bootable flash drive + save file and isntalling those few apps.. would take me.. proberly 20 min.
2009-12-24T18:39:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	Wish you could set this badboy up for me lol its gonna take me for freeking ever to figure out all of the variables.
2009-12-24T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 use the usb-creator tool. have it  use a save file the sizwe you want.. let it do its work (about 10 min for that perhaps) - boot the pendrive - install the apps you need.
2009-12-24T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 not a lot of weirsetuff to it
2009-12-24T18:41:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	would this play nicely with server edition?
2009-12-24T18:41:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	I only need a cli on this client
2009-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 i dont think the server ed plays nicely with unetbootin or the usb-creator tool. Try it and see I guess
2009-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 or use the desktop ed. and disable gdm
2009-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	disable gdm? like do a tasksel and remove it later?
2009-12-24T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chamunks	 just make the service not start.
2009-12-24T18:44:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	... see veriables I'd be terrible with them lol I'm such a basketcase over the holidays.
2009-12-24T19:20:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_Willis	thanks for the help
