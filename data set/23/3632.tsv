2008-06-02T18:18:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	there is a fix.. It won't compile right?
2008-06-02T18:18:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	it seems to have locked down my comupter
2008-06-02T18:19:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	how do you mean?
2008-06-02T18:19:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	i have no idea, i left my computer last night for about twenty minutes, after i had installed vmware and when i got back all there was was a black screen
2008-06-02T18:20:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	did you install server version 1.xx or beta 2
2008-06-02T18:20:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	i have no idea, i left my computer last night for about twenty minutes, after i had installed vmware and when i got back all there was was a black screen. and today i can't even start my computer other than in safe mode
2008-06-02T18:21:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	you don't remember which version you downloaded?
2008-06-02T18:21:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	dunno... i used automatix to install it. i'm a relative novice and all my bad pc habits of not asking and paying little attention are paying off
2008-06-02T18:22:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	did you use  automatix from some other site or synaptic ..?
2008-06-02T18:23:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	i used the gui for automatix and chose vmware from the list
2008-06-02T18:24:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	i installed automatix from synaptic some time ago
2008-06-02T18:25:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	are you using Hardy or Gutsy?
2008-06-02T18:26:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	Gutsy
2008-06-02T18:27:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	you're problem may be automatix related... it has never been a good idea to use it.. I think you're suffering from that.  Without knowing how it's altered your system I can only suggest reinstalling Ubuntu.. don't use automatix in the future.
2008-06-02T18:29:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	say it ain't so. crap. is there no way of uninstalling vmware from the safe mode command line
2008-06-02T18:29:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	unless you can get automatix to uninstall it for you..
2008-06-02T18:30:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	if i'm in safe mode is it possible to use the desktop gui
2008-06-02T18:30:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	automatix makes fundemenal changes to your system that.. as you've experienced.. can be detramental..
2008-06-02T18:31:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	never tried.. maybe sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2008-06-02T18:32:00.000Z	onefunk	scunizi	thanks i'll give it a shot
2008-06-02T18:32:00.000Z	scunizi	onefunk	np.. if you reinstall you might consider separating /home to it's own partition.. makes reinstalling easier without loosing all your info.
