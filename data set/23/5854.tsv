2007-12-11T07:49:00.000Z	cflopez		can someone lend a hand, im having some weird issues with the broadcom firmware on an AMD64
2007-12-11T07:49:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	thats the wireless??
2007-12-11T07:50:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	they are a pain..you can either try fwcutter or try to use ndiswrapper.
2007-12-11T07:51:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	is the driver using fwcutter?
2007-12-11T07:52:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	or is trying to use the native driver some how.
2007-12-11T07:52:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	this forum has been inundated with bcm stuff..which usually gets resolved by using ndiswrapper
2007-12-11T07:53:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	right...the bcm stuff is very propietary..and the g'damn windows driver seems to the best choice
2007-12-11T07:54:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	id dig around a bit though on sites...you'll want that biatch to start on boot. and not have to invoke it once the system starts...there is a write up for that as well...
2007-12-11T07:55:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	that should tell you if the driver is claimed
2007-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	he's right use the inf file instead
2007-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	and try again...but first you need to remove the drivers...by removing them with ndiswrapper
2007-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	you can type ndiswrapper --help
2007-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	you are doing just fine.....this is how you LEARN
2007-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	good luck
2007-12-11T08:07:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	its just the inf file
2007-12-11T08:09:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	refuses to remove?
2007-12-11T08:11:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	sorry now i understand your question...yes
2007-12-11T08:15:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	fo a ndiswrapper -l
2007-12-11T08:15:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	make sure its gone
2007-12-11T08:15:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	as i remember jwd helped you remove it.. and now make SURE its gone with ndiswrapper -l
2007-12-11T08:16:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	then ndiswrapper -i the bcmblah.inf file
2007-12-11T08:20:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	okay...now take it slow..from start...
2007-12-11T08:21:00.000Z	achandrashekar	cflopez	thats what she said...lol
