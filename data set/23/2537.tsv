2010-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	check out the source
2010-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	I did but I can't tell just from the source :-) I don't know enough about the language used, looks like C but I couldn't tell the diff between C and C++
2010-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	you said it was 'eboard', right?
2010-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	yeh, eboard, a chess program
2010-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	see line up the url to download source
2010-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	http://sourceforge.net/projects/eboard/
2010-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	just noticed it says: You will need a C++ compiler and the GTK  2.x libraries (any version above 2.4.0).
2010-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	but does it mean it is ONLY C++?
2010-05-24T07:42:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	looks to me like it's all C++
2010-05-24T07:43:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	C++
2010-05-24T07:43:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	sounds good, any good book/resource advice? :-)
2010-05-24T07:45:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	http://www.learncpp.com/ http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ http://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-Special/dp/0201700735/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1274669099&sr=8-4
2010-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	twow, thanks for the links :-)
2010-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	is the book your favourite?
2010-05-24T07:47:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	favorite? no. But it's the only intro C++ book I've actually read, and the author is something of an authority on the subject.
2010-05-24T07:48:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	the author's bio http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup
2010-05-24T07:48:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	thanks :-)
2010-05-24T07:49:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	if you have zero programming experience, I recommend you start here first http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6B940F08B9773B9F
2010-05-24T07:50:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	I have experience programming php, and object-oriented actionscript 3.0
2010-05-24T07:50:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	it's just C++ looks quite different overall, thanks for the link though
2010-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	Richard Buckland's lectures are good for people with no formal programming training
2010-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	sitwon	gafir	np
2010-05-24T07:56:00.000Z	gafir	sitwon	this introductory course looks really interesting though, thanks: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6B940F08B9773B9F
