2007-11-06T16:26:00.000Z	Russian	redtux	If you are using the gutsy repo version of compiz, it will not work by default with any fglrx driver, including the newly released 8.42., Which is true
2007-11-06T16:26:00.000Z	redtux	Russian	type "dpkg -l xorg-driver-fglrx"

2007-11-06T16:28:00.000Z	redtux	Russian	"apt-cache search fglrx" is your friend... maybe you need to build from source.
