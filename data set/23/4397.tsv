2007-08-24T14:12:00.000Z	numus		Does anyone know how to save settings and data from wubi and then reinstall that in ubuntu?
2007-08-24T14:13:00.000Z	numus		i want to remove my wubi partition.. repartition a section of my 2nd harddrive for ubuntu and get rid of this fake disk
2007-08-24T14:13:00.000Z	numus		stormx2 this is all on a virutal disk.. so it isn't really reinstalling
2007-08-24T14:14:00.000Z	numus		i have done so much alteration to ubuntu to get things to work
2007-08-24T14:14:00.000Z	numus		would be a shame to have to do it all over again
2007-08-24T14:14:00.000Z	numus		stormx2 you know if it is possible to run ubuntu from a slave harddrive?
2007-08-24T14:14:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	sure
2007-08-24T14:15:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	you just need the slave disk in your boot order
2007-08-24T14:16:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	don't instal ubuntu to a USB disk...
2007-08-24T14:17:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	sure, just install as normal and use your slave as your booting disk, grub can tranfser the boot to the first drive if you want.
2007-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	and some bios settings that need to be changed.
2007-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	change the second hdd to be before the first in the boot order
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	grub would have the option to boot windows if you install ubuntu on the 2nd disc
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	yes
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	if you don't mount the first disk you can restart ;)
2007-08-24T14:23:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	true :)
2007-08-24T14:25:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	yes
2007-08-24T14:26:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	yes
2007-08-24T14:28:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	ubuntu is very easy.
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	oh XD
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	I'm in the middle of installing CentOS on my desktop right now so I'm distracted.
2007-08-24T14:31:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	easy. My desktop used to be running ubuntu as a server.
2007-08-24T14:50:00.000Z	EpochWolf	numus	I'm here
