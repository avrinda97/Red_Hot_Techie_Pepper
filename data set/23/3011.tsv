2008-08-31T09:48:00.000Z	mordof		can anyone help me get my webserver configured? more specifically.. i need mail(); to work and i don't know what to get. tried regular sendmail, didn't work (i dno't know how to configure this stuff is the reason).
2008-08-31T09:50:00.000Z	tyl3r	mordof	mail on webservers is always quite complex, just google on it....you will find thousands of useful guides starting from the scratch
2008-08-31T09:50:00.000Z	tyl3r		especially with postfix ;)
2008-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	i've already tried a good number of them, including postfix
2008-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	mordof		haven't been able to get it to work
2008-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	tyl3r		vserver ? root ? control panel ?
2008-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	mordof		alot of them require a bit of extra knowledge though.. they say to configure it, which i don't know how to. this is the first time i've ever tried to get a mail server setup
2008-08-31T09:54:00.000Z	tyl3r		well, you should be careful with it and test for open relay after sucessful install....so whats your current situation ?
2008-08-31T09:54:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	was that to me?
2008-08-31T09:55:00.000Z	tyl3r		yes
2008-08-31T09:55:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	my current situation is i've uninstalled everything that i had previously installed/fiddled with.. and i don't know how to test for open relay
2008-08-31T09:56:00.000Z	tyl3r		you are talking about a mailserver on your local ubuntu system ?
2008-08-31T09:56:00.000Z	tyl3r		or on an external webserver...
2008-08-31T09:56:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	my webserver that's in the furnace room. so php can use mail();
2008-08-31T09:56:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	to send mail to people with php
2008-08-31T09:57:00.000Z	tyl3r		furnace ? sorry im german ;)....
2008-08-31T09:57:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	room with the heater in it in the basement
2008-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	no monitor/keyboard/mouse, etc. ubuntu server install set up specifically for apache/php/mysql.  just want to get mail(); for php working
2008-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	tyl3r		so actually you just need an smtp server listening on that machine accepting mails ?
2008-08-31T09:59:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	smtp server.. yeah i think that's all i need. one that i tell it to send an email to someone, and it does, lol.  no storing of emails or anything
2008-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	tyl3r		so I guess this one is sending mails to internet then...as you have nothing installed right now, did you try this tutorial ? http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect-server-ubuntu8.04-lts-p5
2008-08-31T10:03:00.000Z	tyl3r		should work for your situation...just the page 5 for postfix...
2008-08-31T10:03:00.000Z	mordof	tyl3r	i'll give it a try, thanks
