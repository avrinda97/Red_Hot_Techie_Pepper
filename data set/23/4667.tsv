2009-05-02T02:11:00.000Z	Cammy		Is there any way to stop windows from automatically coming to the front when you click on them? Can I change it so I have to double-click them to make them come to the front or something? It's really annoying only being able to work on the front-most window
2009-05-02T02:12:00.000Z	Cammy		Damn, so Gnome doesn't have the option, I might check out KDE
2009-05-02T02:13:00.000Z	Cammy		The option for windows NOT to automatically come to the front when you single-click them
2009-05-02T02:13:00.000Z	Cammy		It's as bad as MS Windows
2009-05-02T02:14:00.000Z	Cammy		I don't want it to come to the front
2009-05-02T02:14:00.000Z	Cammy		I don't know what compiz is
2009-05-02T02:15:00.000Z	Cammy		Seems a pretty limited GUI system if it forces the active window to come to the front
2009-05-02T02:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Cammy	you could use fluxbox sticky function but that aint really solving the problem just patching it up
2009-05-02T02:16:00.000Z	Cammy		This is an example of what I'd like to do. I'd like to have X-Chat full-screen, chatting away, but I want to have an aMSN window sitting on top, or a video sitting on top, and still keep typing in X-Chat while the other window stays above the X-Chat window
2009-05-02T02:16:00.000Z	Cammy		But every time I click on X-Chat to type in it, it comes to the front and covers those windows
2009-05-02T02:16:00.000Z	Cammy		The only way around it is to NOT have any windows full-screen
2009-05-02T02:17:00.000Z	Cammy	jdu	Thanks, I'll look into it
2009-05-02T02:17:00.000Z	Cammy		I have the "medium" eyecandy settings
2009-05-02T02:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Cammy	i aint too sure you can do that unless what other people are suggesting using compiz
2009-05-02T02:18:00.000Z	Cammy		Okay, thanks. I'm glad there's an "Always On Top" option
2009-05-02T02:18:00.000Z	Cammy		It's not what I wanted, but it's better than nothing
2009-05-02T02:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Cammy	either that or get yourself a tilting wm but that is probably something you dont want to mess with
2009-05-02T02:18:00.000Z	Cammy		It'll essentially do what I want it to do
2009-05-02T02:18:00.000Z	Cammy		But it just requires extra effort every time
2009-05-02T02:19:00.000Z	Cammy		I have a feeling not many people understand what I mean because they've all grown up with GUIs that never gave you the option of not automatically bringing every active app to the top
2009-05-02T02:19:00.000Z	Cammy		Windows and MacOS have always done it, so I suppose when they were coming Gnome they just copied the method
2009-05-02T02:20:00.000Z	Cammy		AmigaOS is the only one I've seen that manages its windows properly
2009-05-02T02:20:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Cammy	I do but not sure its possible the normal way, i have given you suggestion of ways that might do something similar to what you might need, also check the forums and google
