2012-02-10T06:01:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	 should i just paste the whole file
2012-02-10T06:02:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	http://paste.ubuntu.com/835985/
2012-02-10T06:02:00.000Z	crc32		sure
2012-02-10T06:04:00.000Z	crc32		I think you need IN before the {
2012-02-10T06:04:00.000Z	crc32		let me see
2012-02-10T06:05:00.000Z	crc32		mine looks like this
2012-02-10T06:05:00.000Z	crc32		http://paste.ubuntu.com/835989/
2012-02-10T06:06:00.000Z	crc32		The default zones don't show that you need the IN keywords but they quote the word localhost
2012-02-10T06:08:00.000Z	crc32		Is that some kind of unicode representation of a quote? Does bind accept that?
2012-02-10T06:10:00.000Z	crc32	whoever	I don't think bind likes those funky unicoded open and close quotes. Use plain old ascii code 34
2012-02-10T06:11:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	i made the change with IN ad got the same error http://pastebin.com/MEU65y4y
2012-02-10T06:13:00.000Z	crc32		yea don't use that funky open and close quote use "  instead
2012-02-10T06:14:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	the quote also resemble the quotes in your file so don't know what you mean
2012-02-10T06:15:00.000Z	crc32		your quote is unicode character u'\u201c'
2012-02-10T06:17:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	are you saying to chang to u'u201"
2012-02-10T06:17:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	or to use u/22 which is double quote
2012-02-10T06:18:00.000Z	crc32		forget it just replace your qquotes with single ticks '
2012-02-10T06:18:00.000Z	crc32		that will make it easier
2012-02-10T06:22:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	ok, now i get that localhost zone already exists
2012-02-10T06:23:00.000Z	whoever		so is it better to  merge my localhost into the one that already exists or just rename my localhost to something else ?
2012-02-10T06:25:00.000Z	whoever	crc32	now it starts thx for help , now only hope that it does what i extpect
