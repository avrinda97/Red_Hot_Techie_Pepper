2012-10-03T17:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	rkhshm	 the /home/ partition is full or is /home/ not on its own partition?
2012-10-03T17:54:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	/home is full
2012-10-03T17:55:00.000Z	dr_willis		there is a 5% reserved you can reduce for a little extra space ;) but sounds like its time to clean out stuff
2012-10-03T17:56:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	yeah.. i should but from where can i remove stuff if i'm logged in as guest
2012-10-03T17:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	rkhshm	 ive never seen one not able to login with home full. you can try logging in at the console
2012-10-03T17:57:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	i tried .. it just reverts back to the login prompt only
2012-10-03T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis		makes me wonder if theres not a deeper issue.
2012-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	rkhshm		ctrl+alt+f1 did the trick
2012-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	dr_willis		could always reboot into the recovery/rescue mode i guess and look around
2012-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	dr_willis		console worked.. thats a good sign ;)
2012-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	dr_willis		check df -h       to see what is 'full' and how big things are. :)
2012-10-03T17:59:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	yeah doing that..
2012-10-03T17:59:00.000Z	rkhshm		df  -h says /home -> 0% free
2012-10-03T17:59:00.000Z	dr_willis		how big is the home partition?
2012-10-03T18:00:00.000Z	rkhshm		140G <-- /home
2012-10-03T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis		so by default about 5% or 5gb  is reserved ;) you can use the tune2fs command to reduce that %
2012-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis		or just clean out stuff
2012-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	ok
2012-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	rkhshm		but for now i am deleting some data i dont need
2012-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	rkhshm		lets see if it works
2012-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis		check the cache and tmp dirs ;)
2012-10-03T18:02:00.000Z	dr_willis		i forget how to show/short dirs by size used.
2012-10-03T18:07:00.000Z	rkhshm	dr_willis	ok deleting a 21G vm disk did the fix ;-)
