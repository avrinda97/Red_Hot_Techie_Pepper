2007-09-11T15:48:00.000Z	RedMercury		hello - whats an easy way to see what my USB drive is mapped to in /dev ?
2007-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	RedMercury		ive plugged in my iomega rev drive, i can see it in lsusb but i dont know where to mount it from
2007-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	it did not automount?
2007-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	RedMercury	niekie	its not in my fstab
2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	RedMercury		its not a pendrive, its a UDF file system removable hard drive thingy
2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	this is the only removable drive currently connected to your PC?
2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	RedMercury		yes, at the moment
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	try ls -la /dev|grep plugdev
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	how much output does that give for you?
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	RedMercury		zero
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	hrmm..
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	RedMercury	niekie	i wonder if im missing a kernel module
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	could be.
2007-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	niekie		It didn't autodetect it at least, apparently.
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	RedMercury		btw, do you know how i can get and reload the kernel source?
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	niekie		Or it would have tried to mount it, most probably.
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	RedMercury		i come from gentoo land
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	RedMercury		recompile even
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	I haven't really ever done that, so I don't really know, but I am sure it's possible.
2007-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	have a look at the Ubuntu wiki :-)
2007-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	RedMercury		:)
2007-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	niekie		!wiki
2007-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	niekie	RedMercury	those links might help :-)
