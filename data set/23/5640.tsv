2008-05-26T10:30:00.000Z	DavidCraft		i HD on an IBM server.  I was told to try and disable (or bypass) the RAID card and try and install it directly onto the drive.  I have disabled the RAID but Ubuntu still will not see either drive.  Diagnostics on teh drives all check out clean.  DO I need a specific driver or something?
2008-05-26T10:31:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	whats the raid controller?
2008-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	LSI 1030 is the adapter.
2008-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	for LSI Ultra320 SCSI
2008-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	I've never heard of it before.  Have you googled for drivers.  I would but have my hands full with a cranky baby atm ...
2008-05-26T10:36:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	Like I said I disabled the RAID... so would I needs drivers still for the RAID adapeter? or for teh SCSI HDs themselves?
2008-05-26T10:37:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	sounds like the controller doesn't use the standard scsi drivers, or it would just work
2008-05-26T10:37:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	it may be you need to load a non standard module
2008-05-26T10:37:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	hmm i see...
2008-05-26T10:41:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	Meh, I see potential drivers for Suse, Redhat, and windows....  but nothing for Ubuntu.  Is there a way to make these work?
2008-05-26T10:42:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	if it works for redhat/suse, it'll work for debian/ubuntu with some magi
2008-05-26T10:43:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	np np, thanks for the help.  Ill be around lol
2008-05-26T10:57:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	babies down.  what was the link you found to your driver?
2008-05-26T10:58:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	well I found another potential, though the readme wants linux already installed or something... http://www-304.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-56950&brandind=5000008
2008-05-26T10:59:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	yeah, you're going to have fun with this
2008-05-26T11:01:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	any other avenues or aproaches to sugest?  I am almost out of ideas O_o.
2008-05-26T11:03:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	what's the machine again? does it have other driver controllers?  can you add a sata controller to it?
2008-05-26T11:04:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	I had to deal with a install like this years ago and iirc the solution I used was to build the system on another drive, add the needed drivers for the raid controller then transfer the system to the raid drive and boot it back up
2008-05-26T11:04:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	it worked, but it was a pain
2008-05-26T11:05:00.000Z	DavidCraft	izzyb_	its a xseries 335 machine8676.  ANd I can prob ADD a SATA controler but theres no power for IDE or SATA HDs
2008-05-26T11:07:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	yeah, sounds like you're going to have to do a lot of research, but it should be possible.  you may find suse or redhat installs work out of the box since there are rpms for those systems
2008-05-26T11:09:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	np.  sorry I couldn't be more help.
2008-05-26T11:11:00.000Z	izzyb_	DavidCraft	I find it funny that the install instructions for this controller pretty much require that you have another drive to install to
