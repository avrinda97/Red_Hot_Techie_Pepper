2005-07-07T12:51:00.000Z	mig`		hmm, i'm going to need some help with 'cp', there is a way i can have it parse a list of commands maybe? (or copy files from a list) ?
2005-07-07T12:51:00.000Z	mig`		i want to copy over 9 files, with different names
2005-07-07T12:51:00.000Z	mig`		but i have to do it doing: 'sudo cp -rv ....'
2005-07-07T12:52:00.000Z	mig`		hmm, let me try man cp
2005-07-07T12:53:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	if the list of files is in filelist.txt just do: for i in $(cat filelist.txt); do mv $i /path/to/destination; done
2005-07-07T12:54:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	if there is spaces in the filename you want to put the $i after mv in quotes
2005-07-07T13:05:00.000Z	mig`	TPC	not working
2005-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	whats went wrong?
2005-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	you can put an echo before cp to see the exact command its trying to execute
2005-07-07T13:09:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	it doesn't like spaces in paths or filenames
2005-07-07T13:10:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	it doesn't matter, for sees a space as a separator for the arguments
2005-07-07T13:10:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	so it thinks that a new file begins there
2005-07-07T13:10:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	there was some solution to it, but I can't think of it now
2005-07-07T13:11:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	yes, but its still good to learn for next time
2005-07-07T13:11:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	you could put __ or something instead of the spaces, and then use sed to replace the __ with a space in the mv command
2005-07-07T13:12:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	do the files have the same extension or some other special pattern in them that the other files in that dir doesn't have?
2005-07-07T13:13:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	well.. if you want all that starts with vid14 just do /path/to/vid14*.avi
2005-07-07T13:14:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	or some other way, I'm sure there's some way to specify it
2005-07-07T13:14:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	why not?
2005-07-07T13:15:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	for i in in /path/to/vid14*.avi; do mv "$i" /some/other/path; done
2005-07-07T13:28:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	that would work and be really cool because you can use your install with multiple computers
2005-07-07T13:28:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	but only if your bios supports it
2005-07-07T13:28:00.000Z	TPC	mig`	booting from usb I mean
