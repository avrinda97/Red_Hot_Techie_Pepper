2009-03-06T13:17:00.000Z	jumbers		I'm from Africa
2009-03-06T13:18:00.000Z	jumbers		Moron
2009-03-06T13:19:00.000Z	jumbers		So anyway, does anybody know what would cause random slowdowns of my package downloads?
2009-03-06T13:19:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	your ISP hates you?
2009-03-06T13:20:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	have you selected a close mirror for your updates?
2009-03-06T13:20:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	College dorm network. Other things don't seem to do this, only package updates really
2009-03-06T13:20:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	It's not only Ubuntu repos. I'm having the exact same problem with third party ones also
2009-03-06T13:21:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	does your college run a mirror?
2009-03-06T13:21:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	Not that I know of
2009-03-06T13:21:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	check the mirrors list to see if your uni is in it
2009-03-06T13:22:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	Nope, they don't
2009-03-06T13:25:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	I'm wondering if the school is throttling my bandwidth
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	probably
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	do you have another NIC?
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	I'm running behind a router. I was considering changing my MAC address
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	maybe swap your network card for someone else's
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	shared router?
2009-03-06T13:27:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	My own personal router
2009-03-06T13:28:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	probably
2009-03-06T13:28:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	I'm gonna change it and see what happens
2009-03-06T13:29:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	prob it's a mac on your machine more than likely... or both
2009-03-06T13:30:00.000Z	Scooma	jumbers	change both at the same time when you're disconnected from the network
2009-03-06T13:30:00.000Z	jumbers	Scooma	Gah. Changed it and no luck
