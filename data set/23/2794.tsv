2009-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	it uses the same MBR as windows
2009-06-10T09:20:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	which version of grub?
2009-06-10T09:21:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	hmm sorry I don't know which ver is with jaunty...maybe someone else can step in.
2009-06-10T09:23:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	this may help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
2009-10-18T13:22:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	samba4 isn't part of ubuntu..yet, you may want to ask in #samba
2009-11-16T21:33:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	you may want to ask in #clamav
2009-11-17T07:52:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	from what I can glean on your error it may be related to gnome-themes.  Try removing any themes you're using.
2009-11-17T07:54:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	I didn't say for sure ;)  I looked your error and there is a bug one user states: Regarding the evolution issue, deleting ~/.gconfd/saved_state and (if it exists) ~/.gconfd/saved_state.tmp may fix the problem. You can also try with a new user and see if it happens too. If it doesn't then it's a problem with your user's profile. If you can reproduce this error with a new profile then don't hesitate to submit a new report.
2009-11-17T07:55:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	good luck, follow up if it continues.
2011-02-23T06:47:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	have you tried gmusicbrowser?
2011-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	Roasted	Jeruvy	no, but I'd REALLY like to stick with rhythmbox since it does a nice job of playlist handling with my Sansa...
2011-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	Roasted	Jeruvy	I just hate how right now, it picked up 461 songs when there's almost 1200 on here.
2011-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	OK, Can't say I've had any luck with rythmbox  personally.
2011-02-23T06:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	Gmusicbrowser handles my gvfs library without concern.
2011-02-23T06:50:00.000Z	Roasted	Jeruvy	I'm trying it now, but I'm still very curious about rhythmbox.
2011-02-23T06:51:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	I personally gave up on rythmbox
2011-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	I would.
2011-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	Roasted	Jeruvy	I refuse.
2011-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	good luck with that.
2011-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	gmusicbrowser is the only player that manages my library, rythmbox is crap.
2011-02-23T06:57:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Roasted	agreed.
