2007-06-26T09:55:00.000Z	sebastian		Mine doesn't
2007-06-26T09:56:00.000Z	sebastian		I can see it ass a USB device in "lsusb"
2007-06-26T09:56:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	Doesn't mean it has the proper module assosicated with the device.
2007-06-26T09:56:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	How do i solve it then?
2007-06-26T09:57:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	Find the supported module for your device. Google is the best place to start.
2007-06-26T09:58:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	Which USB device?
2007-06-26T09:59:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	Bus 005 Device 003: ID 04c8:072f Konica Corp.
2007-06-26T10:00:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	Is that a camera?
2007-06-26T10:01:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	Yes.. Its a Konica Revio 420Z
2007-06-26T10:03:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	You should be able to just mount that camera and extract the pictures ..
2007-06-26T10:03:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	Ubuntu has that option automatically compiled in the kernel.
2007-06-26T10:03:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	But nothing happens when i connect it
2007-06-26T10:04:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	You said nothing happens eh? When you plug the camera in, does anything happen?
2007-06-26T10:04:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	Nothing other than that it pops up in the list "lsusb"
2007-06-26T10:05:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	hrm... I would of thought it reconized it as a mass storage device. For instance a pen drive.
2007-06-26T10:06:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	you can try
2007-06-26T10:06:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	mount /dev/sda1 /dir/dirc
2007-06-26T10:06:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	mount /dev/sdaX /dir/dirc
2007-06-26T10:08:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	What do you mean with /dev/sdaX
2007-06-26T10:11:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	I mean, you are mounting. That's a manual mount
2007-06-26T10:11:00.000Z	mike3_	sebastian	I'm out for lunch. I will talk to you when I get back if you are around
2007-06-26T10:12:00.000Z	sebastian	mike3_	Thanks, and bon apetit..
