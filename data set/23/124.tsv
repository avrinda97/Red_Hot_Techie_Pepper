2012-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	adamk_	Oran	This laptop likely has Optimus.  If that's the case, you will have to look into a project called Bumblebee to make use of the nvidia GPU.
2012-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	Oran	adamk_	i already did this
2012-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	adamk_	Oran	You can check the computer BIOS, though, and see if maybe there's an option to disable the on-board intel GPU.
2012-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	Oran		but it seems that the problem for bumblebee seems that i doesnt bring in the corrct driver
2012-06-15T17:02:00.000Z	Oran		i also tried the otion in the bios, to turn from switcheble to integrated
2012-06-15T17:02:00.000Z	Oran		both doesnt work
2012-06-15T17:04:00.000Z	Oran		adamk_
2012-06-15T17:04:00.000Z	Oran		did u saw my posts ?
2012-06-15T17:05:00.000Z	adamk_	Oran	Yes, but there's nothing more I can contribute.  I know nothing about bumblebee, and if you had started by telling us you tried bumblebee already, I wouldn't have even replied in the first place.
2012-06-15T17:05:00.000Z	Oran	adamk_	 soory than for stealing ur time
2012-06-15T17:06:00.000Z	adamk_	Oran	Oh, don't worry about that :-)  Good luck.  You might have more luck on #bumblebee
2012-06-15T17:06:00.000Z	Oran		i already was there thoose guys directed my to this channel
2012-06-15T17:07:00.000Z	adamk_		Typical.
2012-06-15T17:11:00.000Z	Oran	adamk_	could u help me with this ? : First, if you are using Ubuntu using version 3.0-1~...ppa1, upgrade to 3.0-1~...ppa2 or newer and be sure that bumblebee-nvidia is installed if you are using the proprietary nvidia driver. A reboot may be necessary.
2012-06-15T17:12:00.000Z	adamk_	Oran	Sorry, as I said, I really don't know anything about bumblebee.  I'm not sure what those version numbers even refer to.
