2009-04-30T02:43:00.000Z	pw-toxic		hi - i just upgraded from 8.10 intrepid to 9.04 and now my system doesnt boot anymore ;(
2009-04-30T02:44:00.000Z	pw-toxic		i'm using a raid system and nvidia card with nvidia drivers
2009-04-30T02:45:00.000Z	pw-toxic		i changed the grub entry from root (0,0) to root (0,5) and it actually started booting, but after some seconsd the following happens:   "Gave up waitning for root device. .... ALERT! /dev/mapper/nv idia_babfbfdf6 does not exist. Dropping to a shell!"
2009-04-30T02:45:00.000Z	pw-toxic		what can i do?
2009-04-30T02:45:00.000Z	pw-toxic		i thinkg babfbfdf6 is my raid driver ?!
2009-04-30T02:45:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	that is your raid partition and its probably correct
2009-04-30T02:46:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	so where is the problem then?
2009-04-30T02:47:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	well do you have dmraid ok installed? do you have the correct root=/dev/mapper... in menu.lst aso?
2009-04-30T02:47:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	i dont know ;) what is dmraid?
2009-04-30T02:48:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	that is the software layer of your fakeraid, see the fakeraidhowto in ubuntu wiki
2009-04-30T02:49:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	how can i get into a console to do some fixes?
2009-04-30T02:50:00.000Z	agruman		pw-toxid, the easiest ways is live cd and then some mounts and then chroot, very well explained in the fakeraidhowto
2009-04-30T03:00:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	the ubuntu wiki says that i need the install cd... is there no possibility to fix this problem without reinstalling ubuntu?
2009-04-30T03:01:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	you dont need to reinstall, you just need to get the machine booted so you can chroot into it. thats what the livecd is for
2009-04-30T03:02:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	ok thx  - but its unimportant which version of ubuntu i have on live cd? because i think i have an old one...
2009-04-30T03:03:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	that should not matter, just make sure to install dmraid once in the livecd as you will need that to see the raid
2009-04-30T03:03:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	thanks - i will look up my ubuntu live cd
2009-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	agruman		just did a fresh jaunty install and "aplay -l" gives me "no soundcards found" however "sudo aplay -l" list them as fine, anyone has some info on this?
2009-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	i've successfully loaded 8.04 from cd, but i dont know how i can change or install anything in my 9.04 ubuntu installation
2009-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic		if i type apt-get install then everything is "installed" on my live ubuntu 8.04
2009-04-30T03:30:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	if you scroll down in the fakeraidhowto you will see information regarding chroot, and "mount --bind  ... aso" after you have chrooted you are in your new install and can fix any grub problems you have, just make sure to apt-get install dmraid first, then mount your raid somewhere
2009-04-30T03:31:00.000Z	agruman	pw-toxic	sorry i cant help you more gotta go
2009-04-30T03:31:00.000Z	pw-toxic	agruman	thanks anyway
