2007-01-17T06:41:00.000Z	Optimus		hey all
2007-01-17T06:43:00.000Z	Optimus		Anyone talkin'?
2007-01-17T06:44:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, the LiveCD is all you need
2007-01-17T06:44:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	Lol
2007-01-17T06:44:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	I'm trying to bootstrap Ubuntu from a minimal Debian system.
2007-01-17T06:45:00.000Z	cyberix		I'm doing this because Ubuntu doesn't support floppy installation.
2007-01-17T06:46:00.000Z	Optimus	cyberix	do you have a CD drive and the bios simply won't allow bootup?
2007-01-17T06:46:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	No. I don't have a cd-drive.
2007-01-17T06:47:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	I have a pcmcia-cd-drive that often fails reading. I can't boot from it, but reading failures during installation are unacceptable so I see no reason in working towards that.
2007-01-17T06:48:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, I agree
2007-01-17T06:48:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, gimme a sec, I think I may have found a site with the howtos of bootstrapping ubuntu
2007-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	Optimus		Gah -- I am supposedly on 3Mbps DSL and I am getting about 1.6kpbs downstream!
2007-01-17T06:51:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, you are using edgy, correct?
2007-01-17T06:51:00.000Z	cyberix		Sarge -> Edgy
2007-01-17T06:53:00.000Z	Optimus		Well I found several threads on ubuntuforums, but it looks like almost everyone ends up with an error 127
2007-01-17T06:53:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix --> http://ubuntuforums.org/tags/index.php/bootstrap/
2007-01-17T06:53:00.000Z	cyberix		Thanks
2007-01-17T06:54:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, this may also give you an idea --https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/FromKnoppix
2007-01-17T06:54:00.000Z	Optimus		Though that is from Knoppix, ergo a CD
2007-01-17T06:55:00.000Z	Optimus		Cyberix, does the laptop have a floppy drive?
2007-01-17T06:56:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	Yes. Thats how I installed Sarge.
2007-01-17T06:56:00.000Z	Optimus		Hrmmm, you might be able to use a floppy dist ( i.e. an entire distro on a single floppy) and debootstrap ubuntu from that using the instructions from Knoppix
2007-01-17T06:57:00.000Z	cyberix	Optimus	I'm currently trying http://linux.simple.be/debian/floppy && http://ruinst.net.ru/ner/debian2ubuntu.html
