2012-09-01T04:16:00.000Z	PissedOff		Any idea how to restore my HD? I installed GNOME on 12.04 and it wiped my drive.
2012-09-01T04:16:00.000Z	PissedOff		After rebooting grub errors.
2012-09-01T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	I'd use your backups
2012-09-01T04:17:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	Explain.
2012-09-01T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	data important to you wil have been copied to a removable storage by you, or to another system for safe keeping....a backup
2012-09-01T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	so if anything bad happens, you can restore the data
2012-09-01T04:18:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	It was a fresh install. After installing GNOME it got wiped.
2012-09-01T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	can you expand on 'wiped' please
2012-09-01T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	a default 12.04 Ubuntu install comes with Gnome desktop by default
2012-09-01T04:19:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	Isn't unity different?
2012-09-01T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	yes, Unity isa shell for the gnome desktop
2012-09-01T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	it replaces Gnome-panel as the default shell
2012-09-01T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	so...how do you mean 'wiped'  you never said
2012-09-01T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	not seeing anything overly exciting there
2012-09-01T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	what do you see when you log in?
2012-09-01T04:27:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	I can't login. Grub errored
2012-09-01T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	then boot to liveCD and reinstate grub2
2012-09-01T04:27:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	I use a 12.04 Live CD and see that my partitions have been wiped.
2012-09-01T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	nothing is wiped at all, just the grub is faulty
2012-09-01T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	as in no partitions?
2012-09-01T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	is it an SSD?
2012-09-01T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PissedOff	you could use testdisk to make the same partitions and fsck them (assuming you know the sizes)
2012-09-01T04:30:00.000Z	PissedOff	ActionParsnip	I know how large they were, but not exactly for one of them
