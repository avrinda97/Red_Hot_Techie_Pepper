2007-04-02T09:26:00.000Z	hidan		okay, i think it'd be a bit easier to tell me apart now. :p
2007-04-02T09:27:00.000Z	hidan		ant: yeah, so hidan is a better nick, i think. ^^;;
2007-04-02T09:27:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: you still having problems after a clean install?
2007-04-02T09:28:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: its still a big problem
2007-04-02T09:31:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: maybe device manager
2007-04-02T09:32:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: you might be able to disable it through iwconfig as well
2007-04-02T09:32:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: do a man iwconfig
2007-04-02T09:33:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	:ohhh i misunderstood i'm sorry, then its ifconfig
2007-04-02T09:39:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: i'm assuming you didnt tell it to do that?
2007-04-02T09:39:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: did you press ctrl+alt+bcksp
2007-04-02T09:40:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: thats not a crash
2007-04-02T09:40:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: something told it to shutdown
2007-04-02T09:40:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: does it happen a lot?
2007-04-02T09:42:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: good idea
2007-04-02T10:25:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: yea from what i know the 15 is a code for a "clean" shutdown, as opposed to an ugly one (crash)
2007-04-02T10:26:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	did you check dmesg?
2007-04-02T10:28:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: that or /var/log/auth.log
2007-04-02T10:29:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: dmesg is for the current time, dmesg just reads whats in /var/log/messages
2007-04-02T10:29:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: yes maam, its all the messages the kernel spits out
2007-04-02T10:30:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: although i dont know that it will help you
2007-04-02T10:33:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: can i have that error again?
2007-04-02T10:43:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: do you have any cron jobs going?
2007-04-02T10:45:00.000Z	ant-	hidan	: it would be crontab, i would look it up to learn a little about it, basically it schedules tasks for your computer to do automitically, maybe something is running and shutting down.
