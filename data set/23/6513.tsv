2006-04-06T05:02:00.000Z	cA1mAn		hello, i have a question: what is the space need to intall ubuntu + ext3 partition on one harddisk? (10GB or more?)
2006-04-06T05:04:00.000Z	cA1mAn		hello, i have a question: what is the space need to intall ubuntu + ext3 partition on one harddisk? (10GB for Ubtuntu and then 10GB for the ext3, is that the miniumum?)
2006-04-06T05:04:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	uh.. your question doesn't make that much sense :-)
2006-04-06T05:05:00.000Z	cA1mAn		so i should install it overall to 10 GB
2006-04-06T05:05:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	ext3 is a filesystem. you create a 10GB ext3 filesystem, and install ubuntu on that
2006-04-06T05:06:00.000Z	cA1mAn	hyphenated	how much space will ubuntu require on that 10GB
2006-04-06T05:06:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	does it matter? the partition will still be 10GB in size  :-)
2006-04-06T05:07:00.000Z	cA1mAn		yes because i need some 3-5 GB to add files
2006-04-06T05:07:00.000Z	cA1mAn		ONE that ext3 parition
2006-04-06T05:07:00.000Z	cA1mAn		ON
2006-04-06T05:08:00.000Z	cA1mAn		ok so i will make 15 GB partition, and how much space will the ubuntu installation take?
2006-04-06T05:08:00.000Z	cA1mAn		or how much space will i have left of this 15 GB for files?
2006-04-06T05:10:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	a standard installation is about 2GB, if I remember right
2006-04-06T05:10:00.000Z	cA1mAn		ok
2006-04-06T05:11:00.000Z	cA1mAn		i'm a bit copnfused, because in this guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo it says on step 7.  to create a partiton of min. 10 GB TWO times!
2006-04-06T05:11:00.000Z	cA1mAn		on 7.5 and again on 7.7, does it refer to the same partition?
2006-04-06T05:12:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	it's a bit confusing, but it's saying something slightly different
2006-04-06T05:12:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	it's assuming your windows install originally took up the entire drive
2006-04-06T05:12:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	and it says "decrease your windows partition by at least 10gb
2006-04-06T05:12:00.000Z	hyphenated		and then later says "create a partition for ubuntu that's about 10gb
2006-04-06T05:13:00.000Z	hyphenated	cA1mAn	does that make more sense now?
2006-04-06T05:13:00.000Z	cA1mAn	hyphenated	ok, so now i have 16 GB of 120 GB (all windows ntfs), so it should work
2006-04-06T05:14:00.000Z	cA1mAn	hyphenated	i didn't understand in 7.5 that it was referring to the already existing WINDOWS partition, thanks!
