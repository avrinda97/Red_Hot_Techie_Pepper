2011-03-18T11:30:00.000Z	qkit		Generalk: if you run fdisk -ll how many partition appear?
2011-03-18T11:31:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	raido : The output is long... what is that website where I can dump the output & give you a url?
2011-03-18T11:51:00.000Z	qkit	GeneralK	how about running this command "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda /media/ntfsdrive"
2011-03-18T11:52:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Same response as when we tried before with just the ntfs argument :-/
2011-03-18T11:55:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	It's really annoying. Even in gdisk it is visible as partition 2 on /dev/sda
2011-03-18T11:56:00.000Z	qkit	GeneralK	if you run "sudo blkid /dev/sda2", what you get?
2011-03-18T11:56:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Nothing at all.
2011-03-18T11:57:00.000Z	qkit	GeneralK	how about run it on /dev/sda ?
2011-03-18T11:57:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda /media/ntfsdrive
2011-03-18T11:58:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	 /dev/sda: TYPE="nvidia_raid_member"
2011-03-18T11:59:00.000Z	qkit	GeneralK	The ntfs partition is riding on top of a hardware raid?
2011-03-18T12:00:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Yeah, ther's a raid controller in the mobo. My main HD is a raid array
2011-03-18T12:01:00.000Z	qkit	GeneralK	what is the output if you run " gdisk -l /dev/sda"
2011-03-18T12:02:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	http://paste.ubuntu.com/581968/
2011-03-18T12:05:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	ntfs-3g: Failed to access volume '/dev/sda2': No such file or directory
2011-03-18T12:07:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Nah, nothing. I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the raid though
2011-03-18T12:12:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	ericy : See, the drive also seems to show up as /dev/dm-0
2011-03-18T12:16:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Again, there's nothing other than dm-0 there's no dm-01 etc.
2011-03-18T12:19:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Oh, cool... there's a gui for parted. :P
2011-03-18T12:30:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	NTFS signature is missing. Failed to mount '/dev/dm-0': Invalid argument The device '/dev/dm-0' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS. Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?
2011-03-18T12:37:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	A floating point exception!
2011-03-18T12:42:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	control          nvidia_ebbedadj   nvidia_ebbedadj5 nvidia_daifaeje  nvidia_ebbedadj1  nvidia_ebbedadj6
2011-03-18T12:43:00.000Z	GeneralK	qkit	Oh well. Thanks for trying
