2010-04-11T09:22:00.000Z	chaorain		Can I get some help please? http://www.pasteall.org/12318
2010-04-11T09:23:00.000Z	chaorain		not a clue whats wrong
2010-04-11T09:23:00.000Z	chaorain		let me try
2010-04-11T09:23:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	chaorain	how did you get that makefile?
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		you cannot rename a makefile.ln or anything like that to just makefile to make it work
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		to compile you first do "./configure", and it will make a makefile for you to use
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		then you do "make"
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	chaorain	shazbotmcnasty	Here is what I'm trying to do. http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Pinnacle_PCTV_HD_Card_(800i)#Drivers
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		then once that's done you do "sudo make install"
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	chaorain		there is no config file
2010-04-11T09:25:00.000Z	chaorain		er configure
2010-04-11T09:26:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	chaorain	that's weird
2010-04-11T09:26:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		I've never compiled anything without a configure file
2010-04-11T09:26:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		I cannot help you here >_>
2010-04-11T09:26:00.000Z	chaorain		yeah,

2010-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	chaorain	shazbotmcnasty	hey I think I figured something out. If you loot at line 4 it looks like I'm missing a system file right?
2010-04-11T09:36:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	chaorain	yes
