2009-08-09T17:27:00.000Z	macgyver_		Rather than post the same question to the bottom of the other 20 same question on UbuntuFormus, does anyone else here have or had an issue with Windows 7 and connectiong from Ubuntu to the sahres on windows 7?  the post that is the same as my issue is --> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1043933.html
2009-08-09T17:28:00.000Z	skapism	macgyver_	have you check whether samba officially supports Win 7?
2009-08-09T17:28:00.000Z	skapism		checked*
2009-08-09T17:29:00.000Z	macgyver_	skapism	negative I have not, but I would not have thought WIndows 7 RC1 would be much different to Vista as far as file sharing goes?
2009-08-09T17:29:00.000Z	skapism	macgyver_	I have no idea, frankly I haven't used samba lately, and not to access Win 7. But yeah, Win 7 is (badly) patched Vista, so yeah :)
2009-08-09T17:30:00.000Z	macgyver_		when I try and "map" a drive in Ubuntu using the "Connect to server option" this is what I get here now --> Cannot display location "smb://192.168.1.150/"  ->
2009-08-09T17:31:00.000Z	skapism		Since one of vista's problems was file transfer over network (horribly slow, they say), it's logical to think they'd revamp that in Win 7. means samba wouldn't just work as it did with Vista
2009-08-09T17:31:00.000Z	skapism	macgyver_	that address pingable?
2009-08-09T17:31:00.000Z	skapism	macgyver_	win7 firewall disabled?
2009-08-09T17:31:00.000Z	skapism	macgyver_	can the win7 computer see ubuntu too?
2009-08-09T17:32:00.000Z	macgyver_	skapism	Firewall open and --> 64 bytes from 192.168.1.150: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=1.63 ms
2009-08-09T17:32:00.000Z	skapism		and win can ping ubuntu?
2009-08-09T17:32:00.000Z	macgyver_	skapism	pinging the other way is fine too
2009-08-09T17:33:00.000Z	macgyver_		smbtree also shows the Windows 7 box, but, no shars
