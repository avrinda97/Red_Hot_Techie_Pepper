2012-03-24T05:34:00.000Z	phillijw		seriously, why do I have to ask how to open a 2nd xterm window? this is nauseating
2012-03-24T05:35:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Do you have a toolbar?
2012-03-24T05:36:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	I have the default setup for ubuntu 11
2012-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	^
2012-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	on the left? yeah
2012-03-24T05:38:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	yepper
2012-03-24T05:40:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Did you right click on the icon?  There should be a box with 4 options.  The top one is "New Terminal"  Click on that one.
2012-03-24T05:41:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	thats not an option. I only have 3
2012-03-24T05:42:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	OK...Go to the top icon, the one that's like a Ubunto logo.
2012-03-24T05:42:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	It's Dash Home
2012-03-24T05:44:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Click on it.  I'm looking for the icon to start a terminal.
2012-03-24T05:45:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	I can find xterm but not sure what to do with it
2012-03-24T05:45:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Click on "More Apps" and select All.  The all is in the upper right hand corner.
2012-03-24T05:46:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Then you're not familiar with the command-line interface (CLI)?
2012-03-24T05:47:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Believe me, you can do more with a command-line interface than the GUI :-)
2012-03-24T05:47:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	oh, I am. Do you know how I can launch a term from the toolbar instead of going through the menus?
2012-03-24T05:48:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	Drag and drop the xterm icon from the Dash Home to your tool bar.
2012-03-24T05:48:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	...I hope this works...
2012-03-24T05:49:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	You may get it after the drag and drop...I hope so.
2012-03-24T05:49:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	doesnt work... oh well, not the biggest deal in the world. I can figure this out later
2012-03-24T05:50:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	k
2012-03-24T05:50:00.000Z	S0C7	phillijw	I believe you're spun around and pointed in the right direction.
2012-03-24T05:51:00.000Z	phillijw	S0C7	thanks
