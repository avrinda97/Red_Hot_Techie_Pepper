2009-08-25T13:40:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 lemme try that
2009-08-25T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	to find files in the pwd and below containing the word fire
2009-08-25T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	you can find filenames containing strings
2009-08-25T13:37:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 what's the syntax?
2009-08-25T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	sudo find / -name "<search string here>"
2009-08-25T13:38:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 if -name "string" it will find the filename
2009-08-25T13:38:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 how about the "string" inside the file
2009-08-25T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	you can use grep for that
2009-08-25T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	sudo grep -R <something>
2009-08-25T13:39:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 i need to use find, cuz grep wont execute because the directory has 400k files
2009-08-25T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	it will execute, it'll just take a while
2009-08-25T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	ok try: sudo grep -R fire .
2009-08-25T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	change fire to what you want to search for, if it has spaces then encapsulate with "s
2009-08-25T13:42:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 cool grep with period works
2009-08-25T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	nice

2009-10-26T12:40:00.000Z	pinoyskull	ActionParsnip	 no
2009-10-26T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	thats why then, get those installed and it will smooth out your flash a lot
2009-11-14T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	run: gksudo nvidia-settings   set the res to anything and click "save to X config file" then run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   and change the resolution to what you wish, save the file and restart X
2009-11-14T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	thiebaude: also gives you a very useful xorg.conf again :)
2009-11-14T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinoyskull	i have to do it that way as my CRT monitor doesnt report refresh rates so I have to populate the file before the driver will load
