2008-05-22T05:20:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	ask again my man
2008-05-22T05:22:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	  I'm running 8.04, and every time I do  a tracepath or traceroute to any fqdn  ie www.google.ca or www.mybc.com I get two replys  I first and last,  the rest 13+ all say no reply.   When I do the same thing from windows I get relys on every hop.  Does anyone have anyideas why this is like this?
2008-05-22T05:22:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	what dns do you have set?
2008-05-22T05:23:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	my router
2008-05-22T05:23:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	so its your router that replies?
2008-05-22T05:24:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	Yes, for the first I'm guessing, but I think the last would be the end site.?
2008-05-22T05:25:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	let me try it on my side. ive never ran tracert on linux
2008-05-22T05:25:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	traceroute or tracepath
2008-05-22T05:26:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	never knew about tracepath either
2008-05-22T05:26:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	can you resolve external domain dns names?
2008-05-22T05:26:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	nslookup yahoo.com for instance
2008-05-22T05:26:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	 yeah
2008-05-22T05:26:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	 nslookup yahoo.com
2008-05-22T05:27:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	think so?
2008-05-22T05:29:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	you think it's a bug?
2008-05-22T05:29:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	no no i was asnwering someone else, sorry
2008-05-22T05:29:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	lol  k.
2008-05-22T05:30:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	tracert for yahoo.com worked fine for me
2008-05-22T05:31:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	on all hops?   I still just get the 1st and 15 hops.   The rest are all no reply.
2008-05-22T05:32:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	on all hops. try out yahoo.com maybe the domain you're trying to get to has a routing issue.
2008-05-22T05:32:00.000Z	louish	Ish_nitti	I just did.  and it's the same...
2008-05-22T05:33:00.000Z	Ish_nitti	louish	weird. let me check something on my side
