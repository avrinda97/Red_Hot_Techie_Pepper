2008-09-30T00:52:00.000Z	nikki_		Hey guys! This is actually a pretty old problem, but I fixed it and forgot about it.
2008-09-30T00:53:00.000Z	nikki_		The latest 2 nvidia drivers listed in EnvyNG don't work for me.
2008-09-30T00:53:00.000Z	nikki_		But the 3rd one (72.something) works.
2008-09-30T00:53:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	the 173.x didn't work for me when i tried them. I'ld recommand to stay with the official repository ones (169.x, working good here with 8800 GTS 320mb)
2008-09-30T00:54:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	how do I get the latest official repo one?
2008-09-30T00:54:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	is it on apt-get.
2008-09-30T00:54:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	i think it is
2008-09-30T00:55:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	if your GPU is recent, it should be nvidia-glx-new. You can check on Ubuntu docs what driver fits most with your GPU, and then remove --purge yours and install those from repo.
2008-09-30T00:55:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	my X server was crashing when i was turning them on, and on system boot.
2008-09-30T00:56:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	for me, the screen was 'flickering' and making crazy artifacts.
2008-09-30T00:56:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	it was same for 96.*.
2008-09-30T00:56:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	what card do you have ?
2008-09-30T00:57:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	thanks for checking, so which one should I install then?
2008-09-30T00:57:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	give me a sec, i'll find you a doc link
2008-09-30T00:57:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	thanks a lot. You seem to be really busy on the ircs. :)
2008-09-30T00:58:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	i'm meant to find some gnome devs to discuss with them about an idea i had (i dont often have ideas :P)
2008-09-30T00:59:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	I see. Best of luck with it! :)
2008-09-30T01:00:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	where exactly would you look for the docs? I can do it myself.
2008-09-30T01:01:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	i think you'll find it on the nvidia site. There are 3 kinds of nvidia drivers : legacy, normal, and new, if i remember well. For each, there's a list of supported cards.
2008-09-30T01:07:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	23:06 < nikki_> An 'i' to the left of a package in the search result list in aptitude means its installed right?
2008-09-30T01:08:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	yes it does.
2008-09-30T01:08:00.000Z	nikki_	SiDi	thanks, sorry for bugging you. :P
2008-09-30T01:08:00.000Z	SiDi	nikki_	you may have to uninstall your drivers in a first time "sudo aptitude purge XXX" if you use aptitude, "sudo apt-get autoremove --purge XXX" if you use apt-get.
