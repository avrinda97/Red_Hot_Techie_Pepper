2005-07-18T13:22:00.000Z	wrtpeeps		hello
2005-07-18T13:22:00.000Z	wrtpeeps		i just have to say, ubuntu is excellent.
2005-07-18T13:22:00.000Z	wrtpeeps		for a new person to linux, this is way better than what i expected
2005-07-18T13:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	if no one else has said it: Welcome to Ubuntu!
2005-07-18T13:25:00.000Z	wrtpeeps	thoreauputic	thanks! i love it, and don't expect to use anything else :D
2005-07-18T13:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	good to hear :)
2005-07-18T13:27:00.000Z	wrtpeeps	thoreauputic	i must congradulate you on a very simple installer
2005-07-18T13:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	heh - don't congratulate me - i'm just a user ;)
2005-07-18T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	the installer is actually the Debian Sarge installer with a few tweaks
2005-07-18T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	some people complain about the lack of a GUI installer... as you say, the existing one is very simple and quick
2005-07-18T13:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	some people have their IRC clients set up with aliases for frequently asked questions ;)
2005-07-18T13:31:00.000Z	wrtpeeps	thoreauputic	how do i install 'gstreamer0.8-mad'
2005-07-18T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	from the commandline, sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-07-18T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	you willl need repositories
2005-07-18T13:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	read the bot's URL
2005-07-18T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	basically you add universe and multiverse for your repos
2005-07-18T13:35:00.000Z	wrtpeeps	thoreauputic	once i have enabled universe, i just do the sudo apt-get thing?
2005-07-18T13:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	first you do sudo apt-get update
2005-07-18T13:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	you should be able to, yes
2005-07-18T13:38:00.000Z	wrtpeeps	thoreauputic	1 more thing, all my mp3's are netwroked on another computer, how do i browse across that network (i can get to it via places/network servers) so i know it is set up right
2005-07-18T13:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	you should be able to use the file manager (nautilus)
2005-07-18T13:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	if it is a windows network, you may need samba support (I only have Linux on my network so I'm using NFS)
2005-09-02T11:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wrtpeeps	tab complete would do it for him automatically
