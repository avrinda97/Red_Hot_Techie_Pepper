2008-01-26T10:59:00.000Z	lucastom		right now it is
2008-01-26T10:59:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	was the 2nd disc you created from the same ISO?
2008-01-26T11:00:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	if it were me i would try redownloading a new iso from a diff mirror
2008-01-26T11:00:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	and try to use a disc with that instead
2008-01-26T11:01:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	first thing that comes ot mind was the ISO could be corrupt or something
2008-01-26T11:07:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	i would say your best bet is just using a donwload mirror directly not using flashget
2008-01-26T11:08:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	yes
2008-01-26T11:09:00.000Z	fatedkiss	lucastom	let me chek for you
