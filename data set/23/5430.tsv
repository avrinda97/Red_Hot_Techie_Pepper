2006-12-02T17:44:00.000Z	St3althy		can someone help me with setting up hosts so all my computers on my network can open internet and type intranet.home to get the ubuntu server homepage
2006-12-02T17:45:00.000Z	St3althy		no one?
2006-12-02T17:46:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	you need to run a nameserver
2006-12-02T17:46:00.000Z	St3althy	graft	go on?
2006-12-02T17:46:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	install bind, play around with configuring it, get all your machines to use that for DNS
2006-12-02T17:47:00.000Z	St3althy	graft	is there another way?
2006-12-02T17:47:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	yeah, /etc/hosts
2006-12-02T17:47:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	on each of those machines
2006-12-02T17:48:00.000Z	St3althy	graft	could i add the ubuntu server to my router dns
2006-12-02T17:49:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	your router runs its own DNS server?
2006-12-02T17:50:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	um, your options are: write host aliases on each one of those machines by hand, or run bind on your ubuntu machine and use it for DNS
2006-12-02T17:50:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	in my experience the latter is somewhat, but not extremely, tricky
2006-12-02T17:53:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	you did that from where?
2006-12-02T17:53:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	um, so looks like your router does do some local DNS
2006-12-02T17:54:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	what's the router?
2006-12-02T17:54:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	model #?
2006-12-02T17:55:00.000Z	graft	St3althy	yeah, you really jus twant to fiddle with the router here... but, sounds like it's already doing what you want?
