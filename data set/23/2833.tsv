2008-11-14T17:57:00.000Z	ValentineXX	jim_p	how to install java in my ubuntu?it is installed by default?
2008-11-17T14:44:00.000Z	jim_p	ValentineXX	uname -r will tell you the kernel if its 64 bit or not
2008-11-17T14:44:00.000Z	jim_p	ValentineXX	and any cpu less that 4 years old can run 64 bit
2008-11-17T14:45:00.000Z	jim_p	ValentineXX	its 32 bit optimized for intel cpus
2008-11-30T17:16:00.000Z	jim_p	ValentineXX	go to Tools > addons > (Last tab with the lego piece) and disable it from there
2008-11-30T17:17:00.000Z	ValentineXX	jim_p	yes i got that, thank you, ubuntu should not include so many useless plugin in those auto searches.
