2009-12-23T15:50:00.000Z	riktking		i need help with ssh
2009-12-23T15:50:00.000Z	riktking		i cant ssh into my server ssh: Could not resolve hostname <hostname> Name or service not known
2009-12-23T15:51:00.000Z	riktking		but i can from a windows box on my network via putty
2009-12-23T15:51:00.000Z	riktking		i dont get it?
2009-12-23T15:52:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	the host of <hostname> is on same network as the one you're using or not?
2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	I suppose your PC and the windows box are on the same network then?
2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	yes they are
2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	so i know i can connect out
2009-12-23T16:02:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	hmm I wonder where the dns resolution failed. whether at your pc or the dyndns system...
2009-12-23T16:03:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	i have used 2 diff machines to login via the same internet connection at the network i am at
2009-12-23T16:03:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	i know its buggin me
2009-12-23T16:03:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	when im on the lan it ssh'd str8 in of course
2009-12-23T16:05:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	maybe checking windows box's putty settings would help. I don't how you're ssh-ing from the current one, but maybe you need to put in the settings
2009-12-23T16:05:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	im using term command ssh <username>@<hostname>:<port>
2009-12-23T16:06:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	which lets me log into a local machine no problemo
2009-12-23T16:08:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	this is on a clean install today
2009-12-23T16:10:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	i have now installed putty on ubuntu and im straight in?? any ideas?
2009-12-23T16:13:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	but since you said even ping didn't work, maybe you have to compare dns resolver instead
2009-12-23T16:14:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	its working on putty
2009-12-23T16:15:00.000Z	syockit	riktking	hmm? you also have putty on that machine. I see... and it's working... now why did ping fail...
2009-12-23T16:16:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	i know im very confused
2009-12-23T16:17:00.000Z	riktking	syockit	i have a way in now, i can x forward, which was what i was after, its not ideal but its a fix. thanks for yours and ActionParsnip1 's help
