2006-07-14T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie		i was seriously put off by gnome-xchat
2006-07-14T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie		it doesn't even have a way to identify to nickserv
2006-07-14T09:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	/msg nickserv identify passwd <-- what is so difficult about that? :)
2006-07-14T09:16:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	right, and it would be nice if gnome-xchat supported some way of sending that automatically
2006-07-14T09:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	I hope you mean ati's control panel, because nvidia makes far superior drivers than ati for linux.
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	actually no, the driver performance itself.  still isn't there yet, but it's improved a lot
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	I have found over various linux distros that nvidia's drivers far outperform those from ati, especially for gaming. For example WoW has all kinds of problems with ati (major artifacts) while with nvidia -- no issues at all. Go figure.
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	hm, i don't do games on linux.  just noticing how much zippier blender is now
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	tho i guess that may also have to do with the snappier kernel in 6.06
2006-07-14T09:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	I'd say its more to the kernel and less the ati drivers.
2006-07-14T09:36:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	i'm just hoping the r300 project can get more momentum, since there's nothing equivalent at all for nvidia cards these days
2006-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	irssi :)
2006-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	how would one do that in irssi?
2006-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	/help ignore
2006-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	no, that's way too simple.  let's say i want to search for everything you've said by filtering the display for only lines containing "fyrestr".  i just want to start typing that and have my display narrow to show those lines
2006-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	you are too spoiled by ajax :P
2006-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	maybe i could write it as a plugin.  god knows i hate the irc protocol enough that i don't want to write a new client
2006-07-14T09:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	I suspect you'd have to enable logging for lastlog to work.
2006-07-14T09:43:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	naw it says no such command
2006-09-08T08:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	that's not what I meant.
2006-09-08T08:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	no, not for everyday use.
2007-11-23T00:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	sproingie	what's wrong with the default manager?
2007-11-23T00:25:00.000Z	sproingie	fyrestrtr	it didn't seem to actually give me any themes when i started using compiz
