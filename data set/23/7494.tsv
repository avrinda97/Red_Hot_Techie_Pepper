2007-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	it is the same but only sold under another name
2007-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	fun, now any details about the error you're getting?
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	nope... it just doesn't start anything when it has been past the part with "press this button to check bios" or what you call that part...
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	nothing about grub?
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	nope :S
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	thats a bios issue and something you need to take up w/ your laptop manuf
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	it only has a _ blinking in the left top corner
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	well the bios works fine :S
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	if that was a problem w/ ubuntu you'd at least be able to boot to cdrom
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	ubuntu doesn't touch the bios
2007-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	yeah i thought so too.. but is there any way i could find out myself what the issue could be ? maybe change the bios to a linux compatible bios (not that i believe that there should be bios's out there not compatible with linux...)
2007-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	that is dangerous and i would not advise it
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	bioses are fairly generic and i highly doubt you have a linux incompatible bios
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	k... the problem is just that i can't return it now since i've "used" it... and i certainly do not want to use windows... just waste of alot of money...
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	well...sorry
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	valberg	rabies	thnx for the help anyways :)
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	if you cant boot from a cdrom something is wrong w/ the bios
2007-08-27T14:05:00.000Z	rabies	valberg	or possibly your cdrom
