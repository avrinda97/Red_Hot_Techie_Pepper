2012-09-05T02:36:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	With Alt+tab, do you know that once you allow the selection to stay on a multi-windowed program for more than about one second, all the windows of that program will be previewed and you just press Alt+tab again to select the one you want?
2012-09-05T02:37:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	and do you know how to go back to the list of all windows when that happens?
2012-09-05T02:38:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	Yes; I press the left or right cursor keys (with Alt still held down)
2012-09-05T02:39:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	You can press any of the cursor keys - whichever is closest to escaping the group of program windows
2012-09-05T02:39:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	like the up arrow?
2012-09-05T02:41:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	somehow, mine doesn't do anything even after keeping for more than 4-5 seconds
2012-09-05T02:41:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	yes... it depends on how many windows there are and their layout... if you're on the first window, left gets you out. if you're on the top row, Up gets you out... etc
2012-09-05T02:42:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	maybe I played with the settings and broke it, I really wanted all Chrome windows across the desktops to have their own icon on the task bar (what do you call that unity thingy on the left?)
2012-09-05T02:43:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	You tell me!
2012-09-05T02:43:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	I know, Unity takes some adjusting to. I screamed at it for months then buckled down and figured out I'd beat the thing!
2012-09-05T02:44:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	I dont have anything against unity. So long it can keep my keypresses to down minimum (and preferably to my left) I am happy :)
2012-09-05T02:45:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	I still prefer classic menus where I can explore and see what related programs are installed on a system without needing to guess their names
2012-09-05T02:46:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	you can, press super button, click on installed software, and scroll through the list, or go to USC and look at installed software categories if you want a sorted list
2012-09-05T02:47:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	press Super+A (a for apps)
2012-09-05T02:48:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	not the same... wastes so much CPU time trying to be fancy... a simple hierarchical menu works fabulously at a glance
2012-09-05T02:48:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	I tried to get used to the "filtered results" part which is closest to what I want, but I ended up installing classic menus applet
2012-09-05T02:49:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	well, I don't think Ubuntu _really_ cares about CPU usage... but I strongly agree with some place to give complete picture of apps
2012-09-05T02:50:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	I know... I've several older notebooks that work fabulously with Lubuntu though... it has style and is light too
2012-09-05T02:51:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	I should've given Lubuntu a try, is it Xfce or Fluxbox?
2012-09-05T02:52:00.000Z	TJ-	sudhi	its LXDE
2012-09-05T02:55:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	ohh, of course, LXDE hence Lubuntu
2012-09-05T02:57:00.000Z	sudhi	TJ-	fixed it, thanks, though I wonder if I can make Unity show all the windows on the sidebar irrespective of their desktop/workspace/max/min'ize position/status
