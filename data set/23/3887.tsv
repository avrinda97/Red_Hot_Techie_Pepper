2009-01-23T18:03:00.000Z	Rencx		How big need be partitions on Ubuntu?
2009-01-23T18:05:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	2-4gb swap (depending on your ram and how big your drive is, 4-10gb / (root partition), you could optonally have a /boot (100mb should be enough) and a /home being about 10gb but feel free to do what you like
2009-01-23T18:08:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	i have 4GB ram i choose 3072mb swap and i have left 317GB how i can brake them?
2009-01-23T18:09:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	also i have hawe swap at the end of hard drive where i need put swap?
2009-01-23T18:09:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	well i would have a / of say 15g and the rest /home, i would also recomend useing lvm
2009-01-23T18:10:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	lvm?
2009-01-23T18:10:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	it is a system that allows you to resize partitions and then grow file systems, you could just start with small partitions and grow them as needed
2009-01-23T18:11:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	so home folder will be for all my files? and root will be for instalation?
2009-01-23T18:12:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	yes, you can also split up your /var (may be useful if you host large websites) and any other folder but you normally just have a / and a /home or just a single big /
2009-01-23T18:14:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	and on home will be all my music and movies and pictures so if i want reinstall Ubuntu they will be safe?
2009-01-23T18:14:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	it is useful to have a seperate home partition, it makes moving to another distro easier
2009-01-23T18:14:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	yes, that's one advantage
2009-01-23T18:15:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	so / will be root and how big i need it?
2009-01-23T18:16:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	4-10 should be ok for a normal use, if you have that much spare make it 20, and if you use lvm you can leave some unused
2009-01-23T18:18:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	for / it need to be at start or end?
2009-01-23T18:19:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	better at the start, it can sometimes help having your first or second partition a really small /boot but that is not normally required
2009-01-23T18:23:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	ok so now i have: sda1-ext3-25GB mounted as / and sda5-ext3-291GB mounted as /home and sda6-swap-3GB
2009-01-23T18:23:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	sda5 is  logical..
2009-01-23T18:25:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	sounds good
2009-01-23T18:26:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	it must be logical?
2009-01-23T18:27:00.000Z	dns53	Rencx	linux does not really care that much
2009-01-23T18:30:00.000Z	Rencx	dns53	Jack_Sparrow: Ty for your help now i will have clan install of Ubuntu whitout Windows :))
