2008-03-02T07:20:00.000Z	Pwhdavey		(Gutsy) How do I download the Python drivers for Chess in 3D?
2008-03-02T07:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	If you install chess with synaptic then you should already have everything it needs.
2008-03-02T07:22:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I have Chess, but it needs Open GL Python stuff to run in 3D view.
2008-03-02T07:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	How did you install it
2008-03-02T07:22:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I never installed anything!
2008-03-02T07:22:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	Chess came with 7.10 by default.
2008-03-02T07:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	So you need to get your video drivers correctly installed
2008-03-02T07:25:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	OpenGL Python bindings and the GtkGLExt Python bindings are what I need.
2008-03-02T07:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	I see that when you try to enable 3d in the preinstalled chess
2008-03-02T07:26:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah
2008-03-02T07:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=427997    suggests trying brutal chess instead
2008-03-02T07:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	Did you install ccsm as well
2008-03-02T07:30:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I'll pass on Brutal.
2008-03-02T07:30:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I just installed CCSM. Looks good. But I don't know how to play with these effects after enabling them. ;)
2008-03-02T07:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	system  pref  advanced
2008-03-02T07:31:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I know, I was in there.
2008-03-02T07:32:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	I know how to enable them, but don't know how to press keys so it will do the effects.
2008-03-02T07:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	YOu want to enable the cube for starters
2008-03-02T07:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	ctrl alt   left mouse button and move mouse
2008-03-02T07:33:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	That is so cool!
2008-03-02T07:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	if you go to the actions tab on effects you can see the keys to enable or kill it
2008-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	Pwhdavey	Jack_Sparrow	What are some critical drivers/programs I should install while I have a working Internet connection?
2008-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Pwhdavey	WHatever you think you want..
