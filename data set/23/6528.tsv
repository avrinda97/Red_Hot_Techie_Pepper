2006-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	Surely rm -rf ~/.Trash-*/*
2006-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	oh?
2006-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	I thought the directories were named like .Trash-username
2006-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	no reason for that, since theyre in the users home-dir, or..?
2006-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	Meh looks like im wrong
2006-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	delete every wmv you can find
2006-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	and never look back. its an evil format.
2006-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	You sure are funny.
2006-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	i speak the truth.
2006-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	pr0n comes in 2 flavours, wma or none.
2006-04-13T06:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	you get your pron in audioformat? haha, nice.
2006-04-13T06:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	first: switch to vlc.
2006-04-13T06:27:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	Tried using that. Didn't work
2006-04-13T06:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	the wildcard would be wm*
2006-04-13T06:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	got the right codecs?
2006-04-13T06:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	VLC only works when i right click the file > open with VLC. And it just closes at random points.
2006-04-13T06:29:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	right click -> properties
2006-04-13T06:29:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	and then tell it to autoplay with vlc
2006-04-13T06:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	kingspawn	Closes at random points.
2006-04-13T06:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	thats weird indeed.
2006-04-13T06:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	try installing all the codecs you can find in synaptic
2006-04-13T06:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	and if it works, start backtracking one by one, to remove the excess stuff
2006-04-27T15:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	Stormx2	"touch file"
