2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	it ight not see the disk if you let ubuntu write to the MBR
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	Well right now, I have no Ubuntu, and XP installed. The thing is when I boot up, I encounter the GRUB bootloader, which gives me an error message
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	yeah, I saw that right after I sent my message.
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	Sorry, I probably missed your message from earlier
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	no problem  I think we were typing at the same time
2007-07-28T12:22:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	what do you suggest I do?
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	I wonder if you're not really booting from the dvd for some reason.  WHat happens if you boot from a ubuntu cd?
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	It works
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	ahh, then it's vista's fault.  I know... hard to believe... windows messing up?  Eghads...
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	I didn't neecessarily purchase my Vista disk... however, it should be able to boot
2007-07-28T12:24:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	haha probably =(
2007-07-28T12:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	Got another drive kicking around?  Have you booted to this vista disk on something else?
2007-07-28T12:24:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	I've never been able to boot vista disks
2007-07-28T12:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	by drive, I mean hard drive.
2007-07-28T12:25:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	were they all, borrowed?
2007-07-28T12:25:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	downloaded xD
2007-07-28T12:25:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	although they should be bootable since I saw a boot folder on the CD. but it just doesn't boot for me.
2007-07-28T12:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	well, I don't know how much anyone in here should be helping you with such a disc, but if you can't boot it on anything, I wonder if the disc is bad, or the dvd drive is bad, or windows tries to boot and sees something funny (like a linux partition) and refuses to continue
2007-07-28T12:27:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	It's ok, but my concern is not the disk. My concern is how to fix my PC with the GRUB loader giving me an error message every time I boot
2007-07-28T12:27:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	Someone had recommended me to get a bootloader on a floppy, but I don't know where to get one. Formating would be a good idea, but I can't write to NTFS with Live Ubuntu
2007-07-28T12:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	oh, well you'd have to google for similar errors, then fix it by booting to the ubuntu disc
2007-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	albert`	craigbass1976	Lol i tried
2007-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	craigbass1976	albert`	paste your grub.conf (or menu.lst-whichever it's called) on rafb or something
