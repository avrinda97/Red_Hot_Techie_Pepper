2011-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	dante123		hi again, changed hd from intel 64 bit pc to amd 65 bit pc...running 10.04.  When i go to boot I get errors like i/o error sda, sector xxxxxxxx and other errors like unhandled error code, result hostbyte:did_bad_target etc.  Any ideas?
2011-11-15T06:54:00.000Z	dante123		could this have something to do with setup of hdd in bios (right now on IDE, could be set to RAID) etc.
2011-11-15T06:54:00.000Z	dante123		other OS windows boots fine and works on same HDD
2011-11-15T06:56:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	checked other rogue devices, such as optical drive?
2011-11-15T07:00:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	disconnected all optical drives.....still getting error that says call trace, bunch of text and numbers....ext4 etc.
2011-11-15T07:00:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	can you try different data cable?
2011-11-15T07:01:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	do you think it has anything to do with raid etc in bios
2011-11-15T07:01:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	is this a pata drive? are you using it in the correct end of the ribbon (not the middle one)
2011-11-15T07:01:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	just in case try another sata cable
2011-11-15T07:02:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	another port even could help, sure disable the raid mode if possible in the bios, and try using ahci or not (sometimes one mode works better)
2011-11-15T07:08:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	which kernel version (or ubuntu release)?
2011-11-15T07:10:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	try lsb_release -a in a console
2011-11-15T07:10:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	maybe a newer kernel works better with that sata chipset... which is why
2011-11-15T07:11:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	don't use the raid thing, just disable it if you can. ahci could help
2011-11-15T07:12:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	same thing with ahci....reverting back to just plain ide
2011-11-15T07:13:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	it is trying to do sata stuff, says revalidation failed, sata link up 1.5gb etc. etc.
2011-11-15T07:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	maybe try a newer kernel?
2011-11-15T07:15:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	dont have newer kernel to try right now...just tried older one and same thing....what was the console command u wanted me to try
2011-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	Artemis3	dante123	depending on your release, you could simply try getting 3 debs from here http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ one for architecture, headers and all
2011-11-15T07:17:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	i dont know how to do what you are saying....cant get on the machine...cant get past the errors...
2011-11-16T06:14:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	u in here?
2011-11-16T06:14:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	calling Artemis 3
2011-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	dante123	Artemis3	ready to try fixing machine again....
