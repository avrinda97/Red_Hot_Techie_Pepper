2006-05-14T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Spec	this is ubuntu, remember we don't do su we do sudo
2006-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Spec	much worse than that - never suggest it in the channel - offer people the wiki and let them work out how to do it
2006-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	Spec	ompaul	i would never suggest anyone to switch into root :)
2006-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Spec	as I like to say, what you do in the privacy of your own CLI is your business, tell our users about wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo and then we know how they are configured
2006-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	Spec	ompaul	i just imply they should be root, or have equivalent-root-privileges
