2009-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	mikesholle1		Hmm, it doesn't work
2009-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	mikesholle1		The only shell script in the root folder of what I unpacked is autogen.sh
2009-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	mikesholle1		I told it to run, but nothing happened
2009-02-04T22:54:00.000Z	mikesholle1		I don't understand your warning Janisozaur
2009-02-04T22:54:00.000Z	mikesholle1		Can you explain further
2009-02-04T22:54:00.000Z	mikesholle1		I just want the option to be able to run Mac programs on my linux system
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	mikesholle1		Doesn't Ubuntu use ext3?
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	mikesholle1		Oh I see
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	mikesholle1		No I didn't install that way
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	mikesholle1		I did a reformat ext3 install because I want the full experience
2009-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	then run terminal (app > accesories > terminal)
2009-02-04T22:51:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	usually it is the file marked as executable (if you issue "ls" in console it should be green with default settings)
2009-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	however beware, unpacking files from tar.bz2/.gz archive in a windows file system will make all files lose their attributes and all would probably become executable
2009-02-04T22:54:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	you have to run it in terminal probably
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	you may lose file attributes on a windows (fat/ntfs) file system
2009-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	it does, but you can also mount your windows partitions
2009-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	cd /path/to/dir/with/autogen.sh
2009-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	./autogen.sh
2009-02-04T22:58:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	no, "cd /home/michael/Desktop/mol-0.9.72.1"
2009-02-04T22:58:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	and then "./autogen.sh"
2009-02-04T23:00:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	then use synaptic to find such a package and install it
2009-02-04T23:01:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	you will probably need to install "build-essential" package
2009-02-04T23:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	mikesholle1	then issue "make" command
