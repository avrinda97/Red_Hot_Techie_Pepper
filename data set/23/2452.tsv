2010-05-07T15:21:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		I have an executable package which works ok, but I have to type ./name after going into that folder everytime I want to run it
2010-05-07T15:21:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		how can I install it such that I can type name directly to run it ?
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	you need to add it to the $PATH
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	Mechdave	but other stuffs installed never need that
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		I just install them and they run
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		like I type ie6 and it opens
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		but this one doesn't
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		its an executable file
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		ie6forlinux
2010-05-07T15:22:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	this may have been installed outside of the scope of the $PATH variable
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		what is $PATH ? :( this is driving me crazy :((
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	yep, need to add it to $PATH
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		I have to type mysql -uroot -p. not -you root
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	easiest way is to add it to your.profile in your home directory
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		hmm
2010-05-07T15:23:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails		will do that then
2010-05-07T15:24:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	Mechdave	but still have to type ./
2010-05-07T15:27:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	if you add the path to the executable in .profile like this --> $PATH:/path/to/executable/
2010-05-07T15:27:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	Mechdave	where can I find the .profile ?
2010-05-07T15:28:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	you might have to create it
2010-05-07T15:28:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	Mechdave	hmm
2010-05-07T15:33:00.000Z	Mechdave	ruby_on_tails	you can add it to the $PATH temporarily by opening a terminal and typing PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory_with_executable
2010-05-07T15:33:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	Mechdave	hmm
