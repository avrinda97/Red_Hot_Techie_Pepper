2005-01-29T15:56:00.000Z	eruin		anyone here know what's the latest point2play version?
2005-01-29T15:56:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	www.transgaming.com
2005-03-19T08:10:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	would you describe the "problem" in more detail, please?
2005-03-19T08:11:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	well, I don't know.. I just see that top reports it using ~10% more or less constantly
2005-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	barely budges 2% here
2005-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	7976 eruin     15   0  7252 1812 1224 S 12.3  0.4  16:15.51 polypaudio   <-- like that since I got into x and started using rbox
2005-03-19T08:13:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	any useful way I could debug?
2005-03-19T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	pull stats output from the polypaudio cli
2005-03-19T08:16:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	how would I do that?
2005-03-19T08:20:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	start polypaudio (it'll be undaemonized), read help or just use stats
2005-03-19T08:22:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	stat didn't give me much info - info gave me a bit more, but you sure that's useful?
2005-04-06T05:52:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	cdrecord, dvd+rw-tools, cdrdao (and associated frontends like k3b and graveman)
2005-04-06T05:52:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	nautilus is capable of burning as well
2005-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	happen to know how I'd burn hoary-install.iso using cdrecord? ;)
2005-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	sudo cdrecord -v dev=/dev/hdc -dao /path/to/hoary-install.iso
2005-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	cheers ;)
2005-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	that assumes your burner is /dev/hdc
2005-04-28T13:27:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	yes
2005-04-28T13:27:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	undefined symbols
2005-04-28T13:28:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9728
2005-07-16T16:37:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	we have to be careful with debian-marillat, because often the dependencies fail to be satisfied on the stable Ubuntu releases.
2005-07-16T16:40:00.000Z	eruin	crimsun	yeah, hoary-extras isnt quite suitable for breezy though ;)
2005-07-16T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	eruin	I certainly hope the distro mismatch ensures that ;)
