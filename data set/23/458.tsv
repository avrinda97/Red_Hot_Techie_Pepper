2011-09-28T03:23:00.000Z	annath		hey all... I have a question. I recently got a new charger for my laptop. The old one was a 90 Watt brick, and the new one is 65 Watts. Windows doesn't seem to have a problem with it, but when I am booted in ubuntu it constantly switched between charging and discharging the battery and popping up notifications about power remaining that get in the way of what I'm doing. Since windows seems to have no problem I'm wondering if
2011-09-28T03:23:00.000Z	annath		 this is some sort of adjustment that Ubuntu isn't doing automatically? (Side note: if I take the battery out and just run on AC power, I have no problems.)
2011-09-28T03:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64	annath	isn't it the official charger then?
2011-09-28T03:24:00.000Z	annath		No, but the one on Acer's website is also a 65 Watt supply, so I assumed that they just revised it to draw less power.
2011-09-28T03:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64		ah ok as long as the wattage is right
2011-09-28T03:25:00.000Z	annath		The computer came with the 90 Watt supply but Acer seems to think that 65 is just fine
2011-09-28T03:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64		no idea anyway
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64		^ that would be most reliable
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64		but.. laptop chargers are dear no?
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64		90 to 65 watts is quite  alot
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64		of difference
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	annath		I actually tried, but I couldn't find another 90 watt supply anywhere
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	annath		:/
2011-09-28T03:26:00.000Z	annath		which was rather confusing
2011-09-28T03:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	annath	it could just be an ubuntu problem. so many peoplle have problems with ubuntu and laptops
2011-09-28T03:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64		in all areas
2011-09-28T03:28:00.000Z	annath		it's got the same output voltage
2011-09-28T03:29:00.000Z	annath		I'll try that
2011-09-28T03:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64		either way, windows works, ubuntu dont
2011-09-28T03:30:00.000Z	annath		Yeah, I know. I'm not hugely concerned with charge speed because I have a newish battery that has good life, so I usually just charge it while I'm in class or at night. I'm just concerned about this flickering
2011-09-28T03:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64		maybe because of ubuntus high power usage
2011-09-28T03:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64		with the kernel
2011-09-28T03:31:00.000Z	annath	Gentoo64	Yep. Which makes me :( because usually it's the other way around XD
