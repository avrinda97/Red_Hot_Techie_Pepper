2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	k, thanks.
2006-08-24T12:52:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	bring up synaptic, and you'll find kde packages to install
2006-08-24T12:53:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Well, as I said: _After installing kubuntu-desktop_ ;-)
2006-08-24T12:53:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	you mean how to you log in to kde?
2006-08-24T12:53:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Yep, I can't find any option on the login screen.
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	at the gdm login screen, there is an option to choose the type of session
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	are you using gdm?
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Yep.
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	ordinarily when you install the kde desktop, it will be added to the list of sessions that appear in gdm
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	let me see if there is a separate package related to that.
2006-08-24T12:55:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	kubuntu-desktop installed without problems, fyi :)
2006-08-24T12:56:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	probably a quick way around your problem is to install kdm (if you haven't yet installed it)
2006-08-24T12:56:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	the package 'kdm'?
2006-08-24T12:56:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	right
2006-08-24T12:57:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Alrighty.
2006-08-24T13:04:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Well, I installed kdm, chose kdm as default there, restarted, got an error about not finding the theme file but now the login screen said "Welcome to Kubuntu".  I logged in and GNOME started.
2006-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	ok, clearly not all of kde is installed
2006-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	Any idea what I'm missing?
2006-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	let me check the kde packages
2006-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	Diabolic	sethk	'kubuntu-desktop' and 'kdm' is all I've installed.
2006-08-24T13:06:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	bring up synaptic, and look at the two KDE sections (KDE Desktop Environment and Kde Desktop Environment (univeral)
2006-08-24T13:06:00.000Z	sethk	Diabolic	I would install everything in KDE Desktop Environment except internationalization files (unless you want internationalization, of course)
