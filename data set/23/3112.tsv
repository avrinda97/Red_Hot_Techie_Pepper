2008-07-23T10:11:00.000Z	michael_		can anybody help me with a processor scaling problem?
2008-07-23T10:13:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	^^ not mike
2008-07-23T10:14:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	in conky and system monitor it shows it running at 800mhz no matter how big the load. how can i get it to run at the normal 1.8ghz?
2008-07-23T10:35:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	my process will not run any higher than 800mhz according to system monitor but its a 1.8ghz processor
2008-07-23T10:35:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	are you monitoring your process while running on the battery?
2008-07-23T10:36:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	thats normal if your doing that on the battery according to your bios settings
2008-07-23T10:37:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	yah mine too...
2008-07-23T10:37:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	in the system monitor, it reports 2 ghz
2008-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	does the sytem monitor report the normal speed on your end when plugged in?
2008-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	oh its when the cpu turns on the fan that it scales the speed too
2008-07-23T10:39:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	when the fan turns off, i get the full 2 ghz
2008-07-23T10:39:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	but when its on, it reduces to 800 mhz
2008-07-23T10:39:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	i guess its to keep the laptop from over heating or drawing excessive power
2008-07-23T10:40:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	hmm thats weird. hey i cant find out how to tell how fast my processor is running in system monitor. my friend that was helping me left
2008-07-23T10:40:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	the system monitor (system -> administration -> system monitor) doesnt tell you the processor speed
2008-07-23T10:41:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	cat /proc/cpuinfo will tell you proc speed
2008-07-23T10:41:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	but not what its running at at the moment
2008-07-23T10:43:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	ok im using conky to tell me the speed at the moment but it wont change from 800mhz no matter what i do
2008-07-23T10:43:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	tell me the output of what running cat /proc/cpuinfo is when you run that in the terminal
2008-07-23T10:45:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	conky only tells you what the processor is doing speed wise at the moment..it doesnt describe what the processor is capable of doing
2008-07-23T10:45:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	it says that cpu 0 and 1 are 800mhz. i dont know how to use the paste bin yet to post the whole thing
2008-07-23T10:46:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	michael_	open the terminal, type cat /proc/cpuinfo and _tell me_ what the output of that is
2008-07-23T10:49:00.000Z	michael_	debian_akroyd	did u get it?
