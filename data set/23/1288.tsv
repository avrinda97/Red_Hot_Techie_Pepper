2010-07-29T05:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	bihari	first that page isn't loading.  second, this is not a c discussion room.

2010-07-29T05:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	bihari	i started programming at 6 years old.  why are you still making excuses?
2010-07-29T05:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	bihari	then buy some books, read documentation online, don't go bugging people in a chat room that has nothing to do with C!
2010-07-29T05:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	bihari	i don't see how that applies to this room....
