2009-06-17T18:13:00.000Z	gburin		hello fellows! it's my first time here, and I'm having trouble with my wireless
2009-06-17T18:14:00.000Z	gburin		today I couldn't find any available conections, but yesterday my wireless was working fine
2009-06-17T18:15:00.000Z	gburin		I've tried to reinstall network manager, also tried to use ndiswrapper as well as proprietary drivers
2009-06-17T18:16:00.000Z	gburin		and in windows xp, the light of the wireless board turns on, but no network is detected
2009-06-17T18:17:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	Try disabling the drivers then reenabling it
2009-06-17T18:17:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	then reboot
2009-06-17T18:17:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	how do I do it?
2009-06-17T18:20:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	until yesterday, this drivers were disabled and the wireless was working fine, but today when I turned on my laptop in the beginning it detected, but didn't connected, but after a while, it stopped detecting
2009-06-17T18:21:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	it sounds like hardware problems, right?
2009-06-17T18:24:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	yes, that may be a hardware issue, although I wouldnt condemn it just yet
2009-06-17T18:25:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	maybe try it on a different system
2009-06-17T18:25:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	i have tried all those things that i said.... the only different thing i did was to install and uninstall gufw, a firewall... ah, and uninstalling gwibber, a microblogging client
2009-06-17T18:26:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	i tried in windows xp, the light of the wireless board turns on, but it doesn't detect any network
2009-06-17T18:28:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	then I would be pretty inclined to throwing it out the window =P
2009-06-17T18:29:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	the good part is that it's still guaranteed by sony and the store
2009-06-17T18:30:00.000Z	rsr	gburin	the go for it... its a vaio?
2009-06-17T18:30:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	i think i will take it to the authorized support
2009-06-17T18:30:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	yes
2009-06-17T18:30:00.000Z	gburin	rsr	VGN-NR330AE
