2005-07-22T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	chris_	sudo passwd root, enter your user password (if it asks), then enter the new root password
2006-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	nickrud	chris_	first, by looking for the equivalent deb file
2006-03-28T16:04:00.000Z	nickrud	chris_	then download the non-rpm, and unpack it, as the factoid said

2006-06-16T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	chris_	if you're on i386, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15786 is nice, libdvdcss & w32codecs are an apt-get away
