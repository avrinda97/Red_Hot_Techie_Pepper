2009-08-07T01:16:00.000Z	Slart	osx5	if you start with that you can add whatever you need.. and leave out the stuff you don't want
2009-08-07T01:16:00.000Z	osx5	Slart	ty
2009-08-07T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	osx5	hmm.. I don't really know... never used it myself.. but I think you'll get a base system.. without X/gnome/kde and such.. if you install "build-essential" it will pull in the compiler, linker and so on..
2009-08-07T01:19:00.000Z	osx5	Slart	k I just want to be able to have wifi and all that stuff working ahead of time if i can
2009-08-07T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	osx5	oh.. I have no idea what you'd need for that.. wifi is black magic to me..I'm just happy it works on my laptop
2009-08-07T01:20:00.000Z	osx5	Slart	Im guessing some sort of driver set
2009-08-07T01:21:00.000Z	osx5	Slart	You think i'd be better off just get xubuntu and installing icewm or another WM on that?
2009-08-07T01:22:00.000Z	Slart	osx5	I think it would be less work for you, yes =)
2009-08-07T01:22:00.000Z	osx5	Slart	I'll probably do that then
