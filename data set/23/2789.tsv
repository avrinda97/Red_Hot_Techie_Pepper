2010-04-11T06:53:00.000Z	calum		OK my internet connection is still repeatedly dropping. It must be the config on here. Anyone help?
2010-04-11T06:53:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	wifi?
2010-04-11T06:53:00.000Z	calum	vegar_	Yes, wireless router with dhcp server
2010-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	I had a wireless router which did that all the time, I updated the firmware.. problem solved
2010-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	check the logs, do "tail /var/log/messages" .. see what happens when it drops
2010-04-11T06:57:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	yeah, it could give you a clue about what's happening.. it's probably either your router or your wifi driver, either case you're kind of bummed until a new driver/firmware comes out :/
2010-04-11T06:58:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	then it might be your wifi controller.. do "lspci" and search for your wifi controller to see if someone else has problems
2010-04-11T07:01:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	good luck, stuff like that is not fun.. it should "just work"
2010-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	is it madwifi?
2010-04-11T07:04:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	what driver then?
2010-04-11T07:08:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	do "lsmod" see if you can find anything resembling a wifi driver, like e.g ath9k
2010-04-11T07:09:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	then that's your wifi driver
2010-04-11T07:10:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	check out this project: http://madwifi-project.org/
2010-04-11T07:10:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	maybe they have a better/more recent driver
2010-04-11T07:10:00.000Z	calum	vegar_	Thanks, I will have a look
2010-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	tried the new blender alpha ver?
2010-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	blender really is the bestest most awesomest out there!
2010-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	it has multiple import/export formats, so .. yes? :p
2010-04-11T07:37:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	if you know c++, you'll learn python in minutes.. and you'll be loving every minute
2010-04-11T07:37:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	anywho, only nonstandard imports/exports will be scripted externally
2010-04-11T07:39:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	I dont work much with animations, but entire movies have been made with blender
2010-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	To be honest, I don't know everything about blender but check out Blender Game Engine
2010-04-11T07:42:00.000Z	vegar_	calum	Try YoFrankie, it's been made with blender game engine
