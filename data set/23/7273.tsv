2005-09-16T12:25:00.000Z	NiLz		hm, can't upgrade firefox with apt
2005-09-16T12:26:00.000Z	NiLz		http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2072
2005-09-16T12:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	maybe use the hoary-backports served from archive.ubuntu.com instead? or don't use hoary-backports at all ?
2005-09-16T12:29:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	could you give me the requirede lines for sources.list please?
2005-09-16T12:29:00.000Z	NiLz		so I shouldn't use unofficial backports at all?
2005-09-16T12:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	look here: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/969
2005-09-16T12:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	line 26
2005-09-16T12:31:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	yep, thanks
2005-09-16T12:31:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	what about hoary-extras?
2005-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	NiLz		should I use it?
2005-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	i don't; you could temporarily enable it if you need something specific, and then disable it again afterwrds
2005-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	HappyFool		!tell firebird619 about repos
2005-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	ok, these links you gave me do not work :(
2005-09-16T12:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	you need to 'uncomment' the lines (remove the # at the beginning)
2005-09-16T12:34:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	of course
2005-09-16T12:34:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	did that
2005-09-16T12:34:00.000Z	NiLz		http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2074
2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	also, i don't know if hoary-backports is up-to-date or not; perhaps it's gotten out of sync
2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	in which case the easiest option is to disable hoary-backports
2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	ok
2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	NiLz	HappyFool	but I can't upgrade my firefox :(
2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	i'm running version 1.0.6 from standard hoary repositories
2005-09-16T12:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	NiLz	sorry, i must be off now; i hope someone else can help you.
