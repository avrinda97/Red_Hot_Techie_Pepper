2006-07-31T13:57:00.000Z	LGKeiz		Why does Ubuntu lag on vmware, I have 1GB of RAM / nVidia G-force 6800 any idea?
2006-07-31T13:57:00.000Z	LGKeiz		I gave it 800MB ram >.>
2006-07-31T13:58:00.000Z	LGKeiz		I have a 2.49GHz - P4
2006-07-31T13:59:00.000Z	LGKeiz		like If I open multi stuff, like Firefox, Konversation, and skype it lags when you open things, also minimizing things are slow.
2006-07-31T14:01:00.000Z	LGKeiz		One more question, could anyone help me compile/install realvnc, It saids Im missing libs ( I'm new too *nix )
2006-07-31T14:02:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	install using synaptic, no need to compile
2006-07-31T14:02:00.000Z	LGKeiz	sethk	o.o
2006-07-31T14:02:00.000Z	LGKeiz	sethk	any guide to that?
2006-07-31T14:03:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	just run synaptic, use the search function, type in vnc.  It will show you the available vnc packages
2006-11-07T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	using sudo?  sudo iwconfig ............
2006-11-07T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	wireless is ethernet, at least in this case.  wireless extension to ieee ethernet standard.
2006-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	I imagine everyone
2006-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	LGKeiz	sethk	- uhm Whats new in Edgy?
2006-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	no idea, too new for me to worry about.
2006-11-10T06:29:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	unanswerable, really
2006-11-10T06:29:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	osx has some very nice features, but I'm concerned about it's stability
2006-11-10T06:29:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	because the value of various features is very subjective
2006-11-10T06:30:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	not a question of the number of features, in fact, linux has more features than osx
2006-11-10T06:30:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	well, that's not really true, since you can run KDE and gnome under osx
2006-11-10T06:31:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	osx has a very nice feature that shrinks all the windows down to the point where you can see them all on the screen at once.  Some people say they don't want to live without it.  Other people say they never even use it.
2006-11-10T06:33:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	I'm not a gamer.  that's a good example; for me, gaming is not an issue.  I know that for many people it's important.
2006-11-10T06:35:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	well, to be fair, linux isn't responsible for that, the wireless protocol is.
2006-11-10T06:35:00.000Z	sethk	LGKeiz	but it's true that if it were poorly done, linux could screw it up, and it isn't screwed up  :)
