2007-05-05T12:59:00.000Z	robert98374		anyone know of a guide to install nautilus scripts for newbs?
2007-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	you can use nautilus-script-manager, though it's still cli I believe
2007-05-05T13:01:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	also see http://www.gnome.org/learn/users-guide/latest/gosnautilus-440.html
2007-05-05T13:02:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	ok thanks illl check that out but where do i find the information on   nautilus-script-manager?
2007-05-05T13:03:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	well I just tried it and it only manages nautilus-script-audio-convert and nautilus-script-collection-svn (pacakges you can install) so it's probably not what you want.  Easier to just copy yours to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
2007-05-05T13:04:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	ok will try that too
2007-05-05T13:07:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	total brain fart- where can i find the .gnome folder?
2007-05-05T13:08:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	or to that folder specificly cause i am not finding it
2007-05-05T13:10:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	it's .gnome2.  It is in your home directory but you need to go to  view > show hidden files
2007-05-05T13:11:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	thanks
2007-05-05T13:11:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	you may need to create nautilus-scripts inside there yourself
2007-05-05T13:14:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	i put it in the folder how do i make it so i can use it?
2007-05-05T13:15:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	did you make sure it was "executable"?
2007-05-05T13:15:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	sorry i am really new to Linux how do i do that?
2007-05-05T13:16:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	right click > properties > permisions
2007-05-05T13:17:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	on the script or on the ISO?
2007-05-05T13:17:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	script
2007-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	sorry i mean it still nothign
2007-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	restart nautilus
2007-05-05T13:20:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	sorry how do i do that? restart gnome completely? (log off/ctrl+alt+backspace)?
2007-05-05T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	'killall nautilus' ina  terminal should do it
2007-05-05T13:23:00.000Z	robert98374	jrib	thanks that made it work
2007-05-05T13:23:00.000Z	jrib	robert98374	k, in the future you should only need to visit ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ in nautilus for the menu to be updated
