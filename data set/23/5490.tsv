2009-05-18T22:13:00.000Z	hkais		anyone here who uses successfully ubuntu 32 bit with 4 GB RAM and the nvidia prop. driver? I am trying to use the server kernel (for the 4GB) but xorg will not start until I switch back to generic kernel.
2009-05-18T22:13:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	I think you'll find it easier to go with 64bit
2009-05-18T22:14:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	no I tried it but I had too much troubles with my IDEs
2009-05-18T22:14:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	x64 isn't as stable as they promise
2009-05-18T22:15:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	ok.. I guess I'll have to give my box a kick then.. it isn't living up to the expectations
2009-05-18T22:20:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	haven't got it?
2009-05-18T22:20:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	huh?
2009-05-18T22:21:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	ah.. I'm already running 64bit ubuntu..
2009-05-18T22:21:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	but apparently I'm not getting the full experience.. mine is just boring stable =)
2009-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	are you running with compiz?
2009-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	yup
2009-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	with proprietary driver?
2009-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	yup
2009-05-18T22:23:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	with extra visual effects?
2009-05-18T22:24:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	well.. I'm not to much into writing with fire and spinning cubes.. I've customized my effects.. I use the expose stuff and some window animations and that's about it
2009-05-18T22:24:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	but I have tried out the effects.. I just think they get in the way of actually.. doing stuff =)
2009-05-18T22:25:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	okay I had also the effects activated und 8.10 and 9.04. The support under itrepid is much better under x64 but not as stable as with 32bit
2009-05-18T22:26:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	what graphics card are you using?
2009-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	nvidia
2009-05-18T22:28:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	I have a nvidia 8800gtx.. not sure if it makes a difference though
2009-05-18T22:29:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	Quadro NVS 140M on my side. A mobile nvidia
2009-05-18T22:30:00.000Z	hkais	Slart	anyway i had much problems with my IDEs and also with the graphics, but the most pain came from my IDEs (Java)
2009-05-18T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	hkais	well.. let's hope they improve whatever it is that is causing the mess
