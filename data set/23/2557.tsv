2009-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	thomas1978c		no, it's a codec/playback issue
2009-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	what's up. what's happening?
2009-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	thomas1978c		video files of all types stutter
2009-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	not flash specifically?
2009-01-31T11:31:00.000Z	thomas1978c	izinucs	yes they flash at about half second intervals
2009-01-31T11:32:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	no.. I mean flash based videos.. only those or other videos too based in h.264 or avi or mpeg4 etc.. ALL of them or just flash?
2009-01-31T11:33:00.000Z	thomas1978c		﻿izinucs: ﻿hi there, im having issues with video playback. its stutters and wants to leave the window when it gets dragged by the mouse cursor.  I have loaded: amarok, codeine, elisa media center, kmplayer and totem. the audio players work fine. but I think I am missing something somewhere. files I have played in the player/s: .avi .divx, .mp4, all get funky during playback.....helpers???
2009-01-31T11:34:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	do you have any restricted video drivers installed? like nvidia or ati?
2009-01-31T11:34:00.000Z	thomas1978c	izinucs	ati, using ****ng
2009-01-31T11:35:00.000Z	thomas1978c		tritium< I got that already
2009-01-31T11:36:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	not saying it is and not saying it isn't but .. maybe it the latest greatest driver the ****ng installed.. or something that ****ng didn't configure correctly
2009-01-31T11:36:00.000Z	thomas1978c	izinucs	it's the only thing that has worked for my ati integrated 3200hd card
2009-01-31T11:36:00.000Z	thomas1978c		ati drivers won't do it
2009-01-31T11:37:00.000Z	izinucs	thomas1978c	sort of.. might be the next release will give you better support.. I have issues with my motherboard.. I have to have pci=nomsi in the kernel line even to boot.
