2007-10-22T06:31:00.000Z	Bensa		Can anyone assist me with installing Ubuntu 7.10?  It loads from disc.  I click on "install" on the desktop, go through selecting a language etc, but when it gets to the part about partitioning the harddrive, it doesn't display my harddrive.  Any ideas? (There's a hard drive.)

2007-10-22T06:32:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	yes
2007-10-22T06:32:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	reboot, do a checkdisk, reboot cleanly _twice_, and then try installing again
2007-10-22T06:34:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	there's no OS on it anymore.  It was a blank HD
2007-10-22T06:34:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	ahhh
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	ah?
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	this is a new one for me :)

2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	 *lol*
2007-10-22T06:36:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	in a terminal, does anything show up for ls /dev/hd* /dev/sd* ?
2007-10-22T06:36:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	I have no idea.  Lemme check
2007-10-22T06:39:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	well, I'll check once it boots from disc again.
2007-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	that command didn't work
2007-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	it didn't show anything
2007-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	are you sure the drive is connected, detected in the bios, etc?
2007-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	no, it told me that there's no such command.
2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	ls?
2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	Drive is connected, detected, etc.
2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	ls /dev/hd right?
2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	ls /dev/sd* /dev/hd*
2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	Bensa	cwillu	all one line, correct?
2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	cwillu	Bensa	yes
