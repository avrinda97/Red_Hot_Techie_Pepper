2006-12-03T17:18:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		Hi. I'm running Kubuntu Edgy, and my SD card read (USB) runs great, apps auto-mount it and everything, except that it's read only, despite me having full permissions. Any ideas?

2006-12-03T17:21:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	hrm.. let me try an SD in my laptop
2006-12-03T17:21:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001	SuperQ	thanks. It's odd, because really, it works great. Just can't write/delete/etc

2006-12-03T17:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	I just put my SD card from my cell phone into my Thinkpad's internal SD slot
2006-12-03T17:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	and was able to write no issue
2006-12-03T17:22:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001	SuperQ	Well, then, give my your laptop, Mr. "Works for me!"
2006-12-03T17:22:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		;)
2006-12-03T17:23:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	haha
2006-12-03T17:23:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	just to verify, the photo I copied to the SD card shows up when I put it back in my phone
2006-12-03T17:24:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001	SuperQ	Joking aside, any ideas, maybe? I don't know crap about USB device handling or whatnot, let alone about this in particular
2006-12-03T17:24:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	best thing you can do is open a terminal and look at the output of dmesg
2006-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	or if you don't know what to look for, do this from a terminal
2006-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	dmesg > ColonelPanic001.txt
2006-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001	SuperQ	Just did that, getting a filesystem panic. Mind if I PM a few lines to you?
2006-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ColonelPanic001	and mail it to superq@gmail.com
2006-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		Or that. heh
2006-12-03T17:26:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001	SuperQ	pastebin'ing it. Soon as this site actually does something...
2006-12-03T17:26:00.000Z	SuperQ		oh.. hehe
2006-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	SuperQ		i forget about pastebin
