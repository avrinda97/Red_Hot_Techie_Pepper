2007-03-21T10:18:00.000Z	nekomancer		hyper: perhaps try chmod 774 [path]  ;  this would make root and group run, read and write while others only may look at it.
2007-03-21T10:19:00.000Z	nekomancer		hyper: is it owned by root?  you may need to sudo the comand
2007-03-21T10:20:00.000Z	nekomancer		Hyper: i can't get su to work in ubuntu
2007-03-21T10:21:00.000Z	nekomancer		only three 7's
2007-03-21T10:21:00.000Z	nekomancer		chmod 777 -spam-
2007-03-21T10:21:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	three sevens didn't work either
2007-03-21T10:23:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	yes but i need to execute
2007-03-21T10:23:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	and i can't make new files or folders in the directory
2007-03-21T10:26:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	that's not really what i was going for. it's a very large directory
2007-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	is there a reason that the file permissions wouldn't change?
2007-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	it doesn't give me any errors
2007-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	yes
2007-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	777 should make it writable then?
2007-03-21T10:32:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	sure
2007-03-21T10:36:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	thanks for your help. Do you use an irc client with autonick completion?
2007-03-21T10:37:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	type half of my nick with proper caps and push tab
2007-03-21T10:38:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	no prob, it makes the line change colors and beep or whatever so that people know you're talking to them:)
2007-03-21T10:38:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	thx for the site.. i'll go read
2007-03-21T10:38:00.000Z	nekomancer	Hyper-cool	have fun
2007-03-21T10:55:00.000Z	nekomancer	Hyper-cool	you need to recursive it again, i think
2007-03-21T10:56:00.000Z	nekomancer	Hyper-cool	-R once more
2007-03-21T10:58:00.000Z	nekomancer	Hyper-cool	you need the -R because it is a folder, i think.
2007-03-21T10:59:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	nekomancer	i tried with -R as well and i just get "not permitted" errors for all files
