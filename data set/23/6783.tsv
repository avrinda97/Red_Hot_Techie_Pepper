2007-10-23T08:54:00.000Z	Clutchsama		 hello all
2007-10-23T08:55:00.000Z	Clutchsama		anyone familiar with the install process on ppc macs around?
2007-10-23T08:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	whats wrong?
2007-10-23T08:58:00.000Z	Clutchsama		looking for install help...anyone?  anywhere better i should look?
2007-10-23T08:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	what help do you need ?
2007-10-23T08:59:00.000Z	Clutchsama		i'm about to attempt my first ubuntu install on my mac g5...have any of you done that?
2007-10-23T09:00:00.000Z	Clutchsama		i'm a little leary of just partitioning my drive as i haven't been able to boot any of the live CDs
2007-10-23T09:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	believe you need to put the cd in and hold down the C till the cd boots
2007-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	Clutchsama		should have mentioned...i tried everything to get gutsy going in text with no luck
2007-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	Clutchsama		i'm now trying to get feisty installed
2007-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	Clutchsama		thanks for helping btw
2007-10-23T09:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	can you get the cd to boot at all?
2007-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	Clutchsama		idle: i've been able to boot into the feisty installer, but nothing else
2007-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	Clutchsama		gutsy i couldn't get past a corrupt loading bar
2007-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	well you can install fiesty and then upgrade to gutsy
2007-10-23T09:04:00.000Z	Clutchsama		my main concern is that if i go through with the install, and feisty doesn't work i'll have issues reinstalling osx
2007-10-23T09:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	let the install partition for you
2007-10-23T09:04:00.000Z	IdleOne		!raid | Humpy
2007-10-23T09:04:00.000Z	Clutchsama		if i let ubuntu take care of the partitioning, os x will be ok to install after?
2007-10-23T09:05:00.000Z	IdleOne		!dualboot | Clutchsama
2007-10-23T09:05:00.000Z	Clutchsama	mrunagi	nope, just that i'm really new and a little caution
2007-10-23T09:05:00.000Z	Clutchsama		thx ubotu
2007-10-23T09:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	Clutchsama	take a look at the yaboot link and you should be ok
