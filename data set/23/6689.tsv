2006-01-27T09:49:00.000Z	idefix_		any VI-techies here?
2006-01-27T09:50:00.000Z	pedrog	idefix_	know a bit about vi
2006-01-27T09:50:00.000Z	idefix_	pedrog	can you open two files in VI?
2006-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	pedrog		idefix - you running gvim or vim?  in a single window you cat do an :sp
2006-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	pedrog		idefix: then :o a new file
2006-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	idefix_	pedrog	just vi
2006-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	idefix_	pedrog	should I have typed vim instead? or even gvim?
2006-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	pedrog		idefix: sp splits the screen then you can open tow files
2006-01-27T09:52:00.000Z	pedrog		idefix: vi is usually vim - just open in the terminal - gvim pops a new window
2006-01-27T09:53:00.000Z	pedrog	idefix_	not sure if gvim is installed by default - called something like vim-x11 in synaptic
2006-01-27T09:53:00.000Z	idefix_	pedrog	how do I switch to the other window inside vi?

2006-01-27T10:08:00.000Z	pedrog	idefix_	must be a windows text file
2006-01-27T10:10:00.000Z	pedrog	idefix_	windows puts in an extra symbol at the end of a line
2006-01-27T10:11:00.000Z	idefix_	pedrog	but if I edit it doesn't do so at the new lines but it doesn't seem to matter?? what is this nonsensical stuff all about?
