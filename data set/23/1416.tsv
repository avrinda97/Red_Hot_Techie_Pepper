2010-04-09T22:30:00.000Z	Serverboost		Hey guys, I am busy with a PXE boot using preseed, but it keeps getting stuck on "Detect and mount CD-ROM), how can the CD-ROM check be disabled? There's no CD-ROM available on the server.
2010-04-09T22:31:00.000Z	thevishy	Serverboost	: seems like u need to configure installation via a webserver
2010-04-09T22:32:00.000Z	Serverboost	thevishy	what you mean? It's a PXE boot
2010-04-09T22:33:00.000Z	thevishy		i suppose u need to mount a installation cd probably on ur server and tell the pxe client so
2010-04-09T22:33:00.000Z	thevishy		what pxe procedure are u following , maybe u shud say thatr
2010-04-09T22:33:00.000Z	Serverboost	thevishy	no you dont understand :) installation goes fine, but when going through the steps it gets stuck on Detect and mount CD-ROM
2010-04-09T22:33:00.000Z	Serverboost		I need to find a way to skip that step
2010-04-09T22:34:00.000Z	Serverboost		It's a network boot
2010-04-09T22:34:00.000Z	thevishy		pxe i see , probably then i got u wrong
2010-04-09T22:34:00.000Z	thevishy		i did a PXE boot just about now :)
2010-04-09T22:35:00.000Z	Serverboost	thevishy	u got any clue?
2010-04-09T22:35:00.000Z	thevishy		jnb : source.list is configured to use my local computer to install .... like 192.168.0.112
2010-04-09T22:36:00.000Z	thevishy	Serverboost	: till what level does the pxe boot proceed ? does it ask u to enter information like Ubuntu Archive Mirror address
2010-04-09T22:37:00.000Z	Serverboost	thevishy	first steps go fine, selecting language etc... then it gets stuck that it cannot find a CD-rom (normal, because it's a network boot) and it asks to load CD-rom drivers
2010-04-09T22:37:00.000Z	Serverboost		I need to know how to SKIP that step, that it doesnt detect it
2010-04-09T22:37:00.000Z	Serverboost		It's the 3rd menu option  "Detect and mount CD-ROM"
2010-04-09T22:38:00.000Z	thevishy	Serverboost	: oh u have such an option ....
2010-04-09T22:38:00.000Z	Serverboost		Or I need another version of Ubuntu?
2010-04-09T22:38:00.000Z	Serverboost		I downloaded server version, is there a netinstall?
2010-04-09T22:38:00.000Z	thevishy		i use netboot
2010-04-09T22:39:00.000Z	thevishy		u download netboot directory from ubuntu server ...copy the ubuntu-installed directory / pxelinux.0 and pxelinux.cfg folders to tftp home directory
2010-04-09T22:40:00.000Z	thevishy		google,.com
2010-04-09T22:46:00.000Z	Serverboost	thevishy	it worked with the netboot,it was not present by default but I uploaded it now and now it works, thank you :)
