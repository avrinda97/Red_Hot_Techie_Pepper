2005-06-20T11:47:00.000Z	josemi		well... I use Gentoo
2005-06-20T11:48:00.000Z	josemi		I don't want anybody be able to do sudo or privileged tasks
2005-06-20T11:48:00.000Z	josemi		without the ROOT account
2005-06-20T11:48:00.000Z	josemi		that's for security
2005-06-20T11:48:00.000Z	josemi		I know
2005-06-20T11:48:00.000Z	josemi		I know what is sudo for
2005-06-20T11:49:00.000Z	josemi		Kvidell: i don't want users to be able to use SUDO
2005-06-20T11:49:00.000Z	josemi		that's all.
2005-06-20T11:50:00.000Z	josemi		and I don't want people to use sudo (in any way)
2005-06-20T11:50:00.000Z	josemi		yeap, and NASA uses Zope + Plone so waht ?=
2005-06-20T11:52:00.000Z	NicP	josemi	theres nothing stopping you from setting up your machine with a root account if you feel the need, but there are reasons that the sudo system has been chosen, please dont encourage newbies to setup a root account when they have no idea what they are doing and they can do everything with the current sudo system
2005-06-20T11:53:00.000Z	NicP		:)
2005-06-20T11:53:00.000Z	josemi	NicP	I agree but (for mi) it's more easy to have a root account for privileged tasks
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	josemi		or... if you want this in other words
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	josemi		I't's highly recommended to know your root passwd, in fact.
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	josemi		network filesystem (Surely)
2005-06-20T11:55:00.000Z	NicP	josemi	but if there is no root account and no root password theoretically the system is more secure
2005-06-20T11:55:00.000Z	josemi	NicP	so root's account have to exists in any way
2005-06-20T11:55:00.000Z	josemi		-s
2005-06-20T11:55:00.000Z	josemi		you can call this account root or "default install user" but's a privileged users
2005-06-20T11:56:00.000Z	josemi		user
2005-06-20T11:56:00.000Z	NicP		well if that works for you thats fine
2005-06-20T11:56:00.000Z	josemi	NicP	of course, so I agree: SUDO is an usefull tool.
