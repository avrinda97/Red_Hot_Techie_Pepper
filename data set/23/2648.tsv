2009-05-11T07:06:00.000Z	yowshi		and does asnyone know how to cancel the on mount fsck disk check thing so when i run through 30 reboots in 5 hours of trying to get my webcam to work i dont have to sit through 15 minutes of disk checks?
2009-05-11T07:07:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	you shouldn't need to reboot.  There are commands to load kernel modules on the fly.  Search for that.
2009-05-11T07:08:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	they dont work. grrr when a programme using the webcam crashes i have to reboot no kill -9 no modprobe -r nothing will free up tyhat webcam except a reboot
2009-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	a little investment of time now, will save you much in the future.
2009-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	i have to reboot for the 15th freaking time today so those are hollow words
2009-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	I did tell you that you dont have to reboot to load kernel modules
2009-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	not load kernel modules but UNLOAD them
2009-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	the modules loaded and stuck loaded and cheese is holdiong it hostage
2009-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	you can unload them too, afaik.  BUt I dont know the command.
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	modprobve -r it doesnt work though because it says the things in use
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	i cant make it not in use though because cheese is keeping it used
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	try killing the cheese process?
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	and cheese wont die to a kill -9
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	no i am a complete idiot who doesnt try obvious things
2009-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	i have been syaing i tried that
2009-05-11T07:15:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	perhaps use a different application, besides cheese?
2009-05-11T07:15:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	the only one which seems to have any prmise is vlc but noone here or anywhere else seems to know how to get that to work
2009-05-11T07:16:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	try sudoing?
2009-05-11T07:16:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	i have to do it via sudobecause i have to run cheese via sudo to get the webcam to work with it
2009-05-11T07:17:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	I suggest you use a different webcam app, something that doesn't require sudoing to start.
2009-05-11T07:27:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	nope. But I guess I could divert with other suggestions ;)  On my laptop, it skips it when on battery power.
2009-05-11T07:28:00.000Z	yowshi	swiftarrow	diversion noted and not helpful
2009-05-11T07:29:00.000Z	swiftarrow	yowshi	sorry abt that.
