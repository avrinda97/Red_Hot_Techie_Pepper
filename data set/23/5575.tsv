2007-01-29T13:09:00.000Z	sparr		i love how when linux and windows dont get along, but linux works with everything else and windows works with nothing else, people blame linux instead of windows
2007-01-29T13:10:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	yeah, the linux corporation needs to up it's espionage budget ;)
2007-01-29T13:12:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	no luv for koffice?
2007-01-29T13:13:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	I'm happy with open office, I only use MS office when my boss yells at me. Haven't tried KOffice yet
2007-01-29T13:13:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	i had ignored koffice til recently, but now im starting to see that its a serious contender...  krita beats gimp in some ways even.
2007-01-29T13:14:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	ill second that.
2007-01-29T13:18:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	I'd kill for synaptic or even apt on windows
2007-01-29T13:19:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	closest ive seen is cygwin, it has a few hundred things on its package list, but over half of it is dev stuff (which i of course installed)
2007-01-29T13:19:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	Meh, I hate cygwin, I'd rather run ubuntu through vmware or parallels, either way you're still running windows as your native OS >.<
2007-01-29T13:21:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	I believe maya and XSI are both available on linux
2007-01-29T13:21:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	maya still doesnt cut it.  i dunno about XSI
2007-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	it depends entirely on how you work with the interfaces, maya works better for some people than it does for others, I just can't get the hang of the mouse movements.
2007-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	maya is better for animation.  but 3ds' modeling system is infinitely better than any alternative
2007-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	I've read reviews that said Photoshop runs better in Crossover than it does natively in windows
2007-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	it does  :)
2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	linux handles swap better, and when swap runs out linux handles disk better so PS's own pseudo-swap runs faster
2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	same reason WoW runs faster
2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	only downside is I've got a d3d vid card >.<
2007-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	Most games perform abysmally for me in openGL mode
2007-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	freaky
2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	it wont
2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	sparr	KrisWood	ive had a few games that used IE's xml engine to render tables that only worked in crossover.  thankfully they werent 3d
2007-01-29T13:32:00.000Z	KrisWood	sparr	No it's not, it's MAGIC :D
