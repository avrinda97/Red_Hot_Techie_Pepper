2009-12-01T00:23:00.000Z	cmp		hi every bod, when i type this command in terminal " sudo gedit /etc/inittab "   it gives me blank page ... is it correct or i got some error?
2009-12-01T00:23:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	inittab isn't used in ubuntu anymore
2009-12-01T00:24:00.000Z	cmp	armornick	can you check this page please. ? http://www.zolved.com/synapse/view_content/28224/How_to_tune_your_Ubuntu_PC_for_faster_performance_
2009-12-01T00:26:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	that's an old article, it doesn't count for the newer versions anymore
2009-12-01T00:27:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	I haven't read all of it, but the inittab thing is definately outdated
2009-12-01T00:29:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	seems only the first thing still works, but I'd be careful with messing with the sytem files
2009-12-01T00:36:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	choose startup applications (or something like it) in the system menu
2009-12-01T00:31:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	don't know, I've rarely ever needed to use swappiness
2009-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	swappiness is a number that determines how quickly the swap partition is used
2009-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	it can free more RAM from your hard drive, but it's slower
2009-12-01T00:35:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	well, your apps have more memory available, but writing to the disk is slower than writing to RAM
2009-12-01T00:36:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	by disabling some of the startup applications
2009-12-01T00:38:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	there should be a short description about what it does
2009-12-01T00:38:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	but I wouldn't disable anything you don't know what it does
2009-12-01T00:38:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	disable bluetooth if you don't use it, etc
2009-12-01T00:39:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	just re-enable them
2009-12-01T00:40:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	just log off and log on
2009-12-01T00:41:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	they aren't actually disabled until you do that, too
2009-12-01T00:42:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	strange, what language are you using? most of my entries have descriptions
2009-12-01T00:44:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	well, the entries have titles right? that should help you a bit
2009-12-01T00:46:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	well, don't disable anything the title of which doesn't mean anything to you
2009-12-01T00:49:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	sorry, can't really help you with that since I don't know what services are started at bootup
2009-12-01T00:51:00.000Z	armornick	cmp	I really don't have the time to help you with something as big as that, but you could try a lightweight ubuntu version
