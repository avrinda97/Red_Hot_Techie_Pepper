2009-02-01T18:25:00.000Z	s0101_		and the user name must be vinagre admin:0
2009-02-01T18:27:00.000Z	s0101_		setup a remote connection to a computer that is connected to my dlink router
2009-02-01T18:28:00.000Z	s0101_		which one is the easyest?
2009-02-01T18:29:00.000Z	s0101_		i would like to use the grapchic
2009-02-01T18:30:00.000Z	s0101_		I tried to use vnc that comes with ubuntu 8.10 but it says connection closed when i try to connect
2009-02-01T18:31:00.000Z	s0101_		do i need to download vnc on both places?
2009-02-01T18:31:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	but you cannot mixup the ssh and vnc thing.
2009-02-01T18:26:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	what is it that you want to do?
2009-02-01T18:28:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	I see, but ssh and vnc are different options to do so
2009-02-01T18:29:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	if you don't have the need to use graphical environment, just use ssh. That will 'breng' you to the other machine on commandline
2009-02-01T18:29:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	if you do want to connect graphically, you'll have to setup vnc and/or xdmcp
2009-02-01T18:30:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	vnc requires a vnc server (not a client, which vinagre is)
2009-02-01T18:31:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	download/install vnc4server on the machine you want to connect to
2009-02-01T18:32:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	on *that* machine start the vncserver on a display of your choice (not 0) like "vnc4server :1", it'll ask you to enter/create a password
2009-02-01T18:33:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	the vnc4client
2009-02-01T18:33:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	however default in applications > internet is option "remote desktop viewer" which also will do
2009-02-01T18:34:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	but at that point, there was no vncSERVER running at the other machine, right?
2009-02-01T18:34:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	ok. So install the vnc4server, vnc4client, and you're ready to go
2009-02-01T18:35:00.000Z	oCean_	s0101_	client on 1 site, server on the machine you want to connect to
