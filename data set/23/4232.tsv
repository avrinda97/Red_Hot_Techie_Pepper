2009-09-12T00:10:00.000Z	gustavonarea		Hi. I have a free/unused partition on a server. How can I enable it (with ext4 and encrypted) from the CLI?
2009-09-12T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	mount it ? just add a line for it to fstab
2009-09-12T00:12:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	Sorry; actually it's not even a partition. It's a unused space on the harddisk for which I want to create a partition
2009-09-12T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	you have gui ?
2009-09-12T00:12:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	no
2009-09-12T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	use parted then
2009-09-12T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	but better do it from a livecd.
2009-09-12T00:14:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	I can't; there's no CD reader (I installed Ubuntu via PXE). Does it make a big difference?
2009-09-12T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	it shouldn't... but still the partition table is going to be edited so some care is good
2009-09-12T00:16:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	ok, thank you!
2009-09-12T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	parted has mkpart and mkfs commands with them you can create the new parition and fs in one go iirc
2009-09-12T00:17:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	cool, thanks :)
2009-09-12T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	a little bit convoluted but should work (in the name of ortoganility=
2009-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	Will it work even after suspend?
2009-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	suspend to disk ?
2009-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	to ram
2009-09-12T00:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	i do not see why it should matter in the s2ram case
2009-09-12T00:20:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	you're right. And it'd make a difference with hibernate?
2009-09-12T00:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	really dunno; i spect to be buggy if it works at all... but is a server. do you suspend your servers ?
2009-09-12T00:23:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	this one, yes. It's only used in a office (from monday to friday). And Wake-on-LAN only seems to work with hibernate and suspend; not with power off :/
2009-09-12T00:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	the make a real swap partition (encrypted if you must).. my gut feel is that it should be more robust...
2009-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	gustavonarea	erUSUL	yeah, makes sense. Thank you very much, once again! ;-)
2009-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	gustavonarea	no problem
