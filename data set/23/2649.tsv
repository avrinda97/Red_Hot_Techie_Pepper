2010-02-06T13:51:00.000Z	swiftarrow		Hi, I have a big problem.  COmpiz used to work in 8.04, but now after upgrading to 9.10 it doesnt.  When I run compiz-check, everything's A-OK, but running compiz --replace causes X to restart, and no compiz.  Help please... thanks in advance!
2010-02-06T13:52:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	Can you pastebin the output of 'compiz &' from your terminal to pastebin.com?
2010-02-06T13:52:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	just a minute
2010-02-06T13:53:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	I have to do compiz >> log, otherwise I dont' get it (X is restarted).  coming right up.
2010-02-06T13:54:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	In that case, something is wrong with your graphics drivers. Which card do you have as reported by 'lspic|grep VGA'?

2010-02-06T13:56:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	I have heard of people having the same problem with that intel gpu. Something is wrong with the drivers in karmic and it is blacklisted, probably for this reason
2010-02-06T13:57:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	I recommend you try with Lucid or Jaunty and file a bug report if the problem persists
2010-02-06T13:58:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	is it a driver problem, or is it a compiz problem.  I'm using the 2.4 intel driver to get rid of X freezing.
2010-02-06T13:58:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	It is a problem with the intel driver. Compiz is fine.
2010-02-06T13:58:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	It's my mom's laptop, she'll scream if I re-install the os one.more.time.  :)
2010-02-06T13:59:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	You don't have to reinstall, you can upgrade to lucid after it's released in April
2010-02-06T13:59:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	is it possible to use the 8.04 intel driver in 9.10?
2010-02-06T13:59:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	Because of the changes in the kernel and user space driver components, I would say not
2010-02-06T14:00:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	ok, thanks for your help.  If you can think of anything more, there's a thread going on about this over here:Â http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1309667&page=2
2010-02-06T14:00:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	The other thing you can try is upgrading to the latest intel driver user space components, to see if it helps. Maybe you can look into the xorg-edgers repo, though I don't know if it offers intel components
2010-02-06T14:01:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	I was looking at that, but am a little apprehensive.  I'll give it a shot though...
2010-02-06T14:01:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	any idea why X just restarts instead of freezing or something?  is it some new failsafe?
2010-02-06T14:02:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	It probably wont do any more harm than good.. if you do try latest user space components, it might be a good idea to couple it with a latest kernel possibly from ppa repo
2010-02-06T14:02:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	I've been looking at this, but it doesn't mention my chipset anywhere...  do you think it's good? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582&highlight=Intel+Corporation+Chipset
2010-02-06T14:03:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	also, since the functionality has dissapeared with the upgrade to 9.10, would it come back? wouldn't my hardware, once abandoned, be left forever?
2010-02-06T14:05:00.000Z	soreau	swiftarrow	I cannot say. You could ask in #intel-gfx for more info. That guide looks decent, but it is designed for 9.04
2010-02-06T14:05:00.000Z	swiftarrow	soreau	ok, thanks@
