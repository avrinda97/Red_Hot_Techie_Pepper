2007-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	Mohero		Hi all
2007-11-02T15:07:00.000Z	Mohero		can someone help with a Cron job issue, if I run the script I have manually, or using webmin tell the system to run the Cron job, everything works, but when it runs automatically every 5 mins, it copy's all the files correctly, but isn't executing the last line:
2007-11-02T15:07:00.000Z	Mohero		iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules
2007-11-02T15:07:00.000Z	Mohero		is the last line of the script
2007-11-02T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	thats not the syntax for iptables-restore
2007-11-02T15:08:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	it isn't?
2007-11-02T15:18:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	what is the santax to use for iptables-restore? if I run iptables-restore /etc/iptables.up.rules it works fine, but in the script as a cron job, it doesn't work
2007-11-02T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	have a look at that script
2007-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	which script? the one I've written
2007-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	I thought iptables-restore read from a names file
2007-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	I'm not aware you can do iptbles-restore <$file
2007-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	works manually, just not in the script.
2007-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	very interesting, I didn't know you can do that
2007-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	ok, is there a *propper* way to get it to read a rules file and apply them?
2007-11-02T15:22:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	you should take lots of credit points too, you seem very helpful here ;)
2007-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	thank you, appiciated
2007-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	ahhh now that I do, I wrote a script that loops thorugh a "rules" file and basiclly does iptables -F $rules_file_variable"
2007-11-02T15:29:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	ok, i'm not *great* at scripts yet... unfortunatly from a windoze background....
2007-11-02T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	this may sound a little backwards, but take a look at the redhat iptables script that is a good example to work from
2007-11-02T15:29:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	ok thanks.
2009-08-02T23:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mohero	is it realistic to expect him to download a 60GB mirror to his local machine for a local mirror
2009-08-02T23:20:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	no
2009-08-02T23:21:00.000Z	Mohero	ikonia	I didn't mean that, I meant use a mirror that is closer to him..
