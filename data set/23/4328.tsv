2007-09-14T09:51:00.000Z	Reikachu		does anyone knowledgeable feel like talking to me about improving my laptop's battery life for a bit?
2007-09-14T09:52:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	in kubuntu with kde powemanagemtn you can set which power profile to run
2007-09-14T09:52:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	already played with power profiles
2007-09-14T09:57:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	did you try cpu-freq-selector
2007-09-14T09:58:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I looked at cpufreq governance policies for a while, monitored it and decided the default ondemand policy was probably the best
2007-09-14T09:58:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	in practice ondemand runs me at my lowest frequency, 1ghz the majority of the time
2007-09-14T09:58:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	i was a control freak with my old laptop,i had hard set it to run at 750Mhz :p it gave me 3.5 hrs
2007-09-14T09:59:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I think 1ghz is the lowest supported by my chipset
2007-09-14T09:59:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	yes but it doesn't work by default because you have to chmod a file or two
2007-09-14T10:01:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I found http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/11/04/enabling-cpu-frequency-scaling/ helpful
2007-09-14T10:01:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	H3g3m0n: thanks
2007-09-14T10:02:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	i have done this when i used Redhat -changing it manually
2007-09-14T10:03:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	what I thought was most relevant was the bit at the bottom telling you to reconfigure the gnome-applets package to set the suid correctly
2007-09-14T10:03:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I think it should let you select cpufreq speed through the default Panel applet
2007-09-14T10:04:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	could you please explain what i shoudl do the the gnome-applets?
2007-09-14T10:04:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	i did see one applet that displays feq
2007-09-14T10:04:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	cpu freq scaling moinitor
2007-09-14T10:05:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I haven't tried this but if I understand the article correctly that applet should also allow you to select freq, but does not by default due to permissions. If you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-applets and answer "Yes" to the question regarding setting the suid of cpufreq-selector to executable
2007-09-14T10:05:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	awright will try now
2007-09-14T10:06:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	it should work. There are some other interesting blogs about this on google. The bug he links to explains why it is not active by default
2007-09-14T10:06:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	I have to go but good luck
2007-09-14T10:06:00.000Z	Reikachu	fermatstheorem	he also explains what to do using chmod instead of dpkg-reconfigure, if that's preferable
2007-09-14T10:07:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Reikachu	but, wouldn't that be kinda userfriendly, to allow the applet to do it?
