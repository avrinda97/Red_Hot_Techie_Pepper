2008-11-05T15:34:00.000Z	Cann0n		agreed
2008-11-05T15:36:00.000Z	Cann0n		as far as AC and such, i don't know. my battery is shot so i stay plugged in
2008-11-05T15:37:00.000Z	Cann0n		it lasts just long enough to run from plug to plug
2008-11-05T15:38:00.000Z	Cann0n		if it's a GUI problem effecting your power, it's probably your settings
2008-11-05T15:39:00.000Z	Cann0n		and the best way to know what you settings are is to set the, instead of rely on a remade kernel from the distro itself
2008-11-05T15:39:00.000Z	Cann0n		for example, i boosted my wifi signal 40% by setting up my kernel properly
2008-11-05T15:39:00.000Z	Cann0n		and that is just one thing,
2008-11-05T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	most new users dont know what half the stuff in menuconfig means or is
2008-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	if you buy linux friendly hardware you dont have to mess around with kernels or worry if ACPI will like your hardware as it will just work
2008-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	shop smart, save yourself hassle. dont just buy whats cheap or latest
2008-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	Cann0n	ActionParsnip	... how long have you been using linux?
2008-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	I started on redhat 6
2008-11-05T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	then madriva 7
2008-11-05T15:43:00.000Z	Cann0n	ActionParsnip	i asked how long, not what version.
2008-11-05T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	mid 2006
2008-11-05T15:44:00.000Z	Cann0n	ActionParsnip	it is all ways recommended to compile your own kernel (that is if you know liniux)
2008-11-05T15:44:00.000Z	Cann0n	ActionParsnip	RedHat 6 came out way before 2006
2008-11-05T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	i work in computers dude. theres nothing i hate more than having to mess with my system. I have a gentoo box, a mandriva fileserver and a kubuntu desktop
2008-11-05T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	thats when i was using mandriva when i got more into it, redhat was more a toy than a real used OS
2008-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	i only use ubuntu as its simple and easy which is all i want
2008-11-05T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	exactly.  i dont spend hours in front of my pc when i can be out having a laugh with my mates :D
2008-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	Cann0n	ActionParsnip	maybe because you are using a pre-release, when tend to be unstable?
2008-11-05T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cann0n	www.kernel.org should have one
