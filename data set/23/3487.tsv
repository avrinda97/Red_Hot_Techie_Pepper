2011-03-04T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learner	try narrowing your questions down when you ask, you'll get better answers
2011-03-04T00:45:00.000Z	learner	ActionParsnip	fine than where, can you help me in that context, cause am running low on money & i need my neighbour wifi to continue my studies on for downloading certain tutorials etc. any help

2011-03-04T00:46:00.000Z	learner	ActionParsnip	i need to crack my Wifi WPA pass, i know kismet can do it, but am not getting the suitable driver for my wifi, or may be i cant patch it, what eve the case is, am not able to make it.
2011-09-05T17:59:00.000Z	learner	ActionParsnip	xarchiver is another option.it supports rar
2011-09-05T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learner	not if you don't have the rar stuffs installed. a default xarchiver in a default install won't be able to handle rar (afaik)
2011-09-05T18:00:00.000Z	learner	ActionParsnip	ok.then u can go for unrar
