2006-12-06T13:30:00.000Z	Lovloss		does the front video work for any of you? The site is http://www.vasilisagames.com
2006-12-06T13:30:00.000Z	Lovloss		Ah thats true
2006-12-06T13:30:00.000Z	Lovloss		open source 4ever
2006-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	Lovloss		Okay now, let me ask this. Where can i get something to transcode files without having to use the commmand line?
2006-12-06T13:32:00.000Z	Lovloss		See? thats all commandline. there's no possible way to gui this?
2006-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	Lovloss		er yeah
2006-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	Lovloss		command lines are frightening
2006-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	Lovloss		:< well i suppose il just bookmark this page then....
2006-12-06T13:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		Maybe someday ill make my own gui for it :D~
2006-12-06T13:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		Mine will rule them all.
2006-12-06T13:34:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	I just signed in. What do you want to do?
2006-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	Lovloss	whyameye	just figuring out what kind of file to embed as a video to open my site, so that the average computer can use it
2006-12-06T13:36:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	I do flash streaming video for my websites. I use ffmpeg to do it. i have instructions on the web if you want. Can your web pages support PHP?
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	then flash will work. i highly recommend. Works with more platforms than anything else. Also mencoder didn't work for me as well as ffmpeg.
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	I put directions on the web: http://cratel.wichita.edu/cratel/cratel_streaming_video
2006-12-06T13:43:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	actually I think it will do it but the metadata info isn't so good....
2006-12-06T13:44:00.000Z	Lovloss	whyameye	then why is it giving me "flv not recognized" :( sudo mencoder Office.avi -of flv
2006-12-06T13:46:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	dunno, but I'll bet something is wrong in your command. My mencoder cheat sheet is: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-selecting-codec.html
2006-12-06T14:01:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	does mplayer play your video OK?
2006-12-06T14:03:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	so if you type "mplayer <filename.extension>" what error do you get?
2006-12-06T14:03:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	install mplayer and see if it likes you file: "sudo apt-get install mplayer"
2006-12-06T14:04:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	let it do what it wants. Linux is chatty, but it shouldn't scare you. OS X and WinXP do stuff like that all the time but they shut up about it....
2006-12-06T14:07:00.000Z	whyameye	Lovloss	does it play OK and w/ audio and video?
