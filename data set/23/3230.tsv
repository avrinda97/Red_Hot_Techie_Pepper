2010-08-29T07:44:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	give me a second
2010-08-29T07:52:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	here is the pastie of the script output  http://pastie.org/1123450
2010-08-29T07:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	Is that really windows 95 that's installed?
2010-08-29T07:53:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	no xp
2010-08-29T07:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	sudo apt-get install mbr; sudo install-mbr /dev/sda
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	ok not /dev/sda2
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	that was the xp partition
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	Definitely not /dev/sda2. Installing anything from ms-sys or install-mbr to the windows partition will break things.
2010-08-29T07:56:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	ah man I did that before I came to ask on irc
2010-08-29T07:56:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	well let me try the correct way
2010-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	You may need to follow this guide as well then: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bootinfoscript/index.php?title=Boot_Problems:Boot_Sector
2010-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	should I get anything after the command or do i need to turn on a verbose option
2010-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	If there is no output then it completed without error.
2010-08-29T08:00:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	so that is good ok
2010-08-29T08:00:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	let me see what happens when I reboot I am on another laptop for irc
2010-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	well that what different now I got to lines when I boot mbr, mbr 123FA
2010-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	Try following http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bootinfoscript/index.php?title=Boot_Problems:Boot_Sector
2010-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	yeah I am going to
2010-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	thanks for all the help you and the other people that have helped me so far
2010-08-29T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	forge_	You're welcome.
2010-08-29T08:05:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	I will get back to you on how testdisk worked in a bit it takes a bit for the laptop to boot up the live cd
2010-08-29T08:31:00.000Z	forge_	Jordan_U	the irony of this all is that testdisk had a thing that rewrites a windows mbr and it is really easy to use and I could not have made that mistake
