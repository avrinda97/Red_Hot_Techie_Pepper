2007-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	ryanakca		I just bought a new comp. It has windows XP. I have linux installed on this comp. I want to somehow get linux onto the new comp, and get the XP onto this one, so that I can sell it. How would I do that? IDE vs SATA HD...
2007-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	use ghost to image the drives.
2007-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	hmm... thanks :D
2007-02-21T08:56:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	have a link to a free ghost app?
2007-02-21T08:56:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	ghost4linux is free.
2007-02-21T08:56:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	and... I.. just burn it to the CD... and then I can ghost the Windows install... and then... what do I do? boot from the CD to copy the windows image to the new HD?
2007-02-21T08:56:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	ideally you would stick your windows disk in your linux machine, ghost it, redeploy it and then deploy your linux ghost image back to your empty windows drive.
2007-02-21T08:57:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	kk... thanks
2007-02-21T08:57:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	is there a way I can do it from a bootable CD?
2007-02-21T08:58:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	you could google for a rescue cd with ghost on it.
2007-02-21T08:59:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	ghost4unix is a boot cd, thanks :D
2007-02-21T08:59:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	sweet deal.
2007-06-08T06:03:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	man rdiff ;)
2007-06-08T06:04:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	ah, never knew such a thing existed
2007-06-08T06:04:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	rdiff + rsync = a decent backup solution
2007-06-08T06:13:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	hmmm. It doesn't let me specify the log in command as in:
2007-06-08T06:13:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	`rsync -az -e "ssh -i /home/backupdesktop/cron/thishost-rsync-key" ryan@192.168.1.107:/home/ryan /backup/ryanhome`
2007-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	huh?
2007-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	I currently have `rsync -az -e "ssh -i /home/backupdesktop/cron/thishost-rsync-key" ryan@192.168.1.107:/home/ryan /backup/ryanhome` running as a cron job. However, if I accidently mess up my system, it doesn't permit me to revert changes, so, is it possible to somehow have 'diff' run each time instead, and create a daily patch for the changes? == original question. You suggested I look into rdiff for backups. rdiff doesn't give me the ...
2007-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	macd	ryanakca	you use rdiff to prepare it, then rsync to back it up
2007-06-08T06:20:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	ah, I thought you were talking about rsync-backup
2007-06-08T06:20:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	s/rsync-backup/rdiff-backup
2007-06-08T06:52:00.000Z	ryanakca	macd	ah, thanks, I've got it working :) http://arctic.org/~dean/rdiff-backup/unattended.html
