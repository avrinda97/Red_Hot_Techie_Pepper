2012-06-14T07:47:00.000Z	luckylee1		why is ubuntu very slow on Ivy Bridge - I have Lenovo X230 - it's probably 50% slower to boot compared to my old X220 (same install - Ubuntu 12.04) … please help
2012-06-14T07:48:00.000Z	luckylee1		please help ubuntu very slow on Ivy Bridge - I have Lenovo X230 - it's probably 50% slower to boot compared to my old X220 (same install - Ubuntu 12.04) … please help
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	crond	luckylee1	is this a brand new system?
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	luckylee1		yupe
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	luckylee1		X230
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	luckylee1		just got it 2 days ago, then installed 12.04
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	luckylee1		very slow and the fan was constantly on
2012-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	luckylee1		ubuntu 12.04 on the older x220 (i7-2640m) was quick … but not on the new x230
2012-06-14T07:50:00.000Z	luckylee1		can you help
2012-06-14T07:50:00.000Z	crond	luckylee1	there's intel bugs of some sort graphically speaking with the default kernel in 12.04, I can't say for sure if that's your issue, but you could look at http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/uq210/running_1210_kernel_on_1204_the_supported_way/ and see if it helps
2012-06-14T07:50:00.000Z	luckylee1		reading it … so this affects all IVY bridges ?
2012-06-14T07:51:00.000Z	luckylee1		this is like going back to 80486 slow … doesn't feel like i7-2640 when running linux ubuntu (the old x220 was fine)
2012-06-14T07:51:00.000Z	crond	luckylee1	odd.
2012-06-14T07:51:00.000Z	luckylee1		it's super duper slow it's killing me … even boot, starting X, shutting down
2012-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	crond		try the updated kernel? also I know on my U31SD I had to switch to GPT instead of MBR, or else I got horrific drive performance.
2012-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	luckylee1		also crashes when waking up from Standby
2012-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	luckylee1		I haven't tried hibernating it
2012-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	crond	luckylee1	eh, for me hibernate works, but standby reboots on wake, so I can't help there.  I just switched everything to hibernate ;)
2012-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	luckylee1		i assume it will also fail because it crashed on standb (just bllack screen no kernel panic whatsoever)
2012-06-14T07:53:00.000Z	luckylee1	crond	x230 ??
2012-06-14T07:53:00.000Z	luckylee1		I'm talking about lenovo x230
2012-06-14T07:53:00.000Z	crond	luckylee1	I know.  Try the new kernel.
