2005-12-02T10:22:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	i think you are somewhat wrong in your thinking then
2005-12-02T10:22:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	what's the installed base of OSX vs. ubuntu? bet you i know which one wins :P
2005-12-02T10:23:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	whats the install base of any *nix distribution to OSX ?
2005-12-02T10:23:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	far lower for workstations/desktop pcs zdennis :)
2005-12-02T10:25:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	i know alot of folks who like their Macs and OSX. I know alot of folks who use Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Gentoo or Fedora Core and don't like OSX. Both have their place, I personally just install debian's ppc port on my Macs. So yes I own a Mac. =)
2005-12-02T10:26:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	you're a crazy man ;) but for every purpose, there is a diff solution, you just have to use what's best for you. if debian is it, then debian is it! :) for me it's freebsd and solaris, but i'm an all server guy. my desktops are all macs ;)
2005-12-02T10:26:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	yes, much better :) os9 was worthless
2005-12-02T10:26:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	my biggest propblem with a Mac is that I would rather pay half the cost and get twice the machine.
2005-12-02T10:26:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	it'll get better, with the intel switch
2005-12-02T10:27:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	but you have to account for your time being worth something. every hour of tinkering with config files or troubleshooting this or that device, or hunting drivers, is worth some amount of money :) my hours are 179$ each :P
2005-12-02T10:29:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	I love tinkering with the OS and config files. And I love the feeling I get when I can *for free* install an OS on my relatives computer who use 1) internet and 2) email, and they get a more secure system then windows. And that is payment enough for me when I see there faces of joy, and tears of happiness
2005-12-02T10:29:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	well, it's obvious what the best solution for you is ;)
2005-12-02T10:30:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	when i start charging $179/hr I willprobably switch to OSX, since OSX will fit better in my country club atmosphere. =)
2005-12-02T10:30:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	hehe, that's about how i like it :P i've got a bunch of 30" displays at the front of my business :P
2005-12-02T10:30:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	just teasing of course =)
2005-12-02T10:30:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	lol, it's true :)
2005-12-02T10:31:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	well could for you! I am wroking on figuring out how-to sell my services for that amount per hour. You're a bit ahead of me in that area.
2005-12-02T10:32:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	hehe. what services? maybe i can help
2005-12-02T10:33:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	i've got alot of skills. I just need to figure out which one to do, since I can't do them all. I have spent the last 4 years at about 80 hours a week coding in C/Java/Ruby, adminstering OSX Servers, Red Hat EL Servers and Windows Servers. I have also taken up a hobby of web development on which I have several commercial clients, and in that meantime I made my boss a millionaire...
2005-12-02T10:35:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	i have also made myself certified in a few different Cisco career and generic things like A+ and Net+ back in the day day.
2005-12-02T10:35:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	you should setup a website for your "business" at least a general overview. and if you have a resume, and you could mail it to ormandj@corenode.com, i'd be glad to go over it :)
2005-12-02T10:35:00.000Z	ormandj	zdennis	i might know some people interested :)
2005-12-02T10:36:00.000Z	zdennis	ormandj	if you don't mind I actually will email you a few questions! Perhaps you can give me some insight from your experiences and perhaps that willhelp me with my area's that I need input on.
