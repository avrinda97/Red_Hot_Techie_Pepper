2010-05-31T04:28:00.000Z	genewitch		where are the x/gnome startup logs? so I can see what the errors are?
2010-05-31T04:29:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	check /var/log/Xorg.*
2010-05-31T04:30:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	thanks.
2010-05-31T04:32:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	no, fresh install
2010-05-31T04:37:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	Alright, what file do I edit to set that up manually?
2010-05-31T04:42:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	With the more recent versions of Ubuntu, it's not necessary to have the </etc/X11/xorg.conf> file. Are the video adapter and/or display device somewhat recent?
2010-05-31T04:42:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	Rage128 is the driver it is using I believe. so no
2010-05-31T04:48:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	I haven't installed a recent Ubuntu on a computer with that ATI video (have done it with newer, though). It might not be as friendly with automatically detecting settings.
2010-05-31T04:49:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	I don't mind setting it up manually. It's a laptop so I imagine that's why the hsync and refresh aren't getting autodetected
2010-05-31T04:50:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	It also says "Video BIOS not found!" right after "Failed to read PCI ROM"
2010-05-31T04:56:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	"Caught signal 7 (bus error). Server Aborting   ... with # Xorg -configure
2010-05-31T04:58:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	Curious -- did previous releases of Ubuntu work OK with this system?
2010-05-31T04:58:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	Never been tried as far as I know
2010-05-31T04:58:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	should I try 6.06/10?
2010-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	for the record, xubuntu-9.04-desktop-powerpc wouldn't display properly, I had to use live video=ofonly to get anything to show up at all.
2010-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	Using a Mac, then?
2010-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	Yeah, TiBook
2010-05-31T05:02:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	it will load in low graphics mode, but I can't read anything, the text is unreadable.
2010-05-31T05:05:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	There's a PowerPC port of Xubuntu Lucid available. Is that what you're trying to get to work?
2010-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	ubuntu-10.04-alternate-powerpc
2010-05-31T05:07:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	xubuntu 9.04 powerpc also didn't work, same issue (black screen or unreadable in low graphics mode)
2010-05-31T05:15:00.000Z	julianc	genewitch	I can't seem to find an answer specific to the PowerPC port of Xubuntu Jaunty. I recommend trying the PowerPC port of regular Ubuntu Hardy (8.04.1).
2010-05-31T05:16:00.000Z	genewitch	julianc	I will try going back to 8.04 then
