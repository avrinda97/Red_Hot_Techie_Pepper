2007-06-19T11:09:00.000Z	eljak	richdurhm	yes of course thats how i work?
2007-06-19T11:11:00.000Z	eljak	richdurhm	to connect you enter something like vnc:/ip_address , ip_address = address of the remote machine
2007-06-19T11:11:00.000Z	richdurhm	eljak	i use ssh then ip
2007-06-19T11:12:00.000Z	richdurhm	eljak	 then another ip similar to his pops up but says needs a password but he did not make one
2007-06-19T11:13:00.000Z	eljak	richdurhm	yes you should enter same password on both machines
2007-06-19T11:13:00.000Z	richdurhm		ya ut i don't think he created one
2007-06-19T11:14:00.000Z	eljak		there should pop a dialog on his machine that says someone is trying to connect to your machine allow it or not something like that
