2008-07-09T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	they won't be on your system by default
2008-07-09T02:30:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	What is the package name?  lib6c ?
2008-07-09T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	no
2008-07-09T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	what needs them ?
2008-07-09T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	slrn is in the ubuntu repo's
2008-07-09T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	you dont need to compile it
2008-07-09T02:32:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	does it support ssl out of the repos?
2008-07-09T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	should do
2008-07-09T02:34:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	nope, not from what I can tell slrn --version  nothing about ssl support.. According to the documentation from slrn site it must be compiled for ssl support with ./configure --with-ssl
2008-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	it is linked against ssl libraries
2008-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	So, i've gave it the ssl lib's with ./configure --with-ssl-/usr/lib/ssl/
2008-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	 External programs / libs: +canlock +inews +ssl +uudeview
2008-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	it's built with ssl
2008-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	which is fine, and then it askes for the headers...  Please install the OpenSSL header files.  If you already did so, point this
2008-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	stop tring to compile it
2008-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	the version in the repo has ssl support
2008-07-09T02:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	can you see now that the ubuntu version has ssl built in
2008-07-09T02:41:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	Getting there...
2008-07-09T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	you don't need to compile anything
2008-07-09T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	do you understand - you do not need to compile anything, just install slrn from the ubuntu repo's
2008-07-09T02:43:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke_	ikonia	I did... Now I'm looking over settings.
2008-07-09T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Gun_Smoke_	great
