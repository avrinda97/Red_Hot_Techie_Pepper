2006-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	rmlightning		i have enabled all repositories, but it still doesn't show firefox as having an update...can anyone tell me why?
2006-04-05T05:14:00.000Z	rmlightning		yes, breezy
2006-04-05T05:14:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	it never will, firefox is too tightly bound to gnome for an easy repo upgrade
2006-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	it's worth the effort
2006-04-05T05:17:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	if you carefully follow that wiki page, you won't be able to notice that ff 1.0.7 is still around
2006-04-06T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	type groups in a terminal, it'll tell you the groups you belong to
2006-04-06T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	if you're not in lpadmin,  sudo adduser <you> lpadmin
2006-04-06T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	a good rule of thumb: don't edit /etc/passwd or /etc/group directly
2006-04-06T09:33:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	i am in lpadmin, but in localhost:631 it won't accept my username and password
2006-04-06T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	do this:    sudo adduser cupsys shadow && sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart
2006-04-06T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	it's not obvious, but necessary to use localhost:631.  After you do that, log in with your regular username & password
2006-04-06T09:44:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	in xp, when i click on connect to a printer on the internet and put in 'localhost:631/printers/psc-1510' it says that windows can not connect to the printer...it never gives me a chance to put in a username or password
2006-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	you have to use the exact name that ubuntu used for the printer, if I remember correctly.
2006-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	I've never done it personally, just kinda watched & helped someone work his way through it months ago.
2006-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	by the way, I'd throw that 1510 into a garbage bin somewhere, if I could I'd do it to mine :)
2006-04-06T09:47:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	in ubuntu my printer says PSC-1510...that is what i typed into xp
2006-04-06T09:47:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	u have a 1510 also?? :)
2006-04-06T09:48:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	yes, unfortunately. I had to buy one 'right now' and that's what I got. and i think CAPS matter in this case
2006-04-06T09:49:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	 i was in the same boat.  my epson went dead without notice and was in a hurry to get another one.  i have it typed in with caps in xp...still no luck :(
2006-04-06T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	I have never networked a printer with xp, so I really have no useful advice
2006-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	please don't threaten us :P
2006-04-07T08:12:00.000Z	rmlightning	nickrud	thanx for ur help lastnight.  i got the printer working today :)
2006-04-07T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	rmlightning	great
