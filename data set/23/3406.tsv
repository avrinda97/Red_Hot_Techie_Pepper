2008-05-28T03:17:00.000Z	gronne		Hi guys.. I'm trying to install the ported version of Alien Vs. Predator, but when I type "make" it says error all over ther place
2008-05-28T03:18:00.000Z	gronne		could anyone please tell me how to install AvP? very badly docimented
2008-05-28T03:18:00.000Z	gronne		documented
2008-05-28T03:18:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	Alien vs Predator?
2008-05-28T03:18:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	yes
2008-05-28T03:20:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	would you have any idea?
2008-05-28T03:20:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	does it run natively in Linux, or are you trying to run it in Wine?
2008-05-28T03:21:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	according to the bad document from it wine may be used to install some parts of it, but it should be able to run in linux from his port
2008-05-28T03:21:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	you got a link to the document?
2008-05-28T03:22:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	sure, I'll find the link
2008-05-28T03:23:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	this is the guy that's made it, http://icculus.org/avp/ I'll try and find more stuff
2008-05-28T03:24:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	the only "guide" I found was a swedish one(I'm swedish too), but it hasn't helped me much... maybe you can see something in it anyway  http://bbs.linux.se/viewtopic.php?t=17379
2008-05-28T03:26:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	i don't understand swedish, but it looks like you just download ryan's code with cvs (or svn, as available on his site), and type "make", then run SETUP.EXE with Wine. after it's installed, it looks like you run the 'Avp' shell script (with ./Avp)
2008-05-28T03:27:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	Yeah, that was my plan, but when I run "make" it just gives me a huge amount of errors
2008-05-28T03:28:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	do you have libSDL 1.2 and libopenal? judging by the links in that guide, those are probably required
2008-05-28T03:29:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	I think so, I've got something called libopenal0a according to synaptic and I should have libsdl 1.2
2008-05-28T03:30:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	is there a 'README' or 'INSTALL' file that can maybe tell you about other required packages? :X
2008-05-28T03:32:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	yeah, tried reading it, but I didn't find anything. Can I post it on pastebin?
2008-05-28T03:34:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	Can I post it on pastebin?
2008-05-28T03:34:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	sure
2008-05-28T03:35:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	http://pastebin.org/39005
2008-05-28T03:36:00.000Z	ceil420	gronne	sorry, i don't know what to tell you :(
2008-05-28T03:37:00.000Z	gronne	ceil420	ok, I'd love to post the errors that I get when I type make, but for some reason it's too many errors that "terminal" can't display every line!!
