2011-07-19T09:57:00.000Z	gechmog		Hi, I'm running 10.04 and I needed to repair a some boot files, and I just inserted my live cd, how do I get to 'recovery mode'?
2011-07-19T09:58:00.000Z	gechmog		All I see is 'Try ubuntu'
2011-07-19T09:58:00.000Z	gechmog		 and 'install'
2011-07-19T09:59:00.000Z	gechmog		:'(
2011-07-19T10:00:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	are you trying to reload grub to boot?
2011-07-19T10:01:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	Jordan_U : Basically I installed an update and then when I restarted I get thrown into some type of shell.  It has (something-here) and I can't do anyhting.
2011-07-19T10:03:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	is this a wubi install?
2011-07-19T10:04:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	No, this is just a recovery I need to make
2011-07-19T10:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	personally I and I suspect others would like to see the boot script run.   http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2011-07-19T10:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	this script will give you a text file of what is where to pastebin.
2011-07-19T10:08:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	Okay.
2011-07-19T10:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	you also clear up whether you want the OS running or recovering stuff from it as well.
2011-07-19T10:13:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	I am also trying to get the OS running, so that I can get my data... I hope.
2011-07-19T10:14:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	thanks for clearing that up, the script should get us the info we need.
2011-07-19T10:16:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	So, I am on my laptop now, and the infected comp has no networking ability, after I recover and all is working and I run that script, would you still get what you need? :S
2011-07-19T10:18:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	I suggested the script as it is a unknown as to what has happened, it is for getting you back in with the correct fix.
2011-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	I guess I should have been more clear (sorry), but i have no networking what so ever to download your script, so I also have no ability to paste it on pastebin as well. :(
2011-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	how are you talking to us now?
2011-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	I'm on my laptop now.
2011-07-19T10:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	can you boot a live cd on the infected computer and plug a usb into it.
2011-07-19T10:25:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	My desktop is what is having the problem, but after scowering the forums it seems all I need is a alternate cd as you so kindly linked to me. :D
2011-07-19T10:25:00.000Z	gechmog	nit-wit	sure
2011-07-19T10:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	gechmog	I doubt the alt cd is the answer to be honest it is probably simpler then that. Use the thumb to transfer the script download to the bad computer, on the live desktop=cd booted, then transfer it back to the laptop, and paste it here.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/
