2008-06-20T03:13:00.000Z	soundray	javier	enable your language in System-Administration-Language Support, then choose a session in your language at login time
2008-06-20T03:14:00.000Z	javier	soundray	but all my ubuntu is in spanish the only thing that isnt is the open office
2008-06-20T03:15:00.000Z	soundray	javier	I still suggest you go through System-Administration-Language Support and log out and back in. If it still doesn't work, ask again
2008-06-20T03:16:00.000Z	javier	soundray	ok thanks ill try

2008-06-20T03:24:00.000Z	soundray	javier	it will be when you next log in. If not, you may have to remove $HOME/.openoffice.org2 (be careful and back it up)
2008-06-20T03:26:00.000Z	javier	soundray	ok thabnks and another question how do i make excel codes to work on open office, it wont detect them
