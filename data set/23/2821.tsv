2009-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	phrostbite		Is there a myspace only im client that works with ubuntu?
2009-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	phrostbite		I don't know because its the only one i use maybe? Actually I am more curious then anything.
2009-01-07T07:15:00.000Z	phrostbite		I know but it doesnt seem to want to show all of the people on my myspace that have myspace im

2009-01-07T07:17:00.000Z	phrostbite		I downloaded kopete but that does not have myspace im
2009-01-07T07:17:00.000Z	phrostbite		Thanks vigo for the link and myk I am using pidgeon
2009-01-07T07:17:00.000Z	Vigo	phrostbite	looks like Pidgin can handle it
2009-01-07T07:18:00.000Z	phrostbite		Yeah it can. Maybe I need to troubleshoot as to why its not picking up my friend who is logged in.
2009-01-07T07:18:00.000Z	phrostbite		oh thanks eseven73 :)
2009-01-07T07:18:00.000Z	phrostbite		I am still really knew it not only irc but ubuntu in general.
2009-01-07T07:19:00.000Z	Vigo	phrostbite	as I stated that link is not official Ubuntu, but there are some on the Forums also
2009-01-07T07:20:00.000Z	phrostbite	Vigo	thank you for the link I am reading it right now.
2009-01-07T07:23:00.000Z	phrostbite		I don't know if this is an ubuntu question but we recently got verizon internet and on there computer they have a shared folder. Well is there a way to have that folder so i can access it from my laptop and put stuff into the shared folder?
2009-01-07T07:27:00.000Z	Vigo	phrostbite	seems so, your choice what program to use, is very possible though, let me look around at the MANs here.
2009-01-07T07:27:00.000Z	phrostbite		Ok sweet thanks, vigo.
2009-01-07T07:29:00.000Z	Vigo	phrostbite	looks like Wine or some Emu that would interface with it would work, WINE is for windows,, I saw on the forums that someone used ,,wait a sec,,,,
2009-01-07T07:30:00.000Z	phrostbite		I need to look up how to use wine. I noticed people talk about it alot.
2009-01-07T07:31:00.000Z	phrostbite		thanks rww for the link I will look at it right now.
2009-01-07T07:32:00.000Z	Vigo	phrostbite	is a secure site, but yes, look like it can and has been done,,,
