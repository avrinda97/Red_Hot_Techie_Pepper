2006-12-07T13:07:00.000Z	dsnyders		noisemo, I think I may not have explained what I'm after very well.  I want a command that gives me a list of just the folders within a directory.
2006-12-07T13:08:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	man ls ^^
2006-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	I can't seem to find anything within man ls.  It doesn't seem to have the capability to list only the directories.
2006-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	hmm.. was sure there was something, you can use "ls -l | grep ^d" though I guess
2006-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	although that might be a bit too verbose
2006-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	depending on what you're doing
2006-12-07T13:14:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	the ^d means "starting with d"?
2006-12-07T13:14:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	yup
2006-12-07T13:15:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	that might work.  Odd that ls doesn't have the capability.  It seems to be able to do everything else.
2006-12-07T13:15:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	yeah, I was surprised too
2006-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	ls -F is pretty good to have as default too, makes it easier to see what's directories (maybe that's enabled by default in ubuntu though)
2006-12-07T13:18:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	I use the colors (ls --color) to distinguish files from folders.
2006-12-07T13:19:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	they work good i pairs =)
2006-12-07T13:19:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	especially if you have lousy memory like me and forget what the different colors mean =)
2006-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	I just came across a solution elsewhere:  ls -d */
2006-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	still not all clean, but better =)
2006-12-07T13:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	I still can't fathom ls not being able to do it properly, though.  After all MS-DOS can do it.
2006-12-07T13:31:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	me neither, but I won't go through the roof until I talk with some real guru, for all I know there's an obscure command that does only this
2006-12-07T13:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	True.  This has bugged me for a while, though.  Many a time it would have been handy.  There are lots of kludge workarounds but nothing satisfying.
2006-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	yeah, I thought about it a long time ago, but haven't really needed it since, I don't do any shell scriptingt, so ls -l | grep ^d has worked for me when I really needed it
2006-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	Doow	ls -d */ will not list hidden directories, such as .mozilla in your home directory :-(
2006-12-07T13:37:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	that's weird, -a don't seem to work together with -d
2006-12-07T13:38:00.000Z	Doow	dsnyders	yeah, really =(
