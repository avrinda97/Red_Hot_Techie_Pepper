2011-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	how are you starting the font viewer?
2011-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	from menu....
2011-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	-%u
2011-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	for me, it's not working unless i start it from the command line and pass in a font file
2011-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	gnome-font-viewer %u
2011-08-16T15:07:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	have you tried that from the command line?
2011-08-16T15:07:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	yeah, it gives Error opening file: No such file or directory
2011-08-16T15:08:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	well that sounds like a path issue then, not a problem with the program
2011-08-16T15:08:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	most fonts are in the /usr/share/fonts directory
2011-08-16T15:10:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	ok, so what should i do, should i mention that in command line?
2011-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	so, something like: gnome-font-viewer /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf
2011-08-16T15:13:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	yeah, i got that font, but that's not we need right....
2011-08-16T15:14:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	so what are you after again?
2011-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	just a normal font viewer how we get in windows....
2011-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	i think we got to load something different
2011-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	you'll have to define normal for me. are you looking for a font browser, or a font-viewer?
2011-08-16T15:16:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	what do you think of fontmatrix ?
2011-08-16T15:16:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	in that case, font browser
2011-08-16T15:18:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	oO, yeah then you'll need to install something else, maybe xfontsel or gfontview
2011-08-16T15:19:00.000Z	rabbi1		fontmatrix is in the syp mgr...... will check these two aswell
2011-08-16T15:19:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	thank you.... mix of words, how these people name it.... :) ha ha
2011-08-16T15:19:00.000Z	whoppergator	rabbi1	great, yeah go with that, the x tool and the gfontview are really old
2011-08-16T15:20:00.000Z	rabbi1	whoppergator	thank you..... :)
