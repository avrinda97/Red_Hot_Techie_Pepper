2008-04-27T04:38:00.000Z	Twim4		hi all
2008-04-27T04:39:00.000Z	Twim4		i upgraded today my ubuntu from 7.10 to 8.04 and have no inet connection
2008-04-27T04:40:00.000Z	Twim4		anybody help?
2008-04-27T04:40:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	no internet connection, eh?  wireless?
2008-04-27T04:41:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	post your ifconfig output to a pastebin
2008-04-27T04:43:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	m....sory i cann't do that because it is on other pc
2008-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	oh, right, that makes sense.  what connections show up under ifconfig, though?  does eth0 show up?
2008-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	do you have two ethernet ports?
2008-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	yes, but eth1 is enabled
2008-04-27T04:45:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	does eth0 work?  why do you have two ethernet cards?
2008-04-27T04:45:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	the cable is in eth1 slot
2008-04-27T04:46:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	the other one has no connection to inet(router)
2008-04-27T04:46:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	if you put it in eth0 does it work?  if so, it'd be easier if you were able to get on the net using eth0 and then we can diagnose using copy/paste
2008-04-27T04:47:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	it works for me in the morning and after the dist upgrade it doesnt work anymore
2008-04-27T04:47:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	I'm sorry, I'm still kind of confused.  neither eth0 nor eth1 work?
2008-04-27T04:48:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	eth1 was working in the morning =)
2008-04-27T04:48:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	ok and eth0 never worked?
2008-04-27T04:48:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	it is not connected
2008-04-27T04:48:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	connect it and see if it works :)
2008-04-27T04:49:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	mkey
2008-04-27T04:50:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	it still doesnt
2008-04-27T04:50:00.000Z	androver	Twim4	i gotta go get a frosty!  sorry, try repeating your question and maybe someone else will help
2008-04-27T04:50:00.000Z	Twim4	androver	allright thx
