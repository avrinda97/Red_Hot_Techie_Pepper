2007-04-27T09:41:00.000Z	_Codeman_		I cannot mount my windows partition and I've tried all kinds of crap can someone please help me?
2007-04-27T09:41:00.000Z	_Codeman_		it's not in there
2007-04-27T09:41:00.000Z	_Codeman_		but the other partition isn't in there either and it mounts automatically
2007-04-27T09:43:00.000Z	_Codeman_		ok, so sda1 and sda2 are my windows drives... sda1 mounts np, sda2 has a problem
2007-04-27T09:44:00.000Z	_Codeman_		I've done that... but it's fat32 not ntfs :P
2007-04-27T09:44:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	ignore the -t
2007-04-27T09:45:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	do you need to mirror all the packages too?
2007-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	_Codeman_	variant	What do you mean?
2007-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	wrong nick, sorry
2007-04-27T09:48:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	are you sure it's fat?
2007-04-27T09:49:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	before you mount it run an fsck on it
2007-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	_Codeman_	variant	http://copy-pasta.com/pasta441 & http://copy-pasta.com/pasta443
2007-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	please pastebing fdisk -l
2007-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	please pastebin fdisk -l
2007-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	the error is because you are trying to mount a partition which is only a container for the logical partition. you need to mount /dev/sda5 not /dev/sda3
2007-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	sorry, ignore that
2007-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	youwere actually mounting /dev/sda2.. which appears to be the right part
2007-04-27T09:54:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	ahh, no, i'm wrong again! it _is_ /dev/sda5 you should be mounting
2007-04-27T09:54:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	mount /dev/sda5 /media/DRV1_VOL2
2007-04-27T09:55:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	imo, you should convert it to ext2/3 as that is also supported under windows with 3rd party softwar
2007-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	lspci
2007-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	variant	_Codeman_	might have to do update-pciids first
2007-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	_Codeman_	variant	Thanks :D
