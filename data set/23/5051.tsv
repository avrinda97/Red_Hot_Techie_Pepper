2007-03-03T12:02:00.000Z	dr-tofu		i haven't had problems with ubuntu since i got it a few weeks ago, and all of a sudden, it will stop booting right after "Running local boot scripts".. it will start fine if i boot to text mode and startx... i have no idea why
2007-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	I've had problems with 'kdm'. Could it be that?
2007-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	no it appears to be the gdm
2007-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	Have you had a look at 'dmesg' and 'less /var/log/messages' ?
2007-03-03T12:10:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	milosevic you can put commands (one per line) in the file /etc/rc.local
2007-03-03T12:11:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	last thing dmesg says is "apm: BIOS not found."
2007-03-03T12:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	old computer?
2007-03-03T12:12:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	relatively new laptop
2007-03-03T12:12:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	a year old maybe two
2007-03-03T12:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	hmmm. Have you had a look for other peoples guides for that model. From http://www.linux-laptop.net/ for example?
2007-03-03T12:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	or even the ubuntu forums/wiki
2007-03-03T12:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	Did you update/upgrade any packages?
2007-03-03T12:16:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	maybe.. i was playing around with the wrt54g firmware source and i had to get a few thigns to build it, but i think i've restarted fine since then
2007-03-03T12:17:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	is there a way to find out what might be stopping gdm from loading?
2007-03-03T12:18:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	'cat /var/log/gdm.log'
2007-03-03T12:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	Try kdm for a short term fix then.
2007-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	after apt-get install kdm, what can i do to set it as the default instead of gnome?
2007-03-03T12:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	as you install it one of the questions should be regarding just that...
2007-03-03T12:42:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	btw switching to kdm solved the problem, thank you
2007-03-03T12:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	Annoying but I thought it might. You're welcome.
2007-03-03T12:45:00.000Z	dr-tofu	gyaresu	.... why does kdm look exactly like gdm?
2007-03-03T12:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	consistencey of prettiness.
2007-03-03T12:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	dr-tofu	You have differences if you want to start autologin and stuff cause it's from the kde end of the world but apart from that it's virtually the same.
