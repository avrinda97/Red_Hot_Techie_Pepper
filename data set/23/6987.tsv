2005-11-17T13:06:00.000Z	hav0k		hmmm, rabeldable, i think i get it, i need to get libdvdcss2 before i get libdvdcss2-dev
2005-11-17T13:07:00.000Z	hav0k		hmmm, yeah, i got the wrong one i guess... haha, i really could have figured that out on my own i guess.  but thanks rabeldable
2005-11-17T13:09:00.000Z	hav0k		alright, ive got it all set up and installed, so now what?  rabeldable
2005-11-17T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	you install those with 'sudo dpkg -i <package file>' from a console
2005-11-17T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	then you're good to go
2005-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	I thought it had better support for playing DVDs but yeah.
2005-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	Or use totem
2005-11-17T13:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	try /dev/dvd
2005-11-17T13:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	totem to the rescue! :)
2005-11-17T13:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	If you can figure out the right thing to tell vlc, it'll work.
2005-11-17T13:15:00.000Z	hav0k	Amaranth	well, im sure it will... hahaha, but i dont know what to tell it.
2005-11-17T13:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	Use the GUI to build the path for you.
2005-11-17T13:16:00.000Z	hav0k	Amaranth	hmm, GUI?
2005-11-17T13:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	right click on the file and choose open with and choose vlc (or open with vlc if that's there)
2005-11-17T13:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	then all files of that type will open with vlc
2005-11-17T13:23:00.000Z	hav0k	Amaranth	thats what i do, but i was wondering if there was a way to have it associated so that i only have to double click the file instead of right clicking and choosing vlc
2005-11-17T13:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	after choosing it once it should have become the default
2005-11-17T13:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	no clue then
2005-11-17T13:25:00.000Z	hav0k	Amaranth	haha, okay
2005-11-17T13:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	hav0k	maybe there is something in system->preferences
2005-11-17T13:25:00.000Z	hav0k	Amaranth	yeah, ill look around
