2010-04-23T08:01:00.000Z	mdel		when 10.04 is released, how do I upgrade?
2010-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	the program you install security updates from, will probably tell you at the bottom, that a new release is available
2010-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	that depends on the version of Ubuntu you currently have installed, to some extent
2010-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	ok and was 9.10 a clean install?
2010-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	ok then that should be fine upgrading it to 10.04
2010-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	however,  I woudn't bother untill like 1st May, since  download servers will be packed to begin with
2010-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	and so rather slow
2010-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	 ZykoticK9  normalley upgrades go fine for like everyone, but 9.04 to 9.10 was an exception for quite a lot of people
2010-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	no
2010-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	April 29th
2010-04-23T08:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	except for development versions, but only more expereinced users should be doing these, really
2010-04-23T08:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	social networking features,  for Facebook and Twitter and such built in,  new themes and backgrounds,  Ubuntu One Music Store for those that want to buy music, and that's about it,  oh and #ubuntu+1 is really the place to be asking the 10.04 questions
2010-04-23T08:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	ah yes and better boot up
2010-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	that's development version
2010-04-23T08:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	10.04 is also a bit more Mac OS X like by default
2010-04-23T08:09:00.000Z	mdel	sebsebseb	yeah isnt there a new theme or something
2010-04-23T08:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	shame Firefox looks to black for my likeing, in the default theme, but other then that, nice theme
2010-04-23T08:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdel	except for how I am not that keen on the new window borders.
2010-04-23T08:11:00.000Z	mdel	sebsebseb	sorry, lets move on
