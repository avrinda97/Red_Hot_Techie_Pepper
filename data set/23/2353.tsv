2009-04-10T00:33:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	what is the problem with the sata controller? doesn't work at all? i am not really familiar with this model but google shows it seems to have worked for some people...
2009-04-10T00:34:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	well thats what I am trying to figure out - I am a bit of a linux novice and when I boot xubuntu 8.10 live cd it doesnt seem to be able to find the drive
2009-04-10T00:36:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	I found a fix on via's site for how to batch the 7.04 version to support this but I do not know enough to understand if this would work for 8.10 - could I send you the info and maybe your experience would help a bit more?
2009-04-10T00:37:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	i've seen that; most likely it wouldn't work for 8.10
2009-04-10T00:38:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	is it actually patching the kernal? would it be best for me then to just install 7.04 if I want to use this SATA chipset?
2009-04-10T00:39:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	this is the link - its at the bottom - SATA & AHCI Patch http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=420&OSID=45&CatID=3270&SubCatID=143
2009-04-10T00:43:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	yes, that is a binary driver for a 7.10 kernel, it doesn't work for 8.10; do you need to run the controller in RAID mode (not sure if this really makes the difference, but it seems the driver explicitly add raid support)?
2009-04-10T00:45:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	it appears there are two seperate drivers - the one at the top of the page is just for RAID support - it looks like the one at the bottom of the page is more for patching the kernal to gain support so my main drive can actually be on the SATA controller
2009-04-10T00:53:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	i see, this looks quite scary. strange that the support for this controller never seems to have made it into the kernel
2009-04-10T00:55:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	yes this looks VERY scary for a linux novice like myself - if i use 7.04 is it actually possible to do this before the installation - i plan to only have 1 SATA HD in my system and no IDE HDs - I want everything to be installed on the 1 SATA HD (which needs this patch to work)
2009-04-10T00:58:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	it is still (and realm of) somewhat possible to install 8.10, but the way i see it, it won't be easy... what do you mean with "possible to do this before the installation..."?  Unless you know someone good with linux to help you (physically, not via irc) I think your best bet is to try if a 7.04/7.10 install is possible with the readme.pdf in the link you posted.
2009-04-10T00:59:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	then you could force the system to keep the old kernel and try to update everything else to 8.10... this *might* work
2009-04-10T00:59:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	i guess i mean is it possible to do this during the installation - i need the installer to be able to see the drive to install the os to it
2009-04-10T01:06:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	check the pdf in (the archive) from the link you gave me; you would need to copy the downloaded driver on an usb stick or something, so you can use it from the 7.04 live-cd. it will never be the usually quite simple ubuntu install
2009-04-10T01:08:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	it seems the is really the only part that I need to use but I wonder if this is the part that might work for 8.10 - http://paste.ubuntu.com/147875/
2009-04-10T01:10:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	so who do I need to pay to get this chipset built into future versions of the kernel :-)
2009-04-10T01:14:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	lol, dunno. i still can't believe that it is not in the kernel. you have the 8.10 live cd running?
2009-04-10T01:15:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	yup - I have the xubuntu 8.10 live cd - just downloaded a few hours ago - i even emailed via asking about support for 8.10
2009-04-10T01:16:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	is this the same pc you are online with now? i mean can you boot the cd while still remaining in the channel?
2009-04-10T01:18:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	it is not but i have them side by side and can boot it while i am in here
2009-04-10T01:19:00.000Z	skybound	klemmer19	then boot the cd, please
2009-04-10T01:21:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	booting now
2009-04-10T01:26:00.000Z	klemmer19	skybound	want me to pm u? I am in
