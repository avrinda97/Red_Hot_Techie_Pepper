2007-09-08T14:32:00.000Z	tobi1canobe	shwouchk	have you set up vg at all yet ?
2007-09-08T14:34:00.000Z	shwouchk	tobi1canobe	yes... you saw my paste!
2007-09-08T14:34:00.000Z	tobi1canobe	shwouchk	I'm talking about pvcreate vgcreate that you need to do before you can lvcreate
2007-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	shwouchk	tobi1canobe	yes, I did...
2007-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	shwouchk	tobi1canobe	I think I gave you the paste for vgdisplay...
2007-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	tobi1canobe	shwouchk	I got this: http://rafb.net/p/qbbCFq63.html

2007-09-08T14:40:00.000Z	tobi1canobe	shwouchk	wierd
2007-09-08T14:42:00.000Z	shwouchk	tobi1canobe	do I need to do anything to have it available every boot, or will it work?
2007-09-08T14:43:00.000Z	tobi1canobe	shwouchk	most likely the startup scripts will find it for you. the fedora ones do anyhow
