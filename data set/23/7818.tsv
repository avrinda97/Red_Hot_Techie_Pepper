2005-05-29T12:37:00.000Z	hondje		I tend to go with /usr/local
2005-05-29T12:38:00.000Z	hondje		I tend to put commerical apps in /opt, like matlab
2005-05-29T12:39:00.000Z	hondje		so something like ln -s /usr/java/jre1.5.0_03/bin/java /usr/bin/java
2005-05-29T12:39:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	using java-package is preferred
2005-05-29T12:39:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	java is apt-able in ubuntu?
2005-05-29T12:40:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	no, but you can build a .deb from Sun's installer .bin using java-package
2005-05-29T12:41:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	Why can't they put java in non-free? Against suns distribution license?
2005-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	yes, Sun's licensing is too restrictive for that
2005-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	Thats' a shame, they'd get a lot of good will if they would open up
2005-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	yes, I agree...
2005-07-24T10:32:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	it shouldn't have any problems
2005-07-24T10:32:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	it cried about it being postscript (reasonable) and then told me to pick an application to open it with :-/
2005-07-24T10:32:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	hm
2005-07-26T07:54:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	the inner physicist in me cringes to hear that :)
2005-07-26T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	yeah, I was thinking along the same lines as I hit return ;)
2005-07-26T08:54:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	it changed a month ago or so
2005-07-26T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	I guess that means they've fixed backports so they don't make upgrading to new releases difficult?
2005-08-01T07:16:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	nice, what fiedl?
2005-08-01T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	Belutz Electrical and Computer Engineering
2005-09-22T12:44:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	Much, thanks :)
2005-10-09T07:02:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	I completely second that wish
2005-10-09T07:03:00.000Z	hondje	tritium	I tried making one, but qt is much easier for a guy like me than gtk
2005-10-09T07:04:00.000Z	tritium	hondje	file a wishlist bug :)
