2006-11-07T15:04:00.000Z	sarah		thanks mnepton.  actually I'm trying to activate cpu frequency scaling, both cpu keep running in the 110F range when I'm not doing anything
2006-11-07T15:05:00.000Z	sarah		it only happened when I upgraded to edgy, so I guessed that there was a problem with dual core recognition in the new kernel
2006-11-07T15:07:00.000Z	sarah		yes, it's a notebook, HPdv2000.  I'll take a look at the laptop testing page
2006-11-07T15:08:00.000Z	sarah		/proc/cpuinfo should return only one CPU even though I'm dual core, right?
2006-11-07T15:10:00.000Z	sarah		hmm, top seems to have only one list given
2006-11-07T15:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	what type of cpu do you have?
2006-11-07T15:11:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	1.73Ghz dual-core intel 32... believe that's called a yonah?
2006-11-07T15:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	just install linux-image-generic
2006-11-07T15:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	that will get a kernel with smp support and more specific for your cpu
2006-11-07T15:12:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	ok, I'll check gkrellm and then try switching the kernel
2006-11-07T15:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	yeah I'm assuming you are using the default kernel.  That is yoru problem.
2006-11-07T15:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	yeah you are using the default kernel. Install linux-image-generic and all will be okay.
2006-11-07T15:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	np
2006-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	my /proc/cpuinfo shows one as well.
2006-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	don't you only have one
2006-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	dual core, one processor.  in dapper this showed up as two
2006-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	yeah I don't believe its going to show up as 2 anyumore.  Even though the system knows there are 2 cores.
2006-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	any guesses as to why things are running so much hotter than before?  the fan's on all the time
2006-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	hotter than when?
2006-11-07T15:43:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	cwillu: than under dapper
2006-11-07T15:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	you already hav ea multi app installer  no need for automatix
2006-11-07T15:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	sarah	automatix is a hacked way of installing software it doesn't do it properly and removal is a PITA
2006-11-07T15:54:00.000Z	sarah	chuckyp	it's just nice to have a suggested list of apps, esp. if I don't know what I'll be needing if I'm new to linux
