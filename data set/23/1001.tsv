2010-12-30T16:03:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario		i have a dual screen configuration, when i use virtualbox in fullscreen, and then click on the other screen, the panels appear over virtualbox. Is it possible to disable this behaviour?
2010-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	there's a option to use "full screen" in Vbox.. that should remove the borders i do believe
2010-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario	KM0201	thats the option im using
2010-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	i thinkt he reslution is out of range for that service.
2010-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	nevermind, it works
2010-12-30T16:11:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	so before you open vbox, are your panels on the other display?
2010-12-30T16:12:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	well, it looks like the issue is that top panel on the right screen... move it to the right.
2010-12-30T16:13:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario	KM0201	you mean permanently? i dont want to reallly. the problem is bearable, just inconvinent, the main problem is the bottom panel becusae it covers the windows panel (the vbox)
2010-12-30T16:14:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	just want to make sure i understand... do the panels "switch" from the left monitor to the right monitor, when you go full screen?
2010-12-30T16:15:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario	KM0201	the panels dont move, when vbox is focused, then it looks like a standard windows desktop, with ubuntu on my left screen, but when i click anything on the left screen, the panels appear above vbox on the right screen. vbox isnt doing fullscreen properly
2010-12-30T16:16:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	i see.. is the "right" monitor set as default display?... (i use nvidia-settings.. don't know how to do it w/ ATI)
2010-12-30T16:18:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	i dunno.. it works fine for me(but i only run one panel)... http://imagebin.org/130211
2010-12-30T16:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	looks the same... hang on, i'll show you
2010-12-30T16:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	if you look, my trashcan is clicked on that shot.
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	um, 3.2 i think
2010-12-30T16:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	yeah, i really don't know.. it works fine for me.
2010-12-30T16:23:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	yes,
2010-12-30T16:23:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	i flashed it out a little, but yes.
2010-12-30T16:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	i dunno... i've used this system on Ubuntu as well, and i don't see the issue you're having
2010-12-30T16:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	it's not bad. but it's not nearly as user friendly as Ubuntu..
2010-12-30T16:26:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	lol, well just be forewarned, they are  bit on the "pricK" side in #debian
2010-12-30T16:28:00.000Z	KM0201	Psycho_Mario	it's not written in stone like Ubuntu... but usually close to 8-12mo
2010-12-30T16:29:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario	KM0201	sounds good, im downloading it now to try out in vbox, if it does everything i need, ill probably install it before i go back to school.
