2010-11-08T08:04:00.000Z	joeoshawa		yeah i am running extended self test but ubuntu is saying the drive is not smart enabled but it is and the overall health self-assessment test says passed
2010-11-08T08:05:00.000Z	joeoshawa		and gsmartcontrol started with not smart enabled but changed when it read the drive
2010-11-08T08:07:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i would give 10.10 at least 40 gig
2010-11-08T08:08:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i am not an expert either in fact i can't even install it it won't talk to my hdd
2010-11-08T08:09:00.000Z	joeoshawa		all other os's will and have no issue including ubuntu 9.1  and earlier but apparently everyone thinks it's my drive or one of the 6 ubuntu install cds or dvd's i have
2010-11-08T08:09:00.000Z	joeoshawa		not the fact that the developers messed up the installer
2010-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i can but it is not working for some reason a friend said the only usb stick i have is not bootable
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	joeoshawa		it is not the cds
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	joeoshawa		it is the installer
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	joeoshawa		it won't talk to my drive
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	w1n5ton	joeoshawa	is it sata or ide?
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	joeoshawa		sata
2010-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	w1n5ton		it could be the header
2010-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	w1n5ton		try plugging it into a different one
2010-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i can and recently did install a 9.4 installation and it went like clockwork
2010-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	joeoshawa		but not supported
2010-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	joeoshawa		and i can't upgrade to 10.10 from it
2010-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	w1n5ton		Why not?
2010-11-08T08:13:00.000Z	joeoshawa		well all installers except 10.04 and 10.10 will work all distro's i have tried
2010-11-08T08:14:00.000Z	joeoshawa		it is only ubuntu
2010-11-08T08:14:00.000Z	joeoshawa	ubuntu	is great if it will install
2010-11-08T08:14:00.000Z	joeoshawa		simple
2010-11-08T08:14:00.000Z	w1n5ton	joeoshawa	why can't you upgrade from 9.04?
