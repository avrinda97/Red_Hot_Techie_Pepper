2008-04-07T02:02:00.000Z	bulio|		I'm currently running a Ubuntu Server with an 80GB main hard drive and a 120GB storage drive
2008-04-07T02:02:00.000Z	bulio|		I want to reformat my 80GB drive, and partition it so Ubuntu gets 15GB, and the remainder is dedicated to storage
2008-04-07T02:03:00.000Z	bulio|		is it best to partition the 65GB left as /home?
2008-04-07T02:03:00.000Z	bulio|		or partition it completely separate, and mount the partition in fstab
2008-04-07T02:03:00.000Z	bulio|		also, how much space should a ubuntu server install have?
2008-04-07T02:03:00.000Z	bulio|		I just want LAMP for home stuff, and GNUMP3D
2008-04-07T02:04:00.000Z	bulio|		is 15GB too much, or enough?
2008-04-07T02:04:00.000Z	bulio|		and is /home a good idea, or make a storage partition?
2008-04-07T02:04:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	depends alot what you plan to do
2008-04-07T02:05:00.000Z	bulio|	simplexio	well, all the server acts as is a NAS
2008-04-07T02:05:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	minimal server with only needed stuff easily lives in 15G
2008-04-07T02:06:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	thats good idea
2008-04-07T02:06:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	just remeber that gloval /tmp isnt mentioned for big tmp data :) like i did
2008-04-07T02:07:00.000Z	bulio|	simplexio	/tmp /var and such will live in the 10GB / partition
2008-04-07T02:07:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	apache/postgresql/mysql etc programs default to /var/
2008-04-07T02:08:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	so if you dont plan to use big databses or big www-pages then 10G for / is enougth
2008-04-07T02:08:00.000Z	bulio|	simplexio	perfect, thanks
2008-04-07T02:09:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	and if you notice that /var or another directory starts to eat too much space, its just adding one hd more and moving dir to it and mounting it on /whatever
2008-04-07T02:10:00.000Z	bulio|	simplexio	is that likely to happen? Because i don't want to partition 10GB, have lots of data on the other 70GB, then have to lose stuff
2008-04-07T02:10:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	?
2008-04-07T02:11:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	"you are planning now do two partiotion, one / and one /home, if in future you see that /var need more space its just adding more hard disks
2008-04-07T02:15:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	in windows if you get C: drive full, you need bigger C: drive or you need delete stuff, in linux if let says /home is full, you can just add hard disk, and mount it to, lets say /home/bulio/, because his files takes 90% of old home capasity
2008-04-07T02:15:00.000Z	simplexio	bulio|	understand what im saying
