2011-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	afaik, once you rmmod the driver is unloaded
2011-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	 overclucker i-humble want to reinstall my usb tv dongel that it's in kernel normaly , driver name is poseidon ...what should i-humble do ?
2011-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	alabd		and see this http://pastebin.com/GeZ7rTND
2011-03-13T11:17:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	how are you re-installing the driver?  btw, after you reinstall the driver, you should rmmod and then modprobe the driver
2011-03-13T11:18:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	thats to load the new driver.
2011-03-13T11:19:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	 in fact ,how to be sure if prev driver is uninstalled or not ?
2011-03-13T11:20:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	uninstall?  or do you mean unload? you cannot uninstall a particular driver, you can blacklist it from loading.. if you run rmmod and you get no errors the driver is unloaded
2011-03-13T11:24:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	in fact usb tv dongel module with name of poseidon is not going to be loaded after i-humble removed pulseaudio package completely from my system and reinstalled it .you see that it has problem to be loaded http://pastebin.com/GeZ7rTND
2011-03-13T11:26:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	i'm not sure why you removed pulseaudio. but how did you reinstall it? and from where?  you could try reinstalling the particular kernel and see if that fixes your issue
2011-03-13T11:26:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	 maybe it will be fixed if driver be installed again , but how ?(driver is in kernel)
2011-03-13T11:26:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	if you reinstall the kernel, the driver will also be installed
2011-03-13T11:27:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	dont remove and install, use synaptic, and select to reinstall that package
2011-03-13T11:27:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	pulseaudio is reinstalled before ... reinstall which package ?
2011-03-13T11:28:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	i dont know about pulseaudio.. but for each kernel there are 3 packages, so just reinstall those 3 and the drivers should be back
2011-03-13T11:28:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	 would you name those 3 ?
2011-03-13T11:29:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	open synaptic and search "2.6.35-22-generic"  you'll see 3 installed packages, those 3
2011-03-13T11:30:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	btw, 2.6.35-22-generic is old, why havent you updated to latest kernel? and do you have the problem with latest kernel?
2011-03-13T11:30:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	2.6.35-27-generic is the latest in maverick
2011-03-13T11:31:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	yes reinstall is inactive and upgrade is possible , but am afraid if system will be damaged with kernel upgrade
2011-03-13T11:32:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	does upgrade so the same as reinstall for us ?
2011-03-13T11:33:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	it should not be a problem, even if the new kernel does not work, you can always boot to kernel 2.6.35-22-generic . kernel 2.6.35-22-generic will not be removed, the new kernel will be the extra option you can choose during boot
2011-03-13T11:34:00.000Z	evilvish	alabd	i would suggest you upgrade to new kernel and try with that first, before you play with reinstalling ;)
2011-03-13T11:34:00.000Z	alabd	evilvish	ok thanks and it's dowloading now
