2004-11-30T10:38:00.000Z	Rene_S		I went back to warty for the time being, testing Codeweavers Crossover Office on it

2004-11-30T10:40:00.000Z	Rene_S	Tsjoklat	Of course, for now I need a stable platform, have to start getting productive on my Photography Studio
2004-11-30T10:41:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	Rene_S	keep me informed about the Codeweavers.. it is something I am considering

2004-11-30T10:45:00.000Z	Rene_S	Tsjoklat	Now having said that I think as a "Movie" its one of the best on the Subject, and Mel deserves credit for it
2004-11-30T10:45:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	Rene_S	yes that is true but the movie is just.. in your face wouldn't you agree... reading is one thing but seeing it
2004-11-30T10:46:00.000Z	Rene_S	Tsjoklat	I think it did what it set out to do, stir up people's "passions".  Rare thing for a movie these days
