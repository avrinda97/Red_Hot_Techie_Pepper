2008-01-29T09:21:00.000Z	codyduncan		okay
2008-01-29T09:21:00.000Z	codyduncan		so
2008-01-29T09:21:00.000Z	codyduncan		I've returned
2008-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	codyduncan		to restate my problem:
2008-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	codyduncan		Having read multiple pages in the wiki, and finding either no answers, or answers that lead to dead ends (as in no solution, or a solution that I apparently do not have the ability to implement), I am still facing the same problem, namely, I am unable to connect to wifi.  I recognize, after browsing the forums for the last two days, that this is a very common problem, but alas, none of the suggested solutions seemed to be right for my situation.
2008-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	codyduncan		So, I am using Gutsy, on an AMD64, and using a Broadcom 4318 wireless card.  Upon first booting Ubuntu (the only OS on my laptop, as I ditched windows all together in search of greener pastures [greener even than those seen in the default XP desktop background]) I found that network manager was not recognizing any wireless networks.
2008-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	codyduncan		I tried using restricted drivers to install the firmware for my card, and while that made it such that wireless networks were found (so I assume my card was working to some degree)  I was not able to connect to my own network.  Each time I tried to connect, the key wouldn't go through.  I'm now guessing that my best bet is to go the route of ndiswrapper, but I'm confused about how to go about using this.
2008-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	bazhang	codyduncan	have you read up on using ndiswrapper?
2008-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	codyduncan		I've read
2008-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	codyduncan		but either something was screwy, or I am too inexperienced to make sense of it
2008-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	codyduncan		and also
2008-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	codyduncan		I found so many different methods online, it seemed, to use ndiswrapper, that I wasn't sure which to follow
2008-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	bazhang		!ndiswrapper
2008-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	codyduncan		so basically
2008-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	codyduncan		I am now at the point to take on ndiswrapper
2008-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	codyduncan		but I am not sure how to go about it
2008-01-29T09:25:00.000Z	codyduncan		I've looked at the wiki
2008-01-29T09:25:00.000Z	codyduncan		understood.
2008-01-29T09:25:00.000Z	bazhang		best  read up on it further codyduncan unless someone here wants to walk you through it step by step
2008-01-29T09:27:00.000Z	codyduncan		I don't want to hassle anyone, but if anyone can send me to a difinitive source, I mean one that isn't going to send me all over the place until I find myself back where I started, that would be appreciated.  If I still am bewildered, I will come back, tail between my legs, looking for a kind heart to lead me along.
