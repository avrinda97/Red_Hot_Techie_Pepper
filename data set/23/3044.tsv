2009-02-15T18:49:00.000Z	opr		guys, here is my xorg.conf file (screen section) http://pastebin.com/m19e8eeda, however, my screen resolution is always 1024x768 when i start up ubuntu!
2009-02-15T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	what video card do you have ?
2009-02-15T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	I suspect you are probably not using the right xorg video drivers
2009-02-15T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	if you go to system -> administration -> hardware drivers menu - does it show an nvidia driver available
2009-02-15T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	that's quite a late card so full support may not be available, lets see
2009-02-15T18:52:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	how are you making it go to the higher res ?
2009-02-15T18:52:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	intereting, as nvidia-settings normally changes and saves config to the xorg.conf
2009-02-15T18:53:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	have you considered saving the changes it makes manually ?
2009-02-15T18:56:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	didnt work, but the odd thing is: the load screen is 1280x1024, then it logs me in (auto-login) and the res changes to 1024x768
2009-02-15T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	it seems to be your desktop rather than your overall x server, interesting
2009-02-15T19:00:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	any ideas?
2009-02-15T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	for your problem, thinking it thorugh in my head
2009-02-15T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	never seen the xserver behave different from the desktop
2009-02-15T19:00:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	hm it is odd, do you think it might be anything to do with autologin?
2009-02-15T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	no idea, could be, but at this stage I don't know.....
2009-02-15T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	trying to find a senario where the desktop would behave different from the xserver
2009-02-15T19:02:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	ok, thanks :)
2009-02-15T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	someone just made a good suggestion, your not using xnest or anything like that
2009-02-15T19:04:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	not afaik, this is pretty much a fresh install
2009-02-15T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	ok, more thinking required
2009-02-15T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	looking through configs, can't see a way to change the desktop outside of the xorg
2009-02-15T19:18:00.000Z	opr	ikonia	humm, what to do then?
2009-02-15T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	opr	not sure at this point
