2005-11-04T17:36:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	what sources are you using?
2005-11-04T17:45:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	ask the bot about sources
2005-11-04T17:47:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	make it like my post. reload the page and click on it on the left.
2005-11-04T17:48:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	then update/reload your package list
2005-11-04T17:49:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	well, it seems youll have to roll back a little bit, or something.
2005-11-04T17:52:00.000Z	ryanmt	dabaR	how do i roll back?
2005-11-04T17:53:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	well, you would need to find out what is overupgraded. upgrade to breezy is maybe the best thing to do.
2005-11-04T17:55:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	cat /etc/issue
2005-11-04T17:56:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	get the sources from ubotu for breezy
2005-11-04T17:56:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	that should work. and dont use ubuntuguide
2005-11-04T06:29:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	ask the bot
2005-11-04T06:36:00.000Z	ryanmt	dabaR	ive read that guide and the default setup thing stuffs my xorg.conf and the  dccprobe doesnt work, and the resolution program doesnt either
2005-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	did you install build-essential or gcc?
2005-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	install the other one.
2005-11-05T08:33:00.000Z	ryanmt	dabaR	whats the other one you were on about?
2005-11-05T08:34:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanmt	the other option in my question as to what you had installed.
