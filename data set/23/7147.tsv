2006-01-12T17:53:00.000Z	cafuego		iKernel: I bet that makes him feel really smart.
2006-01-12T17:53:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	I don't think he really understands how hard it is to crack a linux system.
2006-01-12T17:54:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Well, depending on the system it can be trivially easy (redhat 6 :-)
2006-01-12T17:54:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	heh heh...
2006-01-12T17:54:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	But a default Ubuntu install? Not likely.
2006-01-12T17:55:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	See?
2006-01-12T17:56:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Ubuntu *only* listens for connections if you explicitly install the software to do so. Even then, the packaged apache is unlikely to contains exploits only this (dalnet?) person knows about.
2006-01-12T17:57:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Somehow, I don't think this guy uses his own tools. I think he just downloads "hacking" tools off the internet.
2006-01-12T17:58:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	that's why I was guessing at dalnet ;-)
2006-01-12T17:58:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Nah, this guy is from school.
2006-01-12T17:58:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Oh dear :-)  I'd just ignore him.
2006-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	I reckon he's blocked me :D
2006-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Maybe 'ping -s 1025' his windows box at some stage.
2006-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Unfortuneatly, I don't know how to find out his ip address over the msn protocall.
2006-01-12T07:53:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Then you have bad/irresponsible parents.
2006-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Sorry, you're dead wrong. I'd have bad/irresponsible parents if i WASN'T on ritalin.
2006-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Why not?
2006-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	Can make X wonky.
2006-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	With a nvidia card? Doesn't seem to be too bad with an ati card...
2006-01-14T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	SWitched from X to console recently? On nvidia is can make the console illegible. You only really need it on systems where you ONLY have an fbcon interface, like macs, or possibly embedded devices.
2006-01-14T08:35:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	I'm using an ati card here :) However, at home, on my nvidia card, I don't use kernel frame buffer
2006-01-14T08:36:00.000Z	cafuego	iKernel	It's just one of those things, if you don't need it, don't enable it, so it can't break ;-)
2006-01-14T08:36:00.000Z	iKernel	cafuego	Well, I got told I should switch it on. So I did. No problems so far.
