2008-05-16T00:17:00.000Z	mota		Any comments on how to increased the delay after failed passwords in sshd?
2008-05-16T00:17:00.000Z	nikin	mota	nothing in sshd conf on that?
2008-05-16T00:18:00.000Z	nikin		how mutch time you want?
2008-05-16T00:18:00.000Z	mota	nikin	nope
2008-05-16T00:18:00.000Z	mota		on ubuntu 6.06 lts, I change login.defs to have a FAIL_DELAY of 30. I add a "Uselogin" line to /etc/ssh/sshd.config. I restart ssh. Yet the delay after a bad password when I try login via ssh is still 3 seconds. What am I doing wrong?
2008-05-16T00:18:00.000Z	mota		This was the only method I could suss out, since sshd_config seemed to have no option for changing the delay
2008-05-16T00:19:00.000Z	nikin	mota	let me google a bit

2008-05-16T00:25:00.000Z	nikin		can anyone help me to use policykit with fluxbox... for some reason it ails the get process information... so the unlock bttons stay grey... and after tripple check... i am in the polkituser group., and i am not running with sudo ....
2008-05-16T00:28:00.000Z	mota	nikin	heh. "pam_unix.so is hard-coded to a 3-second delay."
2008-05-16T00:28:00.000Z	mota		how silly
2008-05-16T00:28:00.000Z	nikin	mota	sry didnt know that.. maybe recompiling ? with changing the value?
2008-05-16T00:29:00.000Z	mota		Can't be recompiling standard stuff in this environment
2008-05-16T00:29:00.000Z	mota		Need to basically be relying on standard conf file options
