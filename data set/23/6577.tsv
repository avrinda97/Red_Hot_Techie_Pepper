2006-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	soundray	lafferpt	seriously, mail doesn't create a Sent folder. If you use mutt instead of mail, it keeps a record in its default configuration.
2006-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	soundray	lafferpt	the From: address depends on your configuration.
2006-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	lafferpt	soundray	how do I configure that?
2006-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	soundray	lafferpt	sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
2006-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	soundray	lafferpt	you can send a mail to yourself: 'date | mail -s Testing laffer'. It should end up in /var/mail/laffer
2006-03-14T08:33:00.000Z	lafferpt	soundray	where can I see how to configure postfix? I don't understand the technical terms it refers to
2006-03-14T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	lafferpt	there is a wiki page, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PostfixBasicSetupHowto
