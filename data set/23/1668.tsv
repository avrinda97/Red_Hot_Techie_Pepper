2009-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	nemo	drunkpunk	you just used System->Preferences->Remote Desktop right?
2009-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	drunkpunk	nemo	how best to find out?
2009-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	nemo	drunkpunk	didn't do anything else?

2009-12-13T05:19:00.000Z	nemo	drunkpunk	mm dunno could try cranking up the loglevel on vncviewer I guess
2009-12-13T05:19:00.000Z	nemo	drunkpunk	and maybe check ~/.xsession-errors
2009-12-13T05:21:00.000Z	drunkpunk	nemo	this maybe unrelated but evry time i log out of the machine i'm remoting to it makes me authenticate the shutdown because other users are logged on (even tho they aint!)
