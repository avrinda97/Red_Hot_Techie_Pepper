2010-07-09T22:24:00.000Z	jerkman		i am trying to restore some data off of a hard drive, and it is seemingly unformatted (i.e. partition table is corrupt). I was going to rip the data using dd, but it was going unusually slow. The drive is now not even being properly recognised. I am monitoring /var/log/messages and it's throwing some interesting things..
2010-07-09T22:26:00.000Z	jerkman		i desperately need the data from this drive, so if anyone can help me 'decode' the messages I would appreciate it. I can pastebin it
2010-07-09T22:26:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	go go pastebin
2010-07-09T22:31:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	where are you trying to retrieve data from?? a CD or HD?
2010-07-09T22:31:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	it is a sata 2.5" HDD, in a usb enclosure
2010-07-09T22:32:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	wish I could make heads or tails of what I'm looking at but it looks like a corrupt sector on the disk
2010-07-09T22:33:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	 but that's a guess
2010-07-09T22:33:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	that is what I am thinking, however earlier it was not doing this and was just saying no partition type kinda thing
2010-07-09T22:34:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	do you have the earlier output?
2010-07-09T22:35:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	no unfortunately, it was similar to the one i posted except it didnt keep doing that illegal request... cycle.
2010-07-09T22:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	Does this happen when attempting to mount the drive or when attempting to read?
2010-07-09T22:38:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	as soon as i plug it in, it refuses to mount. It was reading earlier very very slowly with dd, but that kinda access is no more :(
2010-07-09T22:39:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	Sounds like the drive died. All other USB storage devices are being read fine?
2010-07-09T22:40:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	eya, that is a bummer... window refuses to recognise it too, but thats not a surprise...
2010-07-09T22:40:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	I would say the drive's dead then
2010-07-09T22:41:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	damn, its a mates and its ot soe really important stuff on it.. oh well, you win some you lose some
2010-07-09T22:42:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	Was the drive sounding like a ticker tape earlier?
2010-07-09T22:42:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	Rapid clicking noises during heavy operations?
2010-07-09T22:43:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	No, i've had plenty of tickers in the past and this isn't one. I'd say the hardware sounds fine, spins fine etc... must be a sector issue...
2010-07-09T22:43:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	In that case your guess is probably accurate
2010-07-09T22:44:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	short of a low-level format, can sectors be repaired without removing the important data?
2010-07-09T22:47:00.000Z	DarkStar1	jerkman	from what I know, Not really because most causes of bad sectors are physical damage of some sort. however data can be retrieved depending on how much of the data was located in said sectors
2010-07-09T22:49:00.000Z	jerkman	DarkStar1	right then, well thanks for your assistance and your time... i'll go give him the bad news :(
