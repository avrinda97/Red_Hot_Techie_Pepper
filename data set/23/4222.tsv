2008-01-25T16:58:00.000Z	lordmorgoth		anyone knows a bash command to search for a word inside a list of files or folder ?
2008-01-25T16:58:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	grep
2008-01-25T16:59:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 yeah i know grep but can u tell me the full command plz
2008-01-25T16:59:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	grep -i "yourword" folder/file*
2008-01-25T16:59:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	let me try
2008-01-25T17:00:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	*hint* type the first three letters of your folder or file and press tab twice for autocompletion :)
2008-01-25T17:00:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	i know dat im not that ignorant man :P
2008-01-25T17:02:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	ok, just trying to fill your head with useful nonsense :P
2008-01-25T17:02:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	there is also pcregrep if you're familiar with PCRE regular expressions
2008-01-25T17:03:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 i should put the " " ??
2008-01-25T17:04:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	preferrably yes :) you'll eventually end up using regular expressions, it's good to use " " quotes
2008-01-25T17:05:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	so far its not working, im going over the grep man
2008-01-25T17:06:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	tell me the word you're looking for and the complete path to the file, privately if you want is ok
2008-01-25T17:07:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	word: DriverManager , folder: /home/lordmorgoth/Work/credys\ source\ code/WEB/ <--- here i want it to search all those folders to tell me which file contains DriverManager
2008-01-25T17:09:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	ah sorry, you need grep -ri for searching inside a lot of folders or files :)
2008-01-25T17:09:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 tried that already
2008-01-25T17:11:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	or just grep -ri DriverManager  /home/lordmorgoth/Work/credys\ source\ code/WEB/
2008-01-25T17:12:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	by the way, the -i is for case insensitive, it will return "DriverManager", "dRiverManagEr", "drivermanager" etc :)
2008-01-25T17:13:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 sorry i was afk talking to my boss
2008-01-25T17:14:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 thanks alot for the help but i think all the files do not contain the word i want :) but really thanks alot for the grep trick ;)
2008-01-25T17:15:00.000Z	savvas	lordmorgoth	no problem, if it doesn't return anything, it's probably not in any of the files :\ try with another word and see if anything comes up
2008-01-25T17:15:00.000Z	lordmorgoth	savvas	 yeah i think non of the files contain it :)
