2009-05-05T18:52:00.000Z	Magician_		side by side
2009-05-05T18:53:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	what is the other option then?
2009-05-05T18:53:00.000Z	Magician_		it makes your other operating system take the minimal space, side by side gives you equal space or you can maunally partion
2009-05-05T18:54:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	oh. when i installed windows i created a partition that's a 1/3 of the harddrive, leaving the last 2/3 as free space for ubuntu
2009-05-05T18:55:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	I would leave it like that
2009-05-05T18:55:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	i got the sense that i don't want side by side as it will try and shrink/enlarge my windows partition so i want largest free space, but i got the sense that that option didnt install a bootloader
2009-05-05T18:56:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	It will install the boot loader. and all your booting will depend on the kernel. you will be given a choice of which system you want to load
2009-05-05T18:57:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	so given that they'll both let me install grub, and they'll both put ubuntu in the free space i've preset, what would be the difference between the two options?
2009-05-05T18:58:00.000Z	Magician_		in your case there isn't much different other than the space you use
2009-05-05T18:58:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	it seems you got it set up to install correctly to me
2009-05-05T19:00:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	so  if the difference is the space i use, and the space i want to use is the "largest continuous free space", why do i want the "side by side" option?
2009-05-05T19:02:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	most people that do dual boot are using both os about the same amount of time for various things so equal space is the more prominent choice, but if you are going to make ubuntu your primary os then you need to use the largest spacee
2009-05-05T19:03:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	so i DO want largest free space then? will side by side create a 50/50 split and not let me decide on another ratio?
2009-05-05T19:04:00.000Z	Magician_		yes you DO want the largest space in your case. And the side by side will do a 50/50 with no other options
2009-05-05T19:04:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	sorry to ask so many questions. i've set up dual boot dozens of times, usually by using cfdisk for creating partitions and setting mountpoints, but i have NO idea what those two options in the ubuntu menu are supposed to mean
2009-05-05T19:05:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	it is fine. ask all you want   that is what we are here for
2009-05-05T19:06:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	so side-by-side is generally geared for people who have no free space, just one os that uses one partition that covers the whole drive? i take it then that resizing ntfs partitions with linux tools is a LOT safer than it used to be!
2009-05-05T19:06:00.000Z	Magician_		austin:  have you enabled to allow others to view your desktop
2009-05-05T19:07:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	 yes it is alot afer now
2009-05-05T19:07:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	back in my day you had to use partition magic for windows or take teh serious risk of borking the entire ntfs partition
2009-05-05T19:08:00.000Z	Magician_		all that has changed  now.   which is good i think
2009-05-05T19:09:00.000Z	Magician_	jacquesmerde	 I will be right back
2009-05-05T19:09:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Magician_	i still out of habit always use fat rather than ntfs partitions in windows installs, coz of fears of later resizing
