2005-05-10T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	and please please please tell me you're not being silly and using Debian package sources
2005-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	dell500	bob2	it works with no errors
2005-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	what "works"?
2005-05-10T06:43:00.000Z	dell500	bob2	should i uninstall or remove those packages i just installed??
2005-05-10T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	I have no idea what you've done
2005-06-07T12:23:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	yeah, but it should be automatically
2005-06-07T12:37:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	ignore it
2005-09-05T06:22:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	ask on the ndiswrapper mailing list, and include the output of lspci
2005-09-05T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	you mailed the list?
2005-09-22T13:46:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	does that exist in ubuntu?
2005-09-22T13:47:00.000Z	dell500	bob2	no idea, i was just wanting to get a simple web server up to host some pics
2005-09-22T13:47:00.000Z	bob2	dell500	apache2 will be much less hassle
2005-09-22T13:48:00.000Z	dell500	bob2	apt-get install apache2 ??
