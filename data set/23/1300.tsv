2010-05-23T11:55:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	What is the line that you put in cron?
2010-05-23T11:55:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	getting that for you...
2010-05-23T11:56:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	as root
2010-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	did you see my response?
2010-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	Yes, and I'm looking through crontab man page.
2010-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	great
2010-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	You mean crontab -e, I assume
2010-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	yes
2010-05-23T12:05:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	I can't find anything wrong with the crontab
2010-05-23T12:07:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	does it work on your system?
2010-05-23T12:09:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	I'm trying on my system and it's not working... I can't see any reason why not.
2010-05-23T12:09:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	k, i'll keep looking
2010-05-23T12:10:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	Actually, mine is working...
2010-05-23T12:10:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	was looking at the wrong file.
2010-05-23T12:11:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	okay
2010-05-23T12:11:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	Is cron running? (run "service cron status" to check)
2010-05-23T12:15:00.000Z	dmcquay	undecim	got it
2010-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	undecim	dmcquay	lol. It's always the little things.
