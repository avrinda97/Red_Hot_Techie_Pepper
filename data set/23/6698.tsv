2006-01-25T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	do this >>do apt-get install emacs21<< my mistake
2006-01-25T15:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2006-01-25T15:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	I don't need moment by moment feedback I will wait a reasonable amount of time anyway just do this "ompaul ...." at the start of the line
2006-01-25T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	please paste the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list in paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	did you know there is a more up to date version? it was released in October last year, the version you have is from april :-)
2006-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	Esco	ompaul	i dont understand what you mean
2006-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	there is a version 5.10
2006-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	^^^^^6
2006-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	please paste that file into the pastebin for me as I requested
2006-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	before you try updating
2006-01-25T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	you have an error in trying to get emacs that should not be the case and I would like to see the contents of that file - it also may help in an upgrade situation
2006-01-25T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	I may see why you got the error
2006-01-25T15:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	you don't need to explain everything, it is pretty much cool,you ask a question and someone here will answer if they have the answer
2006-01-25T15:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	in a new terminal type cat /etc/apt/sources.list then copy the highlight the contents of that screen with a left click and then with a right click choose copy, in a web browser if clicking on this link does not work http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and there with a right click choose to paste the contents you will get a new url after you submit tell me about it
2006-01-25T15:43:00.000Z	Esco	ompaul	it doesnt work
2006-01-25T15:46:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	it works, your just not understanding me, as I can't explain it any better
2006-01-25T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Esco	have you altered your sources.list at all?
2006-01-25T15:48:00.000Z	Esco	ompaul	thank you but i dont understand you sorry
