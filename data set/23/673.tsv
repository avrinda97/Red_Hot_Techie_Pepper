2011-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	vivekv		I am running Ubuntu on Virtual Box which is running in Debian x64.  I am having a strange problem where all my typing is very sluggish is Ubuntu.  Any ideas?
2011-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	cbilljones	vivekv	have you added virtualbox additions?
2011-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	vivekv		yes I have added
2011-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	vivekv		the VBOx additions
2011-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	vivekv	cbilljones	- strangely the problem is really bad on  the terminal
