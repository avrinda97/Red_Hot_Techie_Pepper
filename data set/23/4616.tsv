2008-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	Did you follow everything on this page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2008-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	Ubuntu doesn't use httpd.conf

2008-07-30T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	add them to the admin group
2008-07-30T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	does 'groups' show you're in the admin group?
2008-07-30T16:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	Whats the username?
2008-07-30T16:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	And you're currently on a user that can sudo, yes?
2008-07-30T16:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	well, I'll ignore the "don't use root" lecture, usermod -G admin -a joshua
2008-07-30T16:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	then "groups joshua" and you'll see admin
2008-07-30T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	what does "groups joshua" return?
2008-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	Have you edited your sudoers file?
2008-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	no.
2008-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	Oh, have you been logged in with joshua this whole time?  try logging out/ and logging back in
2008-07-30T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	pastebin the output of "groups joshua" and "cat /etc/sudoers"
2008-07-30T16:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	it won't be.  this is what your sudoers should look like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/32168/
2008-07-30T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	yeah... those are important
2008-07-30T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	visudo, always use visudo
2008-07-30T16:37:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	Flannel	i dunno how to use vi I used nano
2008-07-30T16:38:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	Flannel	works now :D
2008-07-30T16:38:00.000Z	Flannel	ai3gtmc	visudo honors EDITOR, in your .bashrc put "export EDITOR=nano" and visudo will use nano
