2005-03-22T12:34:00.000Z	factotum		eh, if i where to consider gentoo, id just go bsd for the fun of it
2005-03-22T12:36:00.000Z	factotum		i know
2005-03-22T12:37:00.000Z	factotum		im just saying if i where to go distro-hopping again, i might as well go back to fbsd
2005-03-22T12:38:00.000Z	factotum		well yea, an os needs apps
2005-03-22T12:39:00.000Z	factotum		gnu is a seperate entitiy, linux, bsd, herd, whatever are just different OS's to run its software
2005-03-22T12:39:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	Wrongo, reindeer lover.
2005-03-22T12:40:00.000Z	factotum	DarthFrog	alright LOL, i must be interpriting what I read incorrectly heh
2005-03-22T12:40:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	Hurd is a kernel, not an OS.
2005-03-22T12:42:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	The Free Software Foundation considers GNU to be the OS itself.  They are developing the Hurd kernel for GNU.  They consider Linux to just be a kernel for the GNU system.
2005-03-22T12:42:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	You had to be there. :-)
2005-03-22T12:44:00.000Z	factotum	DarthFrog	huh, wierd. It's crazy to see how different groups opinionate what's the os, what's the kernel, even some cases of is there a difference
2005-03-22T12:44:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	 The Free Software Foundation would refer to Ubuntu as Ubuntu GNU/Linux.
2005-03-22T12:44:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	It's not wierd, exactly. It's RMS' opinions and politics. :-)
2005-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	RMS is Richard Matthew Stallman.  GNU and the FSF are  his babies.
2005-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	factotum	DarthFrog	yea, im still getting used to that. The opinions vs. headlines lol.
2005-03-22T12:46:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	RMS and the FSF made the GNU system.  It was pretty much complete in the early ninties other than needing a kernel.  Linus Torvalds took GNU and added his kernel to it.
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	the combo at first was called Freax, then was renamed Linux.
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	factotum	DarthFrog	ah yea. I remember reading about that, gnu and the kernel
2005-03-22T12:49:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	about 5 or so years later, RMS realised that GNU and the FSF were being over-shadowed by Linux.  He's been trying to get everyone to acknowledge and honour him since then.  He absolutely insists that the system be called GNU/Linux.  At first, he tried to foist LiGNUx.  That went nowhere.
2005-03-22T12:50:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	I agree that RMS and the FSF deserve a great deal of credit.  But I simply hate the name GNU/Linux.  It's ugly.  I also dislike the name Kubuntu.
2005-03-22T12:50:00.000Z	factotum	DarthFrog	so is RMS just stomping his feet or is there merit to that feeling of being overshadowed?
2005-03-22T12:50:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	Lots of merit.
2005-03-22T12:58:00.000Z	DarthFrog	factotum	Not going to happen.  Ever.
