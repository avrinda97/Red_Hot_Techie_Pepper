2005-02-25T13:54:00.000Z	K-Rich		http://ubuntuguide.org/index.html#installmysqldatabaseserver errrr... what is the root password ?
2005-02-25T13:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 mysql's "root" is not the same as unix/linux/ubuntu's "root"
2005-02-25T13:57:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	okay lemme try this then :)
2005-02-25T14:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 when you configured mysql-server, you should have set a "root" password, 'less /usr/share/doc/mysql-server/README.Debian'
2005-02-25T14:02:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	reading now... the only config stuff it asked on install was if it should purge databases when it's uninstalled
2005-02-25T14:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 okay
2005-02-25T14:07:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	http://rafb.net/paste/results/Rtbne969.html   Any other ideas :/
2005-02-25T14:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 any chance you already have a password set?  add -p to the command line
2005-02-25T14:17:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	no password... fresh install
2005-02-25T14:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 there's surely something i'm overlooking, but i'll tell you what i'd do next, maybe it will trigger something for you
2005-02-25T14:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 in the mysql-doc package, there's info on how to manually inspect the mysql user table, databasename "mysql"
2005-02-25T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 from there, you can manually force a password change ... but i do suspect there is also an easier way
2005-02-25T14:20:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	i got it .... i just did an apt-get remoe --purge mysql-* and tried again, had to use the -p option though and it now works
2005-02-25T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 great
2005-02-25T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 btw, i do recommend that mysql-doc package too :)
2005-02-25T14:22:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	gotcha :)
2005-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	thanks for the mysql help earlyer, saved my arse a load of troubles :)
2005-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 np, i've been there myself, so only too happy to spare others the misery, heh
2005-02-26T12:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 lol
2005-02-26T12:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 i want the ability to boot to them to be more universal, so i can start carrying a rescue/util dvd :)
2005-02-26T12:26:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	can't you use 'el torito' with DVD ?
2005-02-26T12:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	K-Rich	 well think for a sec ... if i carry my "toolkit" on a dvd, what do i use to boot someone's non-dvd system? :)
2005-02-26T12:29:00.000Z	K-Rich	eyequeue	super glue does LOL
