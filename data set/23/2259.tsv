2009-07-24T03:25:00.000Z	Phuzion		yes Joe, well everyone will have their own opinions on it of course I've had nothing but problems w/ Windows computers
2009-07-24T03:27:00.000Z	Phuzion		Though my problem doesn't seem to be as bad as others in this room, I consistently have problems with Pigeon when tryin to log into my Yahoo ID and only Yahoo, and it completely shuts pigeon down... any suggestions?
2009-07-24T03:27:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	run Pidgin from a terminal and tell us what you see when it unexpectedly quits...
2009-07-24T03:29:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	I opened a terminal, but I'm not exactly sure how to run pidgin from it?
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	it doesn't quit when running from a Terminal or opening by the icon, it only quits when I log into Yahoo, but not AIM
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	try loggin into Yahoo than, while running from the terminal :)
2009-07-24T03:35:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	it tells me Segmentation fault
2009-07-24T03:37:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	well... that's not really helpful.. :) err... anything else?
2009-07-24T03:38:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	that's all It's telling me? I opened Terminal, typed Pidgin, and that is all it gave me
2009-07-24T03:39:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	are you using a HTTP proxy?
2009-07-24T03:40:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	Gnome
2009-07-24T03:43:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	I am using Gnome Proxy Settings
2009-07-24T03:44:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	is everything unchecked there?
2009-07-24T03:46:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	System -> Preferences -> Network proxy and make sure nothing is checked
2009-07-24T03:46:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	I mean direct connection...
2009-07-24T03:47:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	that's correct, direct connection
2009-07-24T03:47:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	yes...
2009-07-24T03:48:00.000Z	Kalmi	Phuzion	well... no proxy bug than... try updating pidgin: http://www.pidgin.im/download/ubuntu/
2009-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	Phuzion	Kalmi	thanks I'll look into that, a friend of mine who turned me on to Ubuntu helped me last time with this issue, we set back Pidgin to the older version, for whatever reason the newest one cause the issue when it was downloaded
