2008-02-15T10:43:00.000Z	Soylent		I guess I need even more help that I thought then
2008-02-15T10:45:00.000Z	Soylent		the shortcuts are set
2008-02-15T10:45:00.000Z	Soylent		they don't work though
2008-02-15T10:45:00.000Z	Soylent		i believe it is because I am forced to use OSS as alsa doesn't support the chipset of my audio card, so the default volume control is not working, lartza
2008-02-15T10:46:00.000Z	Soylent		not with the default volume controller, I have to use ossxmix
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Soylent		note that, when I use my media keys, it does show the icon on the screen that is shown when "changing volume" it just doesn't work since I am not able to use the default volume control
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Soylent		I have no messed with sound conf
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Soylent		ubuntu did not support my sound card
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Soylent		errr alsa
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Soylent		so I had to get OSS

2008-02-15T10:42:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	the guide is for archlinux so it doesnt work in ubuntu i think
2008-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	go System > Setting  > Key shortcuts
2008-02-15T10:45:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	or something like that
2008-02-15T10:46:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	can you change volume?
2008-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	so you have messed up sound conf on purpose or accidently
2008-02-15T10:49:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	when you mess up you.. do something wrong and settings change
2008-02-15T10:51:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	yes i know
2008-02-15T10:52:00.000Z	Lartza_	Soylent	I can't treally help since your using oss, maybe try to find guide how to get your sound card work with alsa?
