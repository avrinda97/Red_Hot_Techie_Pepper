2005-01-21T11:19:00.000Z	trey3	BockBilbo	2.0 is supposed to rule... a lot of speed improvements etc  :)
2005-01-21T11:22:00.000Z	trey3	BockBilbo	new devel branches are started about a week after release of previous version...
2005-01-21T11:23:00.000Z	trey3	BockBilbo	its the Ubuntu way that devels will always USE the devel branch... whereas Debian folks use Sid and don't much care about the devel release "Testing"...
2005-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	trey3	BockBilbo	with devels using the devel branch, bugs will be found and fixes much faster basically because they will be annoying to devels too  :)
