2010-08-14T06:25:00.000Z	xissburg		 this is ridiculous
2010-08-14T06:25:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	you installed wubi, quit windows, rebooted and there was no boot menu?
2010-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	xissburg	Guest79615	yes
2010-08-14T06:28:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	do you have an ubuntu live cd?
2010-08-14T06:30:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	if you don't have a windows usb to reinstall, do you have an ubuntu usb to check the boot
2010-08-14T06:33:00.000Z	xissburg	Guest79615	I'll try it but...its a big download . .
2010-08-14T06:33:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	which
2010-08-14T06:51:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	yep, it sucks, but in future always keep reinstall disk or pendrive handy cause you never know when you'll need them
2010-08-14T06:51:00.000Z	xissburg	Guest79615	after this I'll never install this thing here again...enough
2010-08-14T06:52:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	this sounds like a disk drive problem not a linux problem, just happend to show up when you installed ubuntu
2010-08-14T06:52:00.000Z	xissburg	Guest79615	I can't agree
2010-08-14T06:53:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	then try what i suggested of making bootable usb of ubuntu, reinstalling grub
2010-08-14T06:53:00.000Z	xissburg	Guest79615	I'm downloading it :( takes time . . .
2010-08-14T06:54:00.000Z	Guest79615	xissburg	i feel for ya, good luck
