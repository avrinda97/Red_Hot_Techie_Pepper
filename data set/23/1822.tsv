2010-07-29T17:07:00.000Z	c3l		how do i mount a cdrom? how do I know what fs type it is?
2010-07-29T17:08:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	mount -o loop /file/to/iso /mnt/cdrom
2010-07-29T17:08:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	fstype iso9660 but automatically recognized
2010-07-29T17:09:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	indomiti: that returns mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
2010-07-29T17:09:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	thats ok
2010-07-29T17:09:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	why sr0 ?
2010-07-29T17:10:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	idk, I entered sudo mount /dev/cdrom cdrom, and it also returns mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
2010-07-29T17:11:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	thats wrong, you asked to mount iso, what do you want now?
2010-07-29T17:11:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	sr0 is a physically device
2010-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	sudo mount -o loop file.iso /mnt/mountpoint
2010-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	I want to mount a cdrom. a physical round disk that I insert to my comp ;)
2010-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	ok i understood iso ... then sr0 will be ok and read-only is of course too
2010-07-29T17:13:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	yeah, but it also returns mount: you must specify the filesystem type, and nothing gets mounted
2010-07-29T17:13:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
2010-07-29T17:14:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	maybe add -o ro
2010-07-29T17:15:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	it gives mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error (could this be the IDE device where you in fact use ide-scsi so that sr0 or sda or so is needed?) In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail  or so
2010-07-29T17:16:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	then try /dev/cdrom
2010-07-29T17:16:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	exactly the same erroe
2010-07-29T17:17:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	ubuntu?nautilus mounts it automatically, is it a multi-fs cd? audio with data?
2010-07-29T17:19:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	I was mainly wondering how to do it manually, and the DE tools doesnt really work as im running xmonad and not the standard DE
2010-07-29T17:19:00.000Z	c3l	schnux	nautilus doesnt say anything when I pop in the cd
2010-07-29T17:28:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	is it already mounted? $ mount
2010-07-29T17:29:00.000Z	schnux	c3l	or $ df
