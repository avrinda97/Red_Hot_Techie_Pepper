2006-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Tells people about #ubuntu-es
2006-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Try the umount command with the device instead of the mount point
2006-04-26T10:16:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	If you put a # before the line it will disable it, but you don't have to enter it all again later if you want it back
2006-04-26T10:16:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Don't unmount /dev or /
2006-04-26T10:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	What else do you have mounted? If you have /usr or something it might be gone now :(
2006-04-26T10:20:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	That looks OK, maybe you want uid=yourusername on those ntfs ones? Make sure you have read/write permission on the folder /hda1 and stuff to change what's ion them
2006-04-26T10:22:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	What I meant anyway was that the FOLDER you were putting it in had write permission (chown yourusername folder) not the device. Anyway I should have spotted the ntfs read only thing
2006-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Microsoft haven't told anyone how NTFS actually works (and it's not as simple as fat32) so there are people gradually working it out. So far they know how to get data (read) but not write
2006-04-26T10:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	You would have to put your drive in another XP computer
2006-04-26T10:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	You learnt a lot :)
2006-04-26T10:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Writing?
2006-04-26T10:31:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	If you resize your partitions with a Live CD and add a fat32 one then you can store your documents and stuff on it (to read/write with windows and linux)
2006-04-26T10:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	As long as they are not being accessed (mounted) at the time (so boot from a CD)
2006-04-26T10:34:00.000Z	Warbo	Cassidy123	Just shrink Windows (then boot it, so it will be checked and fixed by Windows) and you will be fine
