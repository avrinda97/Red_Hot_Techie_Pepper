2006-12-31T08:43:00.000Z	KenThomson		HELP: I plugged in my Microphone, and started to do recording via Sound and Video>Sound recorder, at first i thought no recording was being done, but on sticking my ear to the speaker i heard a extremely faint recording. SO i turned up all the volumes, but still the recording is done at such low volume that the output is not AUDIBLE. PLease help how do i change the volume at which the mic records? IN volume control>MIcrophone, i have set full volume for mic
2006-12-31T08:43:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	there usually is a microphone boost setting
2006-12-31T08:43:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	try alsamixer in a terminal
2006-12-31T08:43:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	ok
2006-12-31T08:44:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	Mic boost  (+20db) [off] , how do i turn it on?
2006-12-31T08:45:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	hit the m
2006-12-31T08:45:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	move with  cursor keys to the thing and hit m
2006-12-31T08:45:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	ok it worked, and then i simply close the terminal window or what?
2006-12-31T08:46:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	hit escape to close alsamixer or simply close the window
2006-12-31T08:46:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	still the recording is done at almost-silent volume, what do i do?
2006-12-31T08:47:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	open alsamixer again, hit tab until you've switched to recording view and then look at the volume indicators
2006-12-31T08:48:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	view: [playback]  [capture]  [all] , which one? and once there what do i see?
2006-12-31T08:49:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	capture, you'll see a similar screen to what you see now
2006-12-31T08:49:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	in the "capture" view, when i speak in the mic, no meters/bars are moving when i speak in the mic
2006-12-31T08:50:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	no, they indicate the current volum settings, use arrow keys to change
2006-12-31T08:50:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	in fact, in none of the three modes, any bars/meters are moving as i speak into the mic
2006-12-31T08:51:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	ok
2006-12-31T08:51:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	It worked, you are my HERO!!! :) :) :)
2006-12-31T08:52:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	you're welcome :)
2006-12-31T08:53:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	Shouldn't they have given a GUI way of doing these things, or are you going to sit around here helping all the people who have a simple mic? :) (no offence whatsoever meant)
2006-12-31T08:53:00.000Z	Seveas	KenThomson	the gui in applications -> sound & video can do this as well, but I forgot the details and was too lazy too look it up (or open the application)
2006-12-31T08:54:00.000Z	KenThomson	Seveas	looks, i better get comfortable with the GUI before i loose my patience with Linux, if i want to make any foray into the Linux world :)
