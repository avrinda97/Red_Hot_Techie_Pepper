2009-11-18T22:19:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	 Your initrd file is broken.  Boot from an older kernel, if you have one installed.
2009-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	i tried the other previous two .. no luck :(
2009-11-18T22:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	Use the LiveCD to start the computer, and reinstall the kernel.
2009-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	so i should do what? put the livecd .. boot to it .. and then?
2009-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	In the LiveCD boot menu, look for a "rescue" option.  (I don't remember the specific name.)  If that doesn't work, you need to do it from the LiveCD desktop.
2009-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	im in the cd menu .. what should i do please? install / boot from first hard disk?
2009-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	Dunno.  Try your luck.  You need the option that starts the kernel from the CD-ROM, but uses the hard disk as root.
2009-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	if i press f6 i get acpi=off / noapic / nolapic / edd=on .. has it anything t do ?
2009-11-18T22:28:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	 / DasEi2 should i change the boot options line? is it that one which you told me to do ?
2009-11-18T22:29:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	I'm looking at the documentation in the ubottu link, but I don't see the repair option that you need. :P
2009-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	any other idea except from the menu please?
2009-11-18T22:35:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	Start the LiveCD and do a filesystem check.  Do a web search, or try this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=161922#post161922
2009-11-18T22:36:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	If a filesystem check doesn't repair the system, then you need to remove and reinstall the kernel, which is more difficult.  I don't see a good howto, and I probably don't have enough time to walk you through it.
2009-11-18T22:37:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	 Terminal window, with the `fsck` program.
2009-11-18T22:37:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	Yes.
2009-11-18T22:38:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	`fsck -v  -c /dev/sda1` probably.  The "/dev/sda1" should be the hard disk name.
2009-11-18T22:39:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	please note that /home is on another physical hard disk here .. does it change something ?
2009-11-18T22:40:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	No, because the system in the root ("/") filesystem isn't getting that far.
2009-11-18T22:40:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	If you had a hardware fault that broke one filesystem, then fsck the other filesystems if you have time.
2009-11-18T22:40:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	You can get a list of names from the "/proc/filesystems" file.
2009-11-18T22:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	Oops, wrong file.  Try /proc/partitions instead.
2009-11-18T22:46:00.000Z	Yancho	dajhorn	/ DasEi2 should i use e2fsck or fsck ?
2009-11-18T22:47:00.000Z	dajhorn	Yancho	`fsck` is a wrapper for the filesystem-specific checkers.  You can use either.
