2012-09-03T09:44:00.000Z	Guddu	ActionParsnip	 ^ Your help please
2012-09-03T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guddu	isn't that your ISP's connection, or do you have the same IP each tuime?
2012-09-03T09:45:00.000Z	Guddu	ActionParsnip	 Yes. It is my ISP. But IP would change each time I am sure.
2012-09-03T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guddu	then you want to use  DHCP for that interface
2012-09-03T09:46:00.000Z	Guddu	ActionParsnip	 With DHCP won't my IP change after restart?
2012-09-03T09:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guddu	yes but your connection doesn't have a static IP
2012-09-03T09:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guddu	or no-ip
2012-09-03T09:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guddu	both services have a client app to update the IP with th service so if your IP does change the service gets notified
