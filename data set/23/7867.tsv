2005-04-13T13:27:00.000Z	Whiffle	caffinated	yeah
2005-04-13T13:29:00.000Z	caffinated	Whiffle	yes.  it's not a point-and-click-easy install, but it does work once you jump the hoops
2005-04-13T13:29:00.000Z	Whiffle	caffinated	sounds like linux :D
2005-04-13T13:31:00.000Z	Whiffle	caffinated	is right, my computer would probably catch fire if I put a HL2 disk anywhere near it
2005-04-13T13:33:00.000Z	caffinated	Whiffle	SATA is really nice these days.  raid a few of those up and you could have some blazing speed.

2005-04-13T13:35:00.000Z	caffinated	Whiffle	well, that's getting in to "it matters who you buy the card from"

2005-04-13T13:41:00.000Z	caffinated	Whiffle	*shrug* the irony of seeing it work on a linux desktop? ;)
