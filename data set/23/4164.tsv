2008-10-24T15:54:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		The desktop background of my brothers computer just whent black, all icons gone... menues and bars are left... he can switch between the sides of the compiz cube...
2008-10-24T15:55:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		rebooting doesnt help...
2008-10-24T15:56:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	nautilus crashed, opening a new nautilus window (select anything from the places menu) should fix it
2008-10-24T15:56:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	ill call and tell him that!
2008-10-24T16:00:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	hmm... the window opened but the background is still black and no icons...
2008-10-24T16:01:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	hmm.. does he get a menu when he right-clicks the desktop?
2008-10-24T16:01:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	nope
2008-10-24T16:02:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	tell him to try running nautilus from the command line
2008-10-24T16:03:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	that opened a file browser... nothing else
2008-10-24T16:04:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	maybe he somehow configured nautilus to to manage the desktop, let me search where is that configured, also, maybe he tried using some kind of an automatic wallpaper setting application?
2008-10-24T16:06:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	thanks! (he didnt use any wallpaper app)
2008-10-24T16:07:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	run gconf-editor from the command line, go into appd->nautilus->preferences and make sure "show_desktop" is checked
2008-10-24T16:07:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	run gconf-editor from the command line, go into apps->nautilus->preferences and make sure "show_desktop" is checked
2008-10-24T16:10:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	that was already checked
2008-10-24T16:12:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	hmm... lest try brute force... run "xkill" click on the desktop then run "sudo killall nautilus" from the command line then try running nautilus again
2008-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	'xkill' from the terminal?
2008-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	yeah
2008-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	of all that doesn't work, try turning off desktop effects
2008-10-24T16:17:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	'sudo killall nautilus' made everything come back, no need to restart nautilus... now what? :) problem solved?
2008-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	seems so, make sure it stays ok after reboot
2008-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	great! rebooting! any idea what might have caused this and how to avoid it?
2008-10-24T16:20:00.000Z	ifireball	NorthByNorthWest	some nautilus glitch. no idea
2008-10-24T16:27:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	ifireball	everything is OK! many thanks! :)
