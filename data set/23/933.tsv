2011-02-20T22:32:00.000Z	digirak		hi i need some help with my c compiler
2011-02-20T22:32:00.000Z	digirak		is there anyway i can see the cause of a segfault
2011-02-20T22:33:00.000Z	digirak		using stack trace or whatever
2011-02-20T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	do you know how to read a stack trace ?
2011-02-20T22:35:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	yes ideally yes
2011-02-20T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	you should get a file in the current working directory for most segfaults
2011-02-20T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	what application is sefaulting
2011-02-20T22:36:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	codelite
2011-02-20T22:36:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	but its actually an executable
2011-02-20T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	not familier with that application, is it from the ubuntu repos ?
2011-02-20T22:37:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	i am compiling code and executing c-code
2011-02-20T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	that's not what I asked, is the application from the ubuntu repos
2011-02-20T22:37:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	no actually it inst the appln its my code
2011-02-20T22:37:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	yes
2011-02-20T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	what version/arch of ubuntu are you using ?
2011-02-20T22:38:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	10.10
2011-02-20T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	32/64bit ?
2011-02-20T22:38:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	i386
2011-02-20T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	I've not got a 32bit machine to hand, so I can't test to see if it's a generic failure, sorry
2011-02-20T22:39:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	no is there some generic way to read the stakctrace?
2011-02-20T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	digirak	it should have put a dump file in the current working directory, unless as erUSUL suggested it's disabled
2011-02-20T22:40:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	oh ok.. will check that out
2011-02-20T22:40:00.000Z	digirak	ikonia	thanks
