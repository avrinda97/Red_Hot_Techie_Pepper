2010-03-22T07:12:00.000Z	poagester		maybe someone can assist me with installing ubuntu with windows xp installed first. i get the following error when trying to boot from the live disk: unable to find a medium containing a live file system
2010-03-22T07:13:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	a bad burn on the cd? It's not even getting to first base..
2010-03-22T07:14:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	second burn at lowest speed of my burner with the same result. I was able to use wubi and install it that way but it stops a a grub cli
2010-03-22T07:17:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	will it help more if I tell you it does it with 9.10 and 9.04
2010-03-22T07:19:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	you're saying you can't boot any of 9.10 and 9.04?
2010-03-22T07:19:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	that is correct
2010-03-22T07:21:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	is your cdrom know to work ok in windows (I presume that's how you burned the cds?). Otherwise, if it's not the cdrom, I'd have to guess there's something in your hardware that's incompatible with Ubuntu...
2010-03-22T07:22:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	I burned the disks using k3b on my gentoo box, no problems yet with that burner. I am just not familiar with how ubuntu works. the drives in the box i am trying to install ubuntu on are a little sketchy, because the box isn't mine. I just want to dual boot it and get it out of here
2010-03-22T07:23:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	I'd try one more time with 8.04. It's the most stable release and uses grub1 while 9.X uses grub2...
2010-03-22T07:24:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	k, I wasn't sure if that version was still supported
2010-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	ill give it a shot and be back in a few hours if it doesn't work. thanx for your help
2010-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	sadly, I'll probably still be here...
2010-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	youre like me
2010-03-22T07:27:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	lots of nerds here. I feel at home...
2010-03-22T10:32:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	even with 8.04 ?
2010-03-22T10:32:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	yes
2010-03-22T10:33:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	you could try unetbootin, I suppose. http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ It's supposed to allow a cd-less install...
2010-03-22T10:35:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	the name is a little misleading ;-)
2010-03-22T10:35:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	I suppose it is...
2010-03-22T10:36:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	so i could take the drive that i want it installed to out of the other box and use unetbootin to install ubuntu on it right
2010-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	yes, you could. Or you theoretically install ubuntu onto a disk using a windows box...
2010-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	poagester	Losha	I don't always think of the easy ways, thanx
2010-03-22T10:40:00.000Z	Losha	poagester	I have made a virtue out of being lazy...
