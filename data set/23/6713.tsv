2006-01-27T10:28:00.000Z	frazmanw	Zugot	"it worked" but accelleration did not, until I installed fglrx and changed my xorg.conf file
2006-01-27T10:28:00.000Z	Zugot	frazmanw	itdidn't work at all... as a matter of fact it didn't even configure x
2006-01-27T10:29:00.000Z	frazmanw	Zugot	I did not have that problem at all. hmmm

2006-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	Zugot	frazmanw	i can get around it (i'm used to the old days), just a minor inconvience
2006-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	frazmanw	Zugot	so do you have X working now then, or are you getting around at command line?
2006-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	Zugot	frazmanw	i'm on the command line
