2007-01-28T17:20:00.000Z	AmbientMstr		I require assistance reinstalling GRUB. My damn Windows installation somehow removed it and now only boots in Windows but I know my other partitions are still there and functional cause I've looked in GParted's livecd. I tried a system rescue disk and GRUB encountered an I/O error. Help. I don't wanna have to go through this crap.
