2011-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	Why do you need sakis3g? NetworkManager which ubuntu comes with already handles it
2011-03-29T06:38:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	apparently not, the key is a zte k3806-z and network manager wont let me connect, goes to it, lights turn on but then keeps saying disconnected
2011-03-29T06:38:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	have you ever used it or know what it is ? (i know its a script but i actually cant, due to job review the code =/)
2011-03-29T06:39:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	I have never heard of it.. I'm looking up info for your key.
2011-03-29T06:39:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	so kind of you
2011-03-29T06:41:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	Is this from Vodafone by chance?
2011-03-29T06:41:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	yes it is
2011-03-29T06:41:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	if you need further details ask please, not sure what you may want to know
2011-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	I am ready a long set of posts which seem to relate to you: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1681372
2011-03-29T06:47:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	opening, mind you im on that key right now lol
2011-03-29T06:47:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	so rather slow loading up
2011-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	I have a 3G stick, so I can kind of guess the speed, mind you I don't have your stick. (Just a E1691/UMG1691)
2011-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	in the first link he says "ill let u know" and disappears, apparently it didnt work, and people suggested that script too
2011-03-29T06:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	I'm reading page 2 of the posts.. doesn't look solved yet
2011-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	its what i said , in a week we ll know...probably lol but id need that key now, its a present for someone, not one id use
2011-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	Though.. how are you connected right now if it doesn't work?
2011-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	saski3g whatever the name was
2011-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	i started it it asked me admin pass (i freaked out) and now im on
2011-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	do you have any other idea?
2011-03-29T06:57:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	Unfortunately I am not an expert in the field with you key.. this is the first time I've seen it be needed.. so how is this sakis3g not working to your satisfaction?
2011-03-29T06:58:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	sakis3g is working like a charm, my question was if anyone knew it or checked its source, im a lil paranoid you see, i dont want to trust it blindly but due to my job i dont have time to check the source, so i was asking if somene did
2011-03-29T06:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Epzis	You will have to keep asking since I won't be able to help in that sense. but it might be normal to ask for administor permission to add a device.
2011-03-29T06:59:00.000Z	Epzis	Diamondcite	ye but doesnt that name give you the creep ? lol
