2009-05-30T06:35:00.000Z	fryguy		why not just run quake in native linux?
2009-05-30T06:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	in JohnnyVbox's case i think it would be native Windows
2009-05-30T06:36:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	why? he's running linux as the host OS
2009-05-30T06:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	are you sure about that
2009-05-30T06:36:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	yes
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	yup
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	and what exactly are you benchmarking?
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	sorry?
2009-05-30T06:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	not it isn't xinerama is one big screen, i think neoTheCat knows what he wants
2009-05-30T06:44:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	xinerama is most definetely NOT one big screen, unless the window manager you are using is treating it incorrectly
2009-05-30T06:45:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	i run xinerama on my dual screen setup and can control the contents of each screen individually
2009-05-30T06:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	read the first line of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinerama
2009-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	read the rest of the article, and take some time to actually set up a xinerama configuration and use it with a window manager that correctly supports the extension
2009-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	note the references to 'active physical display'
2009-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fryguy	i don't want to argue with you
2009-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	?
2009-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	most programs know how to detach from a terminal
2009-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	and screen won't help you
2009-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	xpra would be the solution, or just run from a non-shell
2009-05-30T07:28:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	no
2009-05-30T07:28:00.000Z	fryguy	ZykoticK9	darwin is written completely in house at apple
