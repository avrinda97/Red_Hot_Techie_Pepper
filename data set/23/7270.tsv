2005-09-15T14:08:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		well, i couldn't install a boot loader
2005-09-15T14:08:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		ha, yeah
2005-09-15T14:08:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		yeah
2005-09-15T14:08:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		that's what i have
2005-09-15T14:09:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		yeah
2005-09-15T14:09:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		i have windows in another partition
2005-09-15T14:09:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		i would say running but, well, it's not
2005-09-15T14:10:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		basically all that happens is the list of devices connected to the motherboard comes up, which happens normally right before windows boots
2005-09-15T14:11:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		after the list comes up, it says, "DISK BOOT FAILURE; INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"
2005-09-15T14:12:00.000Z	EtherealPurple		and i didn't install a boot loader because the grub and the other one had fatal errors
2005-09-15T14:12:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	did you use the manual partition editor when you were installing?
2005-09-15T14:12:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	if you did, that would be what broke it
2005-09-15T14:43:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	sometimes they can be messy.... have you tried using lilo?
2005-09-15T14:48:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	should i install the LILO boot loader on the master boot partition or the new ubuntu partition?
2005-09-15T14:48:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	try the mbr first
2005-09-15T14:48:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	how do i do that?
2005-09-15T14:49:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	i can't remember sorry, haven't used lilo for years
2005-09-15T14:49:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	would the mbr be the master boot partition?
2005-09-15T14:53:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	can i not install a boot loader and still run windows if it has the boot flag?
2005-09-15T14:54:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	installing the boot loader should mean you can choose to boot windows or linux
2005-09-15T15:00:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	how would i go about repairing my windows installation?
2005-09-15T15:01:00.000Z	EtherealPurple	funkyHat	was that directed at me?
2005-09-15T15:03:00.000Z	funkyHat	EtherealPurple	yes. lol
