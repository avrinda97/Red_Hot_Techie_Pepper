2008-05-21T22:06:00.000Z	European-African		hello, what is xmms2 in the spm? when I install it does not appear in the Applications? is this because it is actually a addon for xmms, or do I access it from a different menu?
2008-05-21T22:08:00.000Z	European-African		﻿kitche: ok, so I should just install xmms?
2008-05-21T22:09:00.000Z	European-African		﻿kitche: why ﻿audacious? xmms has a gui!
2008-05-21T22:11:00.000Z	European-African		﻿Rixon-: doesn't xmms have its own gui?
