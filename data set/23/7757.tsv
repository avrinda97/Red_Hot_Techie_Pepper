2005-05-04T15:05:00.000Z	buulian		does anyone have an idea of what program to use to payback m4a files
2005-05-04T15:05:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	mplayer will do it, as will realplayer10
2005-05-04T15:07:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	can you type "which realplay"
2005-05-04T15:08:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	:)
2005-05-04T15:08:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	that's useful to know
2005-05-04T15:09:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	/opt/RealPlayer/realplay ?
2005-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	what architecture are you on?
2005-05-04T15:30:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	https://player.helixcommunity.org/2004/downloads/
2005-05-04T15:30:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	get the installer, not the RPM
2005-05-04T15:35:00.000Z	buulian	djm62	it says that the file cannot be displayed
2005-05-04T15:36:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	where does it say that?
2005-05-04T15:37:00.000Z	buulian	djm62	on the screen
2005-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	um...I guessed on the screen
2005-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	what do you do before it says that
2005-05-04T15:39:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	you click on the file in nautilus (file manager)?
2005-05-04T15:39:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	ok, cool (you can think of the desktop as being a window of nautilus without borders)
2005-05-04T15:40:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	can you open a terminal?
2005-05-04T15:40:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	have you got a terminal open?
2005-05-04T15:41:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	type "cd ~/Desktop"
2005-05-04T15:41:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	then chmod +x (whatever your realplayer download was called)
2005-05-04T15:42:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	done that?
2005-05-04T15:42:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	sudo ./(that same file name)
2005-05-04T15:49:00.000Z	djm62	buulian	is subtle
