2005-12-19T13:35:00.000Z	siriusnova		Anyone here run Ubuntu on a thinkpad?
2005-12-19T13:36:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	x41-2527 here.
2005-12-19T13:36:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- how does it run, any install problems? what isn't supported?
2006-05-14T11:49:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	alsa
2006-05-14T11:49:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	everything should use alsa if possible
2006-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- are you here?
2006-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	yes, please use the channel, thanks
2006-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- i see that you found the problem with the thinkpad ACPI issue, when can we expect it to be in the repositories?
2006-06-19T06:34:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	-  i mean that you fixed the problem, i was just wondering when it will hit the repositories
2006-06-19T06:36:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	I didn't fix it; Matthew did. An updated acpi-support will be in the archive when our release manager approves it. Give it some time; the rest of the devs in Paris are probably just arriving, so I wouldn't expect it to be approved for -updates until tomorrow morning localtime (I'm EDT, -0400 GMT).
2006-06-19T09:26:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- are you here?
2006-06-19T09:26:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	again, Matthew pinpointed it; I only made that clear.
2006-06-19T09:27:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	again, the rest of the devs are in Paris or on their way there, so it will be a good seven or eight hours before I'd expect any movement.
2006-06-19T09:28:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- how does the patching work, do we just aptitude dist-upgrade ?
2006-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	siriusnova	we won't be updating the kernel. It's an updated acpi-support package.
2006-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	siriusnova	crimsun	- oh ok
