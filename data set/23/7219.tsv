2005-11-17T14:30:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	ok
2005-11-17T14:32:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	didn't do anything
2005-11-17T14:32:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	who owns that file ?!

2005-11-17T14:33:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	it also told me to change permissions to 644... not 600
2005-11-17T14:33:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	what's the home dir permissions ?
2005-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	lemme check
2005-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	I don't know what's wrong with your setup, but I have 600 and It is ok.
2005-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	home is 777... that a problem?
2005-11-17T14:35:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	I don't know, but having home 777 is .... a very weird idea.
2005-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	what do you suggest, like 744?
2005-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	do you know the meaning of these numbers ?!

2005-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	sobersabre	Fearan	it is actually almost equal to 700 :)
2005-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	owner has rwx, group has r, others have r
2005-11-17T14:38:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	ok
2005-11-17T14:39:00.000Z	Fearan	sobersabre	i'll just do 700
