2004-11-06T10:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jay	open a terminal and do : locate icons | grep gnome | grep smb
2004-11-06T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jay	that brings up a few results here - your mileage may vary
2004-11-06T10:38:00.000Z	jay		found it great thanks in /usr/share/icons
2004-11-06T10:43:00.000Z	jay		i need help... how do i make a shortcut for an smb share on my desktop?

2004-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	jay		ah ok
2004-11-06T10:48:00.000Z	jay		no java still :(
2004-11-06T10:48:00.000Z	jay		no apt-get install java
2004-11-06T10:48:00.000Z	jay		:(
2004-11-06T10:49:00.000Z	jay		any other way around getting java in ubuntu
2004-11-06T10:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jay	java is "non-free" in the liberty/open sense - you wil have to go to the sun website to get it, unless you can locate a working blackdown java apt source (currently an issue)
2004-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	jay	thoreauputic	ok thanks
2004-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	jay		i forget how to install the tar from sun
2004-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	jay		so i guess i will wait on that
2004-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jay	read the instructions, if all else fails ;)
