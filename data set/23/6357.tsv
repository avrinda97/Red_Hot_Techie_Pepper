2006-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	NoobSauce		anyone know how to install nvidia drivers on amd64?
2006-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	NoobSauce		I'm a total linux noob
2006-05-03T13:23:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Install the Ubuntu package.
2006-05-03T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	You need to add the 'restricted' repository.
2006-05-03T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Yes, slightly outdated (The latest kenrel is 2.6.15-21-amd64-k8)
2006-05-03T13:27:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	outdated? how do I go backwards from my kernel then?
2006-05-03T14:40:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Yes, if you're on the amd64 system, use k8. (It's marginally more optimised)
2006-05-03T14:41:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	I presonally run mine on a with -k7 (32 bit)
2006-05-03T14:41:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	It depends on what you intend to sue the machine for.
2006-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	If you need or want java and flash browser plugins, go 32bit.
2006-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	yeah, then I gotta go 32-bit... I need Java unfortunately
2006-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	There's not much difference in performance if you don't do much video processing or compiling.
2006-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	there *is* java, but not a java plugin for 64bit.
2006-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	thanks for telling me that, if I finally got nvidia drivers to install, and then found that out after the fact, I would be really upset
2006-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	<heh>
2006-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	what's teh difference between java and java plugin? you mean for firefox and stuff?
2006-05-03T14:44:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Yes. java as in 'command line' and 'java applications in X' works fine. Applets in the browser do not.
2006-05-03T14:45:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Then you can just fetch the amd64 jre or jdk from sun, which works fine.
2006-05-03T14:46:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Whatcha need linux headers for?
2006-05-03T14:46:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	for getting the nvidia drivers to work
2006-05-03T14:47:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	You don't need headers for those, or do any compilation. They are completely prepackaged.
2006-05-03T14:47:00.000Z	NoobSauce	cafuego	none of those have worked though
2006-05-03T15:12:00.000Z	cafuego	NoobSauce	Xgl is alraedy in dapper (and mainly working fine)
