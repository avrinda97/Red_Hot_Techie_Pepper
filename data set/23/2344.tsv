2009-06-03T14:02:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	I think he means channel operators
2009-06-03T14:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	freenode policy
2009-06-10T01:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	you don't have firestarter running
2009-06-10T01:56:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	how can you tell?
2009-06-10T01:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	the result you're getting is the grep firestarter
2009-06-10T01:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	the pipe sign | separates two commands
2009-06-10T01:57:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	doesn't ps aux show all running processes? and then grep is just used to search through them?
2009-06-10T01:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	but grep is returned as well, because it's a process of it's own
2009-06-10T01:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	if you're trying to get rid of the firewall rules you've set up with firestarter, you need to keep in mind that firestarter is only a frontend to iptables
2009-06-10T01:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	and you can't turn iptables off - if you want to get rid of the rules you need to do it either with iptables itself or firestarter
2009-06-10T01:59:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	i can connect to my ubuntu machine via ssh from another computer behind my lan but my ubuntu machine cannot get on the internet... any ideas? (my router is allowing the internal ip that i have assigned to eth1 to connect to the net)
2009-06-10T02:00:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	does that other computer have ssh server installed then?
2009-06-10T02:00:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	i'm using putty to connect to the ubuntu machine. but ubuntu can't get on google.com or ping yahoo.com, etc.....
2009-06-10T02:01:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	can you use telnet to check if it's the browser doing that? "telnet google.com 80"
2009-06-10T02:02:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	telnet: could not resolve google.com/80: Name or service not known
2009-06-10T02:02:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	no, it isn't
2009-06-10T02:03:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	what'd i do wrong then?
2009-06-10T02:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	ok, so you indeed have problem with your ubuntu, not just the browser
2009-06-10T02:03:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	i know :)
2009-06-10T02:03:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	how do i go about fixing it?
2009-06-10T02:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	``y7	tbh, I personally don't have faintest idea
2009-06-10T03:19:00.000Z	``y7	Myrtti	all this hassle and it appears to be my eth0 nic that is no good
