2007-04-29T12:16:00.000Z	KurtKraut		On Feisty, when I enable the 'desktop effects', the effects are properly loaded, but I lose the windows borders. Is there a way to fix it ?
2007-04-29T12:16:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	re-enable your graphics card using System->Administrion->Restricted Manager drivers.
2007-04-29T12:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	re-enable the graphic card after enabling the desktop effects ?
2007-04-29T12:17:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	you need to re-enable the driver
2007-04-29T12:17:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	you installed the driver manually didn't you..
2007-04-29T12:18:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	yes, I did. And it is already loaded properly.
2007-04-29T12:18:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	then disable and re-enable it using the Restricted Driver Manager. worked for me. needs to add an extra line in your xorg.conf
2007-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	if you add this line yourself, dpkg will consider your config to be 'customised' and so it won't be upgraded. use the manager instead.
2007-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	can you tell me what line is it ? I'm disabling it now thru Restricted Driver Manager and is removing from APT the driver !
2007-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	that's normal. don't worry.
2007-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	ok
2007-04-29T12:30:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	I did what you said and it worked perfectly. Thanks for your help :D
2007-04-29T12:30:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	great.. i can't remember what it was but ;)
2007-04-29T12:30:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	ahah the restricted manager re-enabling. cool
2007-04-29T12:30:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	it was about enabling the desktop effects.
2007-04-29T12:31:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	great.
2007-04-29T12:31:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	I cant remeber how to spin the cube. There is any wiki listing the enabled commands and effects ?
2007-04-29T12:31:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	it should be CTRL-ALT-ArrowLeft
2007-04-29T12:32:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	i had to enable a few desktops and log out and back in for some reason before it worked. don't know why.
2007-04-29T12:32:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	oh, it just worked out ot the box
2007-04-29T12:32:00.000Z	delire	KurtKraut	cool ;)
2007-04-29T12:32:00.000Z	KurtKraut	delire	thank you again
