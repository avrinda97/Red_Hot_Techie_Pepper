2006-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle		digitalninja: How should I know?
2006-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle		:)
2006-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle		digitalninja: I do know something about it, but unfortunately not everything. I never had a reason to run it. ;)
2006-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: A) Yes, and B) Why would you want it?
2006-10-24T14:29:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	a) where? b) I try to install ubuntu to Dell PE1950, it has RAID (needs megaraid something, which is not included in 6.06.1) and it needs bnx2 network driver (not included in 6.06.1)
2006-10-24T14:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: For raid you'll need the alternate install cd found on http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06.1/ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso (for x86 platforms) and the bnx2 driver is indeed included in 6.06.1. However if you do insist on using 6.06 you can find the releases on http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
2006-10-24T14:33:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	this is related: https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/dell-server-improvement
2006-10-24T14:34:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	Ok, I need to try the alternative install. However the standard installation doesn't recognize Broadcom network interfaces
2006-10-24T14:34:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	The link you gave includes 6.06.1
2006-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: It would appear so. However on the alternate install you can manually load drivers that are not recognized correctly. You can also load the driver on the live cd using: sudo modprobe <drivername> in a terminal and then set it up with something like sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart (provided that the /etc/network/interfaces file is set up correctly even if there is not detected a network interface at boot)
2006-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: The first link, yes. The last link is for 6.06
2006-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: hold on.
2006-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	last link states 6.06.1 on the page..
2006-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: You are right. There is actually 6.06.1 files in the 6.06 directory. :)
2006-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	Yeah, I've noticed, 6.06 is completely vanished :) Someone wrote that 6.06 would work directly without any manual steps during install
2006-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: I am sorry, but that's an awful miss by me. I assumed that since there was a 6.06 and a 6.06.1 directory on the mirrors that you could d/l the 6.06 image. :/
2006-10-24T14:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: Still, using the alternate cd you should be able to set up raid properly. I for one use a single drive for linux and the raid drives for important data so for me the raid is set up automagically. :)
2006-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ubotu	tell music_man_nz about enter
2006-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	I'll give alternative install cd a try, it should be easier this time because I found out which modules I need :)
2006-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle		harriv: :)
2006-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	it was "megaraid_sas"
2006-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	story can be read from here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=226114
2006-10-24T14:42:00.000Z	Harriv	BlueEagle	similar hardware, same problems
