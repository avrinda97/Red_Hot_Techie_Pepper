2008-08-09T04:11:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		for some reason, when ubuntu boots, it goes to a black screen
2008-08-09T04:11:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		can someone help me with this?
2008-08-09T04:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	that is normal at least for me it is, if login screen pops up afterwards your good to go
2008-08-09T04:13:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	the login screen never pops up. I can get to a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+1
2008-08-09T04:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	did you do a network insatll or a normal install of ubuntu? if you did normal install when booting do you get any messages that could be errors and does it send you straight to bash (cli) if so have you tried command startx
2008-08-09T04:15:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	I did a normal install. I got no errors, and it keeps me at the black screen. Doesn't send me to bash. When I run startx, it says the xserver is already running.
2008-08-09T04:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	no error/normal messages when booting than it sends you straight to a black screen with nothing on it? sound like you havent got a windows manager and what you see is xorg but that aint right cause xorg allows command input
2008-08-09T04:19:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	sorry... I guess I should have phrased that better. It doesn't output to a monitor. My monitor says no signal found unless I press ctrl+alt+1
2008-08-09T04:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	oh did you setup xorg properly type command gksudo displayconfig-gtk and set monitor display properly and type of board you got, that might help but no sure. Im also checking online
2008-08-09T04:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=121819 someoen with the same problem as you i believe found this in google by typing "ubuntu boot black screen" without quotes
2008-08-09T04:23:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	you didn tell me you had ATI card :/ you should state that, it explains check your drivers, see if your using the correct ones and check that post
2008-08-09T04:23:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	I've seen that before unfortunately :( It'll get the xserver running right again, but at a super low resolution and then I can't use compiz
2008-08-09T04:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	thats the point get xorg running super low and increase it afterwards, your literally redoing your setting untill you find something good "posts #5&6 seem to have complimented each other"
2008-08-09T04:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	might have been an update you did not sure but try redoing xorg might or might not help
2008-08-23T04:25:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	what kind of IBM?
2008-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	desktop IBM "son know mob type" the bios startup is split between primary startup sequence & automatic startup sequence other than that i dont know what else i can say
2008-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	model would be nice... other wise I'm not really sure
2008-08-23T04:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	got the mob open where can i check for model
2008-08-23T04:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	ibm thinkcentre does that help by any chance
2008-08-23T04:30:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	did you try turning on your computer and pressing F8 to get to the boot load menu?
2008-08-23T04:31:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Pirate_Hunter	if you haven't tried the F8, I'd say try that. other wise I can't really help
2008-08-23T04:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	yeah frigging useless let me type the sticker found on the low-right-side on top of the usb
2008-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ShdwShinobi	thingy: MT-M 8187-D1G & S/N KKFDB8X this is from the case and not from the inside
