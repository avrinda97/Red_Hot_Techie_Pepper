2010-12-27T18:10:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Right. Installing that atm.
2010-12-27T18:11:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Yeah. I ran it. CONFIG FILE NOT LOADED. :(
2010-12-27T18:17:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	There also are FreeNode - #eggdrop, #egghelp
2010-12-27T18:18:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	http://www.egghelp.org/files.htm#config
2010-12-27T18:19:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	There are simple.conf if you want that.
2010-12-27T18:19:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	But?
2010-12-27T18:21:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Yes.
2010-12-27T18:22:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Pastebin your conf file. I'll use it.
2010-12-27T18:22:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	This is fine.
2010-12-27T18:23:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Many copynpasta. :(
2010-12-27T18:26:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Correct. From the look of it. You have to apply your user to this particular folder, maybe.
2010-12-27T18:28:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	I'm trying to find the command. I think it have to do with s+ something. I'm not familiar with all permissions.
2010-12-27T18:34:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	No sweat. This looks fun. simple.conf -- you fixed line 96? Something about error.
2010-12-27T18:38:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	1300~ lines. Meh.
2010-12-27T18:42:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	I'm trying to find what I'm missing for eggdrop.conf
2010-12-27T18:43:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	[07:41] * Please make sure you edit your config file completely.
2010-12-27T18:53:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Ah. I give up. :\
2010-12-27T18:53:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	I ran it -- but I don't see my bot in my channel. Oh noe.
2010-12-27T18:55:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Nope. It whined about modules (but not selected an encryption). Nothing about no channel file because I created one.
2010-12-27T18:56:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	~/Desktop/eggdrop.conf
2010-12-27T19:00:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	I don't think so.
2010-12-27T19:00:00.000Z	red2kic_	SubstreamAI	Meh. I'm going back n the other machine. Later. :o
