2010-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	gary_maurizi		help! i pretty much KNOW my bind setup is correct, but dig is failing & host -a maurizi.lan finds maurizi.lan @ 192.168.1.1 but continues to look for ¨maurizi.lan.maurizi.lan¨ and fails. where is my syntax error ? i think its something with my hostname/hosts file/resolv.conf
2010-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	are you reloading/refreshing after changes?
2010-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	yeah i am. One sec and ill pastebin all related files if needed.
2010-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	sure
2010-03-06T07:05:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	here is every related file you should need (and more): http://pastebin.com/E5pT4t86
2010-03-06T07:14:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	I'm looking through your files now...
2010-03-06T07:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	in your zones file, try replacing::  maurizi.lan.      IN      SOA     ns1.maurizi.lan. root.maurizi.lan. ( with :: @      IN      SOA     ns1.maurizi.lan. root.maurizi.lan. (
2010-03-06T07:28:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	will do that asap one sec :)
2010-03-06T07:30:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	same result with nslookup/dig/host -a... it tries maurizi.lan then continues to try maurizi.lan.maurizi.lan without any luck..
2010-03-06T07:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	What happens when you run nslookup by itself?
2010-03-06T07:32:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	how are you reloading bind?
2010-03-06T07:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	you could try using the "trim" option in your host.conf file, e.g. trim maurizi.lan.
2010-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	give it a try, see what happens...
2010-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	those are derive from your host file!
2010-03-06T07:38:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	yes i know. I was wondering if maybe i did something wrong in /etc/hosts  how would i go about using the trim option in named.conf.local? trying too find info on it @ google
2010-03-06T07:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	just like I place in my post, but first, remove the domain information from your etc/hosts file...
2010-03-06T07:40:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	good idea. totally isnt neccesary if im running local named anyway :)
2010-03-06T07:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	right :)
2010-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	Please paste the contents o f/etc/hosts.conf
2010-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	you may want to add a line at the top; order bind hosts
2010-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gary_maurizi	did removing the domain portion of names in your hosts file make any differance.
2010-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	gary_maurizi	greezmunkey	no. nslookup still tries maurizi.lan.maurizi.lan when i ask it try to maurizi.lan
