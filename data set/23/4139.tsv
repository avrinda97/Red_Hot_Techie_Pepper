2008-02-03T14:56:00.000Z	fnx		hello.  anyone here good with configuring wine with alsa? my sound doesn't work :(
2008-02-03T14:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	are you using latest wine?
2008-02-03T14:58:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	yes
2008-02-03T14:58:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	wine --version = 0.9.54 ?
2008-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	yes.  this is the output when i try to run winecfg -- "fixme:mixer:ALSA_MixerInit No master control found on M Audio Audiophile 24/96, disabling mixer"
2008-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	wine --version = 0.9.54 ???
2008-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	fnx		yes dude! I went to the website!
2008-02-03T15:00:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	the sound works sometimes, i don't know how, but most of the time i just get that error message
2008-02-03T15:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	maybe try adding this in /etc/apt/sources.list "deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt gutsy main"  && sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-02-03T15:02:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	Hm. what does this do?
2008-02-03T15:02:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	might already be in there, lemme check
2008-02-03T15:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	the budgetdedicated is a repo with the latest wine, probably built correctly
2008-02-03T15:03:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	nah not there.  ok will try that now
2008-02-03T15:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	it's not an ubuntu repo, so no, it won't be there
2008-02-03T15:05:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	wine is the latest version
2008-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo		no such animal as grub.conf, afaik
2008-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo		there's /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	yes, but from where? did you build it yourself? my wine gives 0.9.49, which isn't latest
2008-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	no I didn't build it. I went to winehq.com and installed the deb from there. 0.9.54
2008-02-03T15:08:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	I'm positve its the absolute latest stable version.  I just know how to fix the alsa mixer problem.  Wine says it can't find the right "master control" for my card
2008-02-03T15:08:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	*don't know
2008-02-03T15:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	fnx	well try wine_0.9.54~winehq0~ubuntu~7.10-1_i386.deb
2008-02-03T15:10:00.000Z	fnx	Frogzoo	thanks for the help.  gotta go
