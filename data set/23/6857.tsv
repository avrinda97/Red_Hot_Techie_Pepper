2006-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	zool2005		Can anyone recommend a reasonably priced external HDD drive (not necessarily portable) that is compatible with Ubuntu please?
2006-10-13T07:19:00.000Z	zool2005		no0tic; edit fstab
2006-10-13T07:19:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	it is not in fstab
2006-10-13T07:20:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	mtab?
2006-10-13T07:20:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	mtab is temporary
2006-10-13T07:21:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	any other suggestion?
2006-10-13T07:21:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	can you make an entry in fstab for it and point it to a specific folder in /media?
2006-10-13T07:22:00.000Z	zool2005		kmaynard; at first I used the root account following on from poor MS habits but now I use sudo exclusively. I have disabled the root acc
2006-10-13T07:22:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	no, because the device file changes if I plug it in before or after other removable mass devices
2006-10-13T07:23:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	i.e. if I plug it in before the ipod it takes /dev/sdb, if I plug it in after it takes /dev/sdc
2006-10-13T07:23:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	understood?
2006-10-13T07:23:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	yup!
2006-10-13T07:24:00.000Z	zool2005		no0tic; create a new group with the mount command and add yourself to that group. (I'm not sure how to do it though :-) )
2006-10-13T07:25:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	the mount point is owned by root.root I don't want my normal user to be in the root group... :)
2006-10-13T07:26:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	create a new group and make it the owner of the mount point, then add your user to the new group
2006-10-13T07:27:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	the mount poit is created each time I plug it in and removed after unmounting by volume-manager
2006-10-13T07:27:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	so probably I need to operate on volume-manager rules...
2006-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	you don't have any problems with the other peripherals
2006-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	no, it is the only external hd formatted in ext3 I have
2006-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	if I format it in fat32 it mounts with normal user permissions
2006-10-13T07:29:00.000Z	zool2005	no0tic	ah. That's probably out of my league! Seems strange that that happens based on format.
2006-10-13T07:30:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	yes
2006-10-13T07:31:00.000Z	no0tic	zool2005	thanks anyway
