2004-12-08T11:43:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Do any of you guys use BitTorrent? Azureus, namely?
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		I'm trying to install the Java JRE
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		So I can run Azureus
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		It isn't working though
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Yup.
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Yeah.
2004-12-08T11:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master		It's supposed to install it under /usr/java right?
2004-12-08T11:45:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Ah.
2004-12-08T11:45:00.000Z	Quest-Master		:)

2004-12-08T13:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	all those packages depend on python being installed] 
2004-12-08T13:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	they don't work without it
2004-12-08T13:36:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Treenaks	I have 2.3.4 Python installed
2004-12-08T13:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	so basically, you do not want to remove python
2004-12-08T13:37:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Treenaks	I want to remove the 2.2.3
2004-12-08T13:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	from the packages? or compiled yourself?
2004-12-08T13:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	apt has python 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
2004-12-08T13:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	look harder in aptitude/synaptic/whatever
2004-12-08T13:39:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Treenaks	Shouldn't apt-get itself have the newest Python?
2004-12-08T13:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	it also has that
2004-12-08T13:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	but  I can assure you, that ubuntu has the latest python
2004-12-08T13:40:00.000Z	Treenaks	Quest-Master	apt-cache search python, look through the list
