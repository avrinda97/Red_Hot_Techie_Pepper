2004-12-26T11:13:00.000Z	hidde		Damn, I get no sound in tvtime. :-S
2004-12-26T11:14:00.000Z	candyman	hidde	do you have the patch-through cable?
2004-12-26T11:14:00.000Z	candyman		tvtime outputs the sound through a jack in the back of the card
2004-12-26T11:14:00.000Z	candyman		mine has a double-jack lead that connects it to the soundcard
2004-12-26T11:15:00.000Z	hidde	candyman	I have it, should work. It did in my previous hoary. :-)
2004-12-26T11:15:00.000Z	candyman		but my sound does not work today anyway, because I installed kde yesterday
2004-12-26T11:18:00.000Z	hidde	candyman	if the cable works, the sound should work?
2004-12-26T11:21:00.000Z	candyman		farruin, zenwhen, no, sound in gnome went away when I installed kde
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		well, it actually went away when I run kde for the first time: no sound, back to gnome, no sound either
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		but it was fine
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman	hidde	yes
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		if the other sound is working
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		tyche, I am doing so as we speak
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		works prerfectly
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	candyman		kmix surround: thanks
2004-12-26T11:22:00.000Z	hidde	candyman	the cable is there, but not the sound, and playing mp3's as we speak.
2004-12-26T11:23:00.000Z	candyman		something is also using all my cpu cycles too
2004-12-26T11:24:00.000Z	candyman		I only use it to tunnel for mail, both pop and smtp
2004-12-26T11:24:00.000Z	candyman		are you tunnelling 10000 local to which port remote?
2004-12-26T11:26:00.000Z	candyman		not sure
2004-12-26T11:27:00.000Z	candyman		I tunnel to a box not administered by myself, and I didn't have to tell the guy anything
2004-12-26T11:27:00.000Z	candyman		it just worked
2004-12-26T11:27:00.000Z	hidde	candyman	is there anything else I can try?
