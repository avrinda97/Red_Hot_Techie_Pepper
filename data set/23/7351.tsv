2005-09-20T12:24:00.000Z	ubuntu		yes it does see my sound card
2005-09-20T12:24:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	all other os meaning what?
2005-09-20T12:24:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	lol
2005-09-20T12:27:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	download it and burn it to a cd
2005-09-20T12:29:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	you should wait until it's final then
2005-09-20T12:29:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	it sounds like you're very put off by technical problems, you should wait until it's done
2005-09-20T12:30:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	did you look to see if your sound card is supported?
2005-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	do you want to make the livecd for just one kind of hardware, or several?
2005-09-20T12:43:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	it's much easier to find howto's on making a livecd than it actually is making one.  just my $0.2
2005-09-20T12:48:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	that's not true.  if you make an application in winxp, there is very little chance it will work right on win98
2005-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	and that's a bad thing
2005-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	can you stop talking about windows please?  I'm about to claw my eyeballs out
2005-09-20T12:56:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	tell that to google
2005-09-24T13:59:00.000Z	cevizoglu	ubuntu	isn't using enough hard disk space.  can anyone help me?
