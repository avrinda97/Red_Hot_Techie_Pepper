2007-04-27T08:17:00.000Z	Hellaenergy		What advantages does ubuntu have over FC?
2007-04-27T08:18:00.000Z	Hellaenergy		jumbers, FC is very easy to use as well.
2007-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	how long did you use FC?
2007-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	I am still using FC
2007-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	I've been using RH since 2
2007-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	2.6.20
2007-04-27T08:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	do you know anyone at Red Hat?
2007-04-27T08:20:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	No I do not
2007-04-27T08:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	how long have you been in the Ubuntu community? (and yes, this all has a point) ;)
2007-04-27T08:21:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	I haven't... I'm thinking about installing it at some point though.
2007-04-27T08:22:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	well, you've been using FC for 3-4 years and know nobody at RedHat. you've been here for 10 minutes and alerady know one of Canonical's senior support people. Ubuntu 1 | FC 0
2007-04-27T08:22:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	thats a good one :)
2007-04-27T08:23:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	just because I don't know people at Redhat doesn't mean I don't know Linux or people i've asked about Fedora Core are not capable of supporting Linux
2007-04-27T08:24:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	but it DOES say something about each company's dedication to their average end user
2007-04-27T08:24:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	if you're General Motors, RH will talk to you. if you're some end user, forget it.
2007-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	I am glad you guys are here. It does show that you are truly geeks :)
2007-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	at Canonical, we *love* individual end users.
2007-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	the war is won in many small battles. not some huge slugfest.
2007-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	I would say that there are not RH people in #fedora.
2007-04-27T08:26:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	s/would/wouldn't/
2007-04-27T08:26:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	Thats good because that is what Linux was built on and continues to be built on ;)
2007-04-27T08:27:00.000Z	mneptok	Hellaenergy	the largest flood begins with a single raindrop ;)
2007-04-27T08:27:00.000Z	Hellaenergy	mneptok	word
