2008-03-05T19:19:00.000Z	raiderxx	erUSUL	03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GeForce 8600 GTS (rev a1)
2008-03-05T19:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	raiderxx	aouch!! with a 8xxx series card you will need the drivers from nvidia.com or use envy (both options dangerous if you do not know what you a are doing) if you want 3d acceleration
