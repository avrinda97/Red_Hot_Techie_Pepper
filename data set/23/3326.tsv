2008-06-29T04:07:00.000Z	teethdood		Virtualbox does not do SMP :( I have a dual core
2008-06-29T04:07:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	was that a reply to me?
2008-06-29T04:08:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	no, I was just saying cuz I need a virtual machine too
2008-06-29T04:09:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	well I got the cloused source version which is meant to suppourt USB
2008-06-29T04:09:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	 ,but the error message as I said,  which I am assuming is to do with my host OS Ubuntu
2008-06-29T04:09:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	what makes you go with virtualbox closed source and not vmware
2008-06-29T04:10:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	VMware there was isues with sound and so on. hell even Internet connection when I did XP
2008-06-29T04:10:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	that's VMware player
2008-06-29T04:11:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	plus Virtualbox has the advantage of being able to use VMware machines, without needing a VMware config file for them :)
2008-06-29T04:11:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	ok so I guess I'll try out virtualbox closed source, see if I can duplicate that problem. I actually want to run an already installed windows as a virtual device
2008-06-29T04:12:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	physical install?
2008-06-29T04:12:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	yes
2008-06-29T04:12:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	ah yes,  wanted to do that myself before,  tryed some stuff, but  didn't really get that far, aslo by what I read, so much that can go badly wrong with that
2008-06-29T04:13:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	you can use VMware converter to convert your pshyical XP  I assume it's XP  into a VM
2008-06-29T04:13:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	install VMware converter into your psyical  XP install and convert with that, however it will basically make the VM the size of your XP partition, so you need some where to put it
2008-06-29T04:14:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	also if you do that, make sure it makes one big  VMware vmdk file, because Virtualbox can't deal with more than one like that.  can't deal with a split VMware VM
2008-06-29T04:15:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	I'm gonna run Ubuntu for a dental office which need to run certain apps (X-rays etc) on windows. Virtualbox should be able to get all the USB connections etc right?
2008-06-29T04:18:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	have you tryed Wine?  the latest Wine.  uhmmmmmmm  you won't get that off the Ubuntu network
2008-06-29T04:18:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	but you can add the repo so you always get the latest Ubuntu Wine :)
2008-06-29T04:23:00.000Z	teethdood	SebNaitsabes	it's impossible to run proprietary windows apps under wine. These are very specific stuff (X-ray interface software, business management etc)
2008-06-29T04:23:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	might run with some tweaking
2008-06-29T04:24:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	but sure better off with the VM I expect in this case
2008-06-29T04:24:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	teethdood	and Micosoft Office 2003 with the exception of Access and Photoshop CS2 and what not run great under Wine
