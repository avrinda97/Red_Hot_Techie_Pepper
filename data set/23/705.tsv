2011-08-18T04:41:00.000Z	Cortex		that' AFTER killing it
2011-08-18T04:42:00.000Z	Cortex		ah.
2011-08-18T04:42:00.000Z	Cortex		I do remember something about the wireless networks thing not working anymore
2011-08-18T04:42:00.000Z	Cortex		but I don't use that. I'm connected through ethernet
2011-08-18T04:43:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	Was it something specific to 11.04
2011-08-18T04:43:00.000Z	Cortex	sevith	what do you mean? the wireless thing?
2011-08-18T04:43:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	Yes
2011-08-18T04:44:00.000Z	Cortex	sevith	if you mean if I'm using 11.04, yes. using classic mode
2011-08-18T04:44:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	Cuz i use it alot of my laptop but i have to reboot at least 5 times before it works right without crashing...its pretty annoying...makes me wanna install windows :O!
2011-08-18T04:45:00.000Z	Cortex		ok, i'm going to reboot and see if this happens again
2011-08-18T04:46:00.000Z	sevith		ok SSHD configs say nothing about ipv6 but i want it to stop listening on ipv6
2011-08-18T04:46:00.000Z	sevith		unless i missed it?
2011-08-18T04:47:00.000Z	sevith		NEVER mind.
2011-08-18T04:49:00.000Z	Cortex		ok, rebooted. applet is still running at 1 hour or so now
2011-08-18T04:50:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	Really? Mine always crashes and i cant even use a hardwired connection.....Wireless is brought down with it...Maybe its a driver issues but iv never had this problem until i upgrade to 11 from 10. Now it happens all the time
2011-08-18T04:51:00.000Z	Cortex		The weirdest part is that now it says that I've been using it for close to three hours when a minute ago it says an hour and a half
2011-08-18T04:51:00.000Z	sevith		Bah iptables ? Who uses them?
2011-08-18T04:51:00.000Z	sevith		I love them.
2011-08-18T04:52:00.000Z	Cortex		should I just reinstall ubuntu and hope this fixes the problem?
2011-08-18T04:52:00.000Z	Cortex		is there any way to directly reinstall ubuntu ?
2011-08-18T04:53:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	? Whats the issue?
2011-08-18T04:53:00.000Z	Cortex	sevith	indicator-applet keeps using up a lot of cpu. 90% +
2011-08-18T04:54:00.000Z	sevith	Cortex	I see...Im having issues with the same indicator applet. It keeps crashing on mine
