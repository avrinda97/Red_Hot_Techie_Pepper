2006-01-12T14:05:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 I need it to be generic so I can use it wherever I may roam, and although I much prefer a cd, I should probably use a floppy until I have it down better so I don't burn through twenty cds.
2006-01-12T14:05:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	cd-rw
2006-01-12T14:06:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 One sec...  because the only thing harder then what I'm trying to do is digging through piles of CDs!  This may take a minute!
2006-01-12T14:06:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	just a suggestion, because I hate floppies.  :)
2006-01-12T14:07:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	but remember older machines may not be able to boot from cd
2006-01-12T14:12:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 I assume there is an easy way to delete and burn things on this sucker in gnome.
2006-01-12T14:12:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 Okay, now what files do I need to dig out for my kernel.
2006-01-12T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	the kernel source archive.
2006-01-12T14:14:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 Is that somewhere online, or simply a file on the external's root partition.
2006-01-12T14:17:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	will /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-686 work?
2006-01-12T14:19:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 Also, the only halfway-run install on the external uses 2.6.12-9-686, while I believe Breezy upgraded to 2.6.12-10-686.  Should I download the newer, or go with the older until I upgrade on my external?
2006-01-12T14:19:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	I wouldn't try to figure this out and change kernel versions at the same time.
2006-01-12T14:19:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	get it working, then worry about updating the kernel.
2006-01-12T14:26:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/base/linux-image-2.6.12-9-686 is what I'm looking for, yes?
2006-01-12T14:27:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	I think the source has a different name, and you need the source
2006-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	This, then?: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/source/linux-source-2.6.12
2006-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	yes, I believe so
2006-01-12T14:31:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	linux-source-2.6.12_2.6.12.orig.tar.gz vs linux-source-2.6.12_2.6.12-9.23.diff.gz
2006-01-12T14:31:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	the diff is for the case where you are changing kernel versions, already have source, and only want files that have changed
2006-01-12T14:31:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	you want all of it.
2006-01-12T14:34:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	sethk	 Obtained!
2006-01-12T14:38:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	now you do make xconfig
2006-01-18T17:05:00.000Z	sethk	StokesTheorem	what does that version have that regular old ubuntu doesn't have?
