2005-05-23T08:50:00.000Z	thr1ce		GLib >= 2.4.5
2005-05-23T08:51:00.000Z	thr1ce		wtf...2.4.5?
2005-05-23T08:51:00.000Z	thr1ce		ooh, right
2005-05-23T08:52:00.000Z	thr1ce		you should be fine
2005-05-23T08:53:00.000Z	thr1ce		not button placement
2005-05-23T08:55:00.000Z	thr1ce		i'm not convinced synaptic/ apt-get / packages management in ubuntu works very efficiently
2005-05-23T08:55:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	it does though...
2005-05-23T08:57:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	what do you mean with 'found it on my system'?
2005-05-23T08:57:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	I removed it through synaptic, updatedb 'ed, ran locate evolution, and found a bunch of data-server stuff
2005-05-23T08:57:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	maybe some config files are still left
2005-05-23T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	they are only removed with apt-get remove --purge
2005-05-23T08:58:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	they weren't config files (i'm not on ubuntu ATM)
2005-05-23T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	did you remove evolution-data-server too?
2005-05-23T08:59:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	and have you run updatedb before running slocate?
2005-05-23T08:59:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	of course
2005-05-23T08:59:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	this was about a month ago...I have since gone back to slack :(
2005-05-23T08:59:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	well, then i'd like to see the output of that slocate run :)
2005-05-23T09:00:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	well, I just had to go through and remove them by hand
2005-05-23T09:00:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	rm `slocate ....` :)
2005-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	not really :)
2005-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	oh, haha, I see what you mean
2005-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	thr1ce	Seveas	I forget these minor things :)
2005-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	Seveas	thr1ce	there are packages in the hoary-extras section of the backport repository
