2008-09-25T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2008-09-25T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	that'll give you libs and g++ compiler
2008-10-17T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	restore from backup
2008-10-17T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	just reverse whatever backup mechanism you have in place
2008-10-17T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	then its not that important is it
2009-01-02T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	one thing at a time
2009-03-09T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	in what release of ubuntu?
2009-03-09T18:54:00.000Z	kebomix	ActionParsnip	it is just going to gray as it crashed !!
2009-03-09T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	use killall emesene
2009-03-09T18:55:00.000Z	kebomix	ActionParsnip	:okay i did before , but it dont work when i try to open it , i dont know wut is wrong with it !
2009-03-09T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	is the process dead now?
2009-03-09T18:56:00.000Z	kebomix	ActionParsnip	: yeah , every time to goes to be gray
2009-03-09T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	have you tried renaming its config folder, you will have to reconfigure but it may be damaged and make the app go wonky
2009-03-09T18:57:00.000Z	kebomix	ActionParsnip	: how to do that ?
2009-03-09T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	cd ~/; ls -a
2009-03-09T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	do you see a folder name .emesene at all
2009-03-09T18:58:00.000Z	kebomix	ActionParsnip	: no
2009-03-09T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	you need to find out the folder or file name that emesene uses for config and rename it so that when you rerun it you get stock settings. This can fix things
2009-04-20T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	have you checked to see if it is on the repos first?
2009-04-20T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	to extract it use tar jxvf <file>
2009-04-20T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kebomix	you will most likely find the app is on the repositorys and that you have downloaded source code needlessly
