2007-03-29T08:09:00.000Z	KaoticEvil		anyone have experience with ubuntu server edition?
2007-03-29T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	the LAMP preinstall was an option on the CD
2007-03-29T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	or you can follow that link
2007-03-29T08:10:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	ive already installed lamp.. but i dont know how to conf it
2007-03-29T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	well, for the most part, it's already setup.
2007-03-29T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	Do you have a particular thing you're looking to do?
2007-03-29T08:11:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	well, i dont see the process running, nor can i access the web server
2007-03-29T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	eh?  apache should be running, I think.  `ps aux | grep apache` doesn't show anything?
2007-03-29T08:12:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	the only thing it shows is the process that i just started by issuing that command
2007-03-29T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	right.  Ok, go ahead and start apache, with `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start`
2007-03-29T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	I guess even with the LAMP preinstall, the 'nothing listening by default' still applies
2007-03-29T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	you sure you selected the LAMP option when installing?
2007-03-29T08:14:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	yes, quite sure
2007-03-29T08:15:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	says its not installed or available.. could this be because im using edgy, and not dapper?
2007-03-29T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	eh?  No.  Edgy's server Install still works fine.  What says it's not available?
2007-03-29T08:16:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	dpkg says package apache2 is not installed or available
2007-03-29T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	then you don't have apache installed.  You can go ahead and install it, or if you'd like, try to reinstall with the LAMP preinstall thing
2007-03-29T08:19:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	the instructions are the same.
2007-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	its on a virtual machine, so i can just reintall the who ball of wax... im glad i did it this way instead of wiping my server box LOL
2007-03-29T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	instllation isn't any different in Edgy.  That's the server CD being different in Edgy
2007-03-29T08:22:00.000Z	KaoticEvil	Flannel	as i said, ill just redo the install.. its only a virtual machine :)
2007-03-29T08:22:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	sounds good.
2007-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	KaoticEvil	yes.  All the server is is ubuntu, sans GUI, with the server kernel
