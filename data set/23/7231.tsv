2005-11-07T17:13:00.000Z	rick_		I have a problem if anyone want to take a shot at it, as a noob I am at my wits end.
2005-11-07T17:13:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	ok
2005-11-07T17:14:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	what program?
2005-11-07T17:15:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	ctrl+alt+f1 log in there
2005-11-07T17:15:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	try running it there
2005-11-07T17:16:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	maybe run a command from console there for running X
2005-11-07T17:19:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	goto console ctrl+alt+f1
2005-11-07T17:19:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	and type the name of the program...what program is it?
2005-11-07T17:20:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	ok just sec
2005-11-07T17:21:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	in console type gnome-terminal --display=:0
2005-11-07T17:23:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	did you try logggin in after ctrl alt f1 username and pass wrod and run the command above?
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	but you are unable to run programs right?
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	yes do it now
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	does it do it again after reboot?
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	maybe just check console and see ps -A look for something defunct and do a killall -9 program
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	next time you have the problem maybe
2005-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	ps -A is to list processes and running programs
2005-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	yes
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	maybe you already checked top to see it something was gombling memory  or using too much cpu or there was a defunct program
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	killall -9 firefox-bin will killall firefoxs otherwise if that fails you do kill -9 process id a shown under ps -A
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	foampeace	rick_	by console i mean ctrl+alt+f1. yes you can do this while everything isrunning even X
2005-11-07T17:45:00.000Z	rick_	foampeace	you still with us?
2005-11-07T17:50:00.000Z	rick_	foampeace	you with us??
