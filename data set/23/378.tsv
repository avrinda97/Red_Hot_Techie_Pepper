2011-12-17T17:15:00.000Z	Ubu_noob		Has anyone installed MATLAB on ubuntu before I can seem to be able to run the installer as root user so ti reaches a point where it says it can not create the directory to put the MATLAB stuff into
2011-12-17T17:17:00.000Z	Ubu_noob		but it doesnt work
2011-12-17T17:18:00.000Z	Ubu_noob		how can i run and installer as a root user? even though i am the only user
2011-12-17T17:19:00.000Z	Ubu_noob		ya but the installer is a gui
2011-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 gksudo theinstaller
2011-12-17T17:20:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	i do that and the terminal is doings something but the installer never pops up
2011-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 its possiuble it dident make one.. if it did not come as a .deb
2011-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 look to see if it installed a .desktop file somewhere.
2011-12-17T17:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 or just make a launcher/.desktop file for it
2011-12-17T17:50:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	i dont know how to do that, :(
2011-12-17T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 dont do that chmod command......
2011-12-17T17:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 it could break things badly.. and theres no point inb doing that to /usr/share/
2011-12-17T17:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 learn to use 'sudo' and 'gksudo' as needed to access system directories
2011-12-17T17:59:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	ok but i tried using gksudo to install MATLAB but it did not start the installer it just paused then did nothing so i cant write to the /usr/local/ that it needs to be in
2011-12-17T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 its possible theres a deeper bug in the installer. OR you could just install it to your users home dir.
2011-12-17T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 you dont just go around doing chmod 777 to system directories and hope things work. :)
2011-12-17T18:02:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	haha. i tried but i dont know what i did wrong it says no such file or directory exist when i click the launcher
2011-12-17T18:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 CaSe Is ImpoRnatnT in LinUx  for onething..
2011-12-17T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 watch out for spaces in paths/filenames also.
2011-12-17T18:03:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	i know but i just copied the instructions given on the matlab ubuntu set up page ... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB is there any chance they did something wrong? im guessing no that it must have been me
2011-12-17T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 could be a typo. or its out of date due to changes in matlab.
2011-12-17T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ubu_noob	 it pays to pay attention and learn what its doing not just follow directions blindly
2011-12-17T18:05:00.000Z	Ubu_noob	dr_willis	ya i know but sometimes when the directions dont help all i can do is follow blindly
