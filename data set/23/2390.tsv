2009-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	puff		I'm feeling a little braindead tonight... when setting up ssh password-less login, you only insert the _public_ key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the target system, right?
2009-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	puff		Does the private key go in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if you want bidirectional psaswordless login?
2009-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	grawity	puff	No.
2009-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	grawity	puff	The _public_ key goes to authorized_keys.
2009-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	grawity	puff	<puff> Does the private key go to...
2009-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Ok, so you were skipping over the first question and answering the second ;-).
2009-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	grawity	puff	Then I probably joined after you asked the first question :/
2009-03-29T15:17:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Nope :-).
2009-03-29T15:17:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Okay,so public key in authorized_keys.  if I want to be able to go in the opposite direction, private key goes where on the destination machine?
2009-03-29T15:17:00.000Z	grawity	puff	Okay... So what were the questions? :)
2009-03-29T15:17:00.000Z	grawity	puff	Actually, it's like this. The *destination* machine only has the public key, in authorized_keys.
2009-03-29T15:17:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Basially I'm setting up a stand-alone network and I want ssh passwordless login on all the machines for the same username.
2009-03-29T15:18:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Yeah, for "going in the oppposite direction", e.g. logging in from destination to source machine now.
2009-03-29T15:18:00.000Z	puff	grawity	and I want to just use the same keypair on all ten machines to keep it simple.
2009-03-29T15:18:00.000Z	grawity	puff	So...from any machine to any other machine?
2009-03-29T15:21:00.000Z	grawity	puff	Yes.
2009-03-29T15:28:00.000Z	grawity	puff	authorized_keys should be 644, I think.
2009-08-21T23:15:00.000Z	grawity	puff	Does 'route' list a default route?
2009-08-21T23:15:00.000Z	puff	grawity	Yes.
2009-08-21T23:16:00.000Z	puff	grawity	I plugged the cable into a laptop and could get out on the laptop, could ping the gateway, but I can't ping the gateway from the server.
2009-08-21T23:30:00.000Z	puff	grawity	I just noticed something... this machine has three wired interfaces, eth0, eth1 and virbr0.  It is set up with a static IP on eth0, and eth0 is up.  When I checked route, it showed a default route, but I just noticed that the default route is 192..168.122.1, which is the IP for virbr0, not eth0.
