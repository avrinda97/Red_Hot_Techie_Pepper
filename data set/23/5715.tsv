2006-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	THX-1138		   !irc
2006-10-09T13:29:00.000Z	THX-1138		there are channels for most languages. - sorry i don't know what language is spoken in Indonesia.
2006-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	how can ubotu not know about the best irc client, irssi?
2006-10-09T13:32:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- Do you have the command to ignore channel messges? enter and quit?
2006-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	hmm, no, those don't bother me. why, is that the reason you don't use it?
2006-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- I love irssi - the docs are thin - found a few  commands but not all and not enough of them.
2006-10-09T13:34:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- I couldn't make sense of /bot <command>
2006-10-09T13:35:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- Thanks going to check it out.
2006-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- hm, wondering how i missed that. - nice link thank you.
2006-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	no problem :-P does seem hard to miss, it's the first link when googling "irssi manual" :-P
2006-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- you are a funny guy. - lol - NOT! ;)
2006-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	you can set most of that stuff in the startup file i believe, though don't ask me how... my irssi box very rarely reboots so i can't be bothered :-)
2006-10-09T13:40:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- It seems much faster to type what you need than wade through a gui. even when it isn't it can be scripted to do *exactly* what you want.
2006-10-09T13:49:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	indeed - that's what i like about irssi. it's like the linux of irc clients :-)
2006-10-09T13:50:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	bitchx is the only comparable client, but the difference is that in bitchx everything seems to be set up by default to be wrong, whereas in irssi all the default settings are more or less correct
2006-10-09T13:51:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- irssi is just great. - Only beginning to discover the power of scripting.
2006-10-09T13:53:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- do you have a script for spell checking. - ah nvm i would just add made up words anyway.
2006-10-09T13:54:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	no i haven't scripted it much - as i said it seems to do most things right out of the box
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	penguin liberation front? the traitors!
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	unlike the heros, the penguin front of liberation
2006-10-09T14:04:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- honestly - the name makes me nervous.
2006-10-09T14:05:00.000Z	KDan	THX-1138	doesn't make me as nervous as wikipedia's "ArbCom"
2006-10-09T14:05:00.000Z	THX-1138	KDan	- off to google it.
