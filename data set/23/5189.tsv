2007-01-23T17:47:00.000Z	datachild		I'm having trouble installing/getting my fluxbox to work.. i've configured the .xinitrc file to exec fluxbox.. but when i try type startx nothing happens, but x starts when i type Xorg (with no fluxbox) and when i try typing "startfluxbox" it won't start because there's no XServer to connect to
2007-01-23T17:48:00.000Z	datachild		anyone that can help me out?
2007-01-23T17:49:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	try execing fluxbox from $HOME/.xsessionrc
2007-01-23T17:51:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	it doesnt work, still complains about that there's no XServer to connect to
2007-01-23T17:52:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	did you run startx after changing .xsessionrc ?
2007-01-23T17:55:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	startx doesnt work, but Xorg starts X
2007-01-23T17:55:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	what do you mean by "doesn't work"?
2007-01-23T17:56:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	you need the xinit package then.
2007-01-23T17:57:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	if you're a newbie, why do you want fluxbox?
2007-01-23T17:58:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	i want to learn.. advance a bit
2007-01-23T17:58:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	how did you install?
2007-01-23T17:59:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	install what?
2007-01-23T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	Ubuntu (I'm assuming that's what you installed)
2007-01-23T17:59:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	by CD
2007-01-23T06:00:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	do you have an old or slow machine?
2007-01-23T06:01:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	no it's a pretty new one
2007-01-23T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	I suggest you run 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' as root, then.
2007-01-23T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	that'll give you a workable environment without too much fiddling around.
2007-01-23T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	in that case I suggest you install 'xubuntu-desktop'. It's a lot slimmer.
2007-01-23T06:03:00.000Z	datachild	soundray	small and easy?
2007-01-23T06:04:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	well, the gnome desktop (which you get with the ubuntu-desktop package) is the easiest.
2007-01-23T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	you can always uninstall packages later when you've gathered some experience
2007-01-23T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	datachild	fluxbuntu isn't an official ubuntu project (yet), so it won't have the same level of support as ubuntu, xubuntu or kubuntu.
