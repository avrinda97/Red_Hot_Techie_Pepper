2005-07-06T09:12:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		i like ubuntu its pretty good
2005-07-06T09:13:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	I don't use thunderbird, but I'd assume there is an "attach" menu item, and a little paperclip icon
2005-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	why do you say that?
2005-07-06T09:19:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	um, there is a giant Attatch icon in my compose window, which appears to allow me to attach any file
2005-07-06T09:19:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	I don't see what your problem is
2005-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	it's a huge paperclip icon.  Are you blind?
2005-07-15T15:42:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	to play realplayer in firefox, you need mplayer, mozilla-mplayer, and w32cdoces
2005-07-15T15:44:00.000Z	NeoGeo64	tiglionabbit	I have all three of those you mentioned.
2005-07-15T15:45:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	will your mplayer play realplayer stuff on its own?  (outside firefox)
2005-07-15T15:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	you should be able to play realplayer stuff in mplayer, even streaming things
2005-07-15T15:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	you sure you have w32codecs ?  um sorry, I don't know why you wouldn't be able to
2005-07-15T15:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	what format is the vidio?  wmp ?
2005-07-15T15:51:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	run apps -> sound&video -> MPlayer, and open a realplayer thing in that
2005-07-15T15:52:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	NeoGeo64	okay, if you can play them in mplayer, you just need to configure firefox to know that, in the plugin settings
