2006-01-05T15:44:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	with samba you'll be able to access exactly what you could access with a windows box
2006-01-05T15:44:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	if you don't need a vpn to use windows, you won't need it with linux either
2006-01-05T15:49:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	I don't think anyone said not to use ssh
2006-01-05T16:15:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	that's a two part answer.  One, there is desktop restoration.  this runs whatever was running the last time you shut down.
2006-01-05T16:15:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	then there are . files in your home directory you can use to start apps when X runs, but by default they are empty.
2006-01-05T16:16:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	doesn't necessarily matter, depends on how the desktop is configured.  You don't have to explicitly save
2006-01-05T16:17:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	the files you will care about are in the .gnome directory under your home directory
2006-01-05T16:18:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	if you remove the entire .gnome directory it will be returned to the state it was in the first time you logged in.
2006-01-05T16:18:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	check other . directories.  Also make sure you use -A with ls to see hidden (dot) files in the subdirectories.
2006-01-05T16:19:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	see the .gnome2 directory
2006-01-05T16:19:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	also .gnome_private
2006-10-22T05:26:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	no
2006-10-22T05:26:00.000Z	sethk	j2daosh	no, like if you just copy them all to a dvd it won't work.
