2007-02-23T16:58:00.000Z	kenthomson		:)
2007-02-23T17:00:00.000Z	kenthomson		I need to do this: I am in /home/ken/pictures and i want to copy all the images begining with 0034* that may be lying in all the subfolder within /home/ken/pictures like ~/pictures/wallpapers or ~/pictures/others/ or ~/pictures/misc, i want to copy all of those to /home/ken/demo/, can someone please help
2007-02-23T17:02:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	do you want to preserve subdirectories?
2007-02-23T17:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	know i want all the pictures to be picked from all the subdirectories in ~/pictures and to be dumped together (without subdirectories) to ~/demo/
2007-02-23T17:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	i meant NO
2007-02-23T17:03:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	find /home/ken/pictures -iname "0034*
2007-02-23T17:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	i am trying to copy
2007-02-23T17:04:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	find /home/ken/pictures -iname "0034*" -exec cp -a {} /home/ken/demo/ \;
2007-02-23T17:04:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	yea i know i hit enter by accident
2007-02-23T17:05:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	mine will work if there are multiple subdirectory levels
2007-02-23T17:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	will all the pictures, in any number of sub-directories down the line..
2007-02-23T17:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	i was going to say that :)
2007-02-23T17:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	could you please take the time to explain a little bit of what you have written?
2007-02-23T17:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	that means i can use " find /home/ken/pictures -iname "0034*"  " seperately and it would give me the same output as "   find /home/ken/pictures -| grep 0034* "??
2007-02-23T17:10:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	yea
2007-02-23T17:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	ok thanks
2007-02-23T17:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	and may i know why there are empty curly braces after cp -a {}
2007-02-23T17:10:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	iname means case insensitive, which really doesn't matter here since we're searching for numbes, but i tend to use it as default
2007-02-23T17:11:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	than why is it empty? and what is the "$" in "$filename"?
2007-02-23T17:12:00.000Z	kenthomson	v_	{} = filename so than why is it empty in your command? Shouldn't it be filled with something?
2007-02-23T17:12:00.000Z	v_	kenthomson	with exec in find, {} represents each/or all files
