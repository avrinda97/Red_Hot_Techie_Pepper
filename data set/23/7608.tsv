2005-06-14T11:10:00.000Z	disasm	koosy	open it with <favorite text editor goes here> and append multiverse to the end, or type this as root: vi /etc/apt/sources.list<enter>:%s/universe/universe multiverse/g<enter>:wq<enter>

2005-06-14T11:42:00.000Z	disasm	koosy	i originally went to linuxdocs all the time back in the day, i have a couple of good books too, ones a unix reference manual, and most of the others are pretty horrible (dont buy idiot's guide to linux or rh linux 5 bible)
2005-06-14T11:43:00.000Z	disasm	koosy	best way to learn is a) google b) cant find on google, ask someone on irc/mailing list oh and cant forget c) play as much as possible
