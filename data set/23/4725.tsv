2007-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	chuck____		I want to create a new user with a password but the -p option for the useradd command only accepts an already-encrypted password using crypt()... how do I go about getting this encrypted password?  i tried looking for a man page for crypt but it doesn't exist
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	chuck____		Where the hell is this crypt function?
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	dchky	chuck____	why don't you just do adduser, then passwd username
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	chuck____		what does that do?
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	dchky		adds a user to the system, then changes the password for that user.
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	chuck____		can you be a little more specific on the syntax of what I have to do
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	dchky		ok, open a terminal window
2007-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	chuck____		passwd username password?
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	dchky		type adduser
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	chuck____		passwd username password?
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	chuck____		Is all I need to know
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	dchky		once the user has been added to the system, type password username <- replace the word username with the name you just added, then hit enter
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	dchky		it'll ask you to type a password for that user,
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	chuck____		oh okay
2007-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	dchky		type passwd --help
2007-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	chuck____	dchky	: is there a difference between adduser and useradd or are they analagous
2007-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	dchky		I wonder why it's called bonobo
2007-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	dchky		sorry, I might have messed up, it's adduser
2007-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	dchky		useradd should not be on the system.
2007-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	dchky		Sorry Ronald|Laptop, it's in the office over the road, and I unplugged it about an hour ago. Some kind of murphy's law I guess.
2007-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	chuck____	dchky	: ? why not?  It appears to have the same functionality as adduser
2007-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	dchky	chuck____	it's probably aliased, I suspect it's an identical command.
2007-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	chuck____	dchky	: aye that's what i asked :<
