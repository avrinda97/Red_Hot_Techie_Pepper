2007-03-08T14:21:00.000Z	lkthomas		zcat[1] , fuck off
2007-03-08T14:23:00.000Z	lkthomas		what a pain to config sound on ubuntu
2007-03-08T14:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	how so?
2007-03-08T14:23:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	my soundblaster can't play anything
2007-03-08T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	strange, Soundblasters have been well supported for about 10 years...
2007-03-08T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	what exactly are you doing, and what's going wrong?
2007-03-08T14:25:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	ok, alsamixer shows emu10k1
2007-03-08T14:26:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	but then even cd is playing, no sound comes out from speaker
2007-03-08T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	have you unmuted the channels?
2007-03-08T14:26:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	PCM and master channel unmuted
2007-03-08T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	can you hear pcm playback?
2007-03-08T14:29:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	Message: alsa mixer timed out
2007-03-08T14:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	that's a bit odd
2007-03-08T14:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	have you tried running alsamixer from a terminal?
2007-03-08T14:31:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	yeah
2007-03-08T14:31:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	alsamixer working
2007-03-08T14:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	and all the channels are unmuted?
2007-03-08T14:31:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	yes
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	sorry, was afk
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	alsa seems working
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	maybe because you haven't got permissions to some device or another?
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lkthomas	I have a CD player for playing audio CDs...
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	lkthomas	gordonjcp	how should I config it ?
