2011-01-02T08:59:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu		thanks GeekSquid didn't know that.
2011-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	np
2011-01-04T08:02:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ... delete the ppa and reload ... then sudo apt-get autoremove
2011-01-04T08:02:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	I did that, and it didn't autoremove. :)
2011-01-04T08:04:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade should clear things out
2011-01-04T08:04:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	the problem is the app that was in the ppa was newer and therefore won't be caught by the upgrade
2011-01-04T08:06:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	I have a classic case of ppa conflict, that is an inherant risk of using ppa's that I took, I guess a clean install is about the only way I know to fix it
2011-01-04T08:07:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	this is a desktop install?
2011-01-04T08:08:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	yep, with server setup after
2011-01-04T08:09:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	goto synaptic, bottom left click Origin, then find the ppa, then click on each of the installed packages, then in package menu force version to the ubuntu version
2011-01-04T08:11:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	sweet!  I didn't know I could do that!  I was tinkering in the origin section, but didn't think to click on Package, thanks a bundle, I'm going to try that.
2011-01-04T08:33:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	have you ever forced downgrade with synaptic like that?
2011-01-04T08:34:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	yes, did it work?
2011-01-04T08:34:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	I'm burning an ISO to a disk Just in Case. :)  so I haven't hit the apply button yet.
2011-01-04T08:41:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	here we go!  I downgraded a bunch of x-swat ppa files xorg and stuff, I can assume I'm going to need to reboot after this
2011-01-04T08:42:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	not sure what you had installed, if any kernelspace stuff, then yeah, ... see if it boots
2011-01-04T08:42:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	right, that is why I burnt the cd before hand. :)
2011-01-04T08:46:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	Flannel's got it
2011-01-04T08:46:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	ok, thanks
2011-01-04T08:54:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	thanks a bundle that worked, and I lived through a reboot
2011-01-04T08:55:00.000Z	GeekSquid	shane4ubuntu	glad that worked, and very happy I could help with my little GUI based trick
2011-01-04T08:55:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	GeekSquid	I love cli, but there are times when GUI is very handy
