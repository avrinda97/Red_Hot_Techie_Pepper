2009-03-01T23:32:00.000Z	hunt577		Geez, this is messed up
2009-03-01T23:32:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	can you not trade the current wifi card with a compatible one from wherever you purchased the computer
2009-03-01T23:33:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	the wifi card is built into the lap top
2009-03-01T23:33:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	ok, late to the convo
2009-03-01T23:33:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	no problem
2009-03-01T23:35:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	well, you could always disable that built in wifi and use a usb or pcmia card
2009-03-01T23:35:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	but shouldn't the built in wifi work?  It worked yesterday on ubuntu when I ran the live cd
2009-03-01T23:36:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	then it should work, unless the live cd uses the host os for the wifi connection?
2009-03-01T23:41:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	I feel a driver may have gotten deleted somehow when I installed ubuntu
2009-03-01T23:46:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	ok, is this correct? You have a laptop (version?) running windoze (version?). You installed a live CD and rebooted. Ubuntu came up in a Live Seesion and you had a look around, wifi worked. you then decided to install Ubuntu, clicked on the Install Icon...
2009-03-01T23:47:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	windows is no longer on the computer
2009-03-01T23:47:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	you installed ubuntu by selecting all the available space on the drive (prompted during install)
2009-03-01T23:48:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	yes and when I went to cancel installation because it was confusing me, I guess it was too late and overwrote windows
2009-03-01T23:49:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	There are several prompts before you actuall partion/format your drive, Did you see the one that said something to the effect "this will overwrite etc..)?
2009-03-01T23:50:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	yes I believe so
2009-03-01T23:51:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	and you click on through, deleting you windoze partition, then you changed you mind and canceled the install while it was partitioning/formatting your drive?
2009-03-01T23:52:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	yes thats what I did and thats probably what messed it all up
2009-03-01T23:52:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	you have several options. If you wish to keep windoze you will need the install disk for it, then you can setup a dual boot configuration. You can also use the live cd to reinstall Ubuntu as your primary OS
2009-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	yes I installed Ubuntu and its my primary OS at this point
2009-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	do you have a working system?
2009-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	exodus_ms	hunt577	other than the wifi
2009-03-01T23:58:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	yes it was my fault, I was not paying attention
2009-03-01T23:59:00.000Z	hunt577	exodus_ms	I take that back, I was paying attention, just didn't know what I was doing lol
