2010-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	ckw	imran	Ugh, I was hoping I could copy from my grub files, but I'm using grub2
2010-01-12T06:35:00.000Z	imran	ckw	Tried that actually, and changed back to old verson
2010-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	imran	ckw	if I recall, I got an "Error 22" or something similar - I'll try again, be back in a minute...
2010-01-12T06:40:00.000Z	ckw	imran	Does XP work still?

2010-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	imran	ckw	Is there anything for ubuntu that will tell me what partitions have OS's on them so I can be 100% sure my (X,X)'s are right?
2010-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	imran	ckw	Well, I could run chat on my iPod but I would be responding slower, and making lots of typos...

2010-01-12T06:46:00.000Z	imran	ckw	if Windows 7 is on (0,1) and it chains to XP on (0,0) shouldn't I set "root" to hd (0,1)? Then, how do I configure the map #'s?
