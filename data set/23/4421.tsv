2007-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	MAHE		and ethernet cable
2007-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	it will not work
2007-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	the cable is not 'crossover'
2007-12-18T19:32:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	a box with many ports
2007-12-18T19:33:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	not between two computers without a crossover cable
2007-12-18T19:33:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	normally the network has one or more switches to connect the copmuters together
2007-12-18T19:34:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	no
2007-12-18T19:35:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	if the 'modem' has more than one port and its a switch/router es
2007-12-18T19:36:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	does it have more than one point
2007-12-18T19:36:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	does it have more than one port
2007-12-18T19:36:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	sorry no
2007-12-18T19:37:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	most cables are used to connect computers to the switch or the modem
2007-12-18T19:37:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	not to each other directly
2007-12-18T19:51:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	no
2007-12-18T19:52:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	a switch connects your computers together into a network, a router may do the same thing but provide a firewall
2007-12-18T19:53:00.000Z	EvanR	MAHE	a modem only allows you a connection over the phone line
