2007-07-22T07:55:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		where's the KDE folder?
2007-07-22T07:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	what do you mean by the kde folder?
2007-07-22T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	that's because you haven't run kde as root, I'd guess
2007-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	http://www.fs-security.com/docs/faq.php
2007-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	use the path they mention for debian, and use use visudo to edit
2007-08-30T10:34:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	thank you very much.
2007-08-30T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	did you install the fglrx one, or are you still using the default one from the install?
2007-08-30T10:34:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	fglrx
2007-08-30T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	fglrxinfo
2007-09-01T13:08:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	maybe you can test it for everyone
2007-09-01T14:37:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	apt-cache policy <package>
2007-09-02T16:15:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	if it's not mentioned in /etc/fstab, ubuntu's supposed to automount it to /media and show it on your desktop
2007-09-02T16:17:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	so if if you remove the reference to it in fstab it will automount?
2007-09-02T16:17:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	mine all do.
2007-11-16T13:29:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	you might try asking on #kubuntu, they know kde better over there in the ghetto :)
2007-11-16T13:30:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	I am, I believe it has something to do with X user permissions, so I had hoped i'd get some help here
2007-11-16T13:31:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	ah, does gksudo work properly?
2007-11-16T13:32:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	yes.
2007-11-16T13:32:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	then it seems to be a kde issue, not X
2007-11-16T13:32:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	ok, thanks :)
2008-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	 /msg ubotu nvidia   for example
2008-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	nickrud	thanks :)
2008-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	MilitantPotato	now, in the window that opened, type   ati
