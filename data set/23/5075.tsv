2007-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox		Hi everyone. I can't make Gutsy to work with my Nvidia GeForce 6200... I've tried everything possible, restricted drivers, nvidia-glx-legacy, glx and glx-new and envy. Nothing works. This is my xorg.conf file: http://pastebin.ca/742130
2007-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox		Nvidia + OpenGL, that is, of course
2007-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox		watch the caps lock, please

2007-10-19T12:51:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	same exact issue here, same card
2007-10-19T12:51:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	my next step was going to be nvidia-glx but sounds like you already tried that
2007-10-19T12:52:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	my issue is with games like Tremulous and Second Life. Everything worked fine on Feisty...
2007-10-19T12:52:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	did you get any XRandR issues when trying to resize using the new drivers?
2007-10-19T12:53:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	trying to resize what exactly?
2007-10-19T12:53:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	: resolution
2007-10-19T15:37:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	sto;; cant figure it out, huh?
2007-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	no, man, I'm on top of this for the last 8 hours or so
2007-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	I somehow got it to work with my 6200 GeForce downstairs
2007-10-19T15:39:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	mine is 6200, any tips appreciated
2007-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	It seems like running "sudo nvidia-xconfig" did it for me (and of course playing with nvidia-settings, but Im sure you did that
2007-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	I'll try. Running nvidia-settings prints a lot of error messages on the terminal, while it eventually opens
2007-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	Here I got tons of error messages
2007-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	Want me to pastebin them?
2007-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	marx2k	ZaphodBeeblebrox	nah Ive been at it for about 6 hours now... im going to bed ...stupid Gutsy...breaking my stupid system...
2007-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	I know the feeling. Have a good rest, mate
2007-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	marx2k	heh :)
