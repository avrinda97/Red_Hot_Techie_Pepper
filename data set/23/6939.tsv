2007-03-17T07:36:00.000Z	blanky		hey guys my videos aren't being embedded into web pages, like trailers for example, instead, it spawns an instance of totem. What do I have to do to make them embedded?

2007-03-17T07:39:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	if i knew i'd tell you but i use the mplayer plugin with ffox
2007-03-17T07:39:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	then it's the mplayer plugin, haha
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	shoot, let me see if i can remember..
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	I already have the mplayer plugin installed :'(
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	thanks for the trying to help though
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	sry don't think i was much help
2007-03-17T07:41:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	it's alright, at least you tried :(
2007-03-17T07:41:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	you say the media tries to all load external to ffox?
2007-03-17T07:41:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	yeah like trailers from apple.com/trailers loads up in totem (external app) instead of being embedded in the page
2007-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	there is a ffox plugin that lets you direct diff. media types to diff. players... MediaPlayerConnectivity... you don't happen to have that add-on do you?
2007-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	not sure what you mean heh
2007-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	i thought maybe if you went add-on happy you might have installed the ffox add-in that makes it load media in external programs
2007-03-17T07:47:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	no, I DONT want to load media in external applications, I want them to be embedded int he pages
2007-03-17T07:48:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	i realize that... it just came to mind because it gives you the effect (symptom) you describe.  but if you don't know what it is you probably didn't install it then so it's not your culprit
2007-03-17T07:49:00.000Z	blanky	mojo	oh I get what you mean now, nah dont got that, dont worry I'm getting help in mozilla irc channel
2007-03-17T07:50:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	glad to hear it.. i was not sure what could be wrong
2007-03-17T07:50:00.000Z	mojo	blanky	good luck
