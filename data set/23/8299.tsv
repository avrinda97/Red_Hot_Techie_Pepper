2005-12-11T16:34:00.000Z	jason__		Hello all! Just installed Ubuntu 5.10 yesterday. Decided to get a wireless card today.
2005-12-11T16:35:00.000Z	jason__		Found a tutorial to add it but it says before doing anything to add ndiswrapper-utils but I cannot find it in the Package Manager
2005-12-11T16:36:00.000Z	jason__		How do I get ndiswrapper-utils if it's not in the Synaptics Package Manager?

2005-12-11T16:40:00.000Z	dave	jason__	What are your sources?
2005-12-11T16:41:00.000Z	dave	jason__	Do you have multiple apt repositories set up in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-12-11T16:42:00.000Z	jason__	dave	I've got the default one that comes with the install.
2005-12-11T16:43:00.000Z	dave	jason__	You will probably need to have more than just the default repositories.  Do you know how to add repositiories?
2005-12-11T16:44:00.000Z	dave	jason__	I don't know how to in synaptic because I do not use gui, but I do know how to with a text editor.
2005-12-11T16:46:00.000Z	jason__	dave	Found how to add one in synaptic...what do I need to add?
2005-12-11T16:47:00.000Z	dave	jason__	I would add the universe and the multiverse
2005-12-11T16:48:00.000Z	jason__	dave	They are actually checkboxes in synaptic so I just had to check them, reloading lists now.
2005-12-11T16:48:00.000Z	dave	jason__	I have the default and the universe and the multivers repositories and I CAN install ndiswrapper-utils
2005-12-11T16:48:00.000Z	dave	jason__	cool, that's easy then
2005-12-11T16:48:00.000Z	dave	jason__	once you have added these repositories, make sure that you update your list
2005-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	jason__	dave	Yep. just did that
2005-12-11T16:50:00.000Z	dave	jason__	Are you able to find ndiswrappers now
2005-12-11T16:52:00.000Z	dave	jason__	Cool.  Glad that I could help
2005-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	jason__	dave	Got ndiswrapper installed and followed the on-line tutorial I found but when I run 'sudo ndiswrapper -l' it doesn't say 'hardware present'
2005-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	dave	jason__	Hmm, I do not use ndiswrapper.  Someone else might have to help you with ndiswrapper.   Is there a channel specifically for ndiswrapper?
2005-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	dave	jason__	#ndiswrapper
