2008-06-12T05:00:00.000Z	wastedfluid		Hi.  Ubuntu 8.04.  When I set up remote desktop.. it all looks fine(Preferences->Remote Desktop) - but when i log in with what it tells me to from my windows computer - vncviewer says "failed to connect to server" - it's all LOCAL, no firewalls, goes through router.. any idea?  I have a drive mapped, I can ping the box...
2008-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	what type of router?
2008-06-12T05:02:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	Linksys WRT54G.  i should note I tested FREENX, and the FREENX client worked.. I just don't want to use FREENX, plus it doesn't resume connections for me.\
2008-06-12T05:03:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	linksys routers have firewall capability , you said no firewall so did you turn it off, or DMZ the Ubuntu box?
2008-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	I didn't DMZ the box.  I was talking about software firewalls.  I have not touched anything in the router, because uPNP is enabled, and I don't need to forward ports.. up to this point
2008-06-12T05:10:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	well if you dont need to forward ports,,, i'm out of ideas,, it just works for me and i am new to Ubuntu, but doing remote for a living for a while, so maybe a ubuntu specific issue, but being local i would suggest looking at logs on both machines and see if there is an instance of "external host xyz was denied ..." or failed login to,,, or access denied.. and look at why
2008-06-12T05:11:00.000Z	wastedfluid		hello again.. I setup Remote Desktop (Via preferences->remote desktop) - however, when I click on "LOCAL connections only" - it will not work - i can not connect to it.. i get "failed to connect to server" - HOWEVER, if I uncheck "Local connections only" - it works ! any ideas?  Seaphor
2008-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	check box on which machine? the "server" or the remote>?
2008-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	On te server machine.. if I select "Local connections only" - and try to connect from Windows - it says "failed to.." - if I UNCHECK local connections only - it works!
2008-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	hrm,,,, so, it works, but only if you open yourself up to anyone,,, ,,,
2008-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	yes.  If I open it up to anyone it works.  Perhaps, when u uncheck that - it adds a uPNP for it?  perhaps, if i forward LOCAL traffic?
2008-06-12T05:17:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	are your router's ip addy and the ubuntu box's ip addy on the same network,,, ie 192.168.1.x/24, ??
2008-06-12T05:18:00.000Z	wastedfluid		yes.. the laptop is 192.168.1.103, and this is 192.168.1.102
2008-06-12T05:18:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	no,,, whats the router's ip addy and sm
2008-06-12T05:21:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	the router can have a ip of 192.168.0.1/16 and issue ip addys to 192.168.1.x/24 and the pc will see it as non local
2008-06-12T05:21:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	well, would 192.168.1.103 and 192.168.1.102 be local, though?
2008-06-12T05:22:00.000Z	wastedfluid		How do I check router's ip addy and sm
2008-06-12T05:22:00.000Z	wastedfluid		I login to the router with 192.168.1.1, if that's what ur asking
2008-06-12T05:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	but its comming from the router on the remote desktop port,,, it looking at the router on that port before it will look at who sent it
2008-06-12T05:24:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	ok, then is on same network and locl,, had to start there
2008-06-12T05:25:00.000Z	SeaPhor		i run all my routers and firewalls on completely different networks for that very reason
2008-06-12T05:28:00.000Z	SeaPhor	wastedfluid	then i would suggest, 1st look up the port ranges for the protocol, check the router logs for those ports being denied, forward them if necessary , and then look at every option for ubuntu, but at the point that its a ubuntu issue then i will pull in help
2008-06-12T05:28:00.000Z	wastedfluid	SeaPhor	 Let me look at the logs.
