2006-01-06T17:29:00.000Z	brasko		Thanks for the advice, I got the Ubuntu installation going now
2006-01-06T17:29:00.000Z	brasko		The CD was definatly burned incorrectly.
2006-01-06T17:29:00.000Z	brasko		The 1 odd thing about hte installation process to me was the partition/format dialog
2006-01-06T17:30:00.000Z	brasko		I've used red-hat/debian/suse, and they all seem similar
2006-01-06T17:30:00.000Z	brasko		Ubuntu's seems slightly different, and more confusing to me
2006-01-06T17:31:00.000Z	brasko		Well, the partition/format is kind of built into 1 step, instead of 2
2006-01-06T17:31:00.000Z	brasko		Maybe it'll just take some getting used to
2006-01-06T17:32:00.000Z	brasko		I'm hoping it didn't format my /home partition
2006-01-06T17:32:00.000Z	brasko		but I can't tell if it did or not, until instalation is doone
2006-01-06T17:32:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Did you tell it to?
2006-01-06T17:33:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Then it shouldn't have touched /home
2006-01-06T17:41:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Unplug the KVM and use 'Terminal Server Client' :-)
2006-01-06T17:42:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	What kind of KVM is it btw? just a hardware switch or a proper powered one?
2006-01-06T17:42:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Applications -> Internet -> Terminal Server Client -> Connect to the windows box with the RDPv5 protocol.
2006-01-06T17:43:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	The more expensive KVMs emulate the hardware for the box you're not switched to, so you don't get this sort of problem.
2006-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	gdm wants to listen on a privileged port, and thus needs to run as root.
2006-01-06T09:38:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Playing with vnc?
2006-01-06T09:39:00.000Z	brasko	cafuego	yeah
2006-01-27T09:15:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	'cvsd' is a chrooted version of cvs. You don't need it to run a normal cvs server.
2006-01-27T09:16:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Yes
2006-01-27T09:16:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	and add the same cfg in inetd.conf or xinitd.conf
2006-01-27T09:18:00.000Z	cafuego	brasko	Check /etc/xinetd.d
2006-01-27T09:19:00.000Z	brasko	cafuego	what do you think the permissions should be?
