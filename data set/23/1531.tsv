2010-08-19T19:21:00.000Z	erry		Btw, anybody got wireless to work on a toshiba t110?
2010-08-19T19:21:00.000Z	erry		I have rtl8187se card and it causes kernel panics
2010-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	erry		I posted a bug report about it which nobody seemed to pay attention to
2010-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	Not a T110, but on an ASUS-A6V my RT carrd is working wiht WPA
2010-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	rtl8187se?
2010-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	it matters. rtl8187b which i have in another laptop works fine, but se won't.
2010-08-19T19:23:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	well seems i got really unlucky with the specific model./
2010-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	did you looke at the UB-WiFI docs ?
2010-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	don't think so
2010-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	it's not just that it doesn't work... It crashes the system
2010-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	it's for 804 / 9.10 but worth a shot: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/RealtekRTL8187b
2010-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	B works fine.
2010-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	i have a problem with SE\
2010-08-19T19:30:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	the binaries in that forum are for an older kernel..
2010-08-19T19:30:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	according to the WiFI docs, ur card is natively supported, so I dont dont know what the deal is there.
2010-08-19T19:31:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	it crashes the system if i load the driver.
2010-08-19T19:31:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	perhaps if it didn't crash the system it would work
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	those binaries you linked me to are 32 bit and i have 64 bit
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	Sri mate, that's the only one I could find.
2010-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	it says r8180 wasnt found
2010-08-19T19:43:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	sri, I can't help any further on that one.
2010-08-19T19:44:00.000Z	erry	KE1HA	maybe if i update the kernel?
2010-08-19T19:45:00.000Z	KE1HA	erry	pass mate, have no idea why it's not working.
