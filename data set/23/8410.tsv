2010-06-27T10:30:00.000Z	ConfusedLinux_		i installed Ubuntu 10.04 the other day to run the game Starcraft , and whenever I play it for about 3-6 minutes, it either says that the game isnt installed or just quits me to the ubuntu login screen
2010-06-27T10:32:00.000Z	ConfusedLinux_		Is there an easy way to dual boot Windows 7 and Linux Mint 9 or Windows 7 and Kubuntu 10.04?
2010-06-27T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 if you have 2 hard drives.. that makes it very very easy.
2010-06-27T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 with 1 hd. you may want to resize the windows partition from within windows. leave part of the HD unallocated. and let the ubuntu installer install to that unalocated space.
2010-06-27T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 it can also be an issue with Samba shares. if you have 'DataDir' and 'datadir' on the same share.. windows can get confused and not see one.
2010-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 its a free world.. get what you want.
2010-06-27T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 it all depends on your 'needs'
2010-06-27T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 so you cant 'fix' windows.. so you want to play windows games in linux.. :)     Check the wine app database on that game and see if theres any known wine issues with it.
2010-06-27T10:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 its not.. windows is confuseing.
2010-06-27T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 and using games in wine. is always a bit of a gamble.
2010-06-27T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 but... you were unable to actually FIX your problem in windows.. so that sort of points that its not simple.
2010-06-27T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 computers are 'simple' when they work.. when somthing breaks.. well thats when you get into the issues.
2010-06-27T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 i dont use Win7 and i basically dont game on windows any more either. So cant help.
2010-06-27T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 theres dozens of irc clients out there.  xchat is the common one.
2010-06-27T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ConfusedLinux_	 what game exactly are you trying to play? Starcraft 1 2? 3 ? i dont even keep track.
