2012-03-04T03:28:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	I've never had an issue, running 12.04 on MacBook 1,1...
2012-03-04T03:28:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	this is a macbookpro 3.1
2012-03-04T03:30:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	not seen anything to do with having to upgrade from 9.04 for macbookpro 3,1 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro
2012-03-04T03:31:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	suggests 10.10 works perfectly pretty much
2012-03-04T03:31:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	would also assume that later versions would do as well
2012-03-04T03:32:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	I would suggest downloading a more recent version, 11.10 for instance and trying that
2012-03-04T03:33:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	lubuntu 11.10 then :P
2012-03-04T03:34:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	you are aware that no matter what flavour of 'buntu you get you can simply install whatever desktop you wish on it? There's even a fork keeping the older version of Gnome alive
2012-03-04T03:35:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	I prefer gnome.. and the system is powerfull enough to handle unity and everything.. however the lack of any menustructure in the unity interface is a real showstopper for people needing more programs than the bar can show at once
2012-03-04T03:39:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	I'd suggest installing Ubuntu 11.10 then simply install the desktop you want... You can even remove Unity.
2012-03-04T03:40:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	have looked into that however, the backports are even buggier then unity
2012-03-04T03:43:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	well, at the risk of being told off by admins, maybe Ubuntu is not the distro for you?
2012-03-04T03:46:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	I am hoping eventually MS will realize that it's the   that solve most problems, and most geeks I know of ( even our great LT ) ran away from ubuntu after unity.
2012-03-04T03:47:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	probably 11.04 will become ubuntu's "XP" no vista/7 or 8 for a
2012-03-04T03:49:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	personally I like Unity. I'm running 12.04 atm and I'm enjoying the new HUD (kind of like a quick search for everything). If you are going to have any version install lower than 11.10 I'd say 10.04 if you havn't already
2012-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	I am planning on running 12.04 in VM to check out the hud
2012-03-04T03:51:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	cool, you might find you can survive without traditional menus... I figured it out, even initially not liking the idea, but now I think it's ace
2012-03-04T03:53:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	you are aware that you can access all programs from unity even in the early versions without adding them to the launcher? you don't have to put every app in the launcher, it's just for popular ones you use often :p
2012-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	I really do not want to have to visually search in a sea of icon's to hope that I find the only I was looking for
2012-03-04T03:55:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	fair enough... But as it stands you are sacrificing system stability, reliability and performance by not running a recent distro.
2012-03-04T04:00:00.000Z	lapion	tr33m4n	 the concept of the unity icon system is like heading back to 1993 and getting a NEXT, and the forest of icons in  in the all-apps unity windows is like heading back to the likes of windows 1.0-3.11, so I do not understand how unity is progress
2012-03-04T04:01:00.000Z	tr33m4n	lapion	well it works for me :)
