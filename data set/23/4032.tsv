2007-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	under the add window, make sure you select something for "calendar" to be published
2007-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	(the first tab that comes up) you must select a publishing source (the second tab is for destination)
2007-12-11T16:50:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I've selected one of my calendars.. still nothing.
2007-12-11T16:50:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I tried the default "Personal" first, that didn't work, I created a new Calanedar to try.  Still grayed out.
2007-12-11T16:51:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	you select webdav, put a server name, and a file name, and OK doesn't become available? on mine i only have to provide those three to get an ok (after selecting a source calendar)
2007-12-11T16:52:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	correct
2007-12-11T16:52:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	What do you have as your server name?
2007-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I have tried http://server.com/dav, http://server.com , server.com
2007-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	Still always grayed out.
2007-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	i can type anything...i tried several text strings (including obviously illegal ones)
2007-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I have all the optional information filled out as well.  Still nothing.
2007-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I have publish as iCal and Pub Freq as Daily although I have tried every other combination without success.
2007-12-11T16:55:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	Do I have to have some other app or plugin installed that I don't know about?
2007-12-11T16:55:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	i'll check my plugins, but it is all defaults (i even just tried using all spaces for server and file and OK becomes available on my end)
2007-12-11T16:57:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	so frustrating.  I'm trying to get everything the way I would need it to be on an old computer before I permanently switch from WinXP to Ubuntu, and Evolution is a major part cause as of now I can't live without Outlook
2007-12-11T17:00:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	unfortunately, i am unable to break my calendar at all to replicate the issue
2007-12-11T17:01:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	hmm.. I'm not sure where else to go with this. I can't find anything on google ubuntu's forums.
2007-12-11T17:04:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	I'm an idiot.
2007-12-11T17:04:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	yah i'm curious though for my own edification :)
2007-12-11T17:05:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	For some reason I'm not used to the check boxes yet, or I haven't had enough sleep in the last two weeks. But I was merely clicking on the calendar source and assuming that was selected. I didn't notice the actual checkboxes next to them.
2007-12-11T17:06:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kitofhawaii	kling0n: sorry for wasting your time and I appreciate the help.  Mental lapse.
2007-12-11T17:06:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	all good :)
2007-12-11T17:13:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	isleshocky77	hmmn....i dunno i do a lot of VM work on my laptops. virtualization's been phenomenal on ubuntu
