2007-02-19T09:30:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	grub-install /dev/hda???
2007-02-19T09:30:00.000Z	mbrnoob	kjon	I'l ltry it
2007-02-19T09:34:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	have a look on the grub manpage about installing grub manually on the mbr.
2007-02-19T09:48:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	If it doesn't work, you can build a voodoo doll to curse arrenlex -"The GRUB guy"-, ok? :P
2007-02-19T09:50:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	 why don't you try and mkfs.xfs /dev/sda ?? :P (joking!)
2007-02-19T09:50:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	did you try the chroot trick? did it work?
2007-02-19T09:52:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	try the following
2007-02-19T09:52:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	have a look at your 'fdisk -l' output...
2007-02-19T09:52:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	what's your root partition?
2007-02-19T09:54:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	Do you have 2 partitions?
2007-02-19T09:54:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	winblowz and ubunu?
2007-02-19T09:54:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	gimme a sec
2007-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	issue the following as root:
2007-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	grub
2007-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	then, root (hd1,0)
2007-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	yes, get out of the chrooted environment
2007-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	and then setup (hd1)
2007-02-19T09:58:00.000Z	kjon	mbrnoob	an easier way might be: grub-install /dev/sdb
2007-02-19T10:00:00.000Z	mbrnoob	kjon	it complains about not finding /boot
