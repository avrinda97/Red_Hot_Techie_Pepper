2011-10-14T10:15:00.000Z	faryshta	cousin_luigi	thanks.
2011-10-14T10:48:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	faryshta	did it work with 11.04?
2011-10-14T10:49:00.000Z	faryshta	cousin_luigi	I don't know. I have a different chipset than you.
2011-10-14T10:49:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	faryshta	I mean did your card work with the previous version of ubuntu?
2011-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	faryshta	cousin_luigi	yes but not out of the box. It worked pretty bad. I used the same steps as before with no results.
2011-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	faryshta	ndiswrapper, by any chance?
2011-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	faryshta	cousin_luigi	that is my last resource.
2011-10-14T10:52:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	faryshta	what steps did you use in the past?
2011-10-14T10:52:00.000Z	faryshta	cousin_luigi	The ndiswrapper site doesn't mention my chipset and its not a native driver.
