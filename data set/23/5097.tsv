2008-04-30T16:05:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	Do your have an ATI card?

2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	Have you installed FGLRX?
2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	sharkp		gimme another information... is xorg.conf changed?
2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	Do you want compiz or happy without it?
2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	sharkp	menisk	I've removed after I've tried it
2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	menisk		Yes
2008-04-30T16:06:00.000Z	sharkp	menisk	I've a radeon hd 2600 XT AGP, I'm not so happy...
2008-04-30T16:07:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	what we'll do is shove you on a driver that won't boot compiz then install FGLRX and have compiz. Sound good?
2008-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	sharkp	menisk	FGLRX doesn't work with new ati agp card, there's a problem with agpgart
2008-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	Since when can you get AGP 2600s?
2008-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	sharkp	menisk	ehm... haven't understood the question...
2008-04-30T16:09:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	If you know it's an AGP thing I'm no help. I've only ever done PCI-E under linux
2008-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	sharkp		yes, menisk, there's a problem with kernel agp support
2008-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	menisk	sharkp	I'm no help then. Haven't delt with it before.
