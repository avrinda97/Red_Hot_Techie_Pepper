2008-07-11T08:39:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Okay, I give.
2008-07-11T08:39:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		How do you connect to the Internet on Ubuntu
2008-07-11T08:40:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Yeah, on Windoze.
2008-07-11T08:40:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		More importantly, how do you view the sites the "connecting to the internet" help file points to?
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		I know how to launch firefox
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Now how do I connect to the Internets
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Cabled
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		On a comtrend CT-301 ADSL Modem
2008-07-11T08:42:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Wired
2008-07-11T08:42:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Yes.
2008-07-11T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	ah,  pppoeconf is the hard way, the best way (if the modem supports it) is having the modem negociate the connection, and have it give a dhcp address to ubuntu
2008-07-11T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	plug in a cable to your router, you should get a connection automatically
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan	nickrud	It's working fine on Windoze, but there's no connection on Ubuntu
2008-07-11T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	is this wireless or cabled?
2008-07-11T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	look up your modem on the net, and see if it has a web browser configuration screen
2008-07-11T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	wait a bit
2008-07-11T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	http://www.dslreports.com/faq/canbrbd/10.1_Aliant#14406 , about the web interface.
2008-07-11T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	not particularly good, you have to hack the modem.
2008-07-11T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	you might want to install pppoeconf, then run   sudo pppoeconf   in a terminal. Once you do that, you can do   sudo pon  sudo poff to start stop internet. But I'd hack the modem eventually, it's a much better way to configure it
2008-07-11T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	and hack is only software hack by the way
2008-07-11T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	I barely did :) Me, I'd go buy a cheeep router with dsl connection :)
2008-07-11T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	true that. But we don't do the docs.
2008-07-11T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	TsuruyaSan	yes, your modem came with software intended for windows
