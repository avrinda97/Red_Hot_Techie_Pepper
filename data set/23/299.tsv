2012-01-08T18:50:00.000Z	antivirtel		Hi! I've installed Oneic recently. My problem is that after the restart it won't boot from HDD. My partition table is looks like this: http://paste2.org/p/1857863 - can someone tell me if it won't boot or will? (+ why not?)

2012-01-08T18:51:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	what step does it fail at ?
2012-01-08T18:52:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	I choose it in boot menu, then it returns, so it can't recognice the OS?!
2012-01-08T18:53:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	it stops at what ?
2012-01-08T18:54:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	how do you mean this?
2012-01-08T18:54:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	It returns to what ?
2012-01-08T18:54:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	it returns to the temporary boot device menu...
2012-01-08T18:55:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	In that menu there is an option at the end, that says Boot from first hard drive..try that option.
2012-01-08T18:55:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	I think it's because you still have the USB/CD still connected,
2012-01-08T18:56:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	no I have disconnected it :) USB...
2012-01-08T18:56:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	Then there cannot be any temporary boot device menu..
2012-01-08T18:56:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	okay..
2012-01-08T18:57:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	yes, it can because it doesn't find any bootable :| unfortunately
2012-01-08T19:01:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	I've tried, it returns to the live CD(USB)'s menu... this partition table must have some problem, right?
2012-01-08T19:04:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	Is this a server install? or a normal desktop one ?
2012-01-08T19:04:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	because the desktop install doesnt normally screw up partitions
2012-01-08T19:04:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	it is just a normal desktop to a laptop
2012-01-08T19:05:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	yeah, you are right, I've never seen the same before
2012-01-08T19:26:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	there is no grub.cfg in /boot/grub, and it writes, that this is read only... why?! May there any problems with BIOS settings?!
2012-01-08T19:27:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	uhh. you dont have permissions to change anything beyond /home/<user> and
2012-01-08T19:27:00.000Z	satyanash	antivirtel	if you arent using sudo... that is.
2012-01-08T19:28:00.000Z	antivirtel	satyanash	I'm not beginner, I'm using sudo, also for mounting, and for `update-grub`
