2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	miki		hello
2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	miki		i got few problems :(
2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	miki		first i cant make floppy to work
2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	miki		says invalid file type or smth like that when using natuilus
2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	miki		and just wont read from command line
2006-01-25T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	put them all on one line with the make of machine and the version of software
2006-01-25T13:03:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	are you using kubuntu or ubuntu?
2006-01-25T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	if you type >> cat /etc/fstab << do you get a line that looks like this >> /dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0
2006-01-25T13:07:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	omw to test it brb
2006-01-25T13:53:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	it shows "/dev/fd0  /media/floppy  auto  rw,user,noauto  0  0"
2006-01-25T13:56:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	so pop in the floppy and type this >>sudo mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /media/floppy <<
2006-01-25T14:22:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	it shows "special service /dev/fd0 does not exist" message all the time
2006-01-25T14:24:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-01-25T14:26:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	its 5.0 iso
2006-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	its 5.10 iso
2006-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	then it should have detected your floppy, is it an external floppy on usb or something?
2006-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	nope, its normal floppy... it works when im booting pc an also it works in windows
2006-01-25T14:28:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	oldschool internal one
2006-01-25T14:28:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	just wondering why it is not detected by ubuntu that is not good
2006-01-25T14:29:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	i had debian previously, and i had same problem
2006-01-25T14:30:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	it looks like its detected but something is not working
2006-01-25T14:30:00.000Z	miki	ompaul	i had file system errors and stuff but all fdd drivers were fine
2006-01-25T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	miki	floppy may be funny hardware, or it may be the case that the media is dodgy
