2005-11-01T15:14:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	it worked a couple days ago though?
2005-11-01T15:14:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	what do you mean it worked a couple of days ago?
2005-11-01T15:15:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	well i would leave my computer and the screensaver would just go
2005-11-01T15:16:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	is it possivle that the 3d rendering just got disabled?
2005-11-01T15:16:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	if it was, it should've said 'disabled', not no.
2005-11-01T15:16:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	i have 2 nvidia 6600 gt's?
2005-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	did you get the drivers for them?
2005-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	yeah
2005-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	i get the nvidia screen before the splash screen
2005-11-01T15:18:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	maybe this would help... when i bring up the preferences for the screensaver it freezes as well?
2005-11-01T15:18:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	...did you enable the drivers for them?
2005-11-01T15:19:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	enabke it?.. how would you do that?
2005-11-01T15:19:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	enable
2005-11-01T15:20:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	assuming you use nvidia-glx ---> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-11-01T15:23:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	doesn't modprobe enable the driver?
2005-11-01T15:27:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	modprobe?
2005-11-01T15:28:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	after the driver is installed i "modprobe nvidia" that enables the driver right?
2005-11-01T15:38:00.000Z	aeon17x	luckyaba_	no, it just installs it.
2005-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	ok... well it has the nvidia screen before the splash screen and my xorg is set to use nvidia?
2005-11-01T15:41:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	ok... how would i enable it then.. nvidia-glx-... didn't work
2005-11-01T15:42:00.000Z	aeon17x		!tell luckaba_ about nvidia
2005-11-01T15:47:00.000Z	luckyaba_	aeon17x	ok... now i was able to disable the screensaver?.. it would freeze the computer when i tried before and i didn't change anything?
