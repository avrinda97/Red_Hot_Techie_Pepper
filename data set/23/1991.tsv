2009-08-07T09:36:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	I'm not sure what you're asking for can be done
2009-08-07T09:36:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	but I don't know for sure
2009-08-07T09:40:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	I understand what you're asking for but the files in /dev probably just talk to the sound driver
2009-08-07T09:45:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	I'm sorry, but I don't know
2009-08-07T09:51:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	he's done passwd, his problem's VNC's password
2009-08-07T10:01:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	have you ever played with esd?
2009-08-07T10:01:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	you might be able to do what you wanted with totem pumping sound through esd
2009-08-07T10:01:00.000Z	c0nd0m	cprevoe	no? whats esd?
2009-08-07T10:02:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	esound or enlightenment sound daemon
2009-08-07T10:02:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	it lets you do some cool stuff like throw sound over a network through another machine
2009-08-07T10:02:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	after that, its just a matter of capturing it on the other side
2009-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	c0nd0m	cprevoe	thanks man ill look into it
2009-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	cprevoe	c0nd0m	np
