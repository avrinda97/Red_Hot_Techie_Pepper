2008-12-17T02:27:00.000Z	kosse		trying to run wow under wine on a nvidia 9600 GT. wow locks up the machine after a minute or so. Anyone know anything about this card and the driver support for it?
2008-12-17T02:27:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Hm i have it and run it ok...
2008-12-17T02:28:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	hmmm
2008-12-17T02:28:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	You have installed the Nvidia 3D driver?
2008-12-17T02:28:00.000Z	kosse		I've installed the driver using envyng
2008-12-17T02:28:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	I'm assuming thats what I need to do
2008-12-17T02:29:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	what version of the driver are you running?
2008-12-17T02:29:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Ok, let me give you a line...
2008-12-17T02:31:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Add SET gxApi "OpenGL" in the Config.wtf file in your wow folder...
2008-12-17T02:32:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	pretty sure I've done that but let me double check. I've made so many changes...
2008-12-17T02:33:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	ah I had it in there but all lower case. is that going to make a difference?
2008-12-17T02:34:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Maybe im not sure... Then i use "wine /blabla/wow/Launcher.exe"
2008-12-17T02:34:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	what version of the nvidia driver are you using
2008-12-17T02:35:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Let me check...

2008-12-17T02:45:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Ok, i installed wine with "sudo apt-get install wine". Maybe you can try it to?
2008-12-17T02:46:00.000Z	kosse	[Spooky]	thats where I started. had this issues and the guys in #wineHQ had me install from source w/ a patch applied. But since it  didn't help I'll go back to the package
2008-12-17T02:47:00.000Z	[Spooky]	kosse	Ok, you need my assistance any more? ;)
