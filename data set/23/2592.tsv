2009-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	leigh		me please!
2009-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	leigh		hi...im running ubuntu 8.10 and have an external harddrive hooked up through USB, i accidentally unplugged it as I was shutting down and now it will not recognize the drive (i assume because it thinks its connected to my previous session)...can i unmount and remount it somehow?  thanks
2009-03-26T06:33:00.000Z	leigh		photojim, i have rebooted...it gives me an error of "unable to enumarate usb device
2009-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	leigh		evilaim:  it is not recognizing the drive in terminal when i type sudo fdisk -l...it finds my other partitions but not that drive
2009-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	leigh		yes...it tells me it is unable to enumerate the device on usb
2009-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	leigh		also...the light on the drive stays on even when i unplug it (signifying that it is connected to a computer)
2009-03-26T06:38:00.000Z	leigh		typed lsusb...hit enter and it just brought me to the next line, with no prompt
2009-03-26T06:39:00.000Z	leigh		evilaim:  i have results from lsusb, what should i be looking for?
2009-03-26T06:40:00.000Z	leigh		evilaim: linux foundation 1.1 root hub, i assume that is an unused port?  other than that i have omnivision technologies, i don't believe that is my drive
2009-03-26T06:42:00.000Z	leigh		i am dual booting windows i will try that
2009-03-26T06:42:00.000Z	pyro2927	leigh	what is your issue?
2009-03-26T06:42:00.000Z	leigh		evilaim:  thank you, i will try and troubleshoot myself...hopefully i won't be back!
2009-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	leigh	pyro2927	i unplugged my external usb harddrive while rebooting and now it will not recognize the drive...i'm assuming it still is "connected" the the previous session
2009-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	pyro2927	leigh	you should be able to force mount it
2009-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	leigh		i tried sudo fdisk -l to find the drive and it is not recognized
2009-03-26T06:44:00.000Z	pyro2927		sudo mount -f /dev/sdb0 /mnt/<volume>        ?
2009-03-26T06:45:00.000Z	leigh	pyro2927	how do i know what <volume> it will be?
2009-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	pyro2927	leigh	evilAIM has got it
2009-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	leigh	pyro2927	 i ran those lines and i believe it is mounted, but i do not have any access to the drive...and it does not report anything else back with fdisk...should i manually unmount it and it will work or am i missing something?
2009-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	pyro2927		can you cd /mnt/external?
2009-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	leigh		media/external is created, but empty
2009-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	pyro2927	leigh	if that doesn't work I guess do the windows safe removal, its the only other idea i have
2009-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	leigh	pyro2927	 thanks for your help...hopefully i won't be back!
