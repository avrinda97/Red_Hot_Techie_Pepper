2007-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	wimdows		*** whilst on the topic of Samba shares - I can't seem to play video files properly over a samba share using WinXP...it's very choppy...
2007-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	what kind of network do you have? its fine here (ubuntu server, ubuntu, xp and osx desktops)
2007-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- a normal network ;-) Ubuntu Feisty (not server) and XP client
2007-05-13T09:03:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	"normal" ?
2007-05-13T09:04:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- not sure what you want me to quantify: netgear modem/router, and another hub/switch with a cross-over configured as a client into the netgear, 100MBit LAN - wired
2007-05-13T09:04:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	and all machines are running at 100mbit full duplex ?
2007-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- yep
2007-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- surely I won't need to setup something like VLC just to play video and audio over the network?
2007-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	I've done exactly the same as you with various ubuntu servers for over a year (and longer with other linux distros) without problem
2007-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- and you can play them perfectly from your Samba share on a WinXP client?
2007-05-13T09:07:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- what client player software do you use on XP?
2007-05-13T09:07:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	yeah, normally divx though I did stream a DVD once
2007-05-13T09:07:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	mediaplayer classic generally
2007-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	what transfer speeds do you get if you copy say a 600MB file?
2007-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- but VLC player should work too, right?
2007-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- dunno - will have to try that
2007-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	yeah it should do - might be worth getting Mediaplayer classic to try it though (its tiny)
2007-05-13T09:09:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- aye, will give media player classic a try - does it support a wide array of vid/audio codecs?
2007-05-13T09:09:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	pretty much everything, assuming you have the codecs installed. you can get the nimo or klite codec packs to get everything you'll ever need
2007-05-13T09:11:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- cheers, will let you know how that goes ;-)
2007-05-13T09:13:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- thanks for that - Media PLayer Classic works great!
2007-05-13T09:14:00.000Z	linxeh	wimdows	yeah it's great - maybe VLC does something odd with direct file access
2007-05-13T09:15:00.000Z	wimdows	linxeh	- hmm yeah could be, it did seem to stutter quite a bit - ah well, I'm happy it's not a server issue ;-)
