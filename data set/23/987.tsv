2010-11-09T03:52:00.000Z	sofaking88		Does anyone know how to enable the ethernet? It was working before! And it's enabled in bios, but nothing is working... :(
2010-11-09T03:53:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	what happens if you do "dhclient eth0" ?
2010-11-09T03:54:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	How do you do that?
2010-11-09T03:55:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	umm errr .. ummm .. do you have a network  icon thingie in your status bar ?
2010-11-09T03:55:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	Yes
2010-11-09T03:56:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	have you tried setting your ethernet settings there ?
2010-11-09T03:56:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	Everything seems fine
2010-11-09T03:57:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	you are going to have to brave the big bad command line (menu -> accesories -> terminal)
2010-11-09T03:57:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	Alright tell me what I have to do in the terminal
2010-11-09T03:58:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	what does "ifconfig -a eth0 |grep inet" give you ?
2010-11-09T03:59:00.000Z	simplyseth		sudo modprobe -a i810
2010-11-09T03:59:00.000Z	simplyseth		woops
2010-11-09T04:01:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	Hmm the wired connection is called "Auto Ethernet". Do I type that instead of eth0?
2010-11-09T04:01:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	its eth0 or eth1 or or or eth2 .. etc
2010-11-09T04:02:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	All I'm seeing is Auto Ethernet... I dunno
2010-11-09T04:03:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	weird .. then I'm lost .. usually ifconfig gives l0 and eth<something>
2010-11-09T04:06:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	What if I change auto ethernet to eth0...?
2010-11-09T04:07:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	.. I'm confused .. in the 8+ years I worked with Linux .. I never seen an interface named something other than eth<something>
2010-11-09T04:08:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	Well this is actually a friend's computer... I never had much of a problem with mine(the one I'm using now)
2010-11-09T04:08:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	I don't understand either
2010-11-09T04:09:00.000Z	simplyseth	sofaking88	and out of curiosity what does  "cat /etc/lsb-release" say ?
2010-11-09T04:13:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu DISTRIB_RELEASE=10.4 DISTRIB_CODENAME=lucid DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 10.04.1LTS"
2010-11-09T04:16:00.000Z	sofaking88	simplyseth	That's all I got
