2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	forward ports on the router
2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	to your server
2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	how would i do this
2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	what is the brand of the router
2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	belkin 54g
2007-05-02T07:35:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	what server you run on your PC(http, ftp..)
2007-05-02T07:36:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	apache
2007-05-02T07:37:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	belkin's utility is usually accesible at 192.168.2.1
2007-05-02T07:37:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	keep in mind that many providers block default http port, so u will have to setup your server to use a different port
2007-05-02T07:38:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	i no i asking one too many q's but what would i enter on the other browser to connect to this pc
2007-05-02T07:39:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	if your apache server is set up already then u can access it from your local network in firefox http://ip_address_of_apache_server:80
2007-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	but u have to configure your router to be able to access your server from outside
2007-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	i want to acces it from a different network
2007-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	coded62_		ok
2007-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	right, so u have to look carefully at your router and see if there's something about default config utility address
2007-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	for belkins u can access configuration utility by going to 192.168.2.1
2007-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	but it may be different
2007-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	just look at your router it has to say there
2007-05-02T07:42:00.000Z	coded62_	usser	thanks for you help always someone to help me in linux unlike windoze
2007-05-02T07:43:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	if not, look at your own ip, if its something like 192.168.x.y then your router config is 192.168.x.1
2007-05-02T07:43:00.000Z	usser	coded62_	no problem
