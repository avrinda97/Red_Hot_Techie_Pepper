2006-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	bluefox83		..i don't want to! i should be able to do that from inside the current running X

2006-08-29T12:35:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	nobody home
2006-08-29T12:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	oh.
2006-08-29T12:39:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	this channel is all volunteers
2006-08-29T12:40:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	this is free software you're using. it's nobody's *responsibility* to answer to you. if somebody helps you, it's because they know how and *feel like it*. this isn't big business, and there is no market share
2006-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	this channel is made up of volunteers, not paid tech support staff. you *can* pay for tech support if you want, but this isn't the place for that
2006-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	i didn't say it was..all i was getting at is, just because it isn't directly a ubuntu issue, doesn't mean you can't try to offer some help..
2006-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	i've been using linux for a few years now, and i have always appreciated every bit of help i get
2006-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	if there isn't anybody who happens to know the solution, you may feel ignored.
2006-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	ah, sweet then
2006-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	i mean, the reason i won't help you isn't out of spite, it's just that i used enlightenment for exactly one day and the quit
2006-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	no no..if no one know then no one knows..that's alright..but turning me away simply because it's not directly a ubuntu issue is a bit rude..just say you don't know..s'all i ask
2006-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	so i don't know
2006-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	sorry
2006-08-29T12:43:00.000Z	ladydoor	bluefox83	i was only trying to direct you to a spot where people would be more likely to know :-/
2006-08-29T12:43:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	don't be sorry, you didn't do anything wrong
2006-08-29T12:43:00.000Z	bluefox83	ladydoor	yes..YOU tried to help. Jack_Sparrow simply said it's not a ubuntu issue..which i do not appreciate..atleast say you don't know
