2011-04-08T20:23:00.000Z	LePousson		anyone can tell me how I may add a UUID to my brand new formatted USB Hard Drive ?
2011-04-08T20:25:00.000Z	LePousson		nobody can help me for any of my problems ?
2011-04-08T20:27:00.000Z	LePousson		ok sorry for bothering but i was not sure that my message was sent properly
2011-04-08T20:27:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	the UUID is generated automatically
2011-04-08T20:28:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: ok but why my system does not see the UUID ?
2011-04-08T20:29:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	what do you mean your system does not see the UUID?
2011-04-08T20:29:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: blkid does not see /dev/sdl1
2011-04-08T20:30:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: could it be the directory name under /media/ where it is automatically mounted ?
2011-04-08T20:30:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	did you run blkid with sudo?
2011-04-08T20:31:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	all the UUIDs are created as sym links in /dev/disk/by-uuid, have you checked there?
2011-04-08T20:33:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	if there is no label then it will use the UUID to generate a mount point
2011-04-08T20:34:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	changing the label depends on the file system used
2011-04-08T20:34:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: thanks for the info and thanks for helping
2011-04-08T20:36:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: any idea for my "sudoers" problem ??
2011-04-08T20:36:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	what is the problem there?
2011-04-08T20:36:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	I missed that one
2011-04-08T20:37:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	did you use sudoedit?
2011-04-08T20:37:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	that is rather bad
2011-04-08T20:38:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	sudoedit provides some protection from accidentially breaking sudoers
2011-04-08T20:39:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	anyway, IIRC, the password bypass is an option that is disabled by default at build time.  in other words you have to recompile sudo
2011-04-08T20:39:00.000Z	LePousson	meganerd	: i just want to avoid typing the password so often
2011-04-08T20:40:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	I have been using sudo for so long that I don't even think about it
2011-04-08T20:42:00.000Z	meganerd	LePousson	it caches for 15 minutes
