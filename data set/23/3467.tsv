2010-05-09T16:14:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	 yes it is, and with 9.10 all worked fine
2010-05-09T16:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	also try installing linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic
2010-05-09T16:19:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	i install the Lucid one isn't it?
2010-06-26T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	mplayer -vo vdpau file.avi
2010-06-26T19:02:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	If i use this command i get 50% CPu usage, using smplayer(with vdpau checked) i stay around the 5% i thought this wasn't the correct command
2010-06-26T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	see what mplayer said in the console maybe it couldn't initializate vdapu and fall back to plain x11
2010-06-26T19:05:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	This one seems to work, what is -vc?  mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffh264vdpau path/to/file
2010-06-26T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	dunno. man mplayer ?
2010-06-26T19:27:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	i get 3 different mplayer but only one with 3 * near the name, is the one that i have installed?
2010-06-26T19:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	that's what i get in lucid with medibuntu   Installed: 2:1.0~rc3+svn20090426-1ubuntu16+medibuntu1
2010-06-26T19:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	so is 1.0-rc3 + svn 2009- 04 - 26
2010-06-26T19:34:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	i get 3 entry after that one :) I have added a ppa for the latest mplayer and i wanted to check if the version installed is that one
2010-06-26T19:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	well mine is from medibuntu so if it is the ppa version it should appear clearly in the deb file
2010-06-26T19:39:00.000Z	matteo1990	erUSUL	Yea but i have 3 output, one from medibuntu, one from the ppa and another
2010-06-26T19:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	but only one appears on the Installed: line; doesn't it ?
2010-06-26T19:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	matteo1990	apt-cache policy mplayer | grep Installed
