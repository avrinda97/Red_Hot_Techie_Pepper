2010-11-10T19:05:00.000Z	dr0id		how to stop 1 ?
2010-11-10T19:05:00.000Z	dr0id		thanks:)
2010-11-10T19:06:00.000Z	dr0id		yeah
2010-11-10T19:07:00.000Z	dr0id		and the python script is running continuously and outputting some data
2010-11-10T19:07:00.000Z	dr0id		I want to exit without killing it ikonia
2010-11-10T19:08:00.000Z	dr0id		weird, I just don't want to kill the process but get out of this screen
2010-11-10T19:08:00.000Z	dr0id		I think closing the console will do it, but that's not a good solution
2010-11-10T19:09:00.000Z	dr0id		gr8 :)
2010-11-10T19:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	if you are using gnu screen just dettach from the script. like ikonio just said. if you do not use screen stop the script send it to background and disown it then clse the terminal
2011-01-27T15:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	tree? ls -R ?
2011-02-09T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	find uploads/ -type d -name "*thumbs*" -exec echo rm -r '{}' +
2011-02-09T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	if the output looks ok then remove the echo
2011-03-10T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	what command gives that error?
2011-03-10T16:28:00.000Z	dr0id	erUSUL	hey, I did a git clone, and got that
2011-03-10T16:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	usually terminal amulators are connected to (pseudo) tty's so is stdin stdout and stderr ...
2011-03-10T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	but really dunno what the error is about... maybe some program was pied to less or something without specting it
2011-04-06T15:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	same here
2011-04-06T15:22:00.000Z	dr0id	erUSUL	ikonia: ohh, I can't have hola2 created beforehand ?
2011-04-10T15:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	anyway, the wiki page has usefull info if you want to attemp the recovery yourself https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery <<< first and foremost make an image of the disk/partition and work in the image
2011-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	dr0id	erUSUL	lets see, I am not linux/ubuntu geek :(
2011-04-10T15:27:00.000Z	dr0id	erUSUL	why did the files not go to trash ? :P
2011-04-10T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr0id	you did not used the gui :P. deltree in Windows does not use trash either XD
2011-04-10T15:28:00.000Z	dr0id	erUSUL	SUCKS MAN :(
