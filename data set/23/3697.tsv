2010-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	lyte		anyone know how i get my /etc/cron.d/apt file back?
2010-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	lyte		a simple "aptitude reinstall apt" didn't help
2010-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	histo	lyte	there is apt-file
2010-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	histo	lyte	that would just be a cron job for auto updates maybe?
2010-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	histo	lyte	the one you want back
2010-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	lyte	histo	yeh basically, but i'd rather use the one from the package than right it myself
2010-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	histo	lyte	I dunno how you got the cron job in the first place
2010-10-13T12:17:00.000Z	histo	lyte	because it doesn't oon anyones system.
2010-10-13T12:17:00.000Z	lyte	histo	documentation says it will
2010-10-13T12:17:00.000Z	lyte	histo	hence looking for that file
2010-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	histo	lyte	what documentation?
2010-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	lyte	histo	the googled and now lost in teh tab abyss kind :p
2010-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	lyte	histo	i'll try a few things like apt-file first
2010-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	histo	lyte	okay well ubuntu isn't set up that way
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	lyte	histo	also "man apt.conf"
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	histo	lyte	lyte are you talking about the cron-apt package?
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	lyte	histo	ahh damn it's cron.daily :(
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	lyte	histo	no not cron-apt
2010-10-13T12:20:00.000Z	histo	lyte	there is /etc/cron.daily/apt
2010-10-13T12:20:00.000Z	lyte	histo	found the file, now. confusing cron.d and cron.daily... pebkac.
2010-10-13T12:21:00.000Z	histo	lyte	how about locate have you ever used that?
2010-10-13T12:21:00.000Z	lyte	histo	yeh, next time... issue is bad permissions (no +x) on the file
2010-10-13T12:22:00.000Z	histo	lyte	seems like the default way they do it
