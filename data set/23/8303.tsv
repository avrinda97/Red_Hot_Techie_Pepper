2004-12-14T09:19:00.000Z	vigilanty		un momento por favor
2004-12-14T09:19:00.000Z	vigilanty		resuming the instalation.
2004-12-14T09:19:00.000Z	vigilanty		started.
2004-12-14T09:20:00.000Z	vigilanty		and just that fast stopped.
2004-12-14T09:20:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Where did it stop?
2004-12-14T09:22:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	I can't put my hands on an install CD right now and fire it up, but have you looked into the different methods of booting the live CD?
2004-12-14T09:24:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	If it is a laptop, you certainly need it, but if you can at least get the install running without it for the time being, a more perminant fix may be able to be worked out later.
2004-12-14T09:33:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	The NVIDIA drivers have not been built against 2.6.9 for Hoary yet I presume.
2004-12-14T09:33:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Ok, try this: "linux acpi=off"
2004-12-14T09:37:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	I guess it is worth a try.
2004-12-14T09:38:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	No go?
2004-12-14T09:39:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Ok, try what I suggested above.
2004-12-14T09:40:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Did that not work for you either?
2004-12-14T09:43:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Glad we got past the problem.
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	If you don't want XP any more, you can.
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Not unless you tell it to.
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	TheMuso	vigilanty	Note that what I suggested is only a temporary work-around.
