2007-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	amishninja		Huh? Oh, I'm on Feisty.
2007-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	amishninja		aptitude, eh? alright, I'll give it a shot.
2007-10-11T09:27:00.000Z	amishninja		Waltz: I actually tried using apt-get already, and php4 is no longer supported by it.
2007-10-11T09:27:00.000Z	amishninja		Waltz: So I'm trying to figure out a workaround.
2007-10-11T09:29:00.000Z	amishninja		Hmm... because I did a google and it said feisty no longer supports php4, and php4 in general will be support-less by the end of the year. I did actually do an apt-cache search php and only saw php5*.
2007-10-11T09:30:00.000Z	amishninja		Yes, I'm developing for a site written in php4 and I need to be able to test it locally on that version...
2007-10-11T09:32:00.000Z	amishninja		I wouldn't mind learning how to actually do it well, but it seems so time-consuming, and why bother doing it if package installers can take care of the overhead
2007-10-11T09:33:00.000Z	amishninja		ah
2007-10-11T09:34:00.000Z	amishninja		any tips on how to start with compiling? I actually am a huge noob when it comes to compiling software in linux (kinda new to linux in general but I know basics like where config files are and how to do some admin stuff etc)
2007-10-11T09:36:00.000Z	amishninja		geef, any tips on learning to compile programs? should I just google it and hope for the best or do you have a specific reference that you like to use?
2007-10-11T09:36:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 Well I learned from FreeBSD which is a bit different than ubuntu, but close to the same.  Let me see if I can find you some references.
2007-10-11T09:40:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 it installs most of the dependencies needed for compiling.
2007-10-11T09:44:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 I have never personally had two installations of php on the same box, so I am not sure if you will run into some errors.  I would say the chance of it is likely though.
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 Unfortunately I have no clue.
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 whenever I compile php here at work for my webservers I just make sure to specify everything I want it to use when I configure it.
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 Untar and unzip it.  tar xzf filename
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 then navigate to the directory it creates.
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 should be close to the name of the tar file.
2007-10-11T09:53:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 then there should be a readme in there, I would take a look at that.
2007-10-11T09:53:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 you are welcome :)
2007-10-11T09:55:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 Give me a second to grab the tarball and I will do it myself so I can walk you through it
2007-10-11T10:24:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 yep, sure did.  If you do ./configure --help it will list all the flags you can use to specify what you want php to use.
2007-10-11T10:25:00.000Z	geefinator	amishninja	 I would read through the flags, and don't worry about being careful, you can always reconfigure.
