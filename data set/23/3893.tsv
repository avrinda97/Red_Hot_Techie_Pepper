2008-02-15T20:07:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	you seem knowledgeable. any clue how to mount a thing such that only root has access to it?
2008-02-15T20:08:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	fstab and set as owner root,.,.not sure how to do it though
2008-06-24T18:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	your having problems with nvidia restricted drivers on the -19 kernel?
2008-06-24T19:00:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	don't think its 19. its the installation CD version
2008-06-24T19:00:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	should be 16 or 17
2008-06-24T19:00:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	oh, sorry, thought i had the same issue,.,. guess not -- have u enabled all repositories then run    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade      ?
2008-06-24T19:00:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	yeap
2008-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	and theres nothing in    System --> Admin --> Hardware Drivers ?
2008-06-24T19:02:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	it asks me to install binary driver and after restart its junk
2008-06-24T19:02:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	i suppose youve checked your xorg.conf
2008-06-24T19:02:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	yes. I changed drivers manually
2008-06-24T19:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	try  'nvidia'
2008-06-24T19:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	also what happens if you boot to recovery mode, then choose the  'fix x' option?
2008-06-24T19:03:00.000Z	clusty	Bodsda	will try. thanks
2008-06-24T19:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	clusty	hope it helps ;~)
