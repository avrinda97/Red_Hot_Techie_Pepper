2008-02-18T01:45:00.000Z	emma		How do you remount?
2008-02-18T01:45:00.000Z	emma		Should HAL or something be edited so that it is permenant?
2008-02-18T01:46:00.000Z	emma		this is a USB connected external hard drive so every time I turn on the computer it will mount itself.
2008-02-18T01:46:00.000Z	emma		that worked, it's gone from the desktop
2008-02-18T01:47:00.000Z	emma		I unmounted /media/disk
2008-02-18T01:47:00.000Z	emma		now mount media disk?
2008-02-18T01:48:00.000Z	emma		mount point /media/disk does not exist
2008-02-18T01:49:00.000Z	emma		I think I should unplug the usb and plug it back in...
2008-02-18T01:49:00.000Z	emma		It just mounted itself.
2008-02-18T01:49:00.000Z	emma		It seems that with USB stuff it mounts itself.
2008-02-18T01:50:00.000Z	danand	emma	- does your disk show up in /etc/mtab?
2008-02-18T01:50:00.000Z	emma	danand	would i check that by doing cat /etc/mtab?
2008-02-18T01:50:00.000Z	danand	emma	- yes
2008-02-18T01:50:00.000Z	emma		It mounted again when I plugged the usb back in but it still shows that the user is root and the user group is root. So I cannot create a new folder.
2008-02-18T01:51:00.000Z	emma		Yes it shows up in the last line of /etc/mtab
2008-02-18T01:52:00.000Z	emma		it says: /dev/sdb1 /media/disk ext3 rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0
2008-02-18T01:52:00.000Z	danand	emma	- can you paste just that line?
2008-02-18T01:52:00.000Z	emma		Yes: /dev/sdb1 /media/disk ext3 rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0
2008-02-18T01:52:00.000Z	danand	emma	- never mind - got it :)
2008-02-18T01:53:00.000Z	emma		You see this is my external hard drive. I want to be able to use it to put things like music and movies and documents on it. But I cannot make a folder in it to put that stuff in there.
2008-02-18T01:53:00.000Z	emma		But there is already a lot of files in it that I can see and even read.
2008-02-18T01:53:00.000Z	emma		Because I copied my old home folder into it before I reinstalled Ubuntu.
2008-02-18T01:54:00.000Z	danand	emma	- you can probably solve your problem by adding an entry to /etc/fstab like /dev/sdb1 /media/usb ext3 rw,users,noauto 0 0
