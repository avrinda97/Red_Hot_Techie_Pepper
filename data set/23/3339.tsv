2010-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	brianski		i suppose someone else would have noticed that before...
2010-10-01T09:18:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Yeah, the default sources.list is a bit verbose.
2010-10-01T09:02:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-10-01T09:04:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	http://pastebin.com/4FQJpH8x
2010-10-01T09:10:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	There are no lucid-security sources there.
2010-10-01T09:11:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Enable security updates in System->Administration->Software Sources.
2010-10-01T09:11:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates main restricted universe multiverse
2010-10-01T09:11:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	lucid-updates != lucid-security
2010-10-01T09:12:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Security updates are copied to updates later, but they won't show up as security updates.
2010-10-01T09:13:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	thanks, that fixed it alright
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Don't worry -- updates are copied from -security to -updates an hour or two after they are published, so you won't be behind much.
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	that quick? why?
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	where can i read more?
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Because security.ubuntu.com isn't mirrored.
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	So we copy it onto the mirrors as quickly as possible.
2010-10-01T09:14:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	i thought that was a "security feature" ?
2010-10-01T09:15:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	Every Ubuntu machine points at security.ubuntu.com so they know about security updates ASAP, even if their mirror is slow to update.
2010-10-01T09:15:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	But most machines point at up-to-date mirrors, so they'll download from there instead.
2010-10-01T09:15:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	This is what stops the security.ubuntu.com DC from melting :)
2010-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	is it possible that new installs don't include security by default, or is it more likely i clobbered my sources.list ?
2010-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	anyhow thanks for your help
2010-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	wgrant	brianski	You must have changed it.
2010-10-01T09:17:00.000Z	brianski	wgrant	yeah i think i did. i don't like how the lines take up so much space, so i usually reformat them at some point. and then i probably copied from my server to my laptop or vice versa :-/
