2011-12-31T05:40:00.000Z	bo		i believe i have filled up my entire sda5 where karmic is installed, and i want to completely free up space on that partition...
2011-12-31T05:40:00.000Z	bo		 i tried "sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get clean" and it returned all 0s (meaning that there were no (unneeded) packages to clean i think)...
2011-12-31T05:40:00.000Z	bo		 i also tried "du -sh.*" in the /home directory and got a bunch of "permission denied"
2011-12-31T05:40:00.000Z	bo		can anybody help please?
2011-12-31T05:41:00.000Z	bo		i have not tried 'rm' because i am not sure how to use it / where to use it
2011-12-31T05:42:00.000Z	bo		drpenguin: how do you suggest i free up space (i don't need ANY data on that sda5 partition)?
2011-12-31T05:42:00.000Z	bo		9.10 karmic
2011-12-31T05:42:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	you could reformat the partition
2011-12-31T05:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	is your system installed to sda5?
2011-12-31T05:45:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	you could just reinstall if you have no data that you care about
2011-12-31T05:49:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	if the deleted partitions (now free space) are contiguous you can reinstall with / at sda5 and /home in a new partition in the free space... there are advantages to keep / and /home on separate partitions
2011-12-31T05:51:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	right now, if I understand, you have two Windows partitions, ubuntu on sda5, and a bunch of free space, right?
2011-12-31T05:55:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	if you run "sudo parted" you can see what the partitioning looks like
2011-12-31T05:58:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	parted is the command line version of gparted (disk manager)
2011-12-31T05:59:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	yes
2011-12-31T05:59:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	"help" gives you the list of commands and "print all" shows you the partitions
2011-12-31T06:00:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	yes, absolutely
2011-12-31T06:01:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	my pleasure and good luck
2011-12-31T08:07:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	"df" will probably tell you what you want to know
2011-12-31T08:09:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	i think so... try "df -a"
2011-12-31T08:09:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	-a = --all
2011-12-31T08:10:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	good luck
2011-12-31T08:10:00.000Z	Chipzzz	bo	ouch!
