2007-11-20T02:35:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	M/B Temp went up 1 degree the others stayed the same
2007-11-20T02:25:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	My wife's does that aswell, I just ignored it.
2007-11-20T02:25:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	I believe it just labels it wrong, is yours a dual core?
2007-11-20T02:26:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	no its an asus a7n8xe deluxe mb with a athlon xp 2800+
2007-11-20T02:26:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	do both increase when you load your CPU?
2007-11-20T02:28:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	all temps stay steady regardless of load
2007-11-20T02:29:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	that's not good
2007-11-20T02:30:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	run glxgears and see if any rise (you'll need to re-enter sensors into terminal to get updated stats)
2007-11-20T02:30:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	ok, but i've had problems with glxinfo crashing X before so if i might disappear for a minute
2007-11-20T02:39:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	still out there?
2007-11-20T02:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	yea, sorta :)
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	any ideas as to why nothing changes?
2007-11-20T02:50:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	yes to all?
2007-11-20T02:52:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	ok, here's what i've got http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45156/
2007-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	i followed this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto to install the sensors
2007-11-20T02:57:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	i don't mind restarting, i can check the bios and see what the temp is according to it
2007-11-20T02:57:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	brb
2007-11-20T03:03:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	nothing changed, cpu temp according to bios is the MB temp in sensors and MB temp is the Intel cpu temp
2007-11-20T03:08:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	nothing changed, cpu temp according to bios is the MB temp in sensors and MB temp is the Intel cpu tem
2007-11-20T03:09:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	Ah :)   None of them go up with 100% CPU usage?
2007-11-20T03:10:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	the MB temp in sensors went up 2 degrees while trackerd was indexing but that was the only change i saw, although according to the bios temps they are labeled wrong or something?
2007-11-20T03:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	sn00zer	you can change the names with gksudo gedit /etc/sensors.conf
2007-11-20T03:28:00.000Z	sn00zer	MilitantPotato	thanks for your help
