2011-12-13T12:07:00.000Z	iqbalkhan		Guys i have finish install ubuntu server 11.10, but there is no GUI just console
2011-12-13T12:07:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	correct, the server install does not come with a gui
2011-12-13T12:08:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	1.) why did you use the server install 2.) what sort of gui are you looking for
2011-12-13T12:09:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	ikonia	i used the server for the development project,, there is some programmer will subit the code
2011-12-13T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	you know you could use the desktop install just fine
2011-12-13T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	that comes with a gui and tools installed by default
2011-12-13T12:10:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	is that an option for you ?
2011-12-13T12:10:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	you can also install a gui on the server install, what sort of thing where you looking for
2011-12-13T12:11:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	ok, what sort of gui are you looking for ?
2011-12-13T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	if you give us an idea of what gui you want / need / expected we can help you install it
2011-12-13T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	or if you tell us the goal you have of using the gui, we can also advise you
2011-12-13T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	thats fine, is there a specific gui you want / had in mine
2011-12-13T12:14:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	that really doesn't effect anything
2011-12-13T12:14:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	ok, so you want gnome,
2011-12-13T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	what version of ubuntu is this
2011-12-13T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	iqbalkhan	ok - if you use the command "sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop" that will install gnome with the unity shell (like the ubuntu desktop) there are other options that may be better suited to the server like the "lubuntu-desktop" package
