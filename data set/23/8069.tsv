2005-03-15T17:56:00.000Z	pablo928		What's the unstable part of Hoary? I loaded it and see  no problems.
2005-03-15T17:56:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	unstable as in it changes
2005-03-15T17:57:00.000Z	pablo928	bob2	I do notice a lot of updates/upgrades daily.
2005-03-31T14:58:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	#ubuntu-es
2005-05-08T12:30:00.000Z	pablo928	bob2	would you check http://www.pastebin.com/276523 and tell me what i need to modify to write to /dev/hda1?
2005-07-26T11:19:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	right
2005-07-26T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	you read the documentation?
2005-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	no, /usr/share/doc/awstats/
2005-07-26T11:13:00.000Z	pablo928	bob2	I read the doc for awstats and figured out this is probably not the app that I need. Can you recommend a good analyzer for web stats on a remote server? (commercial server)
2005-07-26T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	I don't know what sort of information you want
2005-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	then why wouldn't you use awstats?  assuming they give you useful logs.
2005-07-26T11:16:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	it doesn't care where it is, as long as it has access to the log files
2005-07-26T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	so, find out what it's really called.  dpkg -L awstats | grep bin
2005-07-26T11:19:00.000Z	pablo928	bob2	came back /usr/lib/cgi-bin
2005-07-26T11:20:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	so, you have that there.  now just configure it to look at whatever dir youre going to copy the log files to
2005-07-26T11:20:00.000Z	pablo928	bob2	So how do I start the progrqam? Does it have a gui?
2005-07-26T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	no, it doesn't havea gui.  I assume it has a config file in /etc/, though.
2005-07-29T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	it's not in ubuntu
2005-07-29T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-08-03T12:31:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	X won't start
2005-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	X is being completly re-done
2005-08-03T12:33:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	yes
2005-08-03T12:33:00.000Z	bob2	pablo928	the packaging is being completly changed (e.g. it's being split into lots and lots of tiny little .debs)
