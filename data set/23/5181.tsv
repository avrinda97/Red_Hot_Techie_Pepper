2008-10-23T22:08:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	i wrote a howto for the logitech G15 that would be somewhat similar to what you'd have to do a while back - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LogitechG15
2008-10-23T22:08:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	you probably should have told him about control+alt+F6
2008-10-23T22:08:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	err F7
2008-10-23T22:09:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	the relevant sections are adding the key symbols to X and then using xmodmap to map the keycodes to the symbols
2008-10-23T22:10:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	ah ok
2008-10-23T22:10:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	to find out the keycodes to use i had to run xev and push the keys and see what it reported
2008-10-23T22:10:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	this keyboard is similar to yours in amount of keys, but is styled more like the old IBM keyboards.  However, this keyboard I'm purchasing is brand new
2008-10-23T22:11:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	in theory that same process would work for any buttons
2008-10-23T22:11:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	it has a PROM built in so that you can program macros.  the macros are stored in the keyboard itself.
2008-10-23T22:12:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	very handy for linux
2008-10-23T22:12:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	then the macros would work, you'd just have to insert entries for the 24 function keys

2008-10-23T22:14:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	_that's_ the $185 keyboard?
2008-10-23T22:14:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	It's solid Industrial strength metal, and has the "clicky" feel.  Built just like the old IBM keyboard
2008-10-23T22:15:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	that's not plastic your looking at.  It weights a solid 7 pounds
2008-10-23T22:15:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	huh, ok then.  not too shabby.
2008-10-23T22:16:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	it's also as long as my 24 inch monitor lol
2008-10-23T22:16:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	i'm just glad there's a company out there making the old IBM style keyboards that are brand new and black ;)
2008-10-23T22:18:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	I wanted this one, but I can't even find one available on ebay anymore.  I've searched the whole net. http://www.adesso.com/images/big/bigger/MCK-142Pro.jpg
2008-10-23T22:19:00.000Z	coopster	nikitis	looks like you couldn't actually program macros in linux though
2008-10-23T22:20:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	you should be able to.  All you do with the keyboard, no software needed, is hit the program button, type the button you want to be macro'd, and then the macro, and the select button again and bam.
2008-10-23T22:21:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	pushing one button can do up to 72 keys, but macros can be chained as well for a maximum of 862 characters per macro
2008-10-23T22:26:00.000Z	nikitis	coopster	well thanks for the guide.  I'll look into that.  I think i'm going to buy that keyboard for christmas
