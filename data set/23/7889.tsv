2006-10-22T13:11:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	try burning at a slower speed
2006-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	you said you'd used 3 cds, so i thought you were burning some iso image and it was consistently failing
2006-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	what video chipset?
2006-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	hold on

2006-10-22T14:07:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	ah
2006-10-22T14:07:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	you're using a livecd installer i take it?
2006-10-22T14:08:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	at the boot menu, is there a some kind of 'safe mode video' or 'vesa video', something to that effect?
2006-10-22T14:09:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	try that
2006-10-22T14:15:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	I thought the livecd has a launcher on the desktop to do a permanent install
2006-10-22T14:17:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	well, that is a problem
2006-10-22T14:17:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	here are the 6.10 install images
2006-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	fangorious	eck0	replace the 6.10 with 6.06
