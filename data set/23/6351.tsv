2006-10-17T14:16:00.000Z	jewbilee		thanks
2006-10-17T14:17:00.000Z	jewbilee		i downloaded what im assuming was the Live CD from the website
2006-10-17T14:17:00.000Z	jewbilee		and i put it in, and ran it
2006-10-17T14:17:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	desktop cd ?
2006-10-17T14:17:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	yea thats a live cd + installer
2006-10-17T14:17:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	thats right
2006-10-17T14:18:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	if your pc has more than 256 MB ram that should work.. otherwise (less ram) use the Alternate CD instead :) (text installer mode)
2006-10-17T14:20:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	euh.. i don't understand your question well
2006-10-17T14:21:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	ah i see..
2006-10-17T14:22:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	i have no experience with external hd's really.. does it spit out a specific error?
2006-10-17T14:22:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	i only know about internal hd's.. chuckyp: i don't think that would work (mapping) because when the external drive is not connected, it just can't be found
2006-10-17T14:24:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	come back when it works too :)
2006-10-17T14:35:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	hello..
2006-10-17T14:35:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	sooo
2006-10-17T14:35:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	:)
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	what do you want to do
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	do you see your external partition in the installer ?
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	select it as the disk to install on..
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	you can also choose automatic partitioning..
2006-10-17T14:37:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	yes, unless you don't want it to.. but then you're better off with manual partitioning of course :)
2006-10-17T14:37:00.000Z	profoX`	jewbilee	okay.. so.. manual partitioning....
