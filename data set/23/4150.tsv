2007-10-27T04:27:00.000Z	Nelsmar		hhmmmmm my fusion died *crys*
2007-10-27T04:29:00.000Z	Nelsmar		hey anyone know where the compiz log files are stored?
2007-10-27T04:29:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	~/.config/compiz-config
2007-10-27T04:30:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	 nothign about logging in there... any chance you know the param for log?
2007-10-27T04:31:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	hmm... you might try /var/log/messages but highly unlikely... dunno, never needed to log what compiz does
2007-10-27T04:31:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	hhmm eah cause its not working
2007-10-27T04:31:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	what's your GPA?
2007-10-27T04:31:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	it worked when i firs installe dhten it had a memory leak and everythign started locking up... i shut it off and then turning it back on my comptuer runs at 1fps and n visual effects
2007-10-27T04:32:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	what is GPA?
2007-10-27T04:32:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	typo... accidentally pressed P, GA, Graphic Adapter
2007-10-27T04:32:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	6200go. in 7.10 beta worked at 60fps perfectly fine
2007-10-27T04:33:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	I don't know what compiz could have done... XOrg might be the deal
2007-10-27T04:34:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	apears that... my cpu hits 100% instantly when xgl is enabled
2007-10-27T04:34:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	Xgl?
2007-10-27T04:34:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	AFAIK, AIGLX is in Xorg 7.3 and so in every distro
2007-10-27T04:35:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	soooo when i enable compiz it hits 100% cpu usage ;x
2007-10-27T04:35:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	are the effects working at least
2007-10-27T04:36:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	uuhhh i think i see transparency / shadows but wobble isnt working let me check agian brb 2 mins
2007-10-27T04:36:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	wobbly shouldn't be working if selected Basic
2007-10-27T04:37:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	yup all effects are working :)
2007-10-27T04:37:00.000Z	act1v8	Nelsmar	I'm trying to remember where Xorg kept it's log
2007-10-27T04:38:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	i checked the xorg log its clean :(
2007-10-27T04:38:00.000Z	Nelsmar	act1v8	actually let me double and tripple check it
