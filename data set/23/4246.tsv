2007-10-03T05:01:00.000Z	simplechat_		it said that 0.1% were non-contiguous from ubuntu
2007-10-03T05:01:00.000Z	simplechat_		and that there were errors on the root partition
2007-10-03T05:01:00.000Z	simplechat_		does that mean that ubuntu set up its partition too large?
2007-10-03T05:01:00.000Z	simplechat_		or what?
