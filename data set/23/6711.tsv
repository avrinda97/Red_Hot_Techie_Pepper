2006-01-21T17:49:00.000Z	mwe	Forgott3n	you don't install ubnutu from inside windows. it's not a windows program it's a different operating system

2006-01-21T06:33:00.000Z	Forgott3n	mwe	Don't jump to conclusions.
2006-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	mwe	Forgott3n	why did you type that crap?
2006-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	Forgott3n	mwe	I told you, it was computer lag. I inadvertently clicked on the mIRC icon while in Firefox, and Windows lagged out, while I was typing which put it in the mIRC input box.
2006-01-21T06:35:00.000Z	mwe	Forgott3n	well sorry then. It looked like spam
2006-01-21T06:35:00.000Z	Forgott3n	mwe	It's no problem =)
