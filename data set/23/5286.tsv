2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Shaba2		i used my root pw
2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Shaba2		there I have what?
2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Shaba2		you think you coudl be a bit more specific
2008-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	Shaba2		Ok how do I correct that
2008-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	Shaba2		yeah  I tried that
2008-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	Shaba2		no luck getting it to run
2008-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	Shaba2		remember I said Xubuntu
2008-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	Shaba2		Not that I can see Adlai
2008-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Shaba2		"bash vino: command not found"
2008-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Shaba2		from the actual keyboard of the xubuntu machine Adlai?
2008-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	Or Xubuntu* rather
2008-06-27T12:40:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	What do you see then?
2008-06-27T12:40:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	Perhaps upload a screenshot?
2008-06-27T12:41:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	When you connected with your VNC client, did it prompt you to login with a username and password?
2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	There you have it :D
2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	It's just the way you configured VNC
2008-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	Instead of showing you the current user's session, it gets you to login and creates a NEW session.
2008-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	I think there's already a VNC server that comes with Ubuntu.
2008-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	I believe it's called "vino"
2008-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	And what was the problem?
2008-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	What, it doesn't have vino?
2008-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	try running /usr/lib/vino/vino-server in a terminal
2008-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Shaba2	on the Ubuntu machine. And if you are using xchat (or another IRC client), you can use tab-nick-completion. ie. Aha<tab>
