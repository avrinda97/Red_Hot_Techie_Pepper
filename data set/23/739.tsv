2011-03-04T02:02:00.000Z	sjrp		Anyone can answer a simple FTP/wordpress question, please pm me
2011-03-04T02:03:00.000Z	sjrp		Okay, here's the thing. Maybe a silly question but I've got the login for an ftp server, and I need to chmod a folder but all I get is access denied
2011-03-04T02:03:00.000Z	sjrp		do i need to be on the server to chmod?
2011-03-04T02:05:00.000Z	sjrp		Do I need to be on the fysical server to chmod wp-content or is this possible via ftp from home?
2011-03-04T02:05:00.000Z	sjrp		Anyone, help?
2011-03-04T02:05:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	do you need to install this?
2011-03-04T02:07:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	I've got a webhotel with a server that hosts www.lissy.se. I've got the login to the ftp server, and i've managed to login to ftp and get to the wp-content folder but i can't chmod it
2011-03-04T02:07:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	you might need terminal
2011-03-04T02:08:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	sudo -i
2011-03-04T02:09:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	so its saved on the CD? You cant edit the contents of a cd ;)
2011-03-04T02:11:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	Haha, no sorry that wasn't what i ment. I use the command "cd" in the terminal to get to the ftp server that i've mounted, and when I'm in the "httpdocs" folder i try chmod 755 -R wp-content and get permission denied
2011-03-04T02:12:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	are you logged in as an administaor? I would just try to edit from terminal as root (sudo -i)
2011-03-04T02:15:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	Wierd, when I tried sudo -i chmod 755 -R wp-content/ I get "No such file or directory", but if I remove -i it finds the folder but prints access denied
2011-03-04T02:16:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	they are 2 differtn commands, first do sudo -i and then do gedit *********
2011-03-04T02:16:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	or chmod if you prefer
2011-03-04T02:20:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	Chipzzz: Aha! Thank you, I'll try that. What does -i do btw?
2011-03-04T02:20:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	instead of giving you user privelages, it will be as if you are logged in as root
2011-03-04T02:26:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	I get permission denied when I try to enter .gvfs from terminal after doing sudo -i and become root. Wierd to be able to access it as a normal user but not with root? :)
2011-03-04T02:27:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	did it say permission denied, or file not found?
2011-03-04T02:27:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	are you the owner of the server??
2011-03-04T02:28:00.000Z	Jasonn	sjrp	to copy, just highlight
2011-03-04T02:28:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	No, I'm not and that's what I wonder. Is it possible to chmod the wp-content file with just the password to enter the ftp server?
2011-03-04T02:29:00.000Z	sjrp	Jasonn	I've never done this before, but I thought that the ftp login details the admin gave me was the administator login, but maybe it wasn't.
