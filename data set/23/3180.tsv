2008-07-03T12:53:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker		Fryguy, how about upgrading from dapper to fesity then to gutsy and then to hardy?
2008-07-03T12:54:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	you can upgrade directly from dapper to hardy
2008-07-03T12:58:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	your CD burner is probably broken
2008-07-03T12:59:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	what do you mean? did you check the checksum of the files before burning them?
2008-07-03T13:01:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	and you got errors there?
2008-07-03T13:03:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	just burn it on a different computer then, obviously something is either wrong with your burner or your media
2008-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	negge^	i only have one computer with a burner in it
2008-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	then get it at a friends place or at work
2008-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	negge^	i rather upgrade from dapper to hardy
2008-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	then why don't you do it?
2008-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	negge^	thats what i-m intending to do
2008-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	why do you do what? you can upgrade directly to hardy
2008-07-03T13:08:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/04/23/upgrade-ubuntu-606-to-ubuntu-804/ there's a howto
2008-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	if you can just cancel your current upgrade process and let it roll back to the original state then update straight to hardy
2008-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	it'll save you hours of work
2008-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	just press shift + comma
2008-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	I meant shift + dot
2008-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	you don't get a semicolon from up there you're supposed to press Shift + Comma
2008-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	you get a < when you press shift + comma?
2008-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	aah sorry I missed the part where you said you had a spanish keyboard layout or something
2008-07-03T13:16:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	; ; ; ; ; just copy paste from here
2008-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	1. why don't you just change your keyboard layout? 2. if you just need one comma somewhere why don't just copy paste it from here?
2008-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	negge^	CostaRicanQuaker	System --> Preferences --> Keyboard, then click the layout tab
