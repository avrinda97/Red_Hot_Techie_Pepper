2007-10-21T19:58:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	427mb of ram being used? thats quite a lot :O i had 180 in kubuntu feisty
2007-10-21T20:01:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	how much is buffers though
2007-10-21T20:01:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	may i pm?
2007-10-21T20:01:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	i have 763MB used, 28MB buffers, 340MB cached
2007-10-21T20:04:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	incoming four line paste for you
2007-10-21T20:04:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	so about 390MB of RAM is used?
2007-10-21T20:05:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	how do you get 390?  is the buffers what really matters here?
2007-10-21T20:07:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	i have same memory usage as you
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	so the buffers line is really what i should be looking at to determine actual memory used?
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	total used - buffers - cached ?
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	total minus buffers minus cached?
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	yes
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	thank you
2007-10-21T20:11:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	the resulting number is 423mb. will that number ever go down?
2007-10-21T20:12:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	i guess this 400mb usage is a new ubuntu gutsy thing
2007-10-21T20:13:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	well fwiw i had the machine running all day and never hit swap so i guess i'm ok.
2007-10-21T20:13:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	it doesn't appear to be compiz doing it either, which is good :)
2007-10-21T20:14:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	yeah for me compiz only used 4MB of RAM.. thats not the hog, but checkout Xorg memory usage (this is related to compiz!!!)
2007-10-21T20:14:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	9mb
2007-10-21T20:17:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	yeah, if it's 'just gutsy', then well i guess i'll live with it
2007-10-21T20:20:00.000Z	jessie^^	xsacha	stemount: thank you for looking at this with me. i guess this is a 'just gutsy' thing :)
2007-10-21T20:21:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	it was 4 :P
2007-10-21T20:22:00.000Z	xsacha	jessie^^	yeah it's more on video ram. but if you use aiglx it should take off about 20-40MB im sure
