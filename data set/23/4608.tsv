2007-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	OmegaConsole		-help
2007-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	OmegaConsole		Gah, sorry. Trying to learn how to turn off leave and join messages in irssi
2007-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	OmegaConsole		Does anyone know how to acess the menu or anything in irssi?
2007-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	/ignore -channels #channel1 #channel2 #channel3 #etc * JOINS PARTS
2007-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	there is no menu in irssi. It's all done by command line and configuration files.
2007-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	thanks... this is strange.. but cool :)
2007-06-29T15:10:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	add that to menu.lst?
2007-06-29T15:11:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	yeah, in the commented kopt line.  But the first time (the ask) you could just edit it at the grub menu as well
2007-06-29T15:12:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	hmmm.. looking for kopt line now
2007-06-29T15:12:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	Do you mean the kernal line for the specific one I boot up to?
2007-06-29T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	yeah.  it'll go at the end of that.  And you can use setterm to set the attributes (color) of your terminal as well.
2007-06-29T15:14:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	setterm, just a command or another kernal option?
2007-06-29T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	that's a command
2007-06-29T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	kopt should be near the top, before the generated kernel lines
2007-06-29T15:15:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	there is only one kopt?
2007-06-29T15:15:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	found it
2007-06-29T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	yeah.  It's commented out (keep it commented out)
2007-06-29T15:16:00.000Z	OmegaConsole	Flannel	what is the kopt=root=UUID=Lots of weird number ro
2007-06-29T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	That's the stuff that gets put into your Ubuntu lines.  each time you install a new kernel (upgrade, etc), your sources.list gets regenerated.  the kopt line is used to recreate the lines
2007-06-29T15:18:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaConsole	no.  DONT uncomment it.
