2012-07-08T15:43:00.000Z	ceradon		I upgraded to Ubuntu Linux about a week ago. And It was going well. I usually never shut my computer of but when I did I noticed that I had to boot my computer from the flash drive that I had installed Ubuntu on. How can I resolve this issue? I thought I might tell you also that during the setup, the program said it would have to delete two or three partitions (The exact number I can't tell...
2012-07-08T15:43:00.000Z	ceradon		...as I can't remember). Also, if it's relevant, I upgraded from Windows 7 to Ubuntu Linux 12.0.4. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?
2012-07-08T15:45:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	There is no upgrade path from Windows to Linux at all. And whats the problem at that point - do I get you right that your computer doesnt boot without your flash drive anymore?
2012-07-08T15:46:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	Yes.
2012-07-08T15:46:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	I used the ISO images on the Ubunto website.
2012-07-08T15:46:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	Then you apparently installed ubuntu or the bootloader to the flash drive instead your harddrive.
2012-07-08T15:48:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	In the setup, I chose the "Install on hard drive" option. Was it an error on the Ubuntu Installers part or mine?
2012-07-08T15:48:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	You were asked where to install the bootloader at the end of the installation.
2012-07-08T15:52:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	So, what is the ideal solution in this case?
2012-07-08T15:53:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	I guess you have to reinstall, with your flash storage plugged in.
2012-07-08T15:54:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	WITHOUT your flash storage plugged in of course.
2012-07-08T15:57:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	If that's the case then a Netboot is what I'd have to do, right?
2012-07-08T15:58:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	So the flash drive is you installation source?
2012-07-08T15:58:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	Yes.
2012-07-08T15:59:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	Then you cant remove it, but you have to take care where to install the booit loader at the end of the installation process.
2012-07-08T16:01:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	One more thing, How do I login as root on a 12.0.4 Ubuntu system?
2012-07-08T16:02:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	There is no root login on Ubuntu. You always log in as a user and then use sudo.
2012-07-08T16:22:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	Just curious: What if I were to delete all the files on the jump drive then re-install the ISO image onto it then boot the computer. Would that restart the installation?
2012-07-08T16:22:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	No.
2012-07-08T16:22:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	You already have a bootable flash drive. Just boot it.
2012-07-08T16:23:00.000Z	ceradon	bekks	But then how would I get it to reinstall onto my hard drive?
2012-07-08T16:23:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	By starting the installation again.
2012-07-08T16:24:00.000Z	bekks	ceradon	You did it once, you have to do it again.
