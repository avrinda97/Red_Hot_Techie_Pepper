2007-06-23T08:33:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	that's not true
2007-06-23T08:34:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	yes, it is.
2007-06-23T08:34:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	gparted
2007-06-23T08:35:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	that will not tell if you if a partition is mounted or not.
2007-06-23T08:36:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	df -Th will
2007-06-23T08:36:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	my mistake, it will, if it's illuminated
2007-06-23T08:41:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	yes.
2007-06-23T08:41:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	i run windows in a VM. i have 3d installed there. i've run 3d games in it.
2007-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	what VM?
2007-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	vmware/qemu
2007-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	qemu does not have 3d acceleration
2007-06-23T08:43:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	you've proven that it doesn't work through trial and error?
2007-06-23T08:45:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	who are you and why do you spread BS?
2007-06-23T08:46:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	there's nothing wrong with having an attitude.
2007-06-23T08:47:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	i just asked you a simple question, that's all.
2007-06-23T08:48:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	what games do you run with 3D acceleration in Qemu?
2007-06-23T08:49:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	actually, i don't bother with the qemu, and i haven't run games in it in a very long time. CS and Warcraft a few years ago with vmware.
2007-06-23T08:49:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	and what games work better for you in wine than with cedega?
2007-06-23T08:49:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	Wow
2007-06-23T08:50:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	heh, you got sucked into that game too?
2007-06-23T08:50:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	glad i never did :)
2008-08-05T18:44:00.000Z	magnetron	Gnea	they intend to add sarcasm support to utf-9. until then, sarcasm doesn't really transport well over IRC
2008-09-11T21:49:00.000Z	Gnea	magnetron	stop.
