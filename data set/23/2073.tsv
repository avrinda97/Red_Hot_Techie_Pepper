2009-12-19T22:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		I wish to figure out what is going on, sometimes I get ridiculous spike on the cpu that lasts for a few seconds and lags my browser, how do I go finding out why?
2009-12-19T22:28:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	sounds like your browser is causing those CPU spikes.  maybe uninstall some plugins.
2009-12-19T22:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	no it has happened before and with only four plugins installed I doubt that will consume 100% cpu :s
2009-12-19T22:30:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	some of those plugins will cause more problems then you think
2009-12-19T22:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	true say just wished to figure out why exactly it happens at completely random times and days
2009-12-19T22:32:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	I would start by disabling all plugins, then slowly enable them one by one to find out which one is causing teh problem
2009-12-19T22:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	you're assuming it is the browser plugin but right now i am surfing without a problem not even one lag and i am on facebook *shocked* no lags, I very much doubt it is the browser
2009-12-19T22:39:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	I'm pretty sure it is your browser.  Because I had the exact same problem, but you don't need to take my advice, thats fine :)
2009-12-19T22:47:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	it is not about not taking your advise it is that I believe that is very unlikely since its completely random i.e. days/weeks/months etc.
2010-04-03T21:17:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	hey just FYI I was unsuccessful in recovering data with testdisk.  It did recover the partitions though..
2010-04-03T21:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	I see, was it because you repartitioned first or because the data had been overwritten?
2010-04-03T21:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	I am curious to know what went wrong
2010-04-03T21:19:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	I think it was because I repartitioned. I think it may have worked if I had just deleted the partition and not written over it with a new one.  test # 2 I guess :)
2010-04-03T21:20:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	will wait for test 2, if you wouldn't mind could you write your results in the forum, I'll be able to read exactly what you did and how you did it
2010-04-03T21:21:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	I want to test it on a failed HDD, but i need to find one first.
2010-04-03T21:21:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	yeah I will document the next test in a post
2010-04-03T21:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	just make your hdd fail I bet you can find ways to do so online without actually breaking it, I know a while back I found one to test how many writes you can do on a usb before it completely fail lol, wonder if it cna be changed to hd instead but you may not be able to recover it afterwards :s
2010-04-08T00:20:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	axel
2010-04-08T00:20:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	it works like wget
2010-04-08T00:21:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	downloads from multiple sources as well
2010-04-08T00:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	switch10_	nope I want to keep track of the download speed not do multiple connections to a server in attempt to speed up download
2010-04-08T00:21:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	it does that as well.
2010-04-08T00:22:00.000Z	switch10_	Pirate_Hunter	or just put the output of wget to a log file..
