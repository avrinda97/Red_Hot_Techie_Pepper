2008-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	speedhunt3r		What's wrong with rhythmbox? It doesn't play any music files, it keeps skipping. Nothing wrong's with the files, and it's pointed to the right folder. I can play each file through terminal.. what gives...................
2008-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	you need codecs
2008-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	no i don't... it was just fine and one day it decided to skip everysong.
2008-07-12T16:17:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	if i needed codecs then mplayer wouldn't play it either.
2008-07-12T16:17:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	run rhythmbox in the console and see what error it gives
2008-07-12T16:17:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	 no errors..
2008-07-12T16:18:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	do those files exists? in the right directory? can you play them with Movie Player (totem)?
2008-07-12T16:19:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	yeah man I am playing them right now with mplayer, the work just fine,
2008-07-12T16:19:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	check the correct path of the files in the playlist
2008-07-12T16:20:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	 all the files are in one folder and that folder has been imported.
2008-07-12T16:20:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	can you play it with Movie Player?
2008-07-12T16:21:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	yeah, i'm using the mplayer in terminal... anything in GUI can't play the files.. even the gui version of mplayer can't play.
2008-07-12T16:21:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	don't understand why all of a sudden it can't paly.
2008-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	define "can't play"
2008-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	try log out and log in back
2008-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	I hit play... it quickly starts skipping each file after an attempt to play them.. it makes that little error icon next to each file. I try to go into the errors tab but doesn't say what's up...
2008-07-12T16:23:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	weird. ;\ try to ask in the forum
2008-07-12T16:23:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	 i tried banshee same problem...
2008-07-12T16:26:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	 tried relogging same problem.
2008-07-12T16:26:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	did you try with vlc?
2008-07-12T16:27:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	nope not yet... but i don't understand, it should work in rhythmbox.. i used it since i can remember... all of a sudden it starts doing this.
2008-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	jin	vlc can play them... what gives?
2008-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	jin	speedhunt3r	codecs problem probably. if you open a mp3 file with Movie Player, it should ask you to install codecs
