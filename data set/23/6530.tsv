2006-12-11T16:48:00.000Z	Narada		hi guys; which package does the command mail fall into?
2006-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	mailutils or mailx
2006-12-11T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	no swearing please
2006-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	what is the difference between those two
2006-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	mailutils and mailx i mean; because they conflict
2006-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	I don't know. Read the package descriptions with 'apt-cache show mailx'
2006-12-11T16:55:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	k
2007-03-20T13:05:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	fixes for major bugs go into backports
2007-03-20T13:06:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	okay
2007-04-21T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	/msg ubotu info packagename feisty
2007-04-21T15:42:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	is there a bot command for searching for packages in festiry
2007-04-21T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	you mean as in apt-cache search? I don't think so
2007-04-21T15:44:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	yeah that would be too much bandwidth going back and forth :)
2007-04-21T15:45:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	use packages.ubuntu.com instead
2007-04-21T15:45:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	good one
2007-04-21T15:47:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	hmm very innnnnteresting; it is like eix or esearch on gentoo
2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	what missing library?
2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	./RealPlayer10GOLD.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2007-06-04T05:57:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	the package name is libstdc++5
2007-06-04T05:57:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	you're not on 64 bits, are you?
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	Narada	soundray	hmm it installs gcc-3.3-base as well; strange
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	that's fine
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	soundray	Narada	btw, I had bad audio with realplayer. mozilla-mplayer works better for me.
