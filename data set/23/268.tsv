2012-02-11T12:08:00.000Z	Afdal		I have the floppy mounted and I'm in its /media/floppy/boot/grub directory I made
2012-02-11T12:09:00.000Z	Afdal		uh...
2012-02-11T12:09:00.000Z	Afdal		My kernal is on a dmraid partition
2012-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	Afdal		I just need a boot floppy so I can get in and install GRUB natively
2012-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	Afdal		Because grub really hates raid D:<
2012-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	Afdal		<.<
2012-02-11T12:11:00.000Z	Afdal		Well...
2012-02-11T12:11:00.000Z	Afdal		I'm having a lot of trouble getting grub to install on that
2012-02-11T12:11:00.000Z	Afdal		So for now I'm just trying to get grub up somewhere so I can actually boot
2012-02-11T12:11:00.000Z	Afdal		I'm tired of tinkering around on a Live OS
2012-02-11T12:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	you tried supergrub or reloading the grub bootloader to the mbr
2012-02-11T12:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2012-02-11T12:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	it boots a OS that is broken, small download worth a try. YOU can also reload the grub bootloader to the mbr, we also have a script you can run that will tell what is where in the OS
2012-02-11T12:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	you can't boot windows then, you can use esaybcd to boot ubuntu from the windows boot.
2012-02-11T12:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	use easybcd
2012-02-11T12:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	it is a app that willboot other OS's from the windows boot menu.  http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/
2012-02-11T12:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	to be honest the floppy is a waste of time easybcd will do what you want.
2012-02-11T12:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	here is the free one
2012-02-11T12:21:00.000Z	Afdal	urlin2u	FIRST, I need to deal with this error I'm getting when trying to install grub on this raid partition
2012-02-11T12:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	I didn't pick up the raid never mind.
2012-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	In rember talking to you in ubuntu-beginners you have randomly spread grub files across your set might you share that with people helping you.
2012-02-11T13:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	good luck hope you up and running.
2012-02-11T13:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	Afdal	you can save the urls to leafpad and put them on a thumb
