2009-01-05T21:40:00.000Z	homy		HI! I created bootable usb-drive using Create usb startup disk in an intrepid live cd. (32bit). But it doesn not work, my computer says "no bootable device found" when I select "removable" as the boot device.
2009-01-05T21:40:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 That's for booting up.... at BIOS.... not Windows.
2009-01-05T21:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 Kill the power switch on Vista.  Boot up and press <menu boot> button.  Select USB.
2009-01-05T21:41:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	yes. It says "Press F9 to select first boot device after POST", then I pressed F9 and got a menu with removable, cd and hard disk.
2009-01-05T21:41:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	i did select that in the bios.
2009-01-05T21:42:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 That's strange.  It should be.  I know because I did that few hours ago.
2009-01-05T22:12:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 How about disc?
2009-01-05T22:13:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	yeah, I can boot fine from a cd rom but, i want to have a usb thumb drive on which I can also save settings and stuff like that.

2009-01-05T22:16:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	yes. I used method 0. (but in intrepidm usb-creator is included by default and I didn't have to install it)
2009-01-05T22:17:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 What Ubuntu version?
2009-01-05T22:19:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	intrepid uname -r: 2.6.27-11-generic  dpkg-query -W usb-creator: usb-creator 0.1.10
2009-01-05T22:19:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 Did you try different flashdrive?  I had some issues with certain flashdrives in the past.
2009-01-05T22:21:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	well, no I only have one. But, I made it bootable using usb-creator before. But then, after a while, I wiped the drive; and today, I want to install ubuntu on it again. So I know the drive works.
2009-01-05T22:22:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 It work... but it is probable that you wear the usb drive out already.  See if you can open inside... save files on it... etc.
2009-01-05T22:23:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	yes, otherwise usb-creator couldn't save files on it (and I see that there now are fles on the drive)
2009-01-05T22:24:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	I tried the Method 0 given.
2009-01-05T22:26:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 I'm aware you tried the method 0.  However -- There are nothing I can do.  It worked for me.  Did you try saving files on the usb?
2009-01-05T22:27:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	right-click->create document->empty file works well. Btw, the usb drive is formated to fat32? Is that ok?
2009-01-05T22:27:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 I mean... save to the USB.
2009-01-05T22:27:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	yes, saving to usb also works fine
2009-01-05T22:28:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	homy	 If nothing work, try Method 1... and 2.
2009-01-05T22:28:00.000Z	homy	jinja-sheep	ok, I'll probably do that. The weird thing is, method 0 worked perfectly for me in the past.
