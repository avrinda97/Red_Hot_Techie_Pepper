2006-06-28T10:05:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	I just got here.  whats the problem?
2006-06-28T10:06:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	first time, i try to plug in a brand new 1gb usb flash/pen drive ubuntu dapper doesnt recognize it.
2006-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	open a terminal (shell). First make sure the usb system see somethign plugged in: lsusb
2006-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	that is the problem, lsusb just sees the mouse and keyboard, connected to one usb-ps connector.
2006-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	less /var/log/messages -hit > to get to the end - look for somethign like : Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
2006-06-28T10:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	here is what mine looks like - try to cut/paste the similar amount and post the link
2006-06-28T10:15:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	i did that but i do not find any attached scsi etc. i checked it with the link that u send
2006-06-28T10:17:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	tail /var/log/messages - cut paste whatever that displays
2006-06-28T10:18:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	in one second. where do i paste it though in the personal message
2006-06-28T10:18:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	if you don't see anything in messages, I don't think any fstab is going to work
2006-06-28T10:18:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-06-28T10:20:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	did u get the file
2006-06-28T10:21:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	paste the URL 'here'
2006-06-28T10:25:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16674
2006-06-28T10:25:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	sorry i didn't knew how to use that i think i figured it out
2006-06-28T10:27:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	you dun good.  too bad I don't see anything about the pen drive being recognized in any shape (including a "what is this?" kinda message)
2006-06-28T10:27:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	so what does that mean, is there a way to make it work
2006-06-28T10:27:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	what live CD's do you have ?  Ubuntu Dapper, Knoppix.. etc
2006-06-28T10:28:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	it can work - it works on all sorts of computers - something on your box is just tweaked :)
2006-06-28T10:29:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	i have ubuntu breezy, knoppix, dsl
2006-06-28T10:30:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	do you think if i reboot with dsl or knoppix it might recognise
2006-06-28T10:30:00.000Z	CarlFK	taoscotch	I would start with knoppix, see if it does any better
2006-06-28T10:30:00.000Z	taoscotch	CarlFK	cool, but if i do that i might have to log off over here.
