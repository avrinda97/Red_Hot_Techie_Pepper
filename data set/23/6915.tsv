2006-06-03T08:40:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		I need some help playing .wmv files
2006-06-03T08:40:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		I gave done what the docs say on ubuntu page but still in totem the files says it doesnt have decoder
2006-06-03T08:42:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		For .wmv totem says "You do not have a decoder installed to handle this file."
2006-06-03T08:43:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		Has someone played .wmv with 6.06?
2006-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	you need win32 codecs
2006-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	I installed them like it said on unbuntu docs
2006-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	But ... totem still says "You do not have a decoder installed to handle this file."
2006-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	did you try mplayer?
2006-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	I typed "wget -c ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20050412-0.4_i386.deb"
2006-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	then "sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.4_i386.deb"
2006-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	there were no errors, seemed to work.... but doesnt play, and I did not try mplayer
2006-06-03T08:47:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	i checking on my machine, sec
2006-06-03T08:50:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	ain working with totem player
2006-06-03T08:51:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	yes ... it works on mplayer
2006-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	tested it?

2006-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	ok cool thanks
2006-06-03T08:53:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	also xvid doesnt play in totem, plays but without video, only sound
2006-06-03T08:54:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	i dont really use totem
2006-06-03T08:54:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	if you dont like mplayer ... you can try xine
2006-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	xine handles wmv as well
2006-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	pradeep	GuerillaTactiks	be back
2006-06-03T09:01:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	pradeep	earthen solution : Install totem-xine .. works now
