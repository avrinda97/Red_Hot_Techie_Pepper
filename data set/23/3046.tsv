2008-12-17T16:44:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	virtualcut is nice for making screenshot-collections if that's what you want
2008-12-17T16:45:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	I am basically needing to make a thumbnail sheet, will that work?
2008-12-17T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	sorry.. videocut.
2008-12-17T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	vmeare has messed with my mind.. =)
2008-12-17T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	yes, it makes thumbnail sheets.. with titles and such
2008-12-17T16:46:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	videocut is in the synaptic I hope?
2008-12-17T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	yes
2008-12-17T16:49:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	nothing official afaik
2008-12-17T16:50:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	well I installed it from synaptic, and I have no idea how to use it...
2008-12-17T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	imagemagik is a commandline tool.. you run it from the terminal.. after reading the huuuge manual =)
2008-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	video cut was not found in the synaptic
2008-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	have you enabled the repository "universe"? it's done in system, administration, software sources
2008-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	when I search that, it comes up with nothing. And yes, I have enabled universe
2008-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	are you using intrepid?
2008-12-17T17:02:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	hardy
2008-12-17T17:02:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	ahh.. it isn't available for hardy.. it just got included in intrepid
2009-01-27T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	avidemux
2009-01-27T21:15:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	thanks
2009-01-28T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	check if imagemagick can't do it
2009-01-28T00:19:00.000Z	whitedox	Slart	I have imagemagick, but I suck at command line stuff.
2009-01-28T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	whitedox	perhaps there is a gui for imagemagick.. have you checked their site? or synaptic?
