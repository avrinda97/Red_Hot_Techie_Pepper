2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	what do you mean "nothing loads" after you login?
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	after i type in username and pw in in GDM, the desktop starts to load, but doesnt. No icons, no taskbar, etc. Just wallpaper color
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	i can change session to login to failsafe terminal though
2009-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	hmm.  From a terminal you may be able to do "apt-get dist-upgrade" to finish the upgrade?
2009-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	i have no internet. Any way to get it started?
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	it looks like X is configured fine, but the script that starts Gnome after X comes up is missing or broken
2009-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	maybe. When i logged in, GDM didnt start. said hardware was miconfigured(all this even before log in screen). I had options to configure it right or reset to default settings. I reset to default settings, and restarted, now this started happening
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	in the gdm screen in the lower left corner, can you set the session to "Gnome failsafe" and see if that works?
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	i have tried that, didn't. So i then tried failsafe terminal and thats where it is now
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	but has not detected wireless card
2009-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	if it already downloaded a bunch of files before power went out, "apt-get" can probably install them from local disk, automatically
2009-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	it keeps them in a cache before it installs them.
2009-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	what is the command?
2009-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	I'd try "apt-get install -f" first, to get apt to a clean state.
2009-05-11T09:49:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	i get - dpkg was interrupted. you must manually fun sudo dpkg -- configure -a to correct the problem.
2009-05-11T09:50:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	great
2009-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	thank you very much for your help :) its work now, only windows dont show borders. I had this problem before, its due to compiz. I should find a fix
2009-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	now that you have a working gui again, did you go back and finish up the release upgrade?  That might fix the problem.  Or...
2009-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	its doing that now
2009-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	today I just discovered the compiz-config-settings-manager, which lets you set all kinds of stuff about compiz effects
2009-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	yep. i have that.
2009-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	Guest92469	lyrae	maybe in there it has a setting for window borders...  Anyway, glad I could help you get back on track.
2009-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	lyrae	Guest92469	me too. thanks very much, again
