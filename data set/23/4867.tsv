2011-03-31T20:08:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	is SFTP faster?
2011-03-31T20:09:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	could be, basic difference is, that scp uses ssh for authentication and sftp has own mechanisms to authenticate (still using ssh)
2011-04-03T02:50:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	"rename"
2011-04-03T02:53:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	what are "special charectars"?
2011-04-03T02:53:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	anything outside a-z 1-9 and normal symbols
2011-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	do you know a program that can do this?
2011-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	"rename"
2011-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	what is the option to strip special charectars?
2011-04-03T02:56:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	It is not listed in the manual
2011-04-03T02:56:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	there is no option for that because it depends on YOUR definition of "special"
2011-04-03T02:57:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	so feed rename with a list of all those unwanted chars  and what you want it to substitute to
2011-04-03T02:57:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	I want to get rid of the charectars that my pc can't display. They're coming up as ? marks in terminal
2011-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	check your locales
2011-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	how do I know what the chars are if the comp can;'t display them. I need something tthat can strip these special chars
2011-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	^^
2011-04-03T03:30:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	that program didn't help. My computer isn't able to display much of anything. You said something about locales. Is there something I could configure there?
2011-04-03T03:33:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2011-04-03T03:35:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	I'm not on ubuntu sorry
2011-04-03T03:35:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	noone will help me in #gentoo
2011-04-03T03:36:00.000Z	eamon	llutz	here is the output of locale... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/364610/
2011-04-03T03:36:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	then reconfigure your locales in gentoo-manner (however that is, i never used it)
2011-04-03T03:37:00.000Z	llutz	eamon	UTF-8 should be right in most cases
