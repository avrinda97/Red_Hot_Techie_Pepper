2007-04-11T07:21:00.000Z	dyrne	sorcerer	you should'nt have to worry about that if youre installing nvidia-glx just install the packages.  follow this step by step https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2007-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	sorcerer	dyrne	 hey if my drivers mess up can i restore it like in windows
2007-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	dyrne	sorcerer	yes. this is very easy with the packages. little differenct if you used nvidia.sh installer.
2007-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	dyrne	sorcerer	basically if you lose your graphical desktop you can alt-ctrl-f2 then login then 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf'  look for the Driver   "nvidia" or nv line and change it to "vesa" which is a generic driver that is fine for 2d stuff. then either sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or just reboot the comp

2007-04-11T08:04:00.000Z	dyrne	sorcerer	if youre on wifi and signal is weak maybe.  try 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and remove the country prefix us. or whatever from all the urls. then save and exit and 'sudo apt-get update' but all that will kill your download
2007-04-11T08:05:00.000Z	sorcerer	dyrne	 hey man wait could i mesage yoiu privatly if you dont mind
