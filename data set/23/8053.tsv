2005-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	Warty or Hoary?
2005-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	CreeVal	trey3	Warty
2005-02-11T17:48:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	Hoary uses new Gnome defaults though... has Applications, Places, and Desktop now  :)
2005-02-11T17:50:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	depends how you define 'public'...
2005-02-11T17:50:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	there are install CD's etc for it...
2005-02-11T17:51:00.000Z	CreeVal	trey3	I mean like, it's not finished just yet?
2005-02-11T17:51:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	nope... but its stable   :/
2005-02-11T17:52:00.000Z	CreeVal	trey3	waiting till the Warty gets taken off the site then, and exchanged with hoary...
2005-02-11T17:53:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	would be kind a waste  :/
2005-02-11T06:04:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	why would that 'piss you off'?
2005-02-11T06:18:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	its not peticularly smart... but it works...
2005-02-11T06:19:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	should, yes...
2005-02-11T06:53:00.000Z	trey3	CreeVal	/msg, not dcc chat  ;)
