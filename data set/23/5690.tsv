2006-10-04T11:25:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Does anyone know a temporary fix to at least start X? Maybe by trying a generic driver?
2006-10-04T11:26:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Alright, ill try that and see what it says
2006-10-04T11:26:00.000Z	Evilpigster		:D
2006-10-04T11:27:00.000Z	Evilpigster		I tried "nv" typed "
2006-10-04T11:28:00.000Z	Evilpigster		should I reboot?
2006-10-04T11:28:00.000Z	Evilpigster		lol woah
2006-10-04T11:28:00.000Z	Evilpigster		I meant to say
2006-10-04T11:29:00.000Z	Evilpigster		I restarted gdm
2006-10-04T11:29:00.000Z	Evilpigster		err, X server
2006-10-04T11:30:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Yes and I got this error: EE - Failed to initialize GLX extension
2006-10-04T11:30:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	Evilpigster	Then try disabling gfl and possibly dri ext.
2006-10-04T11:30:00.000Z	vanhtu1987		I meant glx
2006-10-04T11:31:00.000Z	Evilpigster		heh
2006-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	Evilpigster	vanhtu1987	I already disabled dri and glcore
2006-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Not sure what gfl is
2006-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	Evilpigster	how about glx ?
2006-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Oh ok
2006-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Alright I will try that
2006-10-04T11:34:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Ok, well disabling GLX got rid of this error (EE - Failed to initialize GLX extension) but it still has the last error "no GLX visuals available"
2006-10-04T11:34:00.000Z	Evilpigster		I also installed XGL hoping that thats not a problem with it
2006-10-04T11:35:00.000Z	Evilpigster		Gahh! I got to start paying attention...
2006-10-04T11:36:00.000Z	Evilpigster		is there a way to remove beryl-manager from the start up?
2006-10-04T11:37:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	Evilpigster	does Ubuntu desktop uses 'xserver-xorg' (I'm not sure as I've no Ubuntu box here right now), if it does, try 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
