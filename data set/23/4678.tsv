2009-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	azlon		i created a live usb disk but when i restart it doesnt save my settings... its like a read only usb disk
2009-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	you've read the persistent install link?
2009-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	its loading now... thanks
2009-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	so if i read that page correctly, using Portable Linux or Live USB Creater will use tmpfs to store my /tmp in ram, which increases the lifespan of the drive... right?
2009-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	I have no idea, but it sounds good =)
2009-08-05T23:07:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	thanks. i am using the older laptop to play video files from another machine? is there a program that is less resource intensive than another? like vlc or something?
2009-08-05T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	I've actually never measured that.. not sure if vlc is "lighter" than any of the others..
2009-08-05T23:08:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	i will just do a little trial and error. thanks!
2009-08-05T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	good luck
2009-08-15T22:53:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	pico, nano, vi, emacs... lots of options
2009-09-27T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	I think df only shows the partitions you have mounted
2009-09-27T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	fdisk will show them.. or gparted.. or parted
2009-09-27T00:06:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	sounds like the drives got renumbered.. I actually thought ubuntu's use of uuids would prevent problems like this.. but I wouldn't say I'm surprised something like this happens
2009-09-27T00:07:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	how can i fix it?
2009-09-27T00:07:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	should i boot from cd with the HDDs connected, then list the HDDs to see which is which, then confirm grub says the right drive for boot?
2009-09-27T00:08:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	tougher question =)  I would start looking at reconfiguring the raid drives.. say you previously had /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 in a raid5 config.. your new drive became the new /dev/sda1 so you would have to change the raid to use /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdd1
2009-09-27T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	you might want to be careful about how you do this.. you don't want to reinitialize the raid volume ie erase everything and start again.. make sure you know what the commands you run actually do
2009-09-27T00:10:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	holy crap man... this sounds a lot like what happened... i think i remember my drives being labeled differently
2009-09-27T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	not really a big problem.. you just have to tell your system where the raid partitions are located now.. I'm not really sure how to do that though.. I've given up on raid5 myself =) http://www.baarf.com/
2010-04-29T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	there is something called nautilus actions.. that might be useful
2010-04-29T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	it's got a nice little gui if I remember correctly.. you can select if it should only show up on some files, all files, folders etc etc
2010-04-29T16:49:00.000Z	azlon	Slart	im trying to make an iso file from a ripped dvd. for some reason when i do mkisofs -o filename.iso -dvd-video /path/to/video_ts   it doesnt work... any suggestions?
2010-04-29T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	azlon	oh.. I've never messed with mkisofs like that.. I use devede or similar tools to create dvd's from avi movies and such
