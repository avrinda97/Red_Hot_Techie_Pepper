2005-01-15T16:28:00.000Z	neighborlee		hey peeps..are there any 'slice' apps for linux..ie: like image ready for PS or fireworks ????
2005-01-15T16:28:00.000Z	neighborlee		py-slice in gimp isn't working for me so :((....
2005-01-15T16:28:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	what's a 'slice' app?
2005-01-15T16:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	well it takes a image and slices it up into table format ..
2005-01-15T16:29:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	page layout with tables for images?
2005-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	you must be shitting me!
2005-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	who on earth does serious webdesign with tables? ... yea i know there are a lot.
2005-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	well some designs flat can not be done with just CSS
2005-01-15T16:31:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	unless I'm not using css right...shrug..i'm a bit rusty so...
2005-01-15T16:32:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	I just need to set my javascript code for mouseovers is all i'm really after but for that I must slice up this large image..can that be done with css ?
2005-01-15T16:33:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	mouseovers? you man an ImageMap?
2005-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	no ..I thought about using imagemap but not sure thats the way I want to go
2005-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	so you want to split up an image into 100 of pieces. buy that adding lots of server load and stuff?
2005-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	is that the standard way of doing things ?
2005-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	ha not 100's..maybe 20 or so....anyway so I can do this with css ???
2005-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	if you have 1 image . You open ONE stream. and get ONE header sent. if you slice it into 100 images you get 99 more open streams and 99 more headers
2005-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	slicing - no, position, yes.
2005-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	neofeed	neighborlee	but for those questions I'd rather you to go to #web
2005-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	well..its slightly more complicated than that
2005-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	sounds good
2005-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	thx
2005-01-15T16:38:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	I stumped all 150 users so far LOL
2005-01-15T16:38:00.000Z	neighborlee	neofeed	so  I guesss ill be using a imagemap possibly LOL
