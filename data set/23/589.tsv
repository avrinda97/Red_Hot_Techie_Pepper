2011-07-01T01:04:00.000Z	sudokill		no
2011-07-01T01:05:00.000Z	sudokill		hope it works
2011-07-01T01:06:00.000Z	sudokill		sometimes they default back to kernel ones
2011-07-01T01:08:00.000Z	sudokill		glxinfo || grep render
2011-07-01T01:08:00.000Z	sudokill		| i mean
2011-07-01T01:08:00.000Z	sudokill		otherwise it can be a bit confusing lol
2011-07-01T01:09:00.000Z	sudokill		i tried 11.04 upgrading from 10.10 with a 4870 and i had to redo graphics drivers
2011-07-01T01:09:00.000Z	sudokill		must be because of newer kernel
2011-07-01T01:09:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	thats not real uncommon w/ ATI devices
2011-07-01T04:05:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	i tried explaining that to him..
2011-07-01T04:05:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	so do i, unfortunately.. this is gonna be a very hard lesson for him.
2011-07-01T04:06:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	if he's serious about possibly getting them back, he needs to immediately turn that PC off, and stop dinking with it, and take it to someone who knwos what they are doing.
2011-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	they're apparently wedding and first born photos.
2011-07-02T03:27:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	i could never get used to KDE...
2011-07-02T03:29:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	yeah, and after i tried gnome 3, and i saw i'm gonna hate it... i switched to xfce.. (might as well embrace the change now)... but xfce, it was just buggy to me... ha strange lockups at times, etc.. that i never had w/ Gnome 2.x... Lxde, has been flawless
2011-07-04T20:09:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	ILoatheVista tracking down the packages one by one in the package manager to remove them, defeats the purpose of the package manager.. it's designed to do that automatically (I'm not sure why Ubuntu software center wouldn't to be truthful)
2011-07-04T20:10:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	if its not working, then he's doin something wrong.. thats what the package manager is designed to do.
2011-07-04T20:19:00.000Z	sudokill	KM0201	i like gimp, i just cant wait until they change to a single UI like photoshop
2011-07-04T20:19:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	the GUI is fine, i actually prefer it... GIMP is just as powerful as PS, it's just different, and it has a STEEP learning curve.
2011-07-04T20:21:00.000Z	sudokill	KM0201	theyre bringing single window in next verison i think, maybe even in the beta
2011-07-04T20:22:00.000Z	KM0201	sudokill	an unecessary change IMO.
