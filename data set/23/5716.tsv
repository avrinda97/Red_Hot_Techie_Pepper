2006-12-17T14:10:00.000Z	ReinH		Guys, are there any issues with dual booting a computer with two hard drives and using the first for windows and the second for Ubuntu?
2006-12-17T14:10:00.000Z	ReinH		I've never done it, so I'm wondering if there are any gotchas
2006-12-17T14:11:00.000Z	ReinH		or is it as easy as partitioningo one hard drive?
2006-12-17T14:11:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	you just "have" to install grub to the mbr of the harddrive that is set as boot device in bios...
2006-12-17T14:12:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	ok, so I install grub on the boot drive.
2006-12-17T14:12:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	if you dont use other methods (boot floppy). yes
2006-12-17T14:13:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	Ok, would I need a partition on that drive for it, then?
2006-12-17T14:13:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	mbr is allready on every hd, you dont need to create it, it just will be overwritten (the ms windows bootloader)
2006-12-17T14:14:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	oh, ok. I see what you mean now
2006-12-17T14:14:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	MBR = Master Boot Record, i think wikipedia has more info, if you want
2006-12-17T14:14:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	How would I typically specify where to install grub?
2006-12-17T14:15:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	for mbr, it ask on which hd
2006-12-17T14:15:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	ok, perfect
2006-12-17T14:16:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	btw, which ubuntu you install ? i remember "old" (dapper?) didnt give you that option thou... meaning the graphicalk installer
2006-12-17T14:16:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	I have a dapper CD I was going to use, but maybe I'll try the new (edgy?)
2006-12-17T14:17:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	what would you recommend?
2006-12-17T14:17:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	im not sure if dapper was "ok", hope someone knows here (i normally use the alternate old text based installer and it "allways" had that option)
2006-12-17T14:18:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	what version of Ubuntu would you prefer for a non critical (second development computer) install?
2006-12-17T14:19:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	dapper and edgy are stable, dapper just has longer support (and edgy more actual software)
2006-12-17T14:21:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	im pretty sure edgy has option (in graphical installer) to select which hd mbr to install
2006-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	no, the worst that can happen is that it install grub in hd2 mbr, and that is not set as boot hd in bios, so windows bootloader is started from hd1 (if that the boot hd in bios)
2006-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	ReinH	oskude	right, which would just mean it would boot into windows as normal, right?
2006-12-17T14:24:00.000Z	oskude	ReinH	yup
