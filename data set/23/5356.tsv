2006-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	oh, I missed some of the stuff you wrote cos you didn't add my name in front of it :)
2006-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	have you tried setting the OS for the application you want to something different?
2006-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	also try starting the application from the command line after FIRST climbing to the directory you want (this is required by 3 WINE progs I use regularly) - ask if you don't get what I mean :)

2006-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	it may be easier for you to use wengo, which runs natively ) and connects to lots of networks - perhaps the one you need
2006-12-17T10:28:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	no - wengo is a linux program that can do videomessaging like eyeball chat www.wengo.com
2006-12-17T10:30:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	I don't know - it works with many networks and open protocols
2006-12-17T10:32:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	also - perhaps try another windows web cam program to see if eyeball or wine is broken :)
2006-12-17T10:32:00.000Z	Who_	dellorino	good luck :)
