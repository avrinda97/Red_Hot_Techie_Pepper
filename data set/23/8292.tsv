2004-11-22T13:52:00.000Z	Rene_S		only time i had success with evol's junk filter is when i used it in conjuntion with spamassassin

2004-11-22T13:52:00.000Z	khronic	Rene_S	using evol 2.0?
2004-11-22T13:53:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	yeah.  I read someplace on the ubuntu forums that it worked and i found that to be true
2004-11-22T13:53:00.000Z	khronic	Rene_S	Is there configuration needed?  It seems to me it is supposed to work out of the box..however, its not the case for me
2004-11-22T13:54:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	I never did any.  I just made sure that the junk filter was on in evolution and i checked off the other option as well
2004-11-22T13:55:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	you can still train it as well
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	khronic	Rene_S	interesting...I have it turned on..and I have been Junking all my spam..but none is ever auto filtered into Junk
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	hmmm
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	 I know on hoary i cant make it do that anymore
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	 but on warty it worked fine
2004-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	khronic		Yeah, it's strange..
2004-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	Rene_S	khronic	 if all else fails thunderbird works ok if you train it
2004-11-22T13:58:00.000Z	khronic	Rene_S	Yeah I've been playing with thunderbird lately.  Looks decent enough
2004-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	khronic	Rene_S	Though the way firefox has been acting on my warty install..I'd be hesitant to use TB
