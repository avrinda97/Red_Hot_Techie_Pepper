2008-01-09T08:56:00.000Z	Fireal		Man the forums have become clustered over the years!  Anyways, anyone know a good place to go for this issue? My DVD-burner burned DVD-R's in other OS's, but it keeps prompting me to insert a blanck dvd (which I did) in gutsy no matter what program I use to burn a data-DVD

2008-01-09T08:57:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	this may sound stupid but are you sure you have a blank dvd in the drive? I got real embarrassed once.
2008-01-09T08:58:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	 yep gone through about half a stack (saw that on the forums too!)
2008-01-09T08:59:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Another question I have to ask, have you googled your brands compatibility with linux? shouldn't be an issue but they DO exist for some things.
2008-01-09T09:01:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	Yes sir, but all that comes up are some lightscribe issues; btw I have an LG GSM-H42L internal burner
2008-01-09T09:04:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Has ubuntu recognized the device? Go System->Preferences->Hardware Information
2008-01-09T09:05:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	I don't have a DVD burner on this comp, but my corresponding line reads CDRW/DVD TSL462c should look sorta like that
2008-01-09T09:06:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	 well I am having trouble finding it, got a buzz word to look for?  I have played cd's and dvd's on it however and it does mount the blank disc
2008-01-09T09:07:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	I'm a little slow, I'll look again
2008-01-09T09:07:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Look for DVDRW
2008-01-09T09:09:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	found it finally, it's there but under scsi device
2008-01-09T09:09:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	you can use ctrl+f to use the find feature
2008-01-09T09:09:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	sweet
2008-01-09T09:11:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Sorry - forgot that *might* be helpful. lol. Anyways click on it and make sure that its recognizing that storage.cdrom.dvdr and/or storage.cdrom.dvdrw are true (if you don't have re-write, that one will be false).
2008-01-09T09:13:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	storage.cdrom.dvdr, dvdrw, & dvdram all "true"
2008-01-09T09:14:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Ok thats good, now check storage.removable.media_available
2008-01-09T09:18:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	sorry, my best guess that that somehow your media wasn't being detected correctly. I really don't know how to proceed from here.
2008-01-09T09:20:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	hey thanks anyways
2008-01-09T09:20:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	if you figure it out post your solution to the forums - this ones kinda funny. it also may be fixed by a clean install.
2008-01-09T09:20:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	 I was thinking that but refusing to believe it :(
2008-01-09T09:21:00.000Z	pck	Fireal	Updating my fiesty caused a few wierd networking problems with no solution that magically (or not so) went away with a clean gutsy install
2008-01-09T09:22:00.000Z	Fireal	pck	on a clean install, this is a bummer
