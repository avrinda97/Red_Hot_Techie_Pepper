2010-08-19T21:17:00.000Z	m15k		does anyone run a local webserver?
2010-08-19T21:17:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	yes
2010-08-19T21:19:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	uazure may you confirm a possible bug: what happens when you start your local webserver and disconnect your internet connection. It is still possible to connect to your webserver?
2010-08-19T21:19:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	yes it is...
2010-08-19T21:19:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	did you install apache2?
2010-08-19T21:20:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	which server did you install and how?
2010-08-19T21:21:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	is there any particular reason on why you are using glassfish?
2010-08-19T21:21:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	have you tried tomcat?
2010-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	and gf is well integrated in my ide
2010-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	what is "h2 web interface"??
2010-08-19T21:23:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	h2 is a database
2010-08-19T21:23:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	and you cant run you database natively on an SQL server?
2010-08-19T21:24:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	or on another RDBMS
2010-08-19T21:24:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	this is for developing purpose
2010-08-19T21:25:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	you should probably ask gf people about this problem then
2010-08-19T21:26:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	its strange cause h2 interface is standalone and not does not contact with gf
2010-08-19T21:27:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	are you using sun-java6-jre/jdk?
2010-08-19T21:28:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	1.6.0.20-b02
2010-08-19T21:28:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	thinking of an jre bug?
2010-08-19T21:29:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	well the opensource java has always given me problems with eclipse and tomcat
2010-08-19T21:33:00.000Z	DrPoO	m15k	sometimes you must rely on "magic"... :p
2010-08-19T22:05:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	also tried with tomcat
2010-08-19T22:05:00.000Z	m15k	DrPoO	same result
