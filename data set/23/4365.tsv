2008-05-14T07:43:00.000Z	degrit		I have a mouse with 5 buttons + wheel (the wheel is the middle button too), but only 2 buttons + wheel as wheel are working and there's no relevant options in Preferences - any clues ?
2008-05-14T07:44:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven	degrit	what mouse is it? my 5 button is working fine
2008-05-14T07:45:00.000Z	degrit		Logitech MX310
2008-05-14T07:45:00.000Z	degrit		actually it has an additional button on the top which in windows operates like alt+tab
2008-05-14T07:45:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven	degrit	lol thats the mouse i have, weird that its not working
2008-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	degrit		I am using feisty if that helps
2008-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		that extra button pisses me off, i hit it while switching sensitivity and it dumps me out of games, i dont know though, cause mine is working
2008-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	degrit		no I mean gutsy
2008-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		wait, do you have 7.10 or 8.04?
2008-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	degrit		7.10 is gutsy right ? how do I make sure ?
2008-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		gusty is 7.10, yea the buttons dont work in 7.10, they work in 8.04 though
2008-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	degrit		yup it's 7.10 all right
2008-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	degrit		I remember I'd managed to make it work in 7.04 though P:
2008-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		yea, sorry about that, it didnt work for me in 7.10, but they work in 8.04
2008-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	degrit		is there any cons in pressing that "Update Release" button in my update manager ?
2008-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		baatii which vm are you using?
2008-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	degrit		I mean, does any app stop working or something like that usually
2008-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		baatii: what speed did you burn it at?
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	degrit		:)
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		it could be broken then
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		try reburning at 4x
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		ok guys i feel stupid, where did the partition editor run off to, its not in system-admin anymore
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	degrit	Wolvenhaven	so in 8.04 that mouse just works, no workarounds needed ?
