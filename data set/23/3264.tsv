2009-05-13T22:11:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	have you tried removing the flash9 plug in?
2009-05-13T22:12:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	i dont know how
2009-05-13T22:12:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	first try through the plugin interface / the interface that chooses what applications handle what content.
2009-05-13T22:13:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	yes i only see flash 9 not 10
2009-05-13T22:15:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	so I would try disabling it, then restarting firefox. You could also look around .profile and the install dir to manually remove flash9 first.
2009-05-13T22:17:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	where is .profile ?
2009-05-13T22:17:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	sorry; its now .mozilla
2009-05-13T22:19:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	also /usr/lib/firefox  and /usr/lib/mozilla
2009-05-13T22:19:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	you can also make sure that flash10 is properly installed in them (in the plugins dir)
2009-05-13T22:21:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	i found flashplugin-alternative.so in plugins/
2009-05-13T22:22:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	that should be it.  How did you install flash10?  far the tar.gz,  .deb or what?
2009-05-13T22:22:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	 .deb
2009-05-13T22:23:00.000Z	jdu	yaris123456789	you might try the tar.gz   it provides an install script, but you don't have to use it; you can copy the .so file included to the plugins dir and replace whatever is there.
2009-05-13T22:24:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jdu	 okay
