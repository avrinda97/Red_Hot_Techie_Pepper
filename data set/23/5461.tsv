2007-03-11T11:33:00.000Z	daya		what is the differrence bet. linux and Unix
2007-03-11T11:34:00.000Z	eck	daya	basically just who wrote the code
2007-03-11T11:34:00.000Z	eck	daya	for most purposes they are the same, but regular unix tends to be more broken
2007-03-11T11:35:00.000Z	daya	eck	I so far knew that unix is not free am I right?
2007-03-11T11:36:00.000Z	eck	daya	it depends on the implementation, but generally it is not compatible with the gpl
2007-03-11T11:36:00.000Z	eck	daya	often though you buy a contract for the source code with a proprietary unix implementation
2007-03-11T11:36:00.000Z	daya	eck	is FreeBSD is totally UNIX?
2007-03-11T11:37:00.000Z	eck	daya	it sort of depends. it has no at&t code in it, but it is directly derviced from unix
2007-03-11T11:37:00.000Z	eck		derived even
2007-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	daya	eck	is there are any flavours of unix as linux ?
2007-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	eck	daya	a lot of people call bsd unix though
2007-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	eck	daya	i don't understand your question
2007-03-11T11:39:00.000Z	daya	eck	I mean different version of unix?
2007-03-11T11:39:00.000Z	daya	eck	as different distros of linux?
2007-03-11T11:39:00.000Z	eck	daya	there are a _lot_ of them
2007-03-11T11:39:00.000Z	daya	eck	is unix is one?
2007-03-11T11:40:00.000Z	daya	eck	eg.
2007-03-11T11:40:00.000Z	eck	daya	there is no such thing as just 'unix'. originally at&t developed it, and they sold the code to many other companies, each of these companies then developed it independently and sold their own slightly incompatible versions of 'unix'
2007-03-11T11:42:00.000Z	daya	eck	thanks a lot !
2007-03-11T11:43:00.000Z	eck	daya	no problem -- if you are interested, wikipedia has a lot more information about the history of unix
2007-03-11T11:43:00.000Z	daya	eck	ok
2007-03-11T11:43:00.000Z	daya	eck	where are you from?, I am from Nepal
2007-03-11T11:44:00.000Z	eck	daya	america
