2010-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	raziel		Is there a way I can have empathy remember my account name but not my password?
2010-10-31T08:53:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	wouldn't you simply clear your password from your account?
2010-10-31T08:56:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	Are you using Ubuntu 10.10 ?
2010-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	On th top right, click on the little envelope icon.  Then click contacts, so your contacts window appears.
2010-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	then click Edit in the menu bar, and select Accounts.
2010-10-31T08:58:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	Are you using evolution or empathy?
2010-10-31T08:59:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	my icon may be different from yours.  In any case, there is a little icon next to the password.  That is supposed to clear the password.
2010-10-31T09:01:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	You should simply be able to click the "Close" button, and your changes are saved.  Is the close button not active?
2010-10-31T09:01:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	I also have an "Apply" button.  This is active if I clear my password.
2010-10-31T09:02:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	as soon as I clear my password, the "Cancel" and "Apply" buttons become active in my "Messaging and VoIP Accounts" dialo.
2010-10-31T09:03:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	diaog = dialog
2010-10-31T09:04:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	when you chose continue, what happens?
2010-10-31T09:04:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	try ignore.
2010-10-31T09:05:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	:(
2010-10-31T09:08:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	ha ha, I tried it, and I just got completely disconnected !  For some reason, it did not give me the option to cancel or ignore.
2010-10-31T09:10:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	One more thing you can try is... System | Preferences | Passwords and Encryption Keys
2010-10-31T09:11:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	(yes, it looks like it had worked for me; I had to re-enter my password on the Administration screen, however, to reconnect.  Empathy did not prompt me for a password).
2010-10-31T09:12:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	I register to googletalk.
2010-10-31T09:16:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	did you try System | Preferences | Passwords and Encryption Key
2010-10-31T09:17:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	there is a "Passwords" tab.  In my setup, I see my google account listed.  I wonder if you can simply delete your jabber entry?
2010-10-31T09:19:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	I would guess that removes your password.  May be you need to restart your Empathy to pick-up that change?
2010-10-31T09:21:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	I noticed one more thing.  I was able to double-click on my google talk password, and I got a dialog that lets me change or erase the password.
2010-10-31T09:25:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	raziel	Great! What was the fix?
