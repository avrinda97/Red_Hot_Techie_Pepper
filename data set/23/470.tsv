2011-09-25T07:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	you have some grub files in sda6 did you have a install there or have youtried some fixes?
2011-09-25T08:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	so sda3 is whch /home or /boot and sda6 is what grub is competeing, it looks like a seperate home setup?
2011-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	you fstab shows sda3 as the boot partition.
2011-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	well not exactly boot but /
2011-09-25T08:11:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	urlin2u	what do you mean fstab?
2011-09-25T08:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	if you look art the boot script towards the bottom you will see this  sda3/etc/fstab, if your not familiar it ereally doesn't matter the question is which of the two partitions sda3 and sda6, did you make / and home or did you .
2011-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	iqbalkhan	I would follow escott that is where I was headed.
