2007-03-24T07:44:00.000Z	quaal_mac		is there any way to get to grub.lst when you boot up and get /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
2007-03-24T07:44:00.000Z	quaal_mac		other than a livecd ?
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	quaal_mac		other than using a livecd, is there any way to get to grub.lst when you boot up and get /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	um dunno, are you implying you're trying to fix the 'job control' problem?  if so how?
2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	yes, i am implying that. i believe it is a problem with grub trying to mount the wrong partition.
2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	but i have no access to /boot when it starts with this no job control nonsense
2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	i would say it's a much deeper problem as it has stumped many a perosn here and nobody knows how to fix it.  i just wondered as we are desperate for solutions on the job control tty thing.  doesn't it open up a mini shell at that stage?
2007-03-24T07:53:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	yea. something like that
2007-03-24T07:53:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	its some initramfs shell
2007-03-24T07:53:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	busybox?
2007-03-24T07:54:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	it was just booting fine yesterday, i'm pretty certain it has to do with grub
2007-03-24T07:54:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	ahh ok.  well i think it's in some single user mode,  did you try mounting partitions?
2007-03-24T07:54:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	ctrl-alt-F1 gives me mount: mounting /dev/hdc1 on /root failed: invalid argument
2007-03-24T07:54:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	what about by specifiying fs type?  it might be more picky in that mode
2007-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	is there any way to access /boot/grub/grub.lst from initramfs
2007-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	umm no im afraid now
2007-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	afraid not **
2007-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	i dont know, if mount doesnt work then no there isn't a way.  unless 'grub' works in which case you could if there is some text editro in grub.
2007-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	why dont you modify the gurb cmd line on bootup?
2007-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	how do i do that
2007-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	quaal_mac	xtknight	by the way yes it says busybox v1.1.3 built-in shell
2007-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	bahh i dont know, i dont think grub has a text editor i was just letting my mind run wild there
2007-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	quaal_mac	well with busybox you should be able to mount stuff.  if it has your HD controller modules loaded and stuff
