2009-03-17T19:59:00.000Z	keepsake	Guest86868	Oh, are you trying to play a windows game? (n I presume?)
2009-03-17T20:00:00.000Z	Guest86868	keepsake	yes exaxtly, but i went on a website and downloaded the version for linux
2009-03-17T20:02:00.000Z	keepsake	Guest86868	Try downloading the Windows version and run it with Wine.
2009-03-17T20:02:00.000Z	Guest86868	keepsake	okay i try that :)
2009-03-17T20:05:00.000Z	keepsake	Guest86868	Using Wine to load the Windows version works for me.
2009-03-17T20:05:00.000Z	Guest86868	keepsake	okay im downloading it now, so i cant wait to see if it works, its a really fun game :D
2009-03-17T20:08:00.000Z	Guest86868	keepsake	okay i got the windows version now, but it lags a bit :/
2009-03-17T20:09:00.000Z	keepsake	Guest86868	It does, but I think it's still playable =\
2009-03-17T20:09:00.000Z	Guest86868	keepsake	yes indeed, but is it like this with every windows products if you use Wine loader ?
2009-03-17T20:10:00.000Z	keepsake	Guest86868	No, most Windows programs don't have frameskip problems.
