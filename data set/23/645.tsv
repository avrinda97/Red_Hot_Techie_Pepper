2011-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	Macer		where do i set default permissions for files and directories? /etc/profile or /etc/.profile?
2011-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	Macer		or is there something a little more universal?
2011-04-27T08:57:00.000Z	Macer		and i have to manually change them
2011-04-27T08:58:00.000Z	Macer		haha
2011-04-27T08:58:00.000Z	Macer		well.. umask has a setting for the files but not the directories
2011-04-27T08:58:00.000Z	Macer		unless that 1 number controls both
2011-04-27T08:58:00.000Z	Macer		let me see if i can find something... but thanks

2011-04-27T08:59:00.000Z	Macer	Agentkiller4	thanks so much heh
2011-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	annother dirty solution would be to actually change the mount parameters
2011-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	so the drive is mounted with RWX
2011-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	Macer	Agentkiller4	haha.. that's ok. i would rather just change the umask settings for the linux boxes and smb.conf
2011-04-27T09:03:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	yeah, i use a second partition for everything inside private folders so i can force global file permissions
2011-04-27T09:03:00.000Z	Macer	Agentkiller4	can you change the umask per dir?
2011-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	i do not think so, i actually mount everything as seperate partitions and have per directory permissions
2011-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	it should affect all inside
2011-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	Macer	Agentkiller4	hm. ok. i will take a look... i have to figure this one out it is driving me nuts ;) thanks for the help
2011-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	is it all on root partition or separated?
2011-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Macer	Agentkiller4	both ;)
2011-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	hmm, because i use nls=iso8859-1,users,umask=000,posix=1,user,uid=user
2011-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	to mount my executable folder
2011-04-27T09:09:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	but if you mount everything seperately and configure its mount options, so that its broken into nice sections
2011-04-27T09:10:00.000Z	Agentkiller4	Macer	look up pydsm, very nice application for managing mountpoints and you can use it to make sure all your folders are mounted with right permissions/umask
