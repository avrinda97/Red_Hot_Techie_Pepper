2005-12-26T08:36:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	If you want to enable the root accoundxt do this;
2005-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	That means you will enter a root shell. A shell is what passes commands to the kernel.
2005-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	If you enter a root shell you have complete control over the machine.
2005-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	If you make a mistake and enter a command that erases your hard disk then all of your data is gone forever.
2005-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Why do you want to be root?
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	yep, there it is!
2005-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	First of all, you create the password right then, second, I doubt this will help you.
2005-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	How will being root help you connect to the internet?
2005-12-26T08:55:00.000Z	darker-shadow	gnube	run as root allow me run and installed the script that allow the ubuntu to connect to the internet. with my user he can't write in some areas
2005-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Your user can write if you do the command "sudo" before the writing.
2005-12-26T08:57:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Like this: # sudo mkdir /HOME/directory
2005-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	What do you mean?
2005-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Yes, that is right, not every user can write to every location.
2005-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	But when they are in a directory that they cannot write to, they can use "sudo" and then they can write there.
2005-12-26T09:01:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Do this instead: sudo ./install ******
2005-12-26T09:02:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	You can write EVERYWHERE with sudo.
2005-12-26T09:03:00.000Z	gnube	darker-shadow	Good luck.
