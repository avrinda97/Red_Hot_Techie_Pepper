2005-12-01T17:14:00.000Z	navarone		gnome are you using cli irc client?
2005-12-01T17:15:00.000Z	navarone		gnome> yes...i don't have it
2005-12-01T17:15:00.000Z	navarone		gnome> I'm on 2.4.4...but it never disappeared before
2005-12-01T17:16:00.000Z	navarone		gnome> yes...the one you can right click names
2005-12-01T17:16:00.000Z	navarone		how?
2005-12-01T17:17:00.000Z	navarone		gnome> window is maxxed
2005-12-01T17:18:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	grap the scratchy looking thing on the right side with your mouse, and pull it to the left
2005-12-01T17:19:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	you can resize the userlist pane till it disappears; you can bring it back by pulling on the vertical bar, and the horizontal lines in the center on the right is a visual aid
2005-12-08T14:07:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	you can edit that by right clicking an appropriate file (say mp3), selecting properties, and using the open with tab.
2005-12-08T14:09:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	If I read that right, you would right click a text file, and remove jive from the properties dialog
2005-12-08T14:10:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	so, right click a text file, select properties a the bottom. You'll see a tab called Open with on the properties window; select that, and remove jive.
2005-12-08T14:10:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	:)
2005-12-08T14:30:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	I'm not sure
2005-12-08T14:33:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	it's in multiverse
2006-01-05T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	if I remember rightly, that's for the animations of the panel itself. Window ani's are controlled by metacity
2006-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	with a deep grey mist obscuring the distance :)
2006-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	navarone	nickrud	sometimes interrupted by a blue screen
2006-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	I haven't seen one of those in years, except for screensavers
2006-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	navarone	nickrud	really?
2006-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	really :)
2006-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	navarone	nickrud	I think that is a major convenience
2006-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	navarone	xorg is just the forked xfree86, after all.
