2007-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	dresden		ok let me look at it again

2007-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	dresden		ok thanks how do i get the 3G driver?? i dont see a link on that page
2007-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	sudo apt-get install ntfs-config && sudo ntfs-config
2007-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	The page ubotu linked you to is fine.
2007-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Follow the instructions under "Installing NTFS 3G Driver"
2007-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Well, run ntfs-config then, as per the page
2007-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	So? That means you already have the necessary driver.
2007-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Nah, you need to enable it.
2007-08-10T07:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	No. Just follow the page ubotu linked you to.
2007-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Meh, it should work without remounting.
2007-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	ntfs-config remounts automatically, I think
2007-08-10T07:38:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Did you properly use ntfs-config, on the correct device, enabling write support, yeah?
2007-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Did you select the correct device?
2007-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	dresden	Stormx2	the tool simply has a checkbox, i dont know how to select a device
2007-08-10T07:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Ah yeah...
2007-08-10T07:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Enable write support for both Internal and External devices, just in case ubuntu is seeing your device as internal
2007-08-10T07:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Ah. Okay, are you sure you don't have permission? Go into the drive and try to rename a file.
2007-08-10T07:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	uhg. I hate to recommend it, but maybe you could try rebooting?
2007-08-10T07:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	dresden	Yeah.
