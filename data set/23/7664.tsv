2005-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	Madpilot		Clearlooks in included in Ubuntu by default, I'm pretty sure
2005-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	Madpilot		I'm using it on my desktop right now
2005-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	it's the old one with squared curves on the bottom though
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	the one in Hoary has the squared bottoms.
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	the new engine has curved bottoms.
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	occy	the one I'm using right now has curves on all four corners
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	really?
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	how'd you get it?
2005-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	do you have backports or something like that in your sources.list ?
2005-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	occy	no backports, just extras. I'm pretty sure it's from the default install, but perhaps I updated it from gnome-looks.
2005-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	naw, I know for certain it's not the default.
2005-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	hmmm I tried getting it and installing it... but the engine isn't up-to-date.
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	you must have compiled the engine
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	which I don't know how to do. :)
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	occy	no compiling here, but I do have four round corners!
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	grrr!!!
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	;)
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	I'll try gnome-look.org
2005-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	got it ;)
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	clearlooks-balloon
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	thanks
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	occy	nope, my Clearlooks has four round in all settings. not sure how I got them, but they're cool!
2005-08-10T07:36:00.000Z	occy	Madpilot	Yeah, I'm good to go...
