2010-07-23T11:16:00.000Z	JViz		Does anyone know where I can get the old 64bit flash player?
2010-07-23T11:18:00.000Z	JViz		I tried googling, I didn't find anything I'd call reputable
2010-07-23T11:19:00.000Z	JViz		i used a script i found on the intarwebs a couple of weeks ago and it worked great, it seems the download is gone now though
2010-07-23T11:21:00.000Z	JViz		two or three weeks ago it worked awesome
2010-07-23T11:22:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1329654
2010-07-23T11:23:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	same thing, no more tarball on the dl site
2010-07-23T11:24:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	just d/l the regular tarbal from adobe
2010-07-23T11:25:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/   just select the tarbal
2010-07-23T11:25:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	doing so, but i don't think this is the 64bit version
2010-07-23T11:25:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	read the post... says there's no more 64 bit, but that makes it work
2010-07-23T11:31:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	done, followed the instructions, it's exactly the same as it was before
2010-07-23T11:31:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	youtube buttons don't work and general flakiness
2010-07-23T11:32:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	no idea, some other ppl tried it and said it worked, I cant tell i'm on 32 bit
2010-07-23T11:33:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	it sort of works, i  can still see ads, i can watch youtube videos as long as they autoplay, i just can't interact with anything
2010-07-23T11:34:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	that's why i was looking for the 64bit version still
2010-07-23T11:34:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	unless someone figures out how to make the 32bit version interactive on 64bit systems
2010-07-23T11:35:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	doubt it'll work but looks like here's a 64 bit for 9.04 http://nxadm.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/install-64-bit-adobe-flash-player-on-ubuntu-904/
2010-07-23T11:37:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	 and here's another option http://blog.mattrudge.net/2010/05/07/installing-flash-player-from-repository-on-ubuntu-10-04-64-bit/
2010-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	that last link did it! thank you!
2010-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	JViz	MaRk-I	thank you for finding that!
2010-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	JViz		it works like a charm
2010-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	yw
2010-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	MaRk-I	JViz	which one worked the one with the sh script?
