2005-04-09T14:54:00.000Z	nexus-		has anyone used Helix DNA server before?
2005-04-09T14:54:00.000Z	nexus-		i can't seem to get the http serv to work
2005-04-09T14:55:00.000Z	nexus-		it returns a "Not Found" no matter how i try to access it
2005-04-09T14:57:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	I have set it up ones
2005-04-09T14:57:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	once even
2005-04-09T14:57:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	don't remember the exact install though
2005-04-09T14:59:00.000Z	scizzo		the first user added is the one having the sudo rights...
2005-04-09T14:59:00.000Z	scizzo		or something like that
2005-04-09T15:00:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	did you administer it using the web interface?
2005-04-09T15:00:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	i can't seem to find it.
2005-04-09T15:01:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	I did it all from commandline
2005-04-09T15:01:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	I don't trust webinterfaces... :)
2005-04-09T15:01:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	there should be a good description of how to install it in the package I guess
2005-04-09T15:02:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	i'm still looking for it
2005-04-09T15:02:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	how do you admin it from cli anyway
2005-04-09T15:05:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	the install and such should give you the ports and stuff listed...also it should tell you where to put the real stuff for playing
2005-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	I think the install was rather straight forward...but it was a long time ago I installed it
2005-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	do you need realplayer to access the services on the ports? when i point my browser at the ports it just says Not Found.
2005-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	nexus-		I wonder if there is a special client
2005-04-09T15:09:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	ummm..you need a player yes
2005-04-09T16:43:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	you there?
2005-04-09T16:48:00.000Z	scizzo	nexus-	now I am
2005-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	nexus-	scizzo	oh yeah do you remember how to operate the server through the cli?
