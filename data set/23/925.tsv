2011-01-19T05:09:00.000Z	bencahill_		hi guys, I can't open xchat back up, any help?
2011-01-19T05:10:00.000Z	bencahill_		or how to resume a sleeping process?
2011-01-19T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	how did you put it to sleep?
2011-01-19T05:11:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	well, it all started with those pills...
2011-01-19T05:12:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	I have xchat set to display an icon in the top bar (notification area, whatever), and when I close the window, it is still open, and I click on the icon to show the window...
2011-01-19T05:13:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	...well, I restarted the panels (killall gnome-panel) and there wasn't any icon up there, and i closed it :(
2011-01-19T05:13:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	it's still running, though
2011-01-19T05:13:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	that's why I'm in here twice, I don't want to kill it :D
2011-01-19T05:14:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	brb, restroom
2011-01-19T05:17:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	back, any ideas how to show the window?
2011-01-19T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	you could try xchat -e 'url or command here' (maybe after closing this instance of xchat), otherwise I don't know
2011-01-19T05:18:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	thanks, I'll try that, cya
2011-01-19T05:21:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	nope, didn't work, but it's till logging, because I see the posts after I quit last in the scrollback ^^
2011-01-19T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	try the GUI commands here (with xchat -e without having this one open) http://toxin.jottit.com/xchat_help_commands  You could try iconifying it again.  Or "show".  Other thing you could do is try wmctrl.
2011-01-19T05:25:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	thanks, that will probably work, cya again :D
2011-01-19T05:31:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	none of the above worked :(
2011-01-19T05:32:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	wmctrl -p -l doesn't list it, because (I assume) it's not a window
2011-01-19T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	hmm, I thought "gui show" would have worked
2011-01-19T05:32:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	yeah, me too, it opened a new xchat window, as did gui iconify
2011-01-19T05:32:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	and no other xchat processes were running at the time
2011-01-19T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	don't know then, try #xchat maybe
2011-01-19T05:33:00.000Z	bencahill_	jrib	trying...
2011-01-19T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	bencahill_	could try interacting with it through dbus too (example: http://blog.woofbit.com/2010/10/11/xchat-command-line-remote-control/)
