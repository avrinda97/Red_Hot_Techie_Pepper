2009-08-13T09:15:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	doesn't work. Doesn't throw any errors, but when I test it I get no sound.
2009-08-13T09:18:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	ok run aplay -l in a terminal see if it found your card and are you on 9.04 or something else? i had 9.04 and could not get it to work along with other problems went back to 8.10
2009-08-13T09:19:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	shows both analog and digital for it. I'm running 9.04
2009-08-13T09:22:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	ok lets see if it works do you have mplayer installed?
2009-08-13T09:23:00.000Z	tehdot		yes
2009-08-13T09:23:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	yes
2009-08-13T09:27:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	open mplayer go to preferences and audio tab choose alsa then configure driver change device to hw=1.3 or what aply -l shows for your card then try to play a file
2009-08-13T09:30:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	in aplay, it shows them both as card 0, subdevice 0
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	if you do not show a hdmi card it is not getting loaded can you pastebin the output of aplay -l please?
2009-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	http://pastebin.com/d8157d78
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	ok you do not have the hdmi card loaded you  have to install the nvidia drivers from their website the new drivers have the hdmi audio
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	ah, ok
2009-08-13T09:42:00.000Z	tehdot	ctmjr	thanks for the help
2009-08-13T09:44:00.000Z	ctmjr	tehdot	your welcome good luck the install direction from nvidia are very good the driver comes with an installer
