2006-01-04T11:05:00.000Z	eobanb	uberleet	the chances of you getting your usb adsl modem to work with ubuntu is slim to none.  my guess would be none.  usb was never for networking, ethernet is, so i dont mean to be rude, but i dont know how it would kill you to just go and buy an ethernet cable for $5
