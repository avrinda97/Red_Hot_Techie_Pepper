2007-11-19T08:59:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	DO you have a CD in it?
2007-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	Is it data or music or?
2007-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	What kind of CD is it?
2007-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	You can not mount a music CD.
2007-11-19T09:01:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	Music CD's do not have the same sort of filesystem that data CD's have. You don't mount music CD's, you "play" music CDs

2007-11-19T09:02:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	sd card?  What is that?

2007-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	Ubuntu 7.10
2007-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	What version?  ...You probably need to update your system.
2007-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	YOu can more than likely mount it manually.
2007-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/floppy
2007-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	ls /mnt/floppy
2007-11-19T09:06:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	If it is not sda1 you will need to check  to see what it is:  sudo fdisk -l /dev/sd*
2007-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	And once it is mounted, you can take your browser to /mnt/floppy
2007-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	But, you will need to close the browser or file manager and manually un-mount it when you are done.
2007-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	umount /dev/sda1
2007-11-19T09:11:00.000Z	usr13	Poz	sudo su -
