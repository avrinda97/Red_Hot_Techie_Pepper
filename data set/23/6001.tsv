2008-01-05T01:53:00.000Z	racarter		my linux desktop suddenly got very slow
2008-01-05T01:53:00.000Z	racarter		i dont really get why
2008-01-05T01:53:00.000Z	racarter		im not doing anything special and the System Monitor gui tool doesn't show a lot happening either
2008-01-05T01:54:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	is your drive thrashing around?
2008-01-05T01:55:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	by very slow, what do you mean in particular?
2008-01-05T01:56:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	ohh, compiz issues probably. Try   alt-f2 metacity --replace  (you can revert with compiz --replace)  and see if it's still slow
2008-01-05T01:57:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	then you need to figure out if you lost 3d accel or something else is wrong with compiz
2008-01-05T01:59:00.000Z	racarter	nickrud	after i switched back to compiz everything seems to be working now
2008-03-09T01:38:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	no nuser (the actual user) at the end :)
2008-03-09T01:41:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	I think  passwd -f <name> does it
2008-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	probably not, I just now saw anything from you :)
2008-12-27T11:05:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	the command is in the smbfs package
2008-12-27T11:05:00.000Z	racarter	nickrud	what is the command to mount an smb drive now?
2008-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	try using the ip address
2008-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	I don't use smb from linux here, I'm no expert
2008-12-27T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	I'm no expert, like I said. I use the places->network in gnome whenever I hook up my laptop to the office net ;)
2008-12-27T11:09:00.000Z	racarter	nickrud	is there a way to force gnome to request a password or something?
2008-12-27T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	not that I know of. Our storage device doesn't require one, I set it up that way. I'm brain dead, and my co workers even more so
2009-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	Flannel dreams truth about linux. That's how he knows all this stuff ;)
2009-02-02T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	a little, yes
2009-02-02T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	shared as in how shared? samba? Never tried that myself
2009-02-02T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	sure do, but I guess the people here at the moment aren't using samba for sharing music files.
2009-02-02T09:48:00.000Z	nickrud	racarter	ah, which one? My nano 3d gen works great with banshee
