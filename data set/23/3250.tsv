2008-06-13T06:47:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	is it unlocked? Can't click unlock still?
2008-06-13T06:47:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	correct, can not unlock, and can not change any settings
2008-06-13T06:48:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	I would try one of two things: reboot into recovery (single user mode) set your wireless settings there, or post to the forums.
2008-06-13T06:48:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	Thank you, I have been following some forum posts, I think someone tried something with policy kit.  Ill look some more, but thanks for taking the time.
2008-06-13T06:49:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	I wish I knew what to do, but unfortuneatly you get higher visiability in the forums,
2008-06-13T06:49:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	something about NX and remote connections is wonky.
2008-06-13T06:49:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	have you thought about a clean re-install?
2008-06-13T06:49:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	No, others with clean install have same problem.
2008-06-13T06:50:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	did you file  a bug report with launchpad?
2008-06-13T06:51:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	Um, no, still kind of new,  box is mostly file server and only messed with it enough to break it :) still learning but its fun.
2008-06-13T06:51:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	I would consider doing a clean install see what happens.  Do you have a /home partition/
2008-06-13T06:52:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	neurobuntu	I think so, but I am going to wait for a bit and keep trolling the forum... not quite ready to reinstall.
2008-06-13T06:53:00.000Z	neurobuntu	Whatsinaname	I would recommened backing up the /home partition and then reformatting it incase the problem is on your home partition
