2009-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	Bobblybook		need help creating a script to run at startup, a bit lost..
2009-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 what its supposed to do exactly?
2009-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 the /etc/rc.local file can do that easially enough
2009-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 but modules can be loaded automatically from a differnt method/file also.
2009-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	I'll take a look at that file
2009-02-08T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 then theres /etc/rc.local to auto-run stuff No sudo needed
2009-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	OK, in rc.local: "In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution bits." Is it enabled by default, or do I need to change something?
2009-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 its enabled by default..
2009-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	ok one thing before I reboot and test it out: how would I call another script file from within rc.local? (It's a wpa_supplicant script, if that matters.)
2009-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 sh whatever.script   or '/path/to/whatever/script &'   note the &
2009-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 you may want ' sh whatever.script &   '
2009-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	so if my script is in /Documents/wifi/scriptname, it would look like:         sh /Documents/wifi/scriptname &
2009-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 you SURE thtas the right path?  why sould you have a /DOcuments directory?  sure you dont mean /home/username/Documents/whatever ?
2009-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	yes that's what I mean. Wasn't sure whether I needed the absolute path
2009-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 when in doubt use the full path
2009-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	ok. The syntax is correct though?
2009-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 looks right.. be sure the CaSe Is CoRrEct :)
2009-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	ofcourse :) BRB.
2009-02-08T10:49:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	Success! Thanks. Now, I don't suppose you have any experience with wpa_supplicant?
2009-02-08T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 never used it. never needed it
2009-02-08T10:50:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	as in, used something else for WPA, or never used WPA/wireless?
2009-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bobblybook	 ive not had to fight with wireless much.. if it dident work.. i used wires :) but now wireless for the most part just works for my machines
2009-02-08T10:53:00.000Z	Bobblybook	Dr_willis	is wpa_supplicant still needed to use WPA encryption for networks? I'm running 8.10 intrepid now, but the guides I read might be old.
