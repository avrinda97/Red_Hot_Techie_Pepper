2007-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	Ward1983		!install
2007-10-19T07:17:00.000Z	Ward1983		can i just keep running my apps while upgrading?
2007-10-19T07:17:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	i'd recommend not
2007-10-19T07:17:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	are all my apps gonna keep working aswell after the upgrade?
2007-10-19T07:18:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	if you have mission critical applications, upgrading to a new version fo ubuntu on day 1 is probably not a good idea
2007-10-19T07:18:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	how long would you recommend waiting?
2007-10-19T07:19:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	i'm a systems engineer, i dont upgrade mission critical appliances unless they're broken
2007-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	well i just have some application i would like to keep using, i don't have a server or anything
2007-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	i mean applicationS
2007-10-19T07:21:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	if youre feeling gutsy, try it, obviously noone can guarantee your applications will work
2007-10-19T07:22:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	then i'm not gonna update, i would not know wherefore
2007-10-19T07:23:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	i updated fully expecting broken things and having to fix things, just like with any linux update honestly
2007-10-19T07:24:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	sure but what advantages has the update for me to risk anding up with a broken working environment
2007-10-19T07:24:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	my question is why even use linux if you don't expect to have the fun of breaking it and fixing it
2007-10-19T07:25:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	i don't have the experience to fix things fast enough, it can take me days
2007-10-19T07:25:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	best way to learn then
2007-10-19T07:25:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	i'm kindof depending on this system
2007-10-19T07:26:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	then don't upgrade it, i've got plenty of other computers to use, in fact i'm ircing from my bsd laptop sitting next to my ubuntu
2007-10-19T07:26:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	then you're lucky :p i only got a old laptop and this desktop
2007-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	i think i'll go for a clean install on the laptop tomorrow then to try it out, i'm not very dependant of that one
2007-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	Ward1983	mrj	thanx for the info
2007-10-19T07:28:00.000Z	mrj	Ward1983	np
