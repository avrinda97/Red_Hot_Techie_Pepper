2005-11-07T10:27:00.000Z	CookedGryphon		i installed kubuntu base and its all ugly and none of the shortcuts are in the menu and half the butons don't work, there's a minimal theme and it crashes, I think it may be because when i installed kubuntu-base using synaptic apt tried to get some stuff from teh internet and couldn't
2005-11-07T10:28:00.000Z	CookedGryphon		tgjw how do i set my proxy settings?
2005-11-07T10:29:00.000Z	CookedGryphon		no, its apt, but it jstu waits a while then coes back to a prompt
2005-11-07T10:29:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	System > Preferences > Network proxy
2005-11-07T10:29:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	don't patronise me
2005-11-07T10:30:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	? sorry, didn't follow previous questions. No patronizing here, no, no ;)
2005-11-07T10:30:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	what app did you want to change/setup proxy for ?
2005-11-07T10:33:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	when i installed kubuntu-base it tried to get some files from the internet in the postinstall but couldn't, and so i tried apt-get and it doesn't seem to b configured, so i'm sat ina decrepit version of kde, no themes, no buttons working, no shortcuts etc
2005-11-07T10:34:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	can you boot in safe mode ?
2005-11-07T10:34:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	(rescue, sorry)
2005-11-07T10:34:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	i can boot and get apps unning, in fact i can give up and go back to gnome, i just wanted to try out kde, and its not impressing me so far,
2005-11-07T10:37:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	I would completely remove kde and reinstall it.
2005-11-07T10:38:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	I know in synaptic you can, so apt-get in command line definitely provides for it
2005-11-07T10:38:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	I can use synaptic
2005-11-07T10:39:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	sometimes depending on what you did at your first rty, it may have installed *some* dpeendencies, not all thus the unstable result
2005-11-27T17:46:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	which version ? 5.10 ? if so, in the menu Places > Connect to server > Windows Share you should have a field for the domaine
2005-11-27T17:47:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	I do that and then when i restart the field is reset, when i set it it works for that session, but its a bit of a faff
2005-11-27T17:47:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	is there any way to set it from the command prompt so i can automount it at boot?
2005-11-27T17:48:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	search synaptic for "smb"... let me see
2005-11-27T17:49:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	MagicFab	i have smbfs n everything installed, i can mount the drive, i just need to set the domain, but it resets to a blank field every time i restart the computer so i have to set it again, then it works
2005-11-27T17:49:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	there's a CLI for samba, smbclient is the package
2005-11-27T17:49:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	can't help much more
2005-11-27T17:52:00.000Z	MagicFab	CookedGryphon	check Google for ubuntu+samba+automount
