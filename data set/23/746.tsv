2011-04-02T00:17:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	There's an app called irssi or something. A lot of people adore it to no end. Try it
2011-04-02T00:18:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	Yep.
2011-04-02T00:19:00.000Z	jiltdil	Starminn	is this available in package ?
2011-04-02T00:20:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	sudo apt-get install irssi should work.
2011-04-02T00:21:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	If you ever need ot know a package name, go here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2011-04-02T00:21:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	Sure thing.
2011-04-02T00:23:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	That's over my head. I keep it pretty simple for myself, so I can't really advise on that. :(
2011-04-02T00:23:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	But I will tell you this: A lot of people ask about having a secure chat connection. SSH is what gets suggested ot them.
2011-04-02T00:24:00.000Z	jiltdil	Starminn	how to use to chat via ssh
2011-04-02T00:24:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	So you could try opening an SSH connection between the two of you, perhaps. :)I Sorry I couldn't help more.
2011-04-02T00:24:00.000Z	Starminn	jiltdil	I've never SSH'd, haha. Try Google. It seems ot be a common question so it shouldn't be too bad.
