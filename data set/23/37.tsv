2012-10-08T19:20:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		Hello, sorry to just burst in with a question, but I'm having an issue with svn on my VirtualBox ubuntu system. It has to do with permissions, and I was wondering if there's anybody with a little time to help me out?
2012-10-08T19:21:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	just ask the actual question
2012-10-08T19:21:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		Well, I cannot commit to the repository, because for some reason SVN doesn't have access to it :/
2012-10-08T19:22:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		The owner of the repository is www-data (I'm pushing through apache) and the group is svn, my user group where all users with access are in
2012-10-08T19:22:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		when I chmod the folder to allow everyone full access, it's working properly
2012-10-08T19:22:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	please ask in one line (don't use enter as punctuation)
2012-10-08T19:23:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		Well, I cannot commit to the repository, because for some reason SVN doesn't have access to it :/. The owner of the repository is www-data (I'm pushing through apache) and the group is svn, my user group where all users with access are in. When I chmod the folder to allow everyone full access, it's working properly.
2012-10-08T19:25:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	pastebin your attempt at making a commit and the full output, as well as Â« ls -ld DIRECTORY Â» output for the relevant directories
2012-10-08T19:28:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		The results from the command are: rwxr-xr-x 6 www-data svn 4096 Oct  8 17:26 /home/svn/zdb, and the error is: Can't open file '/home/svn/zdb/db/txn-current-lock': Permission denied.
2012-10-08T19:29:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	use a pastebin (http://paste.ubuntu.com) and paste what I actually asked please
2012-10-08T19:29:00.000Z	Aidiakapi		That is the result of what you actually asked :S

2012-10-08T19:35:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	Isn't that what you wanted to know? I'm new to linux, so I don't know exactly what you're going for
2012-10-08T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	you setup svn?  What are the permissions on /home/svn/zdb/db/txn-current-lock ?
2012-10-08T19:40:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	ohoow I see those are user root and group root. I used the chmod and chown commands before using the svnadmin create command is that the problem?
2012-10-08T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	is there a reason you're using svn by the way?  Nowadays, many prefer dvcs like git, hg, and bzr
2012-10-08T19:43:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	not really, though I used GIT for some time, and I really didn't like it, I've never heard of the other two
2012-10-08T19:43:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	and SVN with TortoiseSVN seems rather easy, plus the extensions for Visual Studio work great
2012-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	what's zdb?  What's creating that lock file?  Does something else write to the repository maybe?
2012-10-08T19:47:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	no the problem was solved by setting the permissions again (sudo chown www-data:svn /home/svn/zdb, sudo chmod g+rws /home/svn/zdb did the trick for it). zdb is the name of my repository and project
2012-10-08T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	Aidiakapi	k
2012-10-08T19:48:00.000Z	Aidiakapi	jrib	so what are those other version control systems, and do they have advantages over svn? And it's kind of important that it's very easy to use from a windows installation, because all team members are using windows, but the server is running linux
