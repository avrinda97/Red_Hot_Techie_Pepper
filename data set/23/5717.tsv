2006-09-26T14:00:00.000Z	ReinH		guys, question, if I'm going to partition my HD to dual boot with WinXP, with a root ubuntu partition and a Ext3 partition for /home and shared date, how big should the root ubuntu partition be?
2006-09-26T14:00:00.000Z	ReinH		(and also a partition for windows, of course)
2006-09-26T14:01:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- whole system will install in under 5 GB - but, if you plan on installing lots of libraries (KDE stuff, developer tools) I'd make it 10 - 15 GB to be safe.
2006-09-26T14:03:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- you should be sage with 12 GB.  Also, I find it adventagous to put /etc on its own partition (as well as /home)
2006-09-26T14:06:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	just saw your comment: how big a partition should /etc have? and how advantageous?
2006-09-26T14:09:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- it just stores config stuff (like for X11, apt, samba sshd etc.).  So, if needing a reinstall - you don't need to reconfig all of that stuff.  Mine is 16 MB right now, I partitioned it for 200 MB.
2006-09-26T14:09:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	gotcha, sounds like a good idea :)
2006-09-26T14:09:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- i mean /etc has about 16 MB of data.  It is pretty much all text files.
2006-09-26T14:10:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	I would assume you aren't dual booting?
2006-09-26T14:11:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- it is a little more difficult to set up initially - but, I think it pays off in the end.
2006-09-26T14:14:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	and how big is your /swap partition? (and that's it for my questions for now, I believe) :)
2006-09-26T14:14:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	oh, one more: what tool do you use to partition?
2006-09-26T14:14:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- 1 GB - good rule of thumb is 1.5 x Physical ram.
2006-09-26T14:15:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- I use gparted
2006-09-26T14:16:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- yup.  2 of my machines are windowless.  It's just a shame that I need DirectX to shoot people when I'm in the mood :)
2006-09-26T14:16:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	indeed
2006-09-26T14:18:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- good luck with it - see you in a few
2006-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	do you use gparted from a live cd?
2006-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- ya - I always have a copy of Knoppix kicking around.
2006-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	ReinH	kjm	:)
2006-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- but, it is on the live CD install.
2006-09-26T14:20:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	 - just select the "Manually edit partition table"
2006-09-26T14:22:00.000Z	kjm	ReinH	- has saved my bacon on numerous occasion.  ALthough - you can mount your physical drive from the Ubuntu install cd and run gparted
