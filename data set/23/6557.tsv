2006-09-17T10:42:00.000Z	fatejudger		does anyone know of an ubuntu package or repo for VMWare server?
2006-09-17T10:42:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	Best idea is to get vmware-server from vmware.com .
2006-09-17T10:43:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	They update frequently, and even if dapper had support for it, it would be best to get it from the vendor.
2006-09-17T10:43:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	is there any way to package it up into a deb?
2006-09-17T10:44:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	I wish there was.  Maybe in a few months.  For now, I specify /usr/local/???? for all the questions except for the startup script dirs (/etc and /etc/rc.d) and the desktop icons (/usr/share/applications, etc.)
2006-09-17T10:44:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	vmware server being free is a recent idea.
2006-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	recent as in several months
2006-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	it's not like it happened last week
2006-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	Yeah I installed it just a couple of days ago.  Your best bet is to download the .tar.gz and install it with vmware-installl script.
2006-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	link?
2006-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	Just vmware.com.  Follow the VMWare Server links.  You need to register, but it's just to get a somewhat generic serial that the config script will understand.
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	do you know whether I'll have to reinstall Windows under VMWare or whether I'll be able to run my existing Windows partition?
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	live CD
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	there's a command to do it
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	With Windows, you'll need a fresh install under VMWare.  It's simply the way Windows works.
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	that's what I figured...
2006-09-17T10:53:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	what's the advantage of using VMWare over something like Qemu then?
2006-09-17T10:53:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	aside from performance of course
2006-09-17T10:53:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	I dunno.  I prefer VMWare for the ease-of-use, but if you can get the same setup with qemu, with better performance, than go for it.
2006-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	I believe VMWare has better performance
2006-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	since it's at the kernel level
2006-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	fatejudger	silvaran	rather than the user level
2006-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	silvaran	fatejudger	For now :).  Wait for the hardware hypervisor support to take hold :)
