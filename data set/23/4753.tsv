2007-05-16T10:51:00.000Z	digital_k		hello again all :)
2007-05-16T10:53:00.000Z	digital_k		tahoma is included in the mscorefonts now on the repos
2007-05-16T10:53:00.000Z	digital_k		however, tahoma bold is not
2007-05-16T10:54:00.000Z	digital_k		oh wow
2007-05-16T10:54:00.000Z	digital_k		lagging, flooding, same thing?
2007-05-16T10:54:00.000Z	digital_k		:)
2007-05-16T10:55:00.000Z	digital_k		Molluck:what are you attempting?
2007-05-16T10:55:00.000Z	digital_k		I missed your question.
2007-05-16T10:55:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	I'm just trying to find a decent font that doesn't get too fat when an application uses BOLD
2007-05-16T10:56:00.000Z	digital_k	Molluck	do you have font smoothing enabled?
2007-05-16T10:58:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	haha i just did a search for the digg article that tells how to enable smooth fonts.. it is enabled now.
2007-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	omg its nice... except now bold fonts are extremely bold.
2007-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	digital_k	Molluck	for best results, go into the font preferences, and set the fonts to gray scale and slight
2007-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	I prefer medium hinting over slight becuase the letter spacing seems "natural" whereas slight makes it seem less readible
2007-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	digital_k	Molluck	understandable, we see with different sets of eyes. :p
2007-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	indeed :)
2007-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	but this bold has got to go. it's terrible!
2007-05-17T06:43:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	i don't remember :S
2007-05-17T06:43:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	I just told somebody else prior to rebooting, he recommend just using the restricted driver
2007-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	digital_k	Molluck	is yours an integrated card? thats what mine is and I think the integrated ati sets cant do 3d, not the older ones anyway.
2007-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	it is integrated (laptop)
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	digital_k	Molluck	ive decided that if one wants all the wiz bang effects, its better to have non-ati anything. :/
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	Molluck	digital_k	I know.  but for the moment, I have an ati laptop.. would prefer some kind of effects
