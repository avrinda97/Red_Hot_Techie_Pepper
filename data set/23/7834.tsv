2005-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	Enspyron		I want to install  a new linux distribution on my webserver, and if everything works well I will also install it on my workstation... would you recommend Ubuntu?
2005-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	we might be biased around here
2005-04-17T12:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	which distro you should use is very personal. Find one that you like and stick with it
2005-04-17T12:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	not really. The devs make it easy
2005-04-17T12:27:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	also try Suse, fedora, debian and maybe arch
2005-04-17T12:27:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	and mandrake
2005-04-17T12:28:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	get the live cds so you test without installing
2005-04-23T06:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	install gstreamer-plugins
2005-04-23T06:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	assuming you have already enabled the other repos
2005-04-23T06:25:00.000Z	Enspyron	Burgundavia	Install ALL the gstreamer packages?
2005-04-23T06:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	easier that way. Then you get everything
2005-04-23T06:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	gstreamer-plugins is a meta-package for them all
2005-04-23T06:33:00.000Z	Enspyron	Burgundavia	I installed all the packages, but it still doesn't work, and I was mistaken about the file format, it's not AVI but MPG
2005-04-23T06:34:00.000Z	Enspyron	Burgundavia	When I try to play a MPG or avi file, it says I need the plugins. Where can I get those?
2005-04-23T06:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	did you get gstreamer-plugins?
2005-04-23T06:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	then I would recommend changing to totem-xine
2005-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	you also need to install w32codecs
2005-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	totem-xine is far more stable, but gstreamer is more developer friendly
2005-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	w32codecs will get all that stuff
2005-04-23T06:46:00.000Z	Enspyron	Burgundavia	both synaptic and apt-get can
2005-04-23T06:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	www.ubuntu.com/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-04-23T06:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	you need to add the debian-marilliat repo
2005-04-23T07:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Enspyron	where are you creating the dirs?
