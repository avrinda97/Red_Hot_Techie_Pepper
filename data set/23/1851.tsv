2010-09-03T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Please pastebin the output of `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-cache policy libgtk2.0-dev && sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev`
2010-09-03T09:27:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	sorry, i hope your still here, lets try this once more
2010-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Please pastebin the output of `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-cache policy libgtk2.0-dev && sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev`

2010-09-03T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Alright, at some point in the past you had lucid-updates enabled, do you know why you disabled them?
2010-09-03T09:34:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	i disable anything related to updates on my parents machine cause they cant do that, and just update them when ever i come around (were working on that box with this issue)
2010-09-03T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Alright, well the issue comes from the fact that at one point -updates was enabled, and you have some versions of things from -updates which aren't playing well with things from plain 'lucid'.  If you re-enable -updates and do the instlal, you should be fine (this won't force you to do all of the updates, by the way)
2010-09-03T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	also, if the internet is the issue, you might try downloading the 10.04.1 alternate CD and bringing that to their computer to upgrade from.  It'll make you up-to-date as of a few weeks ago.
2010-09-03T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	(of course, if it's just bandwidth in general, and not on a particular computer, the alternate CD will likely be larger than just downloading the updates)
2010-09-03T09:37:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	i didnt realize that thing would NOT update if you turned the updates off. I just installed 10.04.1 with the i386 desktop cd. No they have fast internet (but a crap machine)
2010-09-03T09:38:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Well, it'll update from whatever repositories it has.  If the repositories never get updated (because -updates and -security are turned off) then you won't ever have anything to upgrade to.
2010-09-03T09:40:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	why isnt -updates and -security listed in the software sources gui?
2010-09-03T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	They should be.  Are you on the right tab?
2010-09-03T09:41:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	no im not
2010-09-03T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	The "updates" tab: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/2-software-sources.png
2010-09-03T10:50:00.000Z	pfifo	Flannel	looks like all my packages are working perfectly now, your awesome
2011-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	pfifo	Yes
