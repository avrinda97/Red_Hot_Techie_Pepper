2011-11-16T19:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	pipe command outputs and files to it and it will make a URL
2011-11-16T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	saves having to use a browser to pastebin files, waaaaaay faster
2011-11-26T16:37:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	I'll try
2011-11-26T16:40:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	should I typ: ping 8.8.8.8  ?
2011-11-26T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	yes
2011-11-26T16:43:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	 I think it works, but who can I stop the 'ping command' ?
2011-11-26T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	press CTRL+C
2011-11-26T16:45:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	 It prints "138 packets transmitted, 138 received, 0% packet loss, time 137230ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 48.559/51.745/100.955/4.635 ms"
2011-11-26T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	if you are getting replies then run:  echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf      does the web now work?
2011-11-26T16:48:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	 no it doesn't work
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	do you use a proxy to get online?
2011-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	no
2011-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	if you run:  cat /etc/resolv.conf     does it just have the line I gave without the quotes?
2011-11-26T16:53:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	If i type:  cat /etc/resolv.conf  it prints:      # Generated by NetworkManager nameserver 192.168.2.1
2011-11-26T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	ok, run:  gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf      and change 192.168.2.1 to 8.8.8.8     save the new file, close gedit and try the web (I assume gnome desktop)
2011-11-26T16:58:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	I changed but web is still not working. (I got unity as desktop (ubuntu 11.10))
2011-11-26T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	unity isnt a desktop, its a shell. You are using gnome desktop
2011-11-26T16:59:00.000Z	rootux	ActionParsnip	sorry my fault I'm a newbie sorry
2011-11-26T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rootux	you'll learn :)
