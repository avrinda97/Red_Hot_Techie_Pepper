2010-07-11T05:41:00.000Z	cablop		they can upgrade to OOo in windows without stopping the office work
2010-07-11T05:41:00.000Z	cablop		nope, you can install OOo 3.0 in windows xp, and windows xp is 8 years old!!!
2010-07-11T05:41:00.000Z	cablop		this is what my boss told me and i can't economically argue againsta that
2010-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	cablop		well, for that boss to upgrade means to stop work in the office for at least one day or more until everything is ok again
2010-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	cablop		well office 2007 can be installed on top of winxp... that is 5 years of distance... and still works, i technically understand the thing, but not my boss and not the people who pay the bills
2010-07-11T05:43:00.000Z	cablop		and what non-technicall users feel about ubuntu is that ubuntu is not mature enough for a productive office
2010-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	cablop		i think a better approach was to have stable repos you won't change in two years, not a single change, and build on top of them, not with the latest library available, just to ease updates
2010-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	cablop		well, Jordan_U that's good today... but not one year ago
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	cablop		cause a non-techie user can do that install
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	cablop		*can't
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	Fougner	cablop	then teach him/her?
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	cablop		anyway, i just tell you one of the problems
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	Fougner	cablop	what's the difference for XP?
2010-07-11T05:46:00.000Z	cablop		they son't want to be taught
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	Fougner	cablop	then ubuntu is not for them, yet :)
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	cablop		in xp the user just call me and ask what to do, i can say him/her the steps with no need to see any window
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	cablop		in ubuntu i just say, well, enter the shell and, and they became scared
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	Fougner	cablop	with linux, you just SSH in and install it, the user has to do... nothing
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	cablop		well, back in those days that was an issue
2010-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	cablop		they need to be able to open docx
2010-07-11T05:48:00.000Z	cablop		the customers or providers use ms office and use docx and xslx and if the OOo cannot handle them they wanted to be back on ms office, and windows... of course
2010-07-11T05:48:00.000Z	cablop	Jordan_U	i can do it in this moment, but not in the past
2010-07-11T05:49:00.000Z	Fougner	cablop	well most of the time OO can handle MS office docx. and so on.. afaik
