2009-12-14T10:11:00.000Z	losha	quietone	what's the model number of the drive?
2009-12-14T10:14:00.000Z	losha	quietone	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/storage/P141314/en/spec.htm   It *is* a dual layer device.
2009-12-14T10:16:00.000Z	losha	quietone	I would start by shutting down, letting it cool for a few minutes, then rebooting....
2009-12-14T10:17:00.000Z	losha	quietone	dual layer can be tricky actually, because of the layer break. Are you trying to burn dual layers? For regular dvd players, single layer dvd-r is best
2009-12-14T10:17:00.000Z	losha	quietone	it probably isn't, but power-cycling cures more things than penicillin...
2009-12-14T10:21:00.000Z	losha	quietone	just power cycle the thing and we can start debugging...
2009-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	losha	quietone	first, tell me about your blank disks. What kind, what brand, what size...
2009-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	losha	quietone	do you have any dvd-r? They work best in dvd-players....
2009-12-14T10:36:00.000Z	losha	quietone	commercial dvd players were basically build to play commercially pressed dvds. dvd-r are closest to that....
2009-12-14T10:38:00.000Z	losha	quietone	if all you have is dvd+rw then we can try it, but if you've been having trouble for months, one of the first suspects is the brand and type of blank...
2009-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	losha	quietone	ok, no problem. I'll listen out for you...
2009-12-14T11:04:00.000Z	losha	quietone	are you there?
2009-12-14T11:05:00.000Z	losha	quietone	did you install k3b?
2009-12-14T11:06:00.000Z	losha	quietone	should go quickly, as the files will still be in your cache
2009-12-14T11:16:00.000Z	losha	quietone	select new video project
2009-12-14T11:17:00.000Z	quietone	losha	I chose video dvd and no video Cd
2009-12-14T11:17:00.000Z	losha	quietone	for stuff destined commercial dvd players, I only use dvd-r and only verbatim or taiyo yuden brands...
2009-12-14T11:17:00.000Z	losha	quietone	now navigate to the directory with your vob files in the upper window
2009-12-14T11:19:00.000Z	losha	quietone	taiyo yuden are a japanese brand. Top of the line. I mail order them, but I'm in the USA. Dunno if you can get them for a reasonable price in NZ
2009-12-14T11:29:00.000Z	losha	quietone	in that case, select tools->Burn image in k3b
2009-12-14T11:38:00.000Z	losha	quietone	then set the appropriate options in the burn image menu. I would burn at the slowest speed available (for testing) and choose verify, then let it rip...
2009-12-14T11:45:00.000Z	losha	quietone	the volume id shouldn't make any difference. So what exactly happened?
2009-12-14T12:00:00.000Z	losha	quietone	I'm not sure, to be honest. I haven't used RWs in years. Maybe bastidrazor will know when he comes back online...
