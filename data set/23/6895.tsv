2005-11-28T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	you shouldn't USE debian mirrors, unless you know what you're doing extremely well
2005-11-28T15:11:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	hmmmkey, i will remove them
2005-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	no, debian servers removed but erros still existent
2005-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	i didn't follow what was happening, dunno about the error
2005-11-28T15:15:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	aptitude upgrade for several packages delivers 404 not found
2005-11-28T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	did you "sudo aptitude update" first?
2005-11-28T15:15:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	several times :D
2005-11-28T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	can you put your sources.list into the pastebin?
2005-11-28T15:16:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	bad idea, i have only console at the moment ;)
2005-11-28T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	can you paste it to #flood then?
2005-11-28T15:16:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	and i use my own apt-proxy too
2005-11-28T15:17:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	i will try with #flood
2005-11-28T15:17:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	oh you're using apt-proxy?
2005-11-28T15:18:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	well then test all your reps using a web browser... if none 404, then you probably have an apt-proxy problem
2005-11-28T15:20:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	i have posted to flood
2005-11-28T15:22:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	i'm not sure how apt-proxy works, but why do you have "ubuntu", "ubuntu-security" etc instead of "breezy", "breezy-security" etc? maybe they've valid synonyms, but i've never heard them before
2005-11-28T15:23:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	they are only identifiers for sources.list
2005-11-28T15:23:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	and it worked fine just to this upgrade today ...
2005-11-28T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	oh well, i dunno... the reps seem all perfectly valid at a quick look... why don't you trying without apt-proxy?
2005-11-28T15:25:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	in sources.list, there it is only used the ubuntu backend
2005-11-28T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	moiReee	i don't know, really, it smells like an apt-proxy problem, and i never used it
2005-11-28T15:27:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	ok
2005-11-28T15:34:00.000Z	moiReee	LjL	it is very easy to kill this ugly splash screen from nvidia ;)
