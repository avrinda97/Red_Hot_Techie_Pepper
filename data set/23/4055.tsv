2007-11-28T11:40:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	it's in /var/log/X....   I'll look up the exact name ...
2007-11-28T11:40:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	usually /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-11-28T11:41:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	from they wat should i do
2007-11-28T11:41:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	hopefully you'll see why it's crashing.  Look at the end of the file, because it will hopefully tell you why it stopped
2007-11-28T11:42:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	if thhe problem persist, how can i get u
2007-11-28T11:43:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	I'm often here.  You can pm me if you like.  It's 1:45 am here, though, and I may not stay awake much longer.
2007-11-28T11:43:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	wat about ur email address at least
2007-11-28T11:44:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	seth@cql.com
2007-11-28T11:44:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	if i am to get the solution will it give me solutions on how to solve my problem
2007-11-28T11:45:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	it's hard to say; there are so many possibilities.
2007-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	let me explain the problem further, when i boot my system, my desktop wall paper and the files on my desktop go blank just my mounted drives
2007-11-28T11:52:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	sometimes like now it boots normal
2007-11-28T11:52:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	if it's intermittent I would run a memory test, because it sounds like hardware.
2007-11-28T11:53:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	my system specs is and acer 5610, duo core centrino..with intel graphics cardd
2007-11-28T11:54:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	try running memtest86.  Random behavior may well be caused by intermittent memory.  Could also be caused by intermittent memory on the graphics card.
2007-11-28T11:55:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	that's odd.  I'm not sure what it specifically means, though.
2007-11-28T11:55:00.000Z	ejandi	sethk	if it is the graphics card, pls wat do u suggest
2007-11-28T11:55:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	If practical, try another card as a test.  These types of problems are extremely difficult to isolate.
2007-11-28T11:56:00.000Z	sethk	ejandi	replacing things until it works properly is about all you can do.
