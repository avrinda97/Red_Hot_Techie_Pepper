2008-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	will the program still continue, like the music continue playing ?
2008-12-10T07:49:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	i use mpd
2008-12-10T07:49:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	I'm afraid I don't know, then.
2008-12-10T07:55:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	the music continued, but firefox & xchat closed
2008-12-10T07:55:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	thats odd, im not sure what caused thatr
2008-12-10T07:57:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	well i did it with the red close button (upper right) disconnect !
2008-12-10T07:58:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	on the panel?
2008-12-10T07:59:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	the upper bar right of the time
2008-12-10T08:00:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	I'm afraid I don't know how to help you
2008-12-10T08:00:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	i'm just telling you what i did!
2008-12-10T08:05:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	That's because you've changed your color settings to display fewer colors
2008-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	wonder if i change back to 24 in my xorg.conf
2008-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	and see what it does ?
2008-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	might work
2008-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	i ll try to see
2008-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	this is my card...GeForce4 MX 4000 ! i've changed it, now i have to restart xwindow again ?
2008-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	Every time you change something in xorg.conf, you have to restart the X server.
2008-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	ok
2008-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	be back
2008-12-10T09:11:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	back, it worked..the screensaver looks better, but about the video, or diaporama i ll have to check
2008-12-10T09:14:00.000Z	schnauzer	qcjn	That's good news, but I'm afraid I'm out of ideas.
2008-12-10T09:20:00.000Z	qcjn	schnauzer	when i look at P.P.S whit Open Office it is super slow ? is it my material , or it does that to everybody ?
