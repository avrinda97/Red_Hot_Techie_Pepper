2004-12-18T07:49:00.000Z	DmD		hello, I have a question about a wireless NIC..
2004-12-18T07:50:00.000Z	DmD		will the D-Link DWL-520 Wireless NIC card work with Ubuntu?
2004-12-18T07:52:00.000Z	DmD		will the D-Link DWL-520 Wireless NIC card work with Ubuntu?
2004-12-18T07:53:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	Maybe
2004-12-18T07:53:00.000Z	DmD		I checked on the Ubuntu website and I see the 520+ version works
2004-12-18T07:53:00.000Z	DmD		but I have just the 520 model
2004-12-18T07:54:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	Shouldn't matter unless it uses a different chipset than the + model
2004-12-18T07:54:00.000Z	DmD	Nivlem	 I just installed Ubuntu on my desktop and I'm not able to get online, would you be able to help me configure it?
2004-12-18T07:55:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	Sorry never done it..

2004-12-18T07:56:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	Let me take a look and see how involved it is..
2004-12-18T07:56:00.000Z	Nivlem		It is on the wiki?
2004-12-18T07:57:00.000Z	DmD		alright, thanks
2004-12-18T07:57:00.000Z	DmD		just the 520+

2004-12-18T07:57:00.000Z	DmD		alright
2004-12-18T07:58:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	Where on Ubuntu site..I checked the HOWTO and it doesn't have anything about configuring it..just drops to firmware info
2004-12-18T07:59:00.000Z	DmD		I searched for it on google and that wiki site came up
2004-12-18T07:59:00.000Z	Nivlem	DmD	And how is it you are chatting on IRC if you don't have internet?
