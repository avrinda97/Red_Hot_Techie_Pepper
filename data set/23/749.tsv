2011-03-01T01:10:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup		Can anyone help me mount my harddisk that doesn't want to mount anymore with the livecd?
2011-03-01T01:11:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	ubuntu wont boot or trying to recover files?
2011-03-01T01:11:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	both, at this point
2011-03-01T01:13:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	if ext based fs have u tried sudo e2fsck -C0 -p -f -v /dev/sda1
2011-03-01T01:14:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	assuming its /dev/sda1
2011-03-01T01:15:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	it says it's being opened by another program when i enter that
2011-03-01T01:16:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	and it's /dev/sdb1 because it's changed from a to b for some reason even though i have only one harddisk
2011-03-01T01:17:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	u can find what it is by doing sudo fdisk -l
2011-03-01T01:17:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	nothing happens when i do that
2011-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	your in the live cd running a terminal?
2011-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	yep
2011-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	oh i didnt notice- you know its sb1
2011-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	if so just change command i gave accordingly
2011-03-01T01:19:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	ps- if you forgot the sudo the fdisk -l command will not display anything
2011-03-01T01:19:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	i did, this was the output: e2fsck: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/sdb1
2011-03-01T01:21:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	hmm.

2011-03-01T01:22:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	well you tried to mount it and it gave error i think u said so have u restarted since then
2011-03-01T01:22:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	yes, still the same
2011-03-01T01:22:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	i mean restart and run the e2fsck command without trying to mount it first
2011-03-01T01:23:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	to be clear i think its hungup on the last time you tried to mount and that why giving u busy msg when trying to repair
2011-03-01T01:24:00.000Z	endlesspudingcup	geoffmcc	brb
2011-03-01T01:25:00.000Z	geoffmcc	endlesspudingcup	k
