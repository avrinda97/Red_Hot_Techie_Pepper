2011-03-26T17:05:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	you can do a dual install it should bring them over
2011-03-26T17:08:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	what os are you running
2011-03-26T17:09:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	download the iso for the usb disk you want to make, and then use the disk utility under administration
2011-03-26T17:09:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	all you have to do is provide it with the iso of the 64 bit os
2011-03-26T17:10:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	I mean Startup Disk Creator :D
2011-03-26T17:11:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	then all you have to do is reboot with the flash drive in usb
2011-03-26T17:12:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	insert the usb, choose it as the disk to use and then tell it where to load the iso from by clicking other
2011-03-26T17:13:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	did you load the iso?
2011-03-26T17:14:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	then just click "make startup disk"
2011-03-26T17:15:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	kk
2011-03-26T17:15:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	just do a dualboot setup copy your important stuff and then erase the old ubuntu
2011-03-26T17:17:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	are you going to simply install from the flash drive to your pc, or are you going to run ubuntu off your flash drive all the time?
2011-03-26T17:17:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	if your just going to install ubuntu to your pc you dont need any
2011-03-26T17:21:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	really if there is I would like to know also
2011-03-26T17:25:00.000Z	borillion	divamiller	you would be surprised lol, XP runs better in a vitual machine that it does on hardware HEHEHE
