2011-11-27T00:20:00.000Z	coolstar		In the ubuntu Installer, Should I choose ext4, ext3, or ext2?
2011-11-27T00:21:00.000Z	coolstar		so I want to know if it matters
2011-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	coolstar		I know the USB 2.0 transfer rate is 480 mb/s
2011-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	coolstar		I want to know if the filesystem will matter
2011-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	coolstar		like in mount time
2011-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	coolstar		or unmount time
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	coolstar		I'm trying to get it to boot quickly
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	coolstar		ok
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	for a desktop, i suggest ext4
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	Its a Seagate External Drive
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	is it platter based?
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	then ext4 is fine, Wnidows OS will not be able to read it however
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	The drive is partitioned. My data will be on an NTFS partition on the drive
2011-11-27T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	sounds fine
2011-11-27T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	it can
2012-11-05T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	^
2012-11-05T11:28:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	I just want over local network
2012-11-05T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	then SSH isn't needed, what are you wanting to do on the remote system once you get connected?
2012-11-05T11:30:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	open windows, etc
2012-11-05T11:30:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	basically normal VNC
2012-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	but to achieve what? If you want remote file access you can use samba or SSHFS and get file access, no need for full desktop access for that
2012-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	coolstar	ActionParsnip	I need to open some apps that I cant otherwise use on my tablet
2012-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	coolstar	ahh tablets, good fun. Makes sense
