2012-05-22T14:17:00.000Z	paopao		Are there any very very very serious problems if I didn't upgrade my Ubuntu to a new version?
2012-05-22T14:17:00.000Z	paopao		*don't
2012-05-22T14:19:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	at some point you will not get security updates anymore
2012-05-22T14:19:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	and you will have to update firefox etc. yourself
2012-05-22T14:21:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	that's ok, i am just worried about being attacked by some virus.
2012-05-22T14:22:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	then you should keep your installation up-to-date
2012-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	I mean if a new virus comes about, but i can't receive the update, then my Ubuntu would possibly be attacked
2012-05-22T14:24:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	if a new virus should appear that is capable of exploiting some weak spots in old ubuntus, yes
2012-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	well, it's really a hard choice for me, Ubuntu should support its old version
2012-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	it upgrades so fast that i didn't even enjoy it....
2012-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	no, it would be a huge extra workload to support old versions forever. there is enough work to do to support the latest versions
2012-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	12.04 is a lts version, which means you can stay updated for 5 or 7 years
2012-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	maybe i don't have to upgrade, i just install an anti-virus software?
2012-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	no
2012-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	that is the wrong way
2012-05-22T14:28:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	and remember when you are on 12.04 you can stay there for a very long time
2012-05-22T14:28:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	i want to let you see my desktop
2012-05-22T14:29:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	why?
2012-05-22T14:29:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	i think it's really nice, and that's why i don't want to upgrade
2012-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	on what version are you?
2012-05-22T14:31:00.000Z	paopao	ultrixx	I am sending it to you
2012-05-22T14:32:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	no, thanks
2012-05-22T14:37:00.000Z	ultrixx	paopao	you are at Wuhan University?
