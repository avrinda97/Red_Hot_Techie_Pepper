2009-07-04T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	have you ever been able to boot from a CD?
2009-07-04T01:16:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	the original install of gutsy (according to eh computer owner) booted fine from cd
2009-07-04T01:18:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	did you try to boot from one of those on another computer? (to make sure the CD is ok)
2009-07-04T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	then..., how did you burn the CDs?
2009-07-04T01:20:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	gnomebaker iso images
2009-07-04T01:21:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	I cannot autorun the disc from any computer
2009-07-04T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	and you are certain that didn't just burn a CD with on .iso file on it?
2009-07-04T01:23:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	I have burned cd image of the .iso with gnomebaker at slow and fast write speeds with amd64 AND x86 both have md5 that checks out, neither one works
2009-07-04T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	give me a few minutes, I'm looking something up
2009-07-04T01:25:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	ty
2009-07-04T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	did you use Tools/Burn CD Image in gnomebaker?
2009-07-04T01:33:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	yes
2009-07-04T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	did you burn all the CDs on the same drive? (just fishing around)
2009-07-04T01:36:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	no, tried multiple compps and multiple drives
2009-07-04T01:38:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	I suppose you checked already in the BIOS settings if bootin from CD is enabled
2009-07-04T01:40:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	yes I did
2009-07-04T01:40:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	of course, by that I mean that I set the CD to load before the hard disk and floppy drive (lol)
2009-07-04T01:41:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	yes :-)
2009-07-04T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	so: you cannot boot off any CD on *this* PC, you cannot boot off *these* CDs on any PC, right?
2009-07-04T01:44:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	not off of boot, no
2009-07-04T01:44:00.000Z	unjustice	guntbert	but they run after boot, but not on the particular computer I am trying to get working
2009-07-04T01:48:00.000Z	guntbert	unjustice	I'm pretty close to the end of my ideas :(, last thing for now: try to get hold of a "original" boot CD (no self burnt one), and try to boot with that (doesn't matter what OS) - just to make sure your PC is able to boot off a CD at all
