2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Howitzer		Oh
2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Howitzer		i tried C++ once too
2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Howitzer		but i got all confused with arrays and matrices
2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Howitzer		eh
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Howitzer		nope
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Howitzer		unless you need to write to it
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Howitzer		SO
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Howitzer		What should i try?, Python, C++(again) or Bash?
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Howitzer		But it might not be fully stable
2006-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	Howitzer		to be sure of my case.
2006-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	erez	Howitzer	try python , here is a good guide for beginers: http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/ and also this one :http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/
2006-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	Howitzer		Can i easily step over from Python to something else? (like C Sharp, my nephew said it's the language of the future :x )
2006-04-16T09:32:00.000Z	Howitzer		I thought Java was a bitch
2006-04-16T09:32:00.000Z	erez	Howitzer	after learning python you won't need to EVER learn C# , but i would be able to learn c easly, and c++
2006-04-16T09:33:00.000Z	Howitzer	erez	could you explain why i shouldn't learn C# then?
2006-04-16T09:35:00.000Z	Howitzer		Well
2006-04-16T09:35:00.000Z	erez	Howitzer	python and C# are after all for the same purpose, then you won't need to know c# , if you will want to hack on windows you will want to learn it, buti  can't think of another reason to learn C# if you know python.
2006-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	erez		maybe you should start from C, i started from Pascal then moved to C, and after that i have seen that many languages use the C syntax.
2006-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	Howitzer		Oh god
2006-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	Howitzer		so many choices -_-
2006-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	Howitzer		it's driving me nuts
2006-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	Howitzer		yeah, they told me C++ was hard for newbies
2006-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	erez	Howitzer	the reason python is considered easy to beginers is because it is very easy to read.
