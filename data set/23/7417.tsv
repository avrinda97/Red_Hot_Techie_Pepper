2005-08-04T07:29:00.000Z	rkinder	zeus	did you submit a bug about this?
2005-08-04T07:30:00.000Z	rkinder	zeus	if such a fundamental thing is broken on your system, it would be great to get a bug submitted so the problem may be fixed for 5.10.
2005-08-04T07:34:00.000Z	rkinder	zeus	typical bug, eh :)
2005-08-04T07:37:00.000Z	rkinder	zeus	you can do CTRL-C on bootup to prevent it from hanging waiting for DHCP etc.
2005-08-04T07:37:00.000Z	rkinder	zeus	although you will then have to manually bring up the interface you're interested in...
2005-08-04T07:38:00.000Z	zeus	rkinder	somehow i have to do it anyway
