2005-10-01T16:20:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	a couple of ways, either run gksudo nautilus to get a root file browser and do it through there, or sudo rm -r /root/to/folder. But if you are new to linux use the former
2005-10-01T16:20:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	Are you new to linux?
2005-10-01T16:23:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	that is because it is the root desktop goto /home/user/desktop
2005-10-01T16:26:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	do you understand the sudo stuff?
2005-10-01T16:27:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	the reason why you couldn't delete things is because you didn't have the authority. Using sudo will give you the auth. But be careful when deleting, sometimes there is no way back.
2005-10-01T16:28:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	cool
2005-10-01T16:35:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	sudo apt-get install smeg     to edit your menus

2005-10-01T16:37:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	application/system tools/ smeg menu editor
2005-10-01T16:40:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	if you type user nicks, it beeps them when you post something. If you start to type the name and press tab it will auto-complete it.
2005-10-01T16:41:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	what was the second?
2005-10-01T16:54:00.000Z	selinium	obontu	xmms or BMP but it is a choice thing
