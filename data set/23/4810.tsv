2008-08-20T22:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	/msg ubottu factoid is <reply>Whatever ......
2008-08-20T22:51:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	danke
2008-10-07T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	trilobiti jim_p indeed "sudo update-pciids"
2008-10-07T19:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	relatime is a correct option that can speed up the filesystem... stands for "relative atime" the other related option is "noatime" (atime is access time)
2008-10-07T20:03:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	thanks, missed that
2008-10-07T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	no problem
2010-03-21T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	surely e17 wm has a name :) like gnome's
2010-03-21T16:54:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	lol nope, it's just plain ol' e17. they rolled the WM and DE into one.
2010-03-21T16:55:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	in the days of e16, they had efm, but it was very primitive
2010-10-13T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	well, he seems to have his bits in a row
2010-10-16T14:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	use the alternate install
2010-10-16T14:42:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	okay. I tried ubuntu server as well, but when I went to reinstall lately, it refuses to recognize the usb drive itself as a cdrom
2010-10-16T14:51:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	having issues getting the alternate, I can't do bittorrent, it needs to be http or ftp, no exceptions.
2010-10-16T14:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	where do you live? US http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/ --> http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/10.04.1/
2010-10-16T14:54:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	got it, thanks :)
2010-10-16T14:54:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	can't tell you how much I've missed a good kernel.org download... :)
2010-10-16T14:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	;)
2010-10-16T15:35:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	and it's going through the packages now :)
2010-10-16T15:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	sorry; never seen that error myself ....
2010-10-16T15:54:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	I'm seeing it on previous versions of ubuntu in the bug tracker, as far back as 6.10.  I used usb-creator-gtk, so I guess I'll try unetbootin next
2010-10-16T15:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gnea	good luck then
2011-03-09T16:47:00.000Z	Gnea	erUSUL	ironically enough, I could only get my new workstation up and running using server as a base
