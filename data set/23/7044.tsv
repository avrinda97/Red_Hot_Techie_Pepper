2005-11-22T17:28:00.000Z	jims		I'm sorry if someone replied to my first request for help with madwifi, as soon as my message as sent, I got stalled by my wireless card...
2005-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	jims		Can anyone help with installing madwifi?  Or another alternative to ndiswrapper?
2005-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	me
2005-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	you want the package module-assistant
2005-11-22T17:31:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	you also want the headers for your kernel
2005-11-22T17:32:00.000Z	jims	tarheelcoxn	Will the package module-assistant update drivers or softwar to improve my ability to keep a WLAN connection?
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	no. module-assistant will help you build kernel modules
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	you want to download the madwifi source and build a kernel module to run your card
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	you do have an atheros card, yes?
2005-11-22T17:34:00.000Z	jims	tarheelcoxn	I am a newbie to Linux and Ubuntu, so source builds are a bit intimidating...
2005-11-22T17:34:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	that's what module-assistant is for
2005-11-22T17:34:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	there's no other way to use madwifi
2005-11-22T17:35:00.000Z	jims	tarheelcoxn	Will the module assistant get the source like 'apt-get'?
2005-11-22T17:35:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	no, but the source is really easy to google up
2005-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	jims	tarheelcoxn	Will building madwifi automatically make it the default for my wireless card?
2005-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	no, but that's one easy extra step
2005-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	you want to go to http://www.marlow.dk/site.php/tech/madwifi
2005-11-22T17:37:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	under the "Repository" heading you'll see two lines starting with "deb"
2005-11-22T17:37:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	add those lines to /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-11-22T17:38:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	then have synaptic do an update
2005-11-22T17:38:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	after you've done that, you can use synaptic/aptitude/apt-get to get the madwifi source
2005-11-22T17:41:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	the alternative if you don't want the most up-to-date version: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MoreRecentMadwifiHowto?highlight=%28madwifi%29
2005-11-22T17:42:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	jims	did you already try what's shown in the wiki?
