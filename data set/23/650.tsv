2012-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	xubuntu5		hoooch!
2012-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	xubuntu5		i have one more question
2012-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	xubuntu5		how can i automount via sshfs?
2012-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	xubuntu5		alright thanks
2012-01-09T05:36:00.000Z	xubuntu5		i can add sshfs to /etc/fstab?
2012-01-09T05:36:00.000Z	xubuntu5		maybe write a script that runs on boot or something idk how i'd get it to enter the password for ssh maybe have to use auth files or something :( and thanks again hooch pysdm was just what i needed
2012-01-09T05:37:00.000Z	xubuntu5		and why is my audio sooo bad when i play a file that i've mounted with sshfs i'm just trying to play an mp3 on the remote comp locally but the audio is so messed up for some reason
2012-01-09T05:38:00.000Z	xubuntu5		thanks action
2012-01-09T05:39:00.000Z	xubuntu5		how can i run my scripts after boot as root?
2012-01-09T05:39:00.000Z	xubuntu5		i can't sudo in the script because that requires the root password
2012-01-09T05:40:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	you dont need sudo to mount in fstab
2012-01-09T05:41:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	take the sudo out. it is not needed
2012-01-09T05:42:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	you would chown the file restrict permissions and mark it as setuid and audit the code to make sure it sanitizes any inputs
2012-01-09T05:43:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	its not something you should do unless it is absolutely necessary. in this case it isn't since mount is setuid
2012-01-09T05:46:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	no thats half of the reason for the existence of /etc/fstab
2012-01-09T05:46:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	anything in rc.local is run as root, so you can do whatever you want there, or you can put it in fstab and run it yourself without sudo
2012-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	you backgrounded a process and it is still running fg to bring it forward ctrl-z bg to put it back in the background jobs to list
2012-02-24T20:07:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	ctrl-z; bg
2012-02-24T20:09:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	why would it not?
2012-02-24T20:09:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	what do you mean by background?
2012-02-24T20:11:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	ok you want to switch what server it appears on. much harder. can be done with screen and an xserver in between
2012-02-24T20:13:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	vnc is a lot easier
2012-02-24T20:14:00.000Z	escott	xubuntu5	but if you dont want vnc look into screen+xpra/xnest/xmove
