2008-06-01T05:52:00.000Z	tj83		m_newton... your set on him going through the bios... why not just choose the drive once?
2008-06-01T05:53:00.000Z	tj83		matt12.... choose # 3.... watch the status light... make sure you see some activity... if so and it doesnt work you likely have a bad disk.
2008-06-01T05:53:00.000Z	tj83		if no light.. then you must do something else
2008-06-01T05:54:00.000Z	tj83		m_newton.. I do agree with your logic... and from what he has said.. your suggestions "should" have worked...
2008-06-01T05:55:00.000Z	tj83		matt12... get back to the 1.2.3 choices and list them again for us plz
2008-06-01T05:56:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	1 resume normal setup 2 enter BIOS Setup Util 3 Choose a temp startup device
2008-06-01T05:58:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	okay, I'm testing the live cd on another computer right now
2008-06-01T06:01:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	did you fully go though the last steps option 3 then option 1 with the disc in?
2008-06-01T06:02:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	yes...the live cd doesnt work from another computer either though
2008-06-01T06:04:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	m_newton...should the new live cd work...should I just install ubuntu again? and leave it...or is their a grub repair/remove app on it?
2008-06-01T06:06:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	do you dual boot? and does it give you the "press esc for menu" message?
2008-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	what did you do prior to the issue to possibly "cause" the error?
2008-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	look for ISOburn on google
2008-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	I unassigned the partition through windows
2008-06-01T06:08:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	which partition?
2008-06-01T06:08:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	I killed the ubuntu partition, which killed the grub loader which now won't let me start up
2008-06-01T06:13:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	SHAME! on you for trying to ditch ubuntu.
2008-06-01T06:14:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	I'm not knowledgable enough to get the most out of ubuntu
2008-06-01T06:14:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	I can zip my way around windows easily, but with Ubuntu I was just doing basic stuff.
2008-06-01T06:16:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	what are you saying man...am I cooked?
2008-06-01T06:19:00.000Z	tj83	Matt12	its hard to get "over the hump" with linux
2008-06-01T06:29:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	well, I'm learning a lot about my computer right now, that's for sure
2008-06-01T06:32:00.000Z	Matt12	tj83	yes
