2006-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	ashzilla		I have a question
2006-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	ashzilla		I was reading the Gnome Terminal Getting started guide, when it said it was possible to have tabs
2006-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	ashzilla		So, can I do something similar to my terminal such as firefox - a simplied tab browser?
2006-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	yes
2006-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	please share how :D
2006-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	Shft-Ctrl-T by default, or via menu.
2006-10-31T11:58:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	oh my, that's sexy... I can't believe I've been using nothign but Linux for the last few months and I just learned how to do this.
2006-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	how can I navigate through the tabs
2006-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	pull down the Tab menu.
2006-10-31T12:40:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	Keyboard Shortcuts menu item.
2006-10-31T12:40:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	after edgy there's only option in the menu for work spaces 1 and 2
2006-10-31T12:40:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	that's why I'm having a problem
2006-10-31T12:41:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	right click on switcher and add more workspaces.
2006-10-31T12:41:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	how can I add more workspaces via the command line?
2006-10-31T12:42:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	probably gconftool-2
2006-10-31T13:01:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	maybe paste the whole file to pastebin?
2006-10-31T13:07:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	haha.. Now I see why you need to add workspaces via cli.
2006-10-31T13:08:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	I ended up just adding the workview switcher for ease of use, but I wanted to learn with the cli... because, well, I think I should know how to do everything from the command line and all the practice learning I get is good.
2006-10-31T13:09:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	well fyi, this makes 4 workspaces -->  gconftool-2 -s /apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces -t int 4
2006-10-31T13:10:00.000Z	ashzilla	dcraven	I man'd gconftool-2 but it looked too complicated -.-
2006-10-31T13:11:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	not the attitude to take when your goal is to learn the cli.. lol
2006-10-31T14:05:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	there is a fresh one in /etc/skel/
2006-10-31T14:33:00.000Z	dcraven	ashzilla	new kernel. Rerun vmware-configure or whatever that crap is.
