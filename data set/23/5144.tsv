2007-02-06T06:45:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	what card you using ?
2007-02-06T06:46:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	I am using a d-link airplus G DWL-G510
2007-02-06T06:54:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	do you think adding the ath_pci to my initramfs/modules will work?
2007-02-06T06:47:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	and it worked when you started livecd you say ?
2007-02-06T06:47:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	im on livecd now, using it to connect to this chat
2007-02-06T06:48:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	interesting, so open a terminal window , (applications/accesories)  and type lspci there should be a notation about your wifi card there can you copy and paste just that line back to me please
2007-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	ah same card I use.
2007-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	now, i am using a grub boot cd to run my ubuntu, which is installed on a usb drive
2007-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	the cd has its own kernel to boot with usb drivers
2007-02-06T06:50:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	you will nee to goto system - administration - synaptic, do a search for ndiswrapper and -utils for it, and basically install that, and use the WINDOWS drivers on the cdrom that came with the card
2007-02-06T06:50:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	do you use ndiswrapper?
2007-02-06T06:50:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	I havent found a way to get mine to work woithout it... yep using it right now.. works like a charm
2007-02-06T06:50:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	so weird that the livecd works fine
2007-02-06T06:51:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	try typing, lshw -class network, look under the network card what driver it is use (driver=)
2007-02-06T06:52:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	inetresting I never got it to work with that driver, maybe you can try to do a modprobe ath_pci and see how it links it up to the network card on lshw and iwconfig
2007-02-06T06:53:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	but only do that when you reboot your box to the HDD
2007-02-06T06:53:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	ok, right now when i do that it returns nothing
2007-02-06T06:53:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	no it would not.
2007-02-06T06:54:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	try it when booting from HDD
2007-02-06T06:55:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	right, i will check the lshw from the hdd, be back in a bit
2007-02-06T06:55:00.000Z	pbureau	imanoob	I dont know...  but try modprobe ath_pci see if it attaches it to the ra0 in iwconfig
2007-02-06T06:56:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	first, im going to try adding ath_pci to my modules since i need to make a new boot CD anyway
2007-02-06T07:42:00.000Z	imanoob	pbureau	you here?
