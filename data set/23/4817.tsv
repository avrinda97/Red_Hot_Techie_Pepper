2007-12-16T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	ubuntu
2007-12-16T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	wipe out windows and install ubuntu
2007-12-16T12:40:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	if firefox freezes, you should be able to recover without rebooting :)
2007-12-16T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	instead of the power button, you could also try, after ctrl-alt-backspace doesn't work: alt-sysrq-b
2007-12-16T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	it will do an 'emergency reboot'
2007-12-16T12:50:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	don't remember
2007-12-16T12:56:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	what video card do you have?
2007-12-16T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	what is the result of this command in a terminal: lspci | grep VGA
2007-12-16T13:01:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	i can only guess that you have the right video driver installed.... grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf   should see something about "vesa" or "i810"
2007-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	ok what did it actually say?
2007-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	if you use this command: grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	then what does it have to say about either "vesa" or "i810"? do either show up?
2007-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	jahnkeanate1	have you installed any updates?
