2008-05-07T02:06:00.000Z	ichabooka		My internet connection keeps resetting itself.  using ubuntu 8.04.  it comes up, goes down, comes up.... does anyone have any idea or is anyone experiencing the same thing?
2008-05-07T02:07:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	i get that sometimes but i've proven its due to my ISP
2008-05-07T02:08:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	i thought about that, but my laptop running windows is doing fine
2008-05-07T02:08:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	do u connect via network router modem ?
2008-05-07T02:09:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	yes
2008-05-07T02:09:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	i also have it set to update daily with the latest.  i know it's stupid, but i like it....
2008-05-07T02:09:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	so i imagine whatever changes went in today screwed it up.
2008-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	so it happened only after that upgrade today?
2008-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	i'm running kernel 2.6.24-17-generic
2008-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	yes
2008-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	so it happened only after that *update* today?
2008-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	it was working.  it updated.  i restarted later.  network does not work now
2008-05-07T02:11:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	try stepping back your Update Manager. that way you could isolate the cause more easily
2008-05-07T02:11:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	btw, this is a wired connection
2008-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	i've never done that.  is it pretty self explanatory?
2008-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	if it's due to one or more of those updates, hardware setup should have nothing to do with it..
2008-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	yea, i'm pretty sure it's not hardware related
2008-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	u'd probably get easy documentation on the net and the Help and Support from System Menu
2008-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	lemme check what i have
2008-05-07T02:14:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	thanks for the help babola1
2008-05-07T02:17:00.000Z	babola1	ichabooka	might help with eclipse repo question -->http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=532800
2008-05-07T02:18:00.000Z	ichabooka	babola1	thanks
