2009-05-04T01:05:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	What video card are you using?  And can you show us a pastebin of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2009-05-04T01:07:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	- I dont think It's to do with either of those - I've edited my /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom to start a second x server on boot, and there are two (on tty 7&8) but the moment I log in to either of them, I get whitescreen + mouse
2009-05-04T01:10:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Ah, so you have two x servers.  Have you googled for this much?  I'm finding a lot of "white screen" errors for Intel and ATI drivers in Linux, particularly when there are two X servers running
2009-05-04T01:11:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	well, I'm on nvidia, but I havent found anything useful on google yet
2009-05-04T01:11:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Hm.. Haven't seen anything for nvidia.
2009-05-04T01:12:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Have you tried it with simple vesa drivers or with no xorg.conf?
2009-05-04T01:12:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	visual effects (compiz etc) and the rest of the interface are all intact I just cant see anything
2009-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	how do I do that?
2009-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Which part?  The vesa drivers or the "no xorg.conf"?
2009-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	all of it
2009-05-04T01:14:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	To use the vesa drivers, you should just have to change the "Driver" line in the Video Card device section to: Driver "vesa"
2009-05-04T01:16:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	To use the vesa drivers, you should just have to change the "Driver" line in the Video Card's Device section to: Driver "vesa"
2009-05-04T01:16:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	found something: it's possible that it's a conflict between two instances of compiz
2009-05-04T01:16:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Yeah, I was seeing the compiz stuff coming up in some of the google searching I was doing
2009-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	yeah, disabling graphical effects fixed it
2009-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Great, congrats :)
2009-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	now, the question is how do I get it to work with two graphical effects enabled
2009-05-04T01:19:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Unfortunately, I have no idea regarding that.  Never used more than one X server
2009-05-04T01:19:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	hmmm... anyways, thats for the help
2009-05-04T01:19:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	No problem, good luck
2009-05-04T01:21:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	may have just found something - it's possible running kde in one and gnome in the other fixes the issue, rather than gnome running in both
2009-05-04T01:21:00.000Z	RedSocrates	spasysheep	Ahhh, I see; that may be
2009-05-04T01:21:00.000Z	spasysheep	RedSocrates	I think that may be because i have gfx diables on kde
