2011-02-03T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	helpmee	I mean it seems like it's just saying "you don't need any driver to do this"
2011-02-03T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	helpmee	oh wait, I misread.  Maybe it says it can't find a driver it wants?  What card do you have?  Does unity not work?

2011-02-03T04:44:00.000Z	helpmee	jrib	one moment.
2011-02-03T04:46:00.000Z	helpmee	jrib	also, im running this in virtual box.. incase that helps
2011-02-03T04:46:00.000Z	jrib	helpmee	you might not be able to use unity then (not sure)
2011-02-03T04:47:00.000Z	helpmee	jrib	ok, well right now its installing updates so on moment..
2011-02-03T05:20:00.000Z	helpmee	jrib	no drivers are listed
2011-02-03T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	helpmee	you likely cannot use unity in vbox
2011-02-03T05:21:00.000Z	helpmee	jrib	alright
