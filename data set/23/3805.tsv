2011-06-30T05:16:00.000Z	chaddy		only really finding tmux useful within screen, so many of the screen/byobu shortcuts are second nature, now
2011-06-30T05:17:00.000Z	chaddy		but not screen within screen shortcuts
2011-06-30T05:18:00.000Z	chaddy		well xbmc is worth a google, theborger, as is mythtv
2011-06-30T05:19:00.000Z	chaddy		don't need as much as that, I daresay
2011-06-30T05:19:00.000Z	chaddy		afraid I don't know about that, theborger
2011-06-30T05:20:00.000Z	chaddy		probably LTS for a media server, reliability is better
2011-06-30T05:20:00.000Z	chaddy		much more stable
2011-06-30T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chaddy	Sounds great I run xbmc on a 10th the system of that. If you use Android there is a remote control on the phone :)
2011-06-30T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chaddy	Lucid desktop support dies at the same time Natty does
2011-06-30T05:21:00.000Z	chaddy		yes
2011-06-30T05:21:00.000Z	chaddy		with a view to upgrading to the next LTS when it appears
2011-06-30T05:22:00.000Z	chaddy	ActionParsnip	I couldn't trust Natty that far, to be honest my late experience of that
2011-06-30T05:22:00.000Z	chaddy		has been poor
2011-06-30T05:22:00.000Z	chaddy		lts yes
2011-06-30T05:23:00.000Z	chaddy		not the server edition, though, that' s just cli
2011-06-30T05:23:00.000Z	chaddy		you want classic ubuntu at the login for that, I believe
2011-06-30T05:23:00.000Z	chaddy		then ccsm from there
2011-06-30T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chaddy	then Lucid will last longer :)
2011-06-30T05:24:00.000Z	chaddy		lovely, that'll run myth or xbmc in a snooze
2011-06-30T05:25:00.000Z	chaddy		yes ;)
2011-06-30T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chaddy	there is xbmc live :)
2011-06-30T05:25:00.000Z	chaddy	ActionParsnip	does LTS server still have longer support if you apt-get ubuntu-desktop?
2011-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chaddy	no, because it is then a desktop OS
