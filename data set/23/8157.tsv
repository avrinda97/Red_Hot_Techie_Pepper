2004-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	erich		Hi, any of the developers working on the faster boot process around?
2004-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	erich		Are you using the default "boot-chart", or have you modified it?
2004-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	I have talked to them about it
2004-12-22T06:26:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	Interesting
2004-12-22T06:26:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	my top here by default doesn't include the "PPID" column, which boot-chart tries to use.
2004-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	I can look for a sec though
2004-12-22T06:31:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	i tried building it with gcj but failed. Building it for sun jdk worked.
2004-12-22T06:31:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	which number are you looking for? the numbers reported in top are treacheous.
2004-12-22T06:31:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	the VM size usually inkludes like 4M unused memory for each thread IIRC.
2004-12-22T06:32:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	so, what's accurate?
2004-12-22T06:34:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	no idea. the RSS value should be much better.
2004-12-22T06:34:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	see that's not in top for me
2004-12-22T06:35:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	RES in top i think.
2004-12-22T06:37:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	i think using "RES - SHR" could be a fair value.
2004-12-22T06:50:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	really?
2004-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	can you set pins in synaptic?
2004-12-22T06:56:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	no idea.
2004-12-22T06:56:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	actually, it has a "set internal variable'  I think that may be it
2004-12-22T06:57:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	i'm a debian user, and while i know the synaptic author closely - we worked together on integrating debtags with synaptic - i don't use synaptic myself. guis are always way to slow.
2004-12-22T06:57:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	you can probably set the "default distribution" with that, but not arbitrary pins
2004-12-22T06:57:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	It's nice to search for packages, but I do use apt-get quite a bit too
2004-12-22T07:02:00.000Z	erich	Rotund	more for browsing that for searching actually. For mere searching i prefer "apt-cache search"
2004-12-22T07:02:00.000Z	Rotund	erich	actually, on debian, I always use packages.debian.org
