2011-12-22T07:34:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	.. the log looks ok.. can you do sudo service gdm start?
2011-12-22T07:34:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	restart actually
2011-12-22T07:37:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	startx or gdm works perfectly
2011-12-22T07:39:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	so.. you CAN init the X Server manually but not during boot??
2011-12-22T07:39:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	yup
2011-12-22T07:39:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	can you diff the Xorg.0.log with Xorg.0.log.old?
2011-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	i used "service gdm start" and it worked perfectly
2011-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	is it possible it's the onboard ati card and gnome 3?
2011-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	Doesnt make sense, you siad you were able to get the X Server running
2011-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	true
2011-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	how to debug?
2011-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	not much we can do.. the Xorg log was clean as a whistle.. did you do the diff like I asked?
2011-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	what does the last line mean "ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log"?
2011-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	what diif?  missed it
2011-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	diff Xorg.0.log with Xorg.0.log.old
2011-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	purged and re-added gdm, lightdm, and kdm... and now it is working
2011-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	Jesus!
2011-12-22T08:51:00.000Z	DrPenguin	ryoohki	things like this make me glad I use arch linux.. much more stable than ubuntu :P (not to hate on ubuntu, just had bad experiences post Lucid)
2011-12-22T08:52:00.000Z	ryoohki	DrPenguin	unity is terible - beta quality
