2009-03-06T14:43:00.000Z	sigma_za		ok thanks and does anyone know of a oss program i can use to attach attachments to a pdf file?
2009-03-06T14:44:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	you mean, you want a PDF editor?
2009-03-06T14:46:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	pdf file created via openoffice? why not just add what you want to the ODF?
2009-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	btw, what do you want to attach? by "attach", do you mean "inline"?
2009-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	the thing is i attached the files with a freeware program in windows - adobe reader see's them but okular does not - by attach I mean attach the file like you would attach a file to a email
2009-03-06T14:51:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	were you able to get the attached stuff? I see no reason to attach a file to a PDF
2009-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	yeah but only adobe acrobat reader can see and open them. okular supports embedded files but does not see them
2009-03-06T14:53:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	i can't include the images in the pdf as the resolution will make them unreadable on some screens
2009-03-06T14:54:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	so you want the raw image files in (unspecified format)
2009-03-06T14:54:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	if you can't include the images in the PDF, you can't really use PDF
2009-03-06T14:54:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	nope they are jpegs
2009-03-06T14:55:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	i dont think you understand what I am trying to do
2009-03-06T14:55:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	you have a bunch of images. you're trying to add them to a PDF
2009-03-06T14:56:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	right?
2009-03-06T14:57:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	yeah - i can add them in the actual pdf but thats going to mess up the resolution, thats why i want them as attachments to the pdf rather
2009-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	why not just archive the pdf with the images?
2009-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	you mean like put them all into a zip file?
2009-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	or are you giving the paperwork to someone who has no conception of "directory" or "archive"
2009-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	yes
2009-03-06T15:00:00.000Z	sigma_za	celeritas	yes thats a concern as well, hr people here are really thick
2009-03-06T15:00:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	so it absolutely has to be PDF?
2009-03-06T15:01:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	and a single file?
2009-03-06T15:03:00.000Z	celeritas	sigma_za	if it has to be viewed by acrobat, well then it has to be PDF. so you are saying that PDF has attachments? Besides just embedded images?
