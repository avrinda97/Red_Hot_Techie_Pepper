2009-04-08T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	i'd add a sudo to it just incase
2009-04-08T13:53:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	i will kill him if he doesnt do it with privs ;)
2009-04-08T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	if its not his file, the permissions will not be updated
2009-04-08T13:55:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	i know ;) its his file and hes doing it as superuser...but you are right....i have to think on everything atm
2009-04-08T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	np :D
2010-05-04T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	you dont edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg   that file is generated with update-grub
2010-05-04T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	you edit /etc/default/grub and the other files, grub.cfg is made after the changes
2010-05-04T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	as you saw, editting the file is not advised and its even marked as read only, even to root and it even states at the top of the file to NOT edit the file. Did you not read that?
2010-05-04T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	if you run: cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg | head -n 5   you will see it.
2010-05-04T16:40:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	useless use of cat ;) just use head -n5 /boot/grub/grub.cfg ;)
2010-05-04T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	whatever, still read the files. they tell you stuff
2010-05-04T16:40:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	i didnt read it....i used to edit the grub.cfg times ago....but that wasnt on ubuntu system
2010-05-04T16:40:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	you are right, but stuff happens ;)
2010-05-04T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	yeah, people ignoring warnings is great isnt it
2010-05-04T16:41:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	i tried to add the rootdelay options while editing the grub entry on boot time....it was also not taken!
2010-05-04T16:42:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	so i tried to change it manually in the file....overreading the introduction :9
2010-05-04T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	those are set in /etc/default/grub   i believe
2010-05-04T16:42:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	it didnt work....if you are able to alternate the config with the edit option on startup...it should work also
2010-05-04T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	its explained there :)
2010-05-04T16:43:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	well yes, but you first try the things as you've done them all the time, right? ;)
2010-05-04T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beli	ive played very little with grub as I always single boot
2010-05-04T16:45:00.000Z	beli	ActionParsnip	this is just a testing environment....one physical disk with w2k3server and one with ubuntu desktop
