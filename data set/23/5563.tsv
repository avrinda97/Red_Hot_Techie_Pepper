2006-11-03T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	have you read that page already?
2006-11-03T07:14:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	i read !!
2006-11-03T07:14:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	 they call me to use terminal thats right !
2006-11-03T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	not necessarily. you can use "gksudo nautilus" to start your file browser in root mode
2006-11-03T07:15:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	sudo gksudo nautilus ?
2006-11-03T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	no. just gksudo nautilus
2006-11-03T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	"To run a program using sudo that normally is run as the user, such as gedit, press Alt+F2 and enter gksudo gedit." <- from that page
2006-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	could you just try doing what that page says -- i.e Alt+F2, then "gksudo nautilus", then Enter?
2006-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	i can't get ur point
2006-11-03T07:17:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	 Thanks !! u are great !!
2006-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	no, the RootSudo page is. next time, read it fully ;)
2006-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	sorry master !
2006-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	and don't make it a habit of running Nautilus as root.
2006-11-03T07:20:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	uh .. why ? it will cause security problem ?
2006-11-03T07:21:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	yes. you should only be root when you really need it. and make sure that you *do* really need it.
2006-11-03T07:21:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	i can't login to my root account. It says wrong password.
2006-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	LjL	eseong	that's because *the root account is locked*. but when you use "sudo" or "gksudo", you effectively become root
2006-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	eseong	LjL	oo i get ur point :)
