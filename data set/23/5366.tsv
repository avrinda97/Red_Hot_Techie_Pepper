2006-12-17T07:29:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	do you have the resolution quake wants in xorg.conf?
2006-12-17T07:29:00.000Z	Sublimal-	l3mr	yes, i have
2006-12-17T07:30:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	do you get any error message from the game?
2006-12-17T07:31:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	if it's the same version of X, try backup up your xorg.conf and use one of the working systems
2006-12-17T07:31:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	maybe that helps
2006-12-17T07:31:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	and make sure you use the same driver version
2006-12-17T07:32:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	well there must be a difference somewhere, and switching the xorg.conf takes 3 mins, and maybe helps :)
2006-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	what card?
2006-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	but it does use direct rendering?
2006-12-17T07:34:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	other opengl apps work fine?
2006-12-17T07:34:00.000Z	Sublimal-	l3mr	no, the same problem there
2006-12-17T07:35:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	hmm sorry, no idea :/. dpkg-reconfigure the xserver, other than that...:/
2006-12-17T07:49:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	i had an intel chip in my old laptop too, and 3d worked fine...
2006-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	l3mr	Sublimal-	i mean, fine without the problems you describe.
