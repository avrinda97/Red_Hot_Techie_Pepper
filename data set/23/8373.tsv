2004-11-20T15:44:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	the renderaccel option is set to "On" or "True"?
2004-11-20T15:44:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	you shouldn't need to specify either -- just Option "RenderAccel"
2004-11-20T15:45:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	thanks!
2004-11-20T16:06:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	how do i enable xcompmgr? just install it?
2004-11-20T16:22:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	your xcompmgr package works very well :) how can i set it to start when X starts?
2004-11-26T11:46:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	i just want to thank about xorg and xcompmgr. but if i enable xcompmgr with all the shadows, fades, etc, X locks after a while.
2004-11-26T11:47:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	thanks -- and yeah, that will likely happen
2004-11-26T11:47:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	do you have two machines?
2004-11-26T11:47:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	yes
2004-11-26T11:47:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	well, if you want to install xserver-xorg-dbg and run that, you could log in from the other, attach gdb, and see where it hung if you wanted to be really, really useful
2004-11-26T11:47:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	but only one with a good gfx card
2004-11-26T11:48:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	ok ill try that

2004-11-26T11:50:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	wouldnt the new nvidia driver be helpfull on hoary?
2004-11-26T11:54:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	wouldnt the new nvidia driver be helpfull on debuging xorg? i say this because i am enabling render acceleration.
2004-11-26T11:55:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	yes, 61.16, but 66 is already on debian unstable.
2004-11-26T11:56:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	i am using the one from ubuntu repository.
2004-11-26T11:58:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	i fear that your backtraces may end up in '#0 at ????????'
2004-11-26T11:58:00.000Z	daniels	cardador	but it's worth a shot
2004-11-26T11:59:00.000Z	cardador	daniels	ill try that at home, right now im at work (also ubuntu :) )
