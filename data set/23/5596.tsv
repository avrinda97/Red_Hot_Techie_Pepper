2010-06-15T17:46:00.000Z	rdg		is there an IM client for Ubuntu with the same integration as Empathy?
2010-06-15T17:46:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	don't think so
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	forceflow		empathy is tightly coupled to that widget thingy
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	rdg		suck. you can't disable logging in empathy which makes it a no-go for my work environment
2010-06-15T17:51:00.000Z	forceflow		i run ext4, but that's just because it came as default in u9.10 ...
2010-06-15T17:51:00.000Z	forceflow		(imho, it feels faster than ext3)
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	rdg		empathy doesn't like it if you symbolically link its logs directory to /dev/null
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	why do you do that?
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	rdg		i can't have logs
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	rdg		work requirement
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	forceflow		well, then just disable logging in empathy?
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	rdg		it's not an option
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	rdg		it's been an open bug for nearly 2 years
2010-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	forceflow		really?
2010-06-15T17:54:00.000Z	forceflow		whew
2010-06-15T17:54:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	then just run a cronjob that cleans out log dir every 5 minutes
2010-06-15T17:54:00.000Z	rdg		yup. means medical professionals, certain government personnel, and others can't use it
2010-06-15T17:55:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	I never understood the switch from pidgin to empathy
2010-06-15T18:01:00.000Z	rdg	EgyParadox	the problem with doing a cron job is if Empathy is running and expects a log file to exists.. blammo it crashes
2010-06-15T18:02:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	then just make the cronjob empty the files :)
2010-06-15T18:03:00.000Z	rdg		how do you just empty a file
2010-06-15T18:04:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	delete it, then touch the original filename?
2010-06-15T18:04:00.000Z	forceflow	rdg	then empathy will just find empty logs
