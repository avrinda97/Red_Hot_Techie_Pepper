2012-03-05T00:14:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	ubuntu interface upgrades available .....most of them having kernel in the package name
2012-03-05T00:15:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	ah, good, i thought you were going to say you installed a custom kernel

2012-03-07T00:00:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	if you are dd'ing the iso shouldn't that be to sdb (the stick) not sdb1 (the first partition on the stick)?
2012-03-07T00:01:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	tried with sdb and sdb1 ...not working .....
2012-03-07T00:01:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	you sure the stick is sdb?
2012-03-07T00:03:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	what does uname -a say?

2012-03-07T00:09:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	while unrelated to your dd problem, there is an update to the kernel in lucid
2012-03-07T00:09:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	and you're suggesting first upgrade and then try again ???
2012-03-07T00:10:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	i find its always best to run the latest updates
2012-03-07T00:10:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	i can't see how the dd isue is related but worth updating anyway
2012-03-07T00:11:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	still dd doesn't supposed to be affected by this .....it's a permission issue nothing more .....
2012-03-07T00:11:00.000Z	minixvbox	parapan	yes, thats what i was saying, but just informing you that your current kernel has an update
2012-03-07T00:12:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	k man , thanks for the effort ...
2012-03-07T00:41:00.000Z	parapan	minixvbox	what to hear the solution ???
