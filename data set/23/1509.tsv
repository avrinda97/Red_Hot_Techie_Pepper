2010-03-25T22:55:00.000Z	grim_repair		I can't get my USB drive to mount on the workgroup
2010-03-25T22:55:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		you can't share you're USB drive?
2010-03-25T22:55:00.000Z	grim_repair		no sir

2010-03-25T22:56:00.000Z	grim_repair		automatically
2010-03-25T22:56:00.000Z	grim_repair		I'm not sure what you mean
2010-03-25T22:57:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		grim_repair:automatically or if you  manually mounted it

2010-03-25T22:58:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776	grim_repair	give me a few minutes, I have shared a USB drive with Samba before without issues.
2010-03-25T22:59:00.000Z	grim_repair		thanks Spanglish_7776
2010-03-25T22:59:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776	grim_repair	is it formatted with Linux (ext3, etc) filesystem or windows (FAT32 or NTFS) filesystem ?
2010-03-25T23:00:00.000Z	grim_repair	Spanglish_7776	can I use the mount command to check that?
2010-03-25T23:01:00.000Z	grim_repair		I can't remember how to check the filesystem
2010-03-25T23:02:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776	grim_repair	yes I think so
2010-03-25T23:02:00.000Z	grim_repair		it says type vfat
2010-03-25T23:05:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776	grim_repair	you're trying to share it via the right click share folder or with the samba config file?
