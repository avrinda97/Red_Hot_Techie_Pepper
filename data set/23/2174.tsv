2009-07-25T06:23:00.000Z	edbian	ohmygawd	Lemme read the instructions then I'll let you know.
2009-07-25T06:25:00.000Z	edbian	ohmygawd	ndiswrapper has improved since this how-to was made.  If you look in System -> Admin (I think) You'll see "Windows Wireless Drivers".  Ignore this tutorial and go there.
