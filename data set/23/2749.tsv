2009-09-19T10:55:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	how would you reconfigure your xserver??
2009-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	would you happen to know how to reconfigure your xserver after it hosed your distro by turning on compiz features?
2009-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 i tend to use the fusion-icon tool to enable/disble compiz. Not sure how ya trn it off from the command line.    ask in #compiz perhaps
2009-09-19T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 the X server dosent turn on compiz your windowmanager/desktop does.

2010-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	do you know the apt-get name of the package by any chance???
2010-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 somthing like flash-installer  or some logical name :)
2010-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 i never download the ones from adobe
2010-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	adobe-flashplugin??
2010-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	flashplugin-installet from adobe??
2010-05-07T23:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 Hmm? who is asking?
2010-05-07T23:44:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	thanks!!  the flashplugin-installer did it, I was just joking about the $3 but I think the "software center" is a good idea, next we need a license manager to manage the licenses that we buy for the software so that it doesnt gets wiped after every upgrade/reimage and we wont have to pay again for the same software
2010-05-07T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 i dont use the software center.. i find it limited
2010-05-07T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 buy software? huh? :)
2010-05-07T23:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	Dr_Willis	i would buy software in the software if someone created the infrastructure, billing and managing the licenses
2010-05-07T23:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mezquitale	 ive not seen anything i needed to buy :) at least not lately
