2009-03-12T07:47:00.000Z	tywashere		So I unisntalled wubi, and when I went to install ubuntu, It kept telling me it couldnt write the changes D=
2009-03-12T07:48:00.000Z	tywashere		any idea Scunizi ? :\

2009-03-12T07:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	tywashere	there's a couple of things that I can think of that might work.. these are the only two things that I can come up with .. there's probably lots more.. but first you might be suffering the "bug" with reading some harddrives architecture.  the second is much easier to test.  on the first screen that comes up on the live cd, hit f6 and erase "quiet splash" from the end of the kernel line and add "pci=nomsi" then hit enter and attemp
2009-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	tywashere		do I restart me pc to get back to the startup screen? xD
2009-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	tywashere	yes
