2010-06-26T06:27:00.000Z	IConrad01	Venim	Reboot your machine.  Get to the GRUB menu.
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	Venim	IConrad01	and?
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	IConrad01		When you're in the grub menu, enter "e" -- and then "e" again when you've navigated to the kernel-line.
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	IConrad01		Add a "3" to the end of the line you see.
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	IConrad01		Then hit "enter", and "b".
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	Venim		which line is the kernel one?
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	Venim		initrd?
2010-06-26T06:28:00.000Z	IConrad01		This will boot you into runlevel 3, which is no-GUI w/ Networking.
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	IConrad01	Venim	vmlinuz
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	Venim		so what should that line look like?
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	Venim		atm its linux /vmlinuz....... root=UUID=....3\
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	IConrad01	Venim	Doesn't matter.  You're just adding a "3" to the end of it.
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	IConrad01		Nothing attached to it, just "3"
2010-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	Venim	IConrad01	then boot?
