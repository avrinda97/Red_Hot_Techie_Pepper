2009-08-06T02:43:00.000Z	icarus		every time i attempt to conect to a server in tf2 it will display the message "can not conect toserver" what am i doing wrong
2009-08-06T02:45:00.000Z	icarus		is there a intel driver?
2009-08-06T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	sure
2009-08-06T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	can you ping their ips and names?
2009-08-06T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	intall traceroute and then run: traceroute <ip address here>
2009-08-06T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	its like tracert in windows, you can see were the connection gets stopped
2009-08-06T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	and it will also show if the connection even leaves your pc or home lan
2009-08-06T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	you need to investigate some to find out where the connection gets stopped
2009-08-06T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	you could even find the ap to see what it does yourself
2009-08-06T02:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	traceroute <ip here>
2009-08-06T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	e.g.   traceroute 1.1.1.1
2009-08-06T03:01:00.000Z	icarus	ActionParsnip	ok i need to log out of xchat so i can get the ip thank you for your help and i will be back shortely
2009-08-19T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	if you can ssh to the system you can read dmesg
2009-08-19T18:47:00.000Z	icarus	ActionParsnip	sorry complyetly new to ubuntu (or linux in that matter) is that like a error message?
2012-03-19T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	use your backups
2012-03-19T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	why not?
2012-03-19T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	you may find luck with foremost, if the data has been overwritten then it's gone
2012-03-19T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	get a backup system
2012-03-19T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	I suggested foremost, how is that "no help"
2012-03-19T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	try reading...
2012-03-19T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	use foremost and you may be able to get data back. if the data is important I am shocked you are devoid of backup
2012-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	why? because you destroyed your own data that is the fault of the OS?? Seriously?
2012-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icarus	3rd time lucky...try foremost
