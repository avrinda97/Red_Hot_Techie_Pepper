2010-09-27T10:36:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 what are you finding annoying?
2010-09-27T10:37:00.000Z	lucent	bobstro	it's a big list, we should discuss at a pub with plenty of napkins and ink
2010-09-27T10:37:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 well, maybe a short list we can try to help you with for the time being ?
2010-09-27T10:38:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 but yeah, computers aren't perfect just yet :)
2010-09-27T10:39:00.000Z	lucent	bobstro	I'm very angry about multitasking and clocked CPU operation, also RGB colourspace and the insanity that is the Ctrl key placement on us104 layouts
2010-09-27T10:39:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 oh... so nothing specific about ubuntu at the moment?
2010-09-27T10:40:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 i got over the ctrl key thing some time ago. my german keyboard had same placement, IIRC
2010-09-27T10:41:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 anything related to ubuntu?
2010-09-27T10:41:00.000Z	lucent	bobstro	Ubuntu's title bar design choice is awkward and awful, I have a preference for "/apps/metacity/general/button_layout" to be minimize,menu:close
2010-09-27T10:41:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 you mean the new layout with buttons at left?
2010-09-27T10:42:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 ah, well i agree. that is a 10 second fix though.
2010-09-27T10:43:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 only if they're insisting on it being something else. not like windows hasn't moved things around over the years.
2010-09-27T10:44:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 there are distros that look disturbingly like windows, if that is the measure of success.
2010-09-27T10:44:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 and that 'apple' interface seems to be gaining acceptance!
2010-09-27T10:47:00.000Z	lucent	bobstro	it's not a point to argue with me, you know. I'm expressing that I think it's a stupid design choice, but you are correct about the reasoning
2010-09-27T10:47:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 not arguing, mostly agreeing. but glad that's such an easy fix!
2010-09-27T10:47:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 believe me, i hate computers when they act stupid too.
2010-09-27T10:47:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 just hoping to help out.
2010-09-27T10:48:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 i read that there's supposed to be something new up at the right at some point, so we shall see.
2010-09-27T10:48:00.000Z	lucent	bobstro	overjoyed that the floppy disk is finally near its grave, too
2010-09-27T10:49:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 i thought so too. then i had to update the bios on a motherboard without a floppy.
2010-09-27T10:49:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 just enough to haunt you.
2010-09-27T10:50:00.000Z	bobstro	lucent	 fortunately, creating a DOS ISO worked but it was frustrating.
