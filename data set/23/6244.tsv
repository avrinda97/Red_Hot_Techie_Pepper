2006-05-29T11:24:00.000Z	SurfnKid		sudo su
2006-05-29T11:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	don't tell people to do that, it's a bad idea
2006-06-01T11:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	no defrag needed, the ext3 filesystem is smarter about positioning files on the drive
2006-06-01T11:32:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	right r0xoR  keeps saying that so thats cool
2006-06-17T10:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2006-06-17T10:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	then sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start restarts it
2006-06-17T10:56:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	let me ask you this, will it consume more memory if its on. while im working on the other 7 tty workspaces or will it not make a difference stopping it
2006-06-17T10:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	It'll swap out if you aren't using it and need the RAM
2006-06-17T10:57:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	ok so it will make a diff, cool to know
2006-06-17T10:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	its an old laptop, im trying to not consume a lot of ram, gui runs just fine but until i get more memory I dont wanna drag the hdd
2006-06-17T10:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	SurfnKid	How much RAM do you have?
2006-06-17T10:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	its a PIII500Mhz 128MB and 6.06 runs "just fine" but dragging starts when i run progams and the swapping begins
2006-06-17T10:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	it took me a while to get it online too, so i wanna use it as an irc box till i max out the ram and use it as a music streaming radio of some sort.
2006-06-17T11:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Amaranth	but that helps a lot ill see how that runs man thanx
