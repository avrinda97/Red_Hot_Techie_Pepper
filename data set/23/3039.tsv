2008-08-16T07:25:00.000Z	WDC		Hey, I am updating Ubuntu to 8.04 and it has been hanging on "Searching for Obsolete Software" for a while.
2008-08-16T07:26:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	how long is a while?
2008-08-16T07:27:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	I'd give it another 10 mins just to make sure it's really frozen
2008-08-16T07:27:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Cool. Okay Will do
2008-08-16T07:33:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Still "searching"
2008-08-16T07:36:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Still "searching"
2008-08-16T07:36:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	hm... this is a tricky problem to solve, any interruptions in the installation process could leave your system unstable
2008-08-16T07:37:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	how fun! lol
2008-08-16T07:37:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Would being in VMWare change anything?
2008-08-16T07:38:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	what does the installation window say? It should give some indication of what step you're on.
2008-08-16T07:38:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	ldconfig deferred processing now taking place
2008-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	do you mean running VMWare while installing or doing the installation on VMWare?
2008-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Ubuntu is under VMWare
2008-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	then no, I don't think it'll make a difference
2008-08-16T07:41:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Okay then. I don't think anything will go bad if I restart NOW, but i'll let it run overnight just to be sure (10:41PM)
2008-08-16T07:41:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	iirc searching for orphaned packages is the last task of installation, since it's a non-critical operation you're right in saying there's no harm in restarting now
2008-08-16T07:42:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	deferred processing doesn't take that long usually so I think it's safe to say it's frozen
2008-08-16T07:42:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	Would I need to restart, or CAn I just kill the process somehow?
2008-08-16T07:44:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	I would recommend restarting, so the changes can take effect
2008-08-16T07:44:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	but if you run the system manager you can kill the update process
2008-08-16T07:46:00.000Z	WDC	num1_	What's the process naem?
2008-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	num1_	WDC	I have no clue ;) it should be pretty easy to find with common sense
