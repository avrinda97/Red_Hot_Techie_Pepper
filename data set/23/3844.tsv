2008-09-03T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	sudo apt-get install imagemaick; convert myimagefile.jpg myimagefile.eps
2008-09-03T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	imagemagick does LOADS. can convert to greyscale, shrink, enlarge

2008-09-03T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	man imagemagick ;)
2008-09-03T18:38:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ActionParsnip	erUSUL: imagemagick worked well for that conversion. Thanks much.
2008-09-03T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	awesome
2008-09-03T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	it does a lot, look into it more, you'll be amazed
2008-09-03T18:41:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ActionParsnip	yes, I used it before in years past -- but because it's not in my Graphics menu, I keep forgetting about it.
2008-09-03T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	haha nice

2008-09-03T19:11:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ActionParsnip	thanks, but I don't see an answer in that thread. I'll dig some more in ooo's docs.
2009-06-02T04:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	any modem will work in any country
2010-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	I'd ask in #bash if nobody replys. They have mad skills
2010-08-28T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	do you tell gnome to remember the open apps?
2010-08-28T02:42:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ActionParsnip	No, unless it's somewhere else than I'm used to. This is a spanking new install of lucid
2011-08-15T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	sounds good to me, I recommend you take an image of the restore partition before hand, as a backup (restore partitions are such a pain i the ass)
2011-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	shouldn't do
2011-10-03T05:33:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ActionParsnip	is there a simple way to explore that program outside of a fresh installation (which I'd do), like a chroot?
2011-10-03T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jimcooncat	could virtualize to test
