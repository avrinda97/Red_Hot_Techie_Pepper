2010-06-13T00:57:00.000Z	acovrig		is there any legal info I should know about running ubuntu in a school?
2010-06-13T00:58:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	not sure exactly what you're asking.  if you're on your own machine, then you should be able to run whatever OS you want.  Just don't access anything you're not supposed to (i.e. adult websites, etc)
2010-06-13T00:59:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	I am planning on installing Ubuntu on ~20 comps at a gradeschool, Daekdroom stated it well, I am going to use it commercially
2010-06-20T05:13:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	lspci -nn | grep audio
2010-06-20T05:14:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	returns ''
2010-06-20T05:18:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	do what greezmunkey says...if you don't see anything that pops out, google the motherboard and see if there's anything you can find on it
2010-06-20T05:19:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	not much of a hardware person, where do I find out what motherboard I have
2010-06-20T05:20:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	it will show in the lspci
2010-06-20T05:20:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	if you need to, post the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com and ask someone to look @ it
2010-06-20T05:21:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	http://paste.ubuntu.com/452248/
2010-06-20T05:27:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	what do I google, I'm not getting anything with 'sound' or 'audio' in it
2010-06-20T05:28:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	will there be anything during boot - just before grub?
2010-06-20T05:28:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	sorry, but could you do an lspci -v and paste it for me?
2010-06-20T05:32:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	BIOS Version 1.00.02.DH05
2010-06-20T05:38:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	BIOS Audio Configuration: http://pastebin.com/Jnkhcja3 - lspci -v coming soon
2010-06-20T05:40:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	it may be very long...if you need to, do it this way so it saves to a text file: lspci -v > filename.txt
2010-06-20T05:40:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	its done - http://pastebin.com/ny9nGKET = lspci -v

2010-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	did that say anything about my motherbord?

2010-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	acovrig	SlidingHorn	did u look at my pastebin?
2010-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	I did -- I'm sorry but I wasn't able to find anything
2010-06-24T02:35:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	acovrig	why doesn't my car work?   you need to give details (i.e. error messages, etc)
