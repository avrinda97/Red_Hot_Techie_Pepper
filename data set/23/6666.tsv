2010-07-11T04:43:00.000Z	cablop	picard1421	i think you can try xmm2
2010-07-11T04:43:00.000Z	picard1421	iceroot	xubuntu... and it runs fine.. no hickups? im literally just playing music
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	cablop		i never used it but heard it was intended to be music server or sth like that
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	picard1421		no i just want an easy to use interface.. it will be a touch based music player.. no keyboard etc..
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	picard1421		i have a touchscreen ..
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	cablop		touchbased?
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	cablop		mmm maybe xubuntu with amarok would be good enough
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	cablop		if not try banshee or try
2010-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	cablop		mmm let me remember the name
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	picard1421		is there something lighter.. it can literally be NO os..
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	picard1421		just bootup into music player etc..
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	picard1421		just a GUI music player
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	cablop		i forgot the name, it's a xmms clone, but well done :P
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	picard1421		no ... its a physical touchscreen
2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	picard1421		whats the difference between xubuntu and lubuntu
2010-07-11T04:46:00.000Z	cablop		well, you can also install a ubuntu netbook edition on top and use it picard1421
2010-07-11T04:46:00.000Z	picard1421		hmm.. i get what you are saying.. its media player OS.. that might be kind of cool also... thanks for the help guys i really appreciate it!
2010-07-11T04:47:00.000Z	cablop	picard1421	that's why i told you to try ubuntu network edition, just few items enough for you
2010-07-11T04:48:00.000Z	picard1421		why ubuntu network edition?
2010-07-11T04:48:00.000Z	cablop	picard1421	or, maybe think in another OS, maybe a gogle android will suit you more, dunno
2010-07-11T04:48:00.000Z	cablop	picard1421	cause ubuntu netbook edition has less GUI controls and i think it has a media player inside
