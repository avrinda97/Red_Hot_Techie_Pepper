2007-11-23T22:33:00.000Z	ubuntuser		hi, i need to put an = symbol at boot to fix some things, i try altxxx, but i cant, i need to do something like rw init=/bin/bash, somebody knows ?
2007-11-23T22:34:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	at boot ? you mean when grub loads ?
2007-11-23T22:34:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	yes
2007-11-23T22:35:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	you want to edit an entry in the grub menu ?
2007-11-23T22:35:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	yes
2007-11-23T22:36:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	i think you do not have a very different keyboard, you are in uruguay and me in argentina
2007-11-23T22:36:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	hit 'e' over the entry
2007-11-23T22:36:00.000Z	ubuntuser		i do not speak in spanish, here we cannot
2007-11-23T22:36:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	hehe
2007-11-23T22:37:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	that is not the point, i have to put a "=" symbol
2007-11-23T22:37:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	the equals is shift 0 in es keyboard, or else the one beside the backspace key pressed alone
2007-11-23T22:37:00.000Z	ubuntuser		and i am getting mad trying to know how to put " = "
2007-11-23T22:38:00.000Z	ubuntuser		no juano__
2007-11-23T22:38:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	? what do you want to do ?
2007-11-23T22:38:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	insert an equals where ?
2007-11-23T22:38:00.000Z	ubuntuser		at least that does not works in bash shell at grub
2007-11-23T22:38:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	i need to chroot
2007-11-23T22:39:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	are you on a laptop ?
2007-11-23T22:39:00.000Z	ubuntuser	juano__	no
2007-11-23T22:39:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	then its the one beside the backspace... that one is the equals in english layout
2007-11-23T22:40:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	the one that has an upside down question mark
2007-11-23T22:40:00.000Z	ubuntuser		i tried a lot of combinations, i think i tried what you said , but i do not remember
2007-11-23T22:40:00.000Z	juano__	ubuntuser	thats without shift or ctrl
