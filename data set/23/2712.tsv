2008-12-01T15:48:00.000Z	ziroday	BlueEraser1	but first go to the sound control and make sure PCM is up
2008-12-01T15:50:00.000Z	BlueEraser1	ziroday	do you mean sound preferences?
2008-12-01T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	BlueEraser1	yep
2008-12-01T15:51:00.000Z	BlueEraser1	ziroday	where sould the PCM be up, under which category?
2008-12-01T15:52:00.000Z	ziroday	BlueEraser1	sorry, you went to the panel and right clicked on the volume control there right? It will open a window with a bunch of sliders one of those is labeled with PCM
