2005-12-07T12:56:00.000Z	Maniqui		i will be here soon again
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Maniqui		thanks Fujitsu, for help me installing FF 1.5
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Maniqui		hi. yesterday I has been helped to install FF 1.5 in my fresh Ubuntu. I'm very newbie to Ubuntu and Linux.
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Maniqui		I have installed it manually.
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Maniqui		Now, I didnt understand why I needed to install it in a "hard" way
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Maniqui		and not simple by using Synaptic
2005-12-07T12:58:00.000Z	Maniqui		someone have given me an explanation, but I think I didnt understood it.
2005-12-07T12:59:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 FF 1.5 isn't packaged yet.
2005-12-07T12:59:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 the 1.5 package in the unstable ubuntu version uninstalls the english language translation of Ubuntu, which leaves half of the apps running with all buttons and menus saying [] [] [] [] [] [] [[] ] []  instead of anything meaningful
2005-12-07T13:00:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 In Ubuntu, when something is released, they package it up and make sure it works.  After about 6 months, they freeze everything they have working and make a release of Ubuntu; at this point they can pretty much guarantee the system works
2005-12-07T13:00:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 so, that release of ubuntu gets only minor fixes for bugs that break shit, until 6 more months go by, and all the new shit gets rolled back out in another release.
2005-12-07T13:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 your choices are to move to Dapper for FF1.5, in which case you're likely to suddenly find that X doesn't start and you can't log in; or wait until April and have a whole slew of new shininess that will just work
2005-12-07T13:02:00.000Z	Maniqui	bluefoxicy	I think I dont get it yet... I can make my head around what you are explaining. Do you mean that FF 1.5, shouldnt work fine in Ubuntu 5.10?
2005-12-07T13:02:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	Afirmative.
2005-12-07T13:03:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 It's stable, it's just not integrated with the current system yet.
2005-12-07T13:04:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 In most Linux distributions, the idea of updating programs as they come out is left behind; instead, the different programs are tried out and worked together until we're sure they all work, then a new verrsion of the distro is released.
2005-12-07T13:04:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 this prevents things like updating libpng on a "Stable" system one day and finding that Firefox, Gnome, Gaim, and Gimp all suddenly crash constantly.
2005-12-07T13:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 yeah
2005-12-07T13:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 it depends on how often your distro releases.
2005-12-07T13:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Maniqui	 you'll figure it out after running for a while
