2008-02-21T01:44:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	adduser or addgroup ?
2008-02-21T01:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	adduser:  if you append a group name, the user will get added to the group
2008-02-21T01:45:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	Ok just that I thought he was looking to get his existing user in the group
2008-02-21T01:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	yup he was
2008-02-21T01:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	yes
2008-02-21T01:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	a nice util debian provides.
2008-02-21T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	you'll find it in    gconf-editor (run from the terminal)  , look for storage in the left pane
2008-02-21T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	/system/storage that is
2008-02-21T08:43:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	Ahh no direct way then eh? That's kinda dumb that they DIDN'T tell the user that it needs to NOT be a full path and then not allow one to back out gracefully
2008-02-21T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	been bit by that myself
2008-02-21T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	it will be under /system/storage/_org_fredesktop -etc
2008-02-21T08:44:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	I see default options for various file sysytems
2008-02-21T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	arg, /system/storage/volumes/_org etc that is
2008-02-21T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	you can do   gconftool --recursive-unset /system/storage/volumes , that will unset all your custom mounting stuff, and then you can redo
2008-02-21T08:48:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	THAT didn't do it EITHER... weird.
2008-02-21T08:49:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	I mean I know you're telling me the right thing for what I am speaking of: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-mount/+bug/107668
2008-02-21T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	that is very strange, that's how the custom mounting stuff gets done
2008-02-21T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	are you running gconf-editor as root?
2008-02-21T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	gconf controls your custom settings
2008-02-21T08:51:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	Ok. And I found it and changed it and testing now
2008-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	thank you thank you
2008-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Jouva	you would have found it, you had the bug report.
2008-02-21T08:55:00.000Z	Jouva	nickrud	True but it's sometimes easier for me to talk to somebody, even if they don't end up being the one that helps directly. Sometimes I need to ask somebody a question before my brain kicks in ;)
