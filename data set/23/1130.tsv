2010-11-26T08:35:00.000Z	phil__		im back
2010-11-26T08:35:00.000Z	phil__		<pietro10>, i couldnt find the additional drivers
2010-11-26T08:37:00.000Z	phil__		played world of warcraft on XP, was fine + good graphic settings and performance
2010-11-26T08:37:00.000Z	phil__		but now im on ubuntu its bad
2010-11-26T08:37:00.000Z	phil__		lower framerate
2010-11-26T08:38:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	I don't know if the -opengl option used for warcraft3.exe applies to worldofwarcraft, care to try?
2010-11-26T08:43:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Did you explicitly specify run with opengl? If not wine is still interpretting each directx call into opengl..
2010-11-26T08:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	I'm wondering regarding WoW.. how are you launching it? (Supposedly when running in openGL mode it's supposed to give very good performance...)
2010-11-26T08:47:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	I'm doubting it, unless it has an explicit rule for wow.exe
2010-11-26T08:47:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Please try this.. Open a terminal, 'cd' into your wow directory and run wow with "wine wow.exe -opengl"
2010-11-26T08:48:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	... too confusing?
2010-11-26T08:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20549    Please read the HOWTO below under Configuring
2010-11-26T08:51:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	... use the menu editor with a right click on the application button..
2010-11-26T08:54:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Okay.. can you open an "Explorer" window atleast and goto the folder WOW is installed at?
2010-11-26T08:55:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	 Linux terms gets you lost.. windows terms don't make sense either.. which one are you from x.x
2010-11-26T08:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	 (This.. is going to be a challenge), Please browse to the folder where wow is and look for the folder known as "WTF" and the file known as "Config.wtf"
2010-11-26T08:58:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Please see if there is a line that looks like (SET gxApi "opengl") without the brackets.
2010-11-26T08:58:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Ah yes.. so it's already set to opengl x.x, how about max fps?
2010-11-26T08:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Please drop that to 20 to 30 fps (25 should be very good for most already)
2010-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Too many details for me to go through.. really.. please read the detailed HOWTO at appDB.
2010-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Why is 30 fps bad?
2010-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	Can you see more than that with your own eyes?
2010-11-26T09:01:00.000Z	Diamondcite	phil__	*moves to PM*
