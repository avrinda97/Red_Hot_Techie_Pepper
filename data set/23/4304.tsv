2007-10-12T05:43:00.000Z	mahone		I need an advice on softwares for Ubuntu...
2007-10-12T05:43:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	ask your question
2007-10-12T05:17:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	what is the problem?
2007-10-12T05:18:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	don't paste here
2007-10-12T05:19:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	ok then
2007-10-12T05:19:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	i thought you're pasting the whole fstab! (we get that here alot)
2007-10-12T05:26:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	can you check if your swap is mounted? sudo cat /proc/swaps
2007-10-12T05:27:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	thats ok
2007-10-12T05:27:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-10-12T05:28:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	how big is your swap file and how much ram do you have
2007-10-12T05:28:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	increase your swap to 4GB
2007-10-12T05:29:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	for hibernate you need more swap than RAM
2007-10-12T05:29:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	it stores the RAM and the information to resume
2007-10-12T05:29:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	second thing, you told me that UUID is not working with swap
2007-10-12T05:32:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	back to you, you have to change the resume partition in menu.lst under /boot/grub to match your current swap partion
2007-10-12T05:34:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	yes
2007-10-12T05:34:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	maybe you're not specifying the right UUID's
2007-10-12T05:37:00.000Z	mahone	heguru	do you know what could the problem be?
2007-10-12T05:38:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	well unless I try to troubleshoot it with you, I don't think i would know
2007-10-12T05:39:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	though you can do something like that, but resume (from hibernate) only works if swap is on a partition and not a file
2007-10-12T05:43:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	guarddog if you know firewall and iptables and want greater control
2007-10-12T05:44:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	firestarter if you just need basic personal firewall
2007-10-12T05:45:00.000Z	heguru	mahone	you can use amanda, but its cli based
