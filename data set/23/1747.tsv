2009-12-12T21:18:00.000Z	edl2203		hi people. I am using the karmic koala version of ubuntu, i have got sound on my acer laptop but the mic isnt working, it used to work in 9.04 version,  my audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 04). please help.
2009-12-12T21:19:00.000Z	edl2203		could it be a bug?
2009-12-12T21:19:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	what are you using to record or monitor that mic input?  I have an acer laptop with 9.10 on it as well, never tried the mic
2009-12-12T21:22:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	please test your mic
2009-12-12T21:23:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	trying to think if I have an app that uses microphones
2009-12-12T21:23:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	I have skype, but I haven't got my account password handy so I've never tried it
2009-12-12T21:24:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	put a fake email for a new account, its fast
2009-12-12T21:25:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	put a fake email for a new account, its fast
2009-12-12T21:30:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	trying to make a new account, but it's rejecting all the passwords I try.  There's got to be another app that we can use to test audio.
2009-12-12T21:31:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	let me think
2009-12-12T21:32:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	Did you try your sound recorder?
2009-12-12T21:32:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	as an aside, I think skype is broken- this new account signup is rejecting every password I give it, easy ones that it probably should reject, as well as good ones that it certainly shouldn't
2009-12-12T21:33:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	Go Apps, multimedia, sound recorder
2009-12-12T21:33:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	yup, worked perfectly, no config change required
2009-12-12T21:34:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	I saw a rather long and gnarly howto for setting up skype audio on ubuntu when I first installed skype...  but I can't find the link to it now.
2009-12-12T21:35:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	from what I saw, it looked like all the config work was within skype, almost like all of skype's default audio settings were wrong for use in karmic
2009-12-12T21:36:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	that would help a lot
2009-12-12T21:36:00.000Z	Snossages	edl2203	give it some googling, I bet it'll turn up
2009-12-12T21:37:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	yeah Ive been doing that, ill keep trying
2009-12-12T21:38:00.000Z	edl2203	Snossages	thanks man
