2005-05-20T13:17:00.000Z	ram_einstein		ah! my interent connection is now up on Ubuntu
2005-05-20T13:18:00.000Z	ram_einstein		how do I mount another Linux disk the safe way?
2005-05-20T13:18:00.000Z	ram_einstein		:) IIIEars
2005-05-20T13:19:00.000Z	ram_einstein		I know how to edit fstab but I don't want to...
2005-05-20T13:19:00.000Z	ram_einstein		I don't want to screw anything up
2005-05-20T13:20:00.000Z	ram_einstein		mount /dev/hda0 will do?
2005-05-20T13:20:00.000Z	ram_einstein		it's a Fedora core 3 disk
2005-05-20T13:20:00.000Z	ram_einstein		with lvm
2005-05-20T13:20:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	you need to access the LVM device
2005-05-20T13:21:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	something like /dev/mapper/Volume00-LogVol00
2005-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	`sudo lvm lvs`  should give you a good idea
2005-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	np
2005-05-20T13:27:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	yeah, I ran Red Hat since 7.1 and all the way through to FC3 until I screwed up my LVM a couple days ago by accidentally running fsck on my mounted / filesystem.
2005-05-20T13:28:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	I meant to run it on a Neuros music player connected via USB, but I was tired and screwed up.
2005-05-20T13:29:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	I enjoyed FC3 while I ran it, too. But I'm digging Ubuntu
2005-05-20T13:29:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	this is more than a USB stick
2005-05-20T13:30:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	It's a Digital Audio Computer that talk USB Storage
2005-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	unmount /dev/hda2 and remount the LVM devices
2005-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	FC3 is prettier.
2005-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	but looks aren't everything.
2005-05-20T13:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	type mount
2005-05-20T13:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	with no parameters
2005-05-20T13:43:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	ram_einstein	yeah
