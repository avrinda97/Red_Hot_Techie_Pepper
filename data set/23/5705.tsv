2011-06-11T19:05:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I can't get my new monitor to work right.  I'm only getting 1368x768, and I should be able to get 1440x900.  I'm running LXDE.  The max resolution my preferences --> monitor settings gives me is the 1368x768.  I've done a sudo dpkg reconfigure x-server.org, messed with xrandr, but neither worked.  I've also edited xorg.conf, but the file was a bit sparse to begin with so I'm wondering if that's not the preferred method anymore.
2011-06-11T19:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 whats your video chipset?
2011-06-11T19:08:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430] (rev a2)
2011-06-11T19:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 you did install the nvidia drivers? using that addational-drivers tool, or 'jockey-gtk' ?
2011-06-11T19:10:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	I think I did back when I installed lucid in the first place.  It was (if I remember right) one of those proprietary drivers you have the option of using
2011-06-11T19:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 reinsatll them,. it could be they are some how broken, or dident upgrade
2011-06-23T20:03:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	nvidia Ibelieve
2011-06-23T20:03:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	things worked until an update yesterday
2011-06-23T20:09:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	everything I'm finding on setting up nvidia and so forth explains how to do it from the GUI.
2011-09-17T15:25:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	where are those stored, /home/me/.wine ?
2011-09-17T15:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 .wine for the actal stuff. and the icons come from some other dir. .config/apps   or somthing like that
2011-09-17T15:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	is there a /usr/bin/wine binary?
2011-09-17T15:30:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	sudo dpkg -r wine  ?
2011-09-17T15:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 if you remove a binary there still may be a cache record of it  in things like wich and so forth. if  you are really worried about it.. you could logout/back in or reboot.
2011-09-17T15:39:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	there were all sorts of packages left though.  I did a dpkg -r or --purge on all of them.  Was that the right way to do it?
2011-09-17T15:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 remove wine package, then perhaps sudo apt-get autoremove should get anything left over.
2011-10-25T05:30:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	you ever run into not being able to log into the gui, but terminal and ssh are fine?  I'm getting (and still searching the web for the terms) "Unregistered Authentication for session /org/freedesktop....." and another line that I thought was interesting containing "user ingroup nopasswdlogin".  I'm also looking through today's channel logs as I was in and pasted the exact errors then.  Box is not on a netowrk
2011-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 not seen that issue.
2012-07-13T18:32:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	Aha...
2012-10-25T17:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 nmap has the featurrs.
2012-10-25T18:04:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	you think even if the thing is on a different subnet?
2012-11-28T09:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	craigbass1976	 hp or brother is what i prefer
2012-11-28T09:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976	dr_willis	the mfc by brother always seems to work for me too (although pdf printing over a network is slow for some reason) but he wants okidata.
