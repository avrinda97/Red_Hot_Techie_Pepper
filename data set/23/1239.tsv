2010-06-22T20:56:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	you might have stumble into a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-appmenu/+bug/594877
2010-06-22T20:56:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	I have not done anything today , so how i got the bug from nowhere ? :(
2010-06-22T20:57:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	that's why it's called a bug: ie, unwanted behavior :(
2010-06-22T20:58:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	and it can come all suddenly and from nowhere ? !! !! Ok. I am going to try uninstalling appmenu gtk as said in the launchpad page
2010-06-22T20:59:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	Somehting changed somewhere but it might not be your fault...
2010-06-22T21:00:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	I cannot use SCIM and parcellite. They both appear on the tray but if i click they kill themselves and restart themselves (!!) .. I also tried killing scim from the task manager many times. Every time i kill it , it restarts.. A VIRUS , it behaves like A VIRUS.
2010-06-22T21:01:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	task manager = system monitor. Sorry, i am new to buntu from windows and i am not used to the naming system ;-)
2010-06-22T21:02:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	and you probably need SCIM
2010-06-22T21:02:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	I have scim installed. TO type in tamil, hindi, telugu... It has been working for a week (i installed scim a week ago)
2010-06-22T21:03:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	do you know why scim acts like a virus? every time i kill scim from sys monitor, It just restarts itself.. I tried right click > kill , right click > kill over seventy times :P
2010-06-22T21:04:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	because it is restarted by the system. Something is probably depending on it
2010-06-22T21:06:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	thanks for replying......! B-)
2010-06-22T21:11:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	it's not actually "killed"... it's probably crashing
2010-06-22T21:12:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	even if i "Kill" from system monitor, It restarts ;-)
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	yeah, like I said: something is restarting it because, as a user you probalby have something depending on it.
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	you = ubuntu ?
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	Too much of hassles for a complete beginner like i am.
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	ve2dmn	Lalitha	me == everything :)
2010-06-22T21:14:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	;-)
2010-06-22T21:17:00.000Z	Lalitha	ve2dmn	thanks to you too .
