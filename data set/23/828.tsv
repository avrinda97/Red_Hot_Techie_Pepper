2011-10-17T18:15:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	Ok, with my network cable in?
2011-10-17T18:16:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	are you trying to connect with ethernet or wireless?

2011-10-17T18:16:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	with earthnet
2011-10-17T18:16:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	then with it plugged in
2011-10-17T18:16:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	ethernet
2011-10-17T18:16:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	ok brb
2011-10-17T18:17:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	it doesn't really matter, you can just copy paste the output in pastebin instead of taking pictures and uploading to imgurl
2011-10-17T18:36:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	It gives gzip: stdin: decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored
2011-10-17T18:37:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	tar -xvf didn't work ?
2011-10-17T18:38:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	tar -xzvf gave me that
2011-10-17T18:38:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	once you do the gunzip and get tar file, just do tar -xvf and see if that works
2011-10-17T18:39:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	Same error. Child returned stats 2
2011-10-17T18:39:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	It is broken?
2011-10-17T18:40:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	no, are you sure you are doing -xvf and not -xzf
2011-10-17T18:40:00.000Z	sileni	bhavesh	I'm able to untar it fine on my computer
2011-10-17T18:41:00.000Z	bhavesh	sileni	Even if I double click it return child returned status 2, maybe this one? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1677122&page=3
