2008-10-03T10:21:00.000Z	insta		anyone have suggestions for how i can track why my I/O wait is so high?
2008-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	i/o on the hard drive'll be something you can look at with hdparm.
2008-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	insta	jamesish	i'm pretty sure it's harddrive-related actually, because my system is running on a compact flashcard that's in PIO mode.  however, it happens while streaming a movie over my network ... so ...
2008-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	insta		i'm trying to see if mplayer is thinking it will outsmart me by caching the movie
2008-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	you said it was i/o related. Is it that or your network, then? What made you think i/o? Just a guess? guesses are okay, I'm just trying to make sure I understand.
2008-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	insta		i've only ever seen "wait" be high in top when it was waiting on I/O
2008-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	jamesish		inar
2008-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	read man top.
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	insta		aw, that's a pretty official rtfm :(
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	it tells you what all the WAIT and whatnot mean. Either that or man ps.
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	insta		ok, and it says it's I/O
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	insta		so it's either network latency or disk latency, and i'd like to know how to tell which one
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	I don't tell *everyone*to read man pages. Only people who're sounding like they already have some undersatnding and are interested ;
2008-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	they're dense information, and really awesome.
2008-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	insta	jamesish	i know, i was just pretty sure of myself with it
2008-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	think of man pages as secret unix knowledge going back forty, fifty years. They're the awesome.
2008-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	insta		i use man a lot
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	insta		heh
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	insta		actually, in my terminal right now, 3 of my 4 tabs are manpages
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	okay, you can either benchmark your network or your latency. BUt here's a freebie: if you have solid state storage, and you're streaming a movie over the network, it's almost certainly network.
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	insta		generally, you'd think so, but solid state != fast in this case :(
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	insta		solid state in this context just means no moving parts
2008-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	jamesish	insta	try rsyncing a file with the --progress flag, that'll help.
