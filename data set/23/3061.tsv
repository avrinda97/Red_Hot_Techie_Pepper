2008-08-12T09:31:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	are you sure ssh server is running on the remote machine?
2008-08-12T09:31:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	 of coursed, i can connect from windows xp
2008-08-12T09:33:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	what is the command you are using specifically of course omitting ip addresses, etc.  i use ssh all the time, i may be able to help
2008-08-12T09:34:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	ssh usernam239@mydomain.com
2008-08-12T09:37:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	when you type that and hit enter, you then immediately get the public key/password error without anything else in between?
2008-08-12T09:37:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	Permission denied (publickey,password).
2008-08-12T09:39:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	??  harisund ??
2008-08-12T09:39:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	did you previously exchange keys between the computer you are trying to run the ssh client from and the server?
2008-08-12T09:40:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	no, how to do that?
2008-08-12T09:40:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	with putty i never exchanged anything
2008-08-12T09:41:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	the ssh server, I assume is running linux, correct?
2008-08-12T09:41:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	yes linux
2008-08-12T09:42:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	i deleted already , doesnt help
2008-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	is there another user account on the server you can attempt to connect to.  like root maybe?
2008-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	nope its shared hosting
2008-08-12T09:45:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	just to see if it is the computer on your end, could you su to another account on your computer and see if you can log into the server from it?
2008-08-12T09:47:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	doesnt work
2008-08-12T09:49:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	that's a weird problem.  to make a key on your end type $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
2008-08-12T09:49:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	i can't imagine how but possibly that could make a difference
2008-08-12T09:51:00.000Z	php6th	nate__	doesnt work
2008-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	nate__	php6th	sorry, dude, that's not an error I have ever encountered.  i admit i'm stumped.  i'll give it some more thought though
