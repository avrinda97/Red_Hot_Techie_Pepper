2009-10-04T04:13:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	use mount
2009-10-04T04:36:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	do live cd's even have uids or gids?
2009-10-04T04:22:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	use mount
2009-10-04T04:22:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	insufficient i have mounted the windows partition twice now it saysa the fuilesd are read only
2009-10-04T04:30:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	is your windows partition NTFS or FAT?
2009-10-04T04:31:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	i think ntfs
2009-10-04T04:31:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	mouting with the ntfs option worked anyway
2009-10-04T04:32:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	unmount your windows fpartition and mount it again specifying that it should be writable
2009-10-04T04:32:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	whats the tag for that?
2009-10-04T04:32:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	but you need to know if it is FAT or NTFS first
2009-10-04T04:33:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	what do i add to the mount command to make it writeable?
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	mount /dev/sd?? ~/mountpoint -o uid=yourUID,gid=yourGID,umask=0007
2009-10-04T04:37:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	remember that windows doesnt have UIDs and GIDs
2009-10-04T04:38:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	yes this i know i just havent used a live cd in sooooo long like 3 years opr so

2009-10-04T04:39:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	Live CDs are fully featured
2009-10-04T04:39:00.000Z	yosh1	Mka	how do i figure out my uid and gid?
2009-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	Mka	yosh1	type "id"
