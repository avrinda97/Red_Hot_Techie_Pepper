2011-02-21T07:39:00.000Z	Gartral		that too.. Linux is based on Unix directly, Mac is based off of Cocoa/BSD... BSD is only VERY loosly based on unix.. with many many many other changes.

2011-02-21T07:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	linux isn't based on unix, or deriving anything from it
2011-02-21T07:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	the only thing they really all have in common is that they can pass a test suite
2011-02-21T07:41:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	tell the other guy that, I was telling him what he needed for getting MacOSX apps running under linux.
2011-02-21T07:46:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	not even on fn+arrows or other keys?
2011-02-21T07:46:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	no fn keys either
2011-02-21T07:46:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	daRuffian go google the CR-48 and look at it's keyboard.
2011-02-21T07:53:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	it doesn't, it just sets new selections
2011-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	is there a way too force thr functionality i'm looking for?
2011-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	i don't know of anything that will remove packages not in a list
2011-02-21T07:56:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	oh, hey; this works, dpkg --get-selections > selections, dpkg --clear-selections, dpkg --set-selections < selections
2011-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	careful with dpkg --clear-selections ;]
2011-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	and in context too the clone file i have?
2011-02-21T07:58:00.000Z	ohsix	Gartral	forget the !clone message, just do it with dpkg, using aptitude is an attempt to skip packages that were automatically installed in the list
2011-02-21T07:58:00.000Z	Gartral	ohsix	I don't understand, do I use the clone file i have? how does this new method work?
