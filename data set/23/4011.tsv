2008-06-15T23:02:00.000Z	Ward1983	LimCore	QUILz i read that some time ago, or is this a other TOR ?
2008-06-15T23:02:00.000Z	LimCore	Ward1983	using TOR is not the same as RUNNING a tor SERVER
2008-06-15T23:03:00.000Z	Ward1983	LimCore	aha, i thought one should allways do both
2008-06-15T23:03:00.000Z	Ward1983	LimCore	but then again i dont do any illegal crap
2008-06-15T23:03:00.000Z	Ward1983	LimCore	so i dont need services like TOR
2008-06-15T23:03:00.000Z	LimCore	Ward1983	tor is for stoping bad guys from spying on you
2008-06-15T23:04:00.000Z	LimCore	Ward1983	you are seriously missinformed about stuff

2008-06-15T23:05:00.000Z	Ward1983	LimCore	it appeared as a serious article to me
2008-06-15T23:06:00.000Z	LimCore	Ward1983	if this articla statted that by using TOR you allow others to do illegal activities from your computer, as you written a moment ago, then it is totall nonsense
