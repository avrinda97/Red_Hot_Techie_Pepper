2005-05-31T12:47:00.000Z	teknoprep		why do you guys think that.. ubuntu plays WoW like shit in Point2Play/cedega, but gentoo plays its flaylessly around 60fps
2005-05-31T12:47:00.000Z	teknoprep		i think ubuntu repo's are built really poorly
2005-05-31T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teknoprep	 perhaps kernel version/differances.
2005-05-31T12:48:00.000Z	teknoprep	Dr_Willis	i had both 2.6.8 on both gentoo and ubuntu
2005-05-31T12:48:00.000Z	teknoprep	Dr_Willis	gentoo blows it out of the water.. and it takes a non moron to work with gentoo
2005-05-31T12:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teknoprep	 im just been trying to get Guildwars working with Cedega. :P no luck yet however

2005-05-31T12:51:00.000Z	teknoprep	Dr_Willis	its becuase the repo's are no good... i prefer waiting and getting it compiled myself then getting someone else's crap compile
2005-05-31T12:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teknoprep	 over all ive have had very few issues with ubuntu at all.
2005-05-31T12:53:00.000Z	teknoprep	Dr_Willis	i also have a problem with openGL just being slow in general with the xorg-driver-ati... gentoo did a much better, easier, and faster running install of ati-drivers
