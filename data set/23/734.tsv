2011-07-31T02:01:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	you beat me to it ):
2011-07-31T02:01:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	was close :)
2011-08-05T21:53:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	yes
2011-08-16T21:15:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	iszak not true, I run 11.04 and it installed fine
2011-08-16T21:16:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Looking the PPA there's 6.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1~mfs1 and 6.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1~mfs1
2011-08-16T21:16:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	iszak : though apparently it isn't there anymore....
2011-08-16T21:17:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	I don't see 11.04 anything there, actually
2011-08-16T21:17:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	neither do I but I can guarantee you it was there a few days ago
2011-08-16T21:20:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Strange that all the Natty packages would disappear. 6.0 beta 5 for 11.04 is in mozillateam/firefox-next
2011-08-30T09:34:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	He wants tomcat and openssh-server as well, tasksel just gave him an easy way to select and install all of them rather than my list of three commands and half a dozen packages
2011-08-30T09:34:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	I was just mentioning that apt-get handles tasks just as well as tasksel
2011-08-30T09:35:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Doesn't tasksel just download the packages using apt-get or aptitude anyway and just gives an easy way of selecting a specific group of packages?
2011-08-30T09:36:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	that's right, and apt-get does the same when you use "^" at the end
2011-09-01T22:25:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	beniwtv : actually half-right : there's also a daemon started on boot
2011-09-01T22:26:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	I guess the daemon is there to start pulseaudio for the user?
2011-09-01T22:28:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	beniwtv : it seems to depend on configuration, pulseaudio can run either on a system level or on a user level
2011-09-15T21:40:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	what do you need exactly ? a web-based interface for system administration ?
2011-09-15T21:41:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Actually, nevermind. I don't really need one, but it might've been useful, I'll just do things manually.
2011-09-15T21:42:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	ok. I was just wondering what you were looking for exactly. Such tools exist (but might cause some security issues)
2011-09-15T21:42:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Yes, I know, but it's only a server running on a local VM for some testing purposes (:
2011-09-15T21:43:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	then you might want to have a look at webmin
2011-09-15T21:43:00.000Z	Polah	glebihan	Is it in the repos?
2011-09-15T21:44:00.000Z	glebihan	Polah	apparently not...
