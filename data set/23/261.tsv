2012-02-15T16:41:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	switching to xfce won't make the power management issue go away, its a regression in the kernel (fixed in 3.2.5 though)
2012-02-15T16:42:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	Oh! I see. What should I do then? :-|
2012-02-15T16:42:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	wait for precise to be released in april
2012-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	running a different kernel means we can't support you here if anything goes wrong
2012-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	terminhell Damn. Am so confused. :-( What to do then?
2012-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	wait for 12.04 or try the ppa (knowing the risks)
2012-02-15T16:46:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	Some alpha version (not sure about the term) is available on net I believe? Shall I try it ?
2012-02-15T16:46:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	of 12.04 i mean
2012-02-15T16:46:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	up to you. its not stable so there are risks
2012-02-15T16:47:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	Risk as in?
2012-02-15T16:47:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	stuff may break, do you know what alpha means?
2012-02-15T16:48:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	I believe, they keep making changes, fixing bugs, till it comes very stable for public consumption
2012-02-15T16:49:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	alpha usually involves implementing features, beta is usually bug-fixing and then you get the rc and actual release (by then it is safe to use)
2012-02-15T16:51:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	Oh. Thanks for info.
2012-02-15T16:51:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	Why the issue is there though? It is all about kernel?
2012-02-15T16:52:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	yes, it is a regression in the kernel
2012-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	How can I check if am running on latest version of kernel or not
2012-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	uname -a
2012-02-15T16:58:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	terminhell 3.0.0-15-generic-pae #26-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 20 17:07:31 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
2012-02-15T16:59:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	there is an update, but you won't get 3.2.5 or higher on 11.10 unless you deliberately install it
2012-02-15T17:00:00.000Z	sideev	auronandace	And how can i install it?
2012-02-15T17:02:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade (that will get you the latest in the repo which is 3.0.0.16)
2012-02-15T17:06:00.000Z	auronandace	sideev	no worries :)
