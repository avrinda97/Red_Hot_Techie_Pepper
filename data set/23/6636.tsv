2006-02-26T10:02:00.000Z	weareallone		thank you thank you thank you
2006-02-26T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	weareallone	now, to make sure it works on next boot, you need to type the following at the console: echo "options snd-cs4236 isapnp=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/snd-cs4236
2006-02-26T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	weareallone	then: echo "snd-cs4236" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2006-02-26T10:10:00.000Z	weareallone	crimsun	done, do i need to reboot?
2006-02-26T10:13:00.000Z	weareallone		if i can just find a good media player on here...
2006-02-26T10:14:00.000Z	crimsun	weareallone	you don't need to reboot. Those two steps were to ensure that audio functions correctly on subsequent boots.
2006-02-26T10:14:00.000Z	weareallone		not sure if all problems are solved with sound yet
2006-02-26T10:28:00.000Z	weareallone	crimsun	i get this msg when i try to play something on totem- There were no decoders found to handle the stream, you might need to install the corresponding plugins... so far no other player works either ...rythmbox says mp3 is not streaming music
