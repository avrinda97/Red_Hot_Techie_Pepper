2009-10-23T17:46:00.000Z	trap2		I need to adjust my monitor position without using the monitor inbuilt keys ....any idea guys ?
2009-10-23T17:47:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	what is the display card you are using? I mean nvidia..
2009-10-23T17:48:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	nvidia has a software for it I know. But I am using intel inbuilt graphics card for 845GLLY
2009-10-23T17:49:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	my resolutions and refresh rates are all same and ok for both the OS
2009-10-23T17:49:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	Okay.
2009-10-23T17:50:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	But what is the actual problem you are facing?
2009-10-23T17:50:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	I generated the modeline and used it pretty well
2009-10-23T17:52:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	When I boot from linux to XP or vice versa, my display is slided and I have to use the monitor OSD buttons to place it correctly on position. But when I place it correctly for one OS I lose the position in the other OS :(
2009-10-23T17:54:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	you have to save the screen settings after you made changes  xorg
2009-10-23T17:54:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	still I am looking to solve your problem.
2009-10-23T17:56:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	 Try this command and get back to me. sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-10-23T17:58:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	 but I think It will just replace my custom modeline in file xorg.conf with the default one thats flickering
2009-10-23T17:59:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	save your screen settings to xorg.conf that's it.
2009-10-23T18:02:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	send me screen shot I will solve your problem completely
2009-10-23T18:02:00.000Z	mohan1	trap2	Everything you can do with ubuntu.
2009-10-23T18:03:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	the screen shot will capture just the screen that is displayed. It will not capture the black shifted part. It will look absolutely normal and I have tried that already
2009-10-23T18:05:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	thanks for those searches. I think I will now do some hit and trial with the vsync and hsync in the xorg.conf modeline and check will they move the postion. :) !
2009-10-23T18:06:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	you might not have such problems is you use CRT
2009-10-23T18:06:00.000Z	trap2	mohan1	sry *LCD
