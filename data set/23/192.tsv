2012-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	so i try it but it doesnt help can i just delete some partion with GRUB i just need to start windows dont need data
2012-04-08T13:31:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	Try to load windows in repair mode from the Windows installation disk. I believe your MBR is deleted so start the Repair and in the command prompt type bootrec /fixmbr and then bootrec /fixboot
2012-04-08T13:32:00.000Z	Mammodreoci		should i skip GRUB when i delete some partion on HDD ?
2012-04-08T13:32:00.000Z	slavsan		What do you mean by skipping GRUB?
2012-04-08T13:34:00.000Z	Mammodreoci		i just need to start windows to restore computer so i need to skip GRUB
2012-04-08T13:36:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	dont have instalation disk i had windows installed on PC before i bought it
2012-04-08T13:38:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	what actually happend when you tried to reinstall grub and run a grub-update?
2012-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	cant mount any sda i had ubuntu on sda4 but after restart is gone and cant mount other sda's
2012-04-08T13:43:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	Why not just install ubuntu on sda4 again?
2012-04-08T13:52:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	you dont understand me i will tell you it chronologically. I wanted to reset windows. I found VAIO assist tool to reset notebook to defeault factory settings. I save all my data and can delete all things on notebook. I click that button to reset it. Notebook is restarting, when turned off and tried to start GRUB rescue promt prevented to start windows so cant finish that operation. I  found out on Live CD that my ubuntu is
2012-04-08T13:53:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	i will install ubuntu later but need to clear windows
2012-04-08T13:54:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	my only problem is GRUB so i am asking that is it possible to skip GRUB when i delete Linux swap partion
2012-04-08T13:55:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	I'm not aware of such a possibility
2012-04-08T13:55:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	Do you want to keep Windows or want to delete it completely
2012-04-08T13:57:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	If you want to remove Windows for good just install ubunt and format all the other partitions afterwards
2012-04-08T14:05:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	had a Disconnect when u wrote something
2012-04-08T14:08:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	I don't think you can just skip GRUB. Maybe someone else might have a solution for this but I believe your Windows MBR is wiped out or something. I'm not sure what this reset actually did but it seems it f**ked up GRUB in some way. The only solution I see is to install ubuntu on sda4. If it already is on sda4 and grub loads from there try to mount sda4 and reset GRUB.
2012-04-08T14:08:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	Sorry if I'm not getting the picture here.
2012-04-08T14:09:00.000Z	Mammodreoci	slavsan	thanks a lot
2012-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	slavsan	Mammodreoci	you're welcome
