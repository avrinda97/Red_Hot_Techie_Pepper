2009-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	perhaps the w32codecs from medibuntu.org
2009-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	go to the website, no need for the dramatics
2009-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	go to the website www.medibuntu.org
2009-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	then select the w32codecs deb file to download.
2009-12-06T07:27:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	then double click it, or open with gdebi
2009-12-06T07:27:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	no cursing here
2009-12-06T07:28:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	you have been told multiple times, how to do this. Please do so and stop repeating.
2009-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	nakake	bazhang	you dont know how to explain anything, thanks for teaching me how to double click though, because that was obviously the main issue here
2009-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	bazhang	nakake	no need for the attitude. we are volunteers here.
2009-12-06T07:30:00.000Z	nakake	bazhang	you're like the volunteers at the old folks home, giving the same robotic and depressing smalltalk
