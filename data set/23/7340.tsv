2007-02-27T17:01:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	why FTP and not SFTP?
2007-02-27T17:04:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	SFTP is *way* easier to set up. and far, FAR more secure.
2007-02-27T17:06:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	why not give them accounts and encrypt their traffic?
2007-02-27T17:08:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	why would you open up such a giant security hole?
2007-02-27T17:09:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	FTP is a clear text protocol. it is highly insecure. crackers with absolutely no skills or experience can easily sniff FTP credentials.
2007-02-27T17:10:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	absolutely.
2007-02-27T17:11:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	Windows users can use PuTTY + Filezilla. OSX users Terminal.app + CyberDuck.
2007-02-27T17:11:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	FTP is a great idea. if this is 1992. ;)
2007-02-27T17:12:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	Filezilla is the (S)FTP client for Windows i'd use
2007-02-27T17:12:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	vhosts
2007-02-27T17:14:00.000Z	mneptok	addictedtothenet	and?
