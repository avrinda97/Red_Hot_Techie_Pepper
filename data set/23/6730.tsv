2006-01-18T08:08:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	I think so...
2006-01-20T10:41:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	you can get high speed cdrw in most larger towns, small cities
2006-01-20T10:42:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	not over 12x
2006-01-20T10:42:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	i swear ive seen 24x
2006-01-20T10:42:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	and im in australia ;)
2006-01-20T10:43:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	no drive burns DL at 16x yet =P
2006-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	they make them for PCI-X still...
2006-01-20T11:21:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	some workstations dont support AGP, and are u sure bout that, the newest incarnation of PCI-X supports upto 533Mhz
2006-01-20T11:22:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	wtf?  last time I looked it was 64 bit and 133 MHz only... they made PCI-E because they couldn't push a paralell bus any faster than that
2006-01-20T11:23:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	ill have a look
2006-01-20T11:23:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	PCI-X 2.0 uses a 266MHz rate and also a 533MHz rate, expands the configuration space to 4KB, adds a 16-bit bus variant and allows for 1.5V signalling
2006-01-20T11:24:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	that's hard to believe.... is it point to point as well?
2006-01-20T11:25:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	look at the wiki article for PCI its all there
2006-01-20T11:25:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	url?
2006-01-20T11:25:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	ill get it for you =)
2006-01-20T11:26:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect#Other_PCI_variants
2006-01-20T11:29:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	told ya so =P
2006-01-20T11:30:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	wow.... know of any motherboards that support such a beast? ;)
2006-01-20T11:30:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	afaik most workstation boards do... or PCI-X along with PCI-E as well
2006-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	in case u want a shiny PCI-E gfx card in ur work station =P
2006-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	psusi	nbound	why not use everything pcie though?
2006-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	nbound	psusi	legacy, or some cards havent migrated to pcie yet
