2005-10-28T14:07:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	Blocks reserved for system use (only usable by root)
2005-10-28T14:08:00.000Z	h4zn__	NiGhTHiNG	how much should i set it to
2005-10-28T14:08:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	What are you going to mount the partition as?
2005-10-28T14:10:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	If you don't know, don't set it to anything
2005-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	Yes
2005-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	People usually set it to twice the size of their RAM, though that's a gross generalization
2005-10-28T14:15:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	You create a swap partition
2005-10-28T14:15:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	And set it to a size that's twice your RAM
2005-10-28T14:16:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	Are you working your way through the installer or what?
2005-10-28T14:16:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	Then why not use the default partitioning option?
2005-10-28T14:17:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	And do you have any unpartitioned space?
2005-10-28T14:18:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	That's why it's complaining
2005-10-28T14:18:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	h4zn__	You must first create some unpartitioned space and then you can use the default installer partitioning options
