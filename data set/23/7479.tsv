2005-07-18T11:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	love to help but gotta go soon. sorry.
2005-07-18T11:34:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	thanks, you were helping me last night but I couldn't do what you suggested because I have no Internet access on Ubuntu.  I put in a different modem today hoping to solve the problem.
2005-07-18T11:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	externals are the troublefree way... if you have one.
2005-07-18T11:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	they are 'real' modems.
2005-07-18T11:35:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	yes, I know, I will have to eventually invest in one.
2005-07-18T12:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	any external modem will do fine (usually). because they do the DAC digital to analogue conversion in hardware not software.
2005-07-18T12:10:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	Do you have cable Internet or dial-up. If dial-up, what modem do you have that works with Ubuntu
2005-07-18T12:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	i have had every external modem work with linux.
2005-07-18T12:13:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	it just gets recognised.
2005-07-18T12:13:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	Yes, I am sure all externals work, I was just wondering if you or anyone has an internal modem that they've got to work with Ubuntu
2005-07-18T12:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	sorry. been some years since i've needed too.
2005-07-18T12:19:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	What external modem is best to get: serial or USB
2005-07-18T12:19:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	I would guess USB but thought I would ask.
2005-07-18T12:19:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	SERIAL!!!!!!!
2005-07-18T12:19:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	:)
2005-07-18T12:20:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	OK, Thanks :)
2005-07-18T12:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	serial's been working A1 for a million years and you arn't worried about bandwidth.
2005-07-18T12:26:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	Just to let you know, in the Ubuntu Forums I found this link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=36762&highlight=Modems which is a person with the same Intel 537EP modem as me and he has downloads and steps to install.
2005-07-18T12:26:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	nice one man. now you are the internal modem guru :0
2005-07-18T12:27:00.000Z	firebird619	gyaresu	I will let you know if it works
2005-07-18T12:27:00.000Z	gyaresu	firebird619	do. that's interesting.
