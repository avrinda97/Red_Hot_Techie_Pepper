2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		hey guys
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		what's the keyboard shortcut for switching between tabs?
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		like say in gedit when i have two files open and want to switch between them
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	depends what software you are using
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	not really
2009-09-30T16:01:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	I mean you can customise it
2009-09-30T16:01:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	how would i customize it?
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	what standards?
2009-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	I don't think we have those things round here
2009-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	i'm not sure what you mean.
2009-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	standards...
2009-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	i was just wondering if alt-c^pgup and pgdn are used in other apps
2009-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	do you think standards in user interfaces are detrimental?
2009-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	no only in GUI's
2009-09-30T16:05:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	mechadiversity is important
2009-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	so why not have the left click do a different thing in every application? say let's have it bring up the context menu in firefox, let's have it select (but not open) files in nautilus, let's have it select and open files in another file browser, and let's have it turn on the scroll tool in gvim - what do you think?
2009-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	you have the source code
2009-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	you can make it do whatever you like
2009-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	perhaps
2009-09-30T16:07:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	actually this is already supported:  let's have it select (but not open) files in nautilus, let's have it select and open files in another file browser
2009-09-30T16:08:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	ever heard of vi?
2009-09-30T16:09:00.000Z	cheater99	graingert	is that a point?
2009-09-30T16:09:00.000Z	graingert	cheater99	a point to me I think
