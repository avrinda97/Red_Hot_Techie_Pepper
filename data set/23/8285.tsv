2004-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: thank for the link, i'll see it:)
2004-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: i am french, so no pb :)
2004-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	looks like the Eagle driver is included in 2.6.
2004-11-02T13:50:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	Did you browse around the wiki on that link I sent you?
2004-11-02T13:51:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: yes.
2004-11-02T13:51:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: but like i forgot to wrote it on something, could you please regive it to me ? ^^;;
2004-11-02T13:53:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	sure.  But I found another one first.  :)
2004-11-02T13:53:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: i look at it, thanks :)
2004-11-02T13:54:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	make sure to click on the link in the third comment.
2004-11-02T13:54:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: oki, thanks :)
2004-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	Is it an ADSL modem?  Would the eagle-adsl-tools package be relevant?
2004-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: yes, mine is a adsl usb modem, and one supported by the eagle driver. in fact i remember i was forced to install it on the mandrake 10 also...
2004-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	reinstall the driver?  Why?
2004-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	That's a rather large can of worms to open...
2004-11-02T13:58:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: like i have a eagle.ko already on, but see nowhere the modem in access, i think i must install the eagle driver in complete form, so re-install it 
2004-11-02T13:59:00.000Z	bronson	Daidoji	Unless the kernel driver is really old, I doubt it...
2004-11-02T14:00:00.000Z	Daidoji	bronson	: i don't have eagleconfig nor startadsl on the system
