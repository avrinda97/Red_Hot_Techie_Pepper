2005-12-26T12:42:00.000Z	jenda		How does one mount a removable drive if it wasn't detected automatically?
2005-12-26T12:43:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	generally "sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/removable"
2005-12-26T12:44:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	k thx
2005-12-26T12:44:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	and the drive might be /dev/sda or /dev/sdb  or /dev/sdc etc.  Or it might not be loaded because you are missing a driver.  Check that you can see when you type "cat /dev/scsi/scsi"
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	no such file and directory
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	Hmm... it's not detected... but it gets power
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	what is it?
2005-12-26T12:47:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	A 40 Gig "External Drive Enclosure"
2005-12-26T12:48:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	it is probably misconfigured then.  I assume there is a harddrive in the enclosure, you should check that it is plugged in all the way, that it is set as "master" or "cable select (CS)" with the jumper on the back of the drive, and that the drive size is compatible with the enclosure.  Some don't like big drives, some don't like small drives.
2005-12-26T12:49:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	K, it's not mine - a frend wants some data from my PC, but I suppose it normally works for him...
2005-12-26T12:50:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	most "just work".
2005-12-26T12:50:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	Yeah I know. Never had this before. There are no buttons or switches on it... it's plugged.
2005-12-26T12:51:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	try a different USB port.  It is 2.5" drive?
2005-12-26T12:51:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	Desktop, and yes, it's 2.5
2005-12-26T12:52:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	if it has an external power adapter you could try using it.  not all usb ports are created equal (which is why those drives have an "optional" power supply)
2005-12-26T12:53:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	I see... I don't have an adapter. But it seems to have enough power (it stopped blinking when I plugged the power in
2005-12-26T12:54:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	it might have enough power for the usb electronics but not the drive.  It might just not be supported.
2005-12-26T12:55:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	Hmm... so I'll try switching them around a bit.
2005-12-26T13:26:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	Is there a way to install some more external HDD drivers or something of the sort?
2006-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	you could download "smart boot manager"
2006-04-23T11:59:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	what is it and how does it work?
2006-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	Falstius	jenda	it is a floppy, you put it in your drive and boot from it, then it gives you a menu to select different devices to boot from.  Simple to use.
2006-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	jenda	Falstius	perfect. Where do i get it?
