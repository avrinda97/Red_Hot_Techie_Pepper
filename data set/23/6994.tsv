2006-03-26T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	raven	please "sudo aptitude install build-essential" and try again
2006-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	raven	what are you building?
2006-03-26T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	raven	you let build-essential and its dependencies fully install?
2006-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	raven	tritium	 yes i did, i have a older version of gkrellm on my system but i would like this newer version installed
2006-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	raven	tritium	ive never had make working
2006-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	tritium	raven	is gettext installed (please run "apt-cache policy gettext")
2006-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	raven	tritium	ok
2006-03-26T12:16:00.000Z	raven	tritium	it is now
2006-03-26T12:17:00.000Z	tritium	raven	try make again
2006-03-26T12:17:00.000Z	raven	tritium	its going crazy with lots of error msgs
2006-03-26T12:18:00.000Z	raven	tritium	 everything is either error or warning
2006-03-26T12:18:00.000Z	tritium	raven	you likely don't have all the build-dependencies installed.  Why not install the ubuntu package instead?
2006-03-26T12:18:00.000Z	raven	tritium	how do i do that?
2006-03-26T12:19:00.000Z	tritium	raven	it's in the universe repository.  Enable it, and install gkrellm.
2006-03-26T12:19:00.000Z	raven	tritium	ok thank you
2006-03-26T12:19:00.000Z	tritium	raven	there are a ton of gkrellm packages too (apt-cache search gkrellm)
2008-11-19T10:18:00.000Z	tritium	raven	your laptop supports HDMI audio?  If so, which make/model?
2008-11-19T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	raven	thanks
