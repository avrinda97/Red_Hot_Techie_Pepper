2009-01-31T14:45:00.000Z	trimeta		My Windows VM has only 384MB RAM, but I only run Office...
2009-01-31T14:45:00.000Z	trimeta		(my whole system has 2GB RAM)
2009-01-31T14:46:00.000Z	trimeta		So, no advice on working with ext4 in 8.10?
2009-01-31T14:47:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	unless you are a filesystem developer   i would advise you wait until ext4 goes main stream
2009-01-31T14:47:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	but then again i still use ext2   so   pfft
2009-01-31T14:48:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	It's non-experimental in the latest kernel, and I'm edgy enough to try it for myself, though I wouldn't put it on a server yet.
2009-01-31T14:48:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	but until they release it in the distro it will be pretty unsupported
2009-01-31T14:49:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	I'm actually installing Gentoo in a separate partition, and plan on accessing my Gentoo stuff from within Ubuntu...
2009-01-31T14:49:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	so you can still mount ext4 as ext2     no ?
2009-01-31T14:50:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	I enabled extents, so it can't be mounted as ext3 anymore.
2009-01-31T14:51:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	have you tried as ext2 ?
2009-01-31T14:51:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	Yes, and I still get a "bad fs" error...maybe if I force it...
2009-01-31T14:51:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	don't break an fs just to answer my Q
2009-01-31T14:52:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	I haven't put anything on it yet, breaking it won't hurt anything.
2009-01-31T15:35:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	you have a command called "remove" ???
2009-01-31T15:36:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	rm, sorry.
2009-01-31T15:36:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	and you can pipe into "rm" ?
2009-01-31T15:37:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	Well, no, I guess not. xargs it is, then.
2009-01-31T15:37:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	i'm sorry for being such a pain.  but how about     rm `locate blah`
2009-01-31T15:38:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	Does rm's blank-separated argument list accept newlines as separators?
2009-01-31T15:40:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	good point  heh   so we have several things to overcome   the "propper" way to attack this would be     find ...   or with locate     locate hamachi | while read q ;do rm "$q" ;done
2009-01-31T15:41:00.000Z	trimeta	_2	Probably in the end, I'd do something like "locate -0 hamachi | xargs -0 | rm"
2009-01-31T15:41:00.000Z	_2	trimeta	you still can't pipe into rm
