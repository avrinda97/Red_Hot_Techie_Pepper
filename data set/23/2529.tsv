2009-02-06T22:24:00.000Z	malachai		How can I open a program through SSH? I need it to show up on the remote desktop. For example, I can tunnel to my remote PC through my phone, and I want to open a picture on the desktop
2009-02-06T22:24:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	Well, that depends... you want it to open up on the main X display? There's some security in place to make that difficult.
2009-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	malachai		ramirand: Yes, that's right.
2009-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	Just so I know I have this straight, you're dialed in from somewhere else on computer A, and you connect in to computer B, and you want to run something on computer B that will display on computer B?
2009-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	Correct again.
2009-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	Is there a user logged in to computer B?
2009-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	I can log in. I'm the administrator
2009-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	That is, someone logged in to the X display.
2009-02-06T22:27:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	 I can also log in as the current user
2009-02-06T22:27:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	Yes
2009-02-06T22:28:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	So there's an X display up and running, with a user logged in. OK. Do you know what the X display's ID is?
2009-02-06T22:28:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	I'm guessing it's :0 ?
2009-02-06T22:28:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	It's probably something like :0
2009-02-06T22:29:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	OK. If it is, then run something in the remote session, and add -display :0 to it.
2009-02-06T22:29:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	All right, that's it?
2009-02-06T22:29:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	I'm guessing that will give you an error, since security is probably turned on.
2009-02-06T22:30:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	But it's worth a try before attempting to figure out anything more difficult! :)
2009-02-06T22:31:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	I'll try it out in a second. I have to wait until the current user is ready
2009-02-06T22:31:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	As an alternative, in the ssh you can type "export DISPLAY=:0"
2009-02-06T22:31:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	Then all X programs will use that display by default, w/o specifying -display :0
2009-02-06T22:33:00.000Z	malachai	ramirand_	 Works PERFECTLY. Thanks!
2009-02-06T22:33:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	No problem. Just be careful, whatever you start shows up on the X display and is running as YOU.
2009-02-06T22:34:00.000Z	ramirand_	malachai	So, if you have the privs to wipe out a directory full of irreplaceable photos, and the person receiving the screen accidentally deletes them... well. :)
