2007-02-06T11:41:00.000Z	eidolon		hi folks.  i'm having all sorts of problems workin with Edgy Eft (6.10).  i'm following hte instructions in the add/remove applications for running the nvidia driver, but it fails to actually load anything
2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	eidolon		it specifically says "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" - which I do, and I get "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver!  be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel."
2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	eidolon		nowhere in the installer does it say waht that is.
2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	did you install the nvidia driver ?
2007-02-06T11:43:00.000Z	eidolon		Reading state information... Done
2007-02-06T11:43:00.000Z	eidolon		nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
2007-02-06T11:43:00.000Z	juano__		!wireless
2007-02-06T11:43:00.000Z	eidolon		lsmod | grep nv returned nothing
2007-02-06T11:44:00.000Z	eidolon		if i do 'sudo modprobe nvidia', it says "Not loading nvidia module; not used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2007-02-06T11:44:00.000Z	eidolon	Quintin	yes, i got that.  but a) the installer should have done that from synaptic (or whatever add/remove programs is) or commented on it in the release notes.
2007-02-06T11:44:00.000Z	eidolon		i'm running a stock 6.10 install.
2007-02-06T11:45:00.000Z	eidolon		the 'Driver' in xorg.conf is 'nv'
2007-02-06T11:45:00.000Z	eidolon		should it be 'nvidia' ?
2007-02-06T11:46:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	yes, that is if you want 3d rendering
2007-02-06T11:46:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	better graphics for games
2007-02-06T11:46:00.000Z	eidolon		i want any performance at all.  right now it's terrible :)
2007-02-06T11:46:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	etc.
2007-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	eidolon		AAARGGHGHHHH
2007-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	eidolon		now when i do 'sudo nvidia-glx-config enable' it says "Your x configuration has been altered"
2007-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	after making the change you need to restart X
2007-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	eidolon		do i need to run this installer anymore?
2007-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	eidolon		or did i just do what the installer would have done anyway?
2007-02-06T11:48:00.000Z	juano__	eidolon	after changing it to nvidia , hit ctrl + alt + backspace to restart X
