2009-06-16T05:41:00.000Z	Dimitree		Is there a difference for the Software Resources when the server is selected ? "Main Server" and Local country server for example ?
2009-06-16T05:42:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	no
2009-06-16T05:42:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	why then when selecting "main server" new updates are being found which are not found when using "local" server ?
2009-06-16T05:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	what 'local' server are you referring to?
2009-06-16T05:44:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	well at default my server is set to "Server for Bulgaria" and when i check for updates it found updates and installed them, but when i switch to "Main server" it finds even more updates
2009-06-16T05:45:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	possibly the mirror for bulgaria hasn't updated yet
2009-06-16T05:45:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	so if i wait i will have the same result like with the main server ?
2009-06-16T05:47:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	it should yes.
2009-06-16T05:47:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	ok thank you
2009-07-26T04:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	leave out the . in the launcher
2009-07-26T04:34:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	it doesn't start that way eather :(
2009-07-26T04:35:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	have only 1 / seperating lkeyholtv
2009-07-26T04:35:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	yes only one / and it doesn't start, but it starts when i go to the folder in terminal and do ./lkeyholetv command
2009-07-26T04:38:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	check the path again. any spelling/case errors?
2009-07-26T04:39:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	no i used the Browse button to locate the file maby thats why ?
2009-07-26T04:39:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	/home/t0m0rr0w/Desktop/KeyHoleTV/lkeyholetv
2009-07-26T04:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	is the file executable?
2009-07-26T04:41:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	yes that option is selected in properties
2009-07-26T04:41:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	allow executing file as programm
2009-07-26T04:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Dimitree	if the spelling/case is correct i honestly don't know.
2009-07-26T04:43:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	ok thanks anyway
2009-07-26T04:48:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	i also tryed the "Make Link" option, when the link file is in the same folder as the app, the app starts, but when i move it elsewhere it doesn't o-o
2009-07-26T04:53:00.000Z	Dimitree	bastidrazor	only for information i added the executable to /usr/bin/install -c lkeyholetv /usr/local/bin  and cp -r .KeyHoleTV  /usr/local/bin and now the shortcut works systemwide :) ^_^
