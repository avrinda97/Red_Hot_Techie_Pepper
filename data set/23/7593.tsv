2005-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	GazaM		Anyone here know how to make gtk1 apps look nicer, I'm using dvd::rip and looking at it is crap
2005-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	port it to gtk2
2005-06-18T12:17:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	then you'll have to deal, unfortauntely
2005-06-18T12:17:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	or use thoggen, which is awesome
2005-06-18T12:19:00.000Z	GazaM	bob2	thoggen seems to use gstreamer, which means that I shouldn't really need a thoggen lib, just the gstreamer plugin
2005-06-18T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	yes, I said theora, tho
2005-06-18T12:21:00.000Z	GazaM	bob2	nice recomendation, have you used it a lot?
2005-06-18T12:21:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	yes
2005-06-18T12:23:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	gstreamer does all the encoding, thoggen is just a simple gui wrapper for it
2005-06-19T16:41:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	you just join it and it's created if it doesn't exist
2005-06-19T16:42:00.000Z	GazaM	bob2	what about if I leave, will the channel then be deleted aswell?
2005-06-19T16:42:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	yes
2005-06-19T16:43:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	/mode #channelname +s
2005-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	sudo dpkg -P packagename
2005-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	or use synaptic or aptitude or apt-get or ...
2005-06-20T08:31:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	there are multiple "issues"
2005-06-20T08:31:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	driver support can't be magically improved
2005-06-20T08:31:00.000Z	GazaM	bob2	I didn't say magically
2005-06-20T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	GazaM	dmix will hopefully work by default n breezy
