2009-10-25T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	it's poisition in distro watch means nothing, I was just going to make you aware of the correct support channels for mint so you got the right advice
2009-10-25T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	how does the most downloadable distro position make it the best - it just means it's had the most downloads, but this isn't really for #ubuntu
2011-04-08T12:23:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	what are you talking about ?

2011-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	it's likley it's something simple like a cable problem if other machines are working, this one did work but is no longer working
2011-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	if it has an IP - it's probably running off the lease file
2011-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	it can't find it because of the DNS query I've just said
2011-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	you need to get it back on the network
2011-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	no

2011-06-30T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	ok, so changing /etc/hosts won't do anything
2011-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	incoming ?
2011-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	that's probably routing - contact your network admin
2011-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	then you should know how to debug this
2011-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	ok - then we don't need a running commentary in this channel please.
2011-06-30T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	odix	ok - you're asking for network help - we don't support that here
