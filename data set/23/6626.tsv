2009-03-22T06:14:00.000Z	eax		Hi :) I just installed Jaunty (love it! Apci works for me now :D ) But I managed to f*ck up my xp partition (human error) How do I add it to GRUB again? :)
2009-03-22T06:16:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	> !grub
2009-03-22T06:17:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	I didn't loose it after installing windows, I deleted XP by accident but managed to save it ( I think) :S
2009-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	if u follow that guide it will fix grub for you
2009-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	 ahh your partition sty
2009-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	sty?
2009-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	sRy*
2009-03-22T06:19:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	have a look at testdisk
2009-03-22T06:19:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	ooh okay ;) Thanks :) I'm not even certain that I actually fixed it :S
2009-03-22T06:19:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	I actually did it throug testdisk ;)
2009-03-22T06:21:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	I saved the important files from my xp part, but I can't seem to make it "recover" all the files at all :S When I mount the drive it's empty except for "boot.ini" & "pagefile.sys"
2009-03-22T06:22:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	what happend, what didi u do to mess it up ?
2009-03-22T06:23:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Yesterday late at night I tried to install Jaunty (beta) on my laptop but I managed to select my NTFS part instead of EXT3 part, I realized my error at about 12% and canceled immediately but to no avail :(
2009-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	try photorec, it will recover most files that are left on the partition
2009-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Thanks :) So just use it and then??
2009-03-22T06:28:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	you probably wont get it running with out reinstalling windows :/
2009-03-22T06:29:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Hmm fair :P I wanna try though >_< I'm simply to lazy to re-install windows. It's just such a hassle! Installing driver and downloading your favorite programs through their webpages >_<
2009-03-22T06:30:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	winXP has some sort of auto recovery thing on the CD you might give it a try
2009-03-22T06:30:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Thanks, I'll give it a shot :) Other good advices? :)
2009-03-22T06:30:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	BACKUP! ;)
2009-03-22T06:31:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Thanks ;) I actually learned that now :P Took a couple of careless years >_<
2009-03-22T06:31:00.000Z	Dreamglider	eax	join the club hehe
2009-03-22T06:33:00.000Z	eax	Dreamglider	Thanks! I will ;)
