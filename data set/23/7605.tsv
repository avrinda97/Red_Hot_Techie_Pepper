2005-12-02T14:04:00.000Z	neoplasticity		whats the difference between linux, linux-image and linux-image-2.6.12?
2005-12-02T14:04:00.000Z	neoplasticity		is the default kernel as 2.4 kernel?
2005-12-02T14:05:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	linux-image-686, for example, depends on linux-image-2.6.12-9-686 (the current version for that architecture)
2005-12-02T14:06:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	make sense?
2005-12-02T14:06:00.000Z	neoplasticity	tritium	so which kernel should i pick?
2005-12-02T14:07:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	it's a good idea to use linux-686, or the architecture of your choice, so it pulls in other dependencies, like the matching linux-restricted-modules
2005-12-02T14:08:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	there is no linux-image-2.6.12 without an associated architecture
2005-12-02T14:09:00.000Z	neoplasticity	tritium	well, the options are linux-ppc, linux-image-ppc, linux-image-2.6.12-ppc
2005-12-02T14:09:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	linux-ppc
2005-12-02T14:10:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	not sure why the installer offers those
2005-12-02T14:11:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	please try sudo apt-get -f install
2005-12-02T14:12:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	also, you can try sudo dpkg --configure --pending
2005-12-02T14:13:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	they do different things.  Without knowing what's going on with your install, we need to try both.
2005-12-02T14:14:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	I realize that, but you shouldn't be getting any errors
2005-12-02T14:16:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	I'm back
2005-12-02T14:21:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	can you elaborate on the error you're getting during install?
2005-12-02T14:22:00.000Z	neoplasticity	tritium	after i install base system, it reboots
2005-12-02T14:22:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	what size disk are you installing on?
2005-12-02T14:23:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	that's not really enough.
2005-12-02T14:24:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	the Apple key
2005-12-02T14:25:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	the channel topic mentions that us.archive.ubuntu.com is down
2005-12-02T14:26:00.000Z	tritium	neoplasticity	use another archive (such as archive.ubuntu.com, without the "us" at the beginning)
2005-12-02T14:46:00.000Z	neoplasticity	tritium	or anyone else.. after i've changed sources, how do i restart the install to pick up where it left off at installing the packages after the base install is done
