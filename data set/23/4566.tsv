2007-07-10T05:17:00.000Z	pick		to use
2007-07-10T05:17:00.000Z	pick		can i use ubuntu with windows xp
2007-07-10T05:18:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	what's the sence in that?
2007-07-10T05:20:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	that's a totally different thing... using them parallel is absolutely possible... ubuntu installation will detect the win partition and include it to its bootmanager... then, when booting, you can select which OS to boot
2007-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	just go into XP and free up some disc space (about 5-10 G is way enough) then insert ubuntu cd and reboot... during nstallation ubuntu will prompt you which partition to use... use the free space to create a partition... ubuntu will detect the XP partition as long as you don't accidentaly delete it..
2007-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	by freeing uip I mean -> use partition magic or else to decrease your XP partition size
2007-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	just freeing up space on a partition won't work
2007-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	that's ok... get yourself partition magic, it's a prog that allows you to change partition size without loosing your data
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	pick	brainiac	will it detect my GFX card and my wireless card
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	most likely
2007-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	get yourself gparted, it's free
2007-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	that's what the cd is actually for
2007-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	of course it won't, it's a live CD... once loaded you should see an icon saying "Install"... click that
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	you will install ubuntu out of the live cd
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	what do you mean you did?
2007-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	dumm question: have you burned the cd?
2007-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	gratz
2007-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	just make sure that while installing you don't accidentaly delete you XP partition
2007-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	that would be no good for your XP
2007-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	brainiac	pick	np
