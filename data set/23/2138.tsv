2009-06-18T20:46:00.000Z	sedontane|2		how do I update my liniux kernel - I am running the LTS version with 2.6.24 - I need at least 2.6.26
2009-06-18T20:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	that can't be right
2009-06-18T20:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	which LTS?
2009-06-18T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	I would have thought,  they would have given you a later kernel then that from the repo
2009-06-18T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	ok you want a later kernel, well  not much point getting 2.6.28  if   the 2.6.30 kernel is also available as a ppa for hardy
2009-06-18T20:53:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	ok so how do i get that?
2009-06-18T20:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	Why not upgrade to 8.10 by the way?  nice release,  8.04 is getting old now.   Then you can do a clean install  and put on Ubuntu 9.10  released at the end of October, with Ext4 as default file system :)
2009-06-18T20:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	you read me wrong, read that again
2009-06-18T20:57:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	I cant use 9th edition ubuntu
2009-06-18T20:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	what I am suggesting is you uppgrade to 8.10,  skip 9.04,  and  put a clean install of 9.10 on when it's released
2009-06-18T20:58:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	so how do ipgrade to 8.10?
2009-06-18T20:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	already  thing with upgrading from 8.04 to 8.10 is this,  it happended to me on the other computer it went well, except  then I had no working ethernet,  it also happended to someone I talked to last night.   I guess there is some kind of bug.
2009-06-18T20:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	only thing not already thing above
2009-06-18T20:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	I am saying the upgrade might go wrong, and then you got to clean install  if you want your Internet to work, or so it seems
2009-06-18T21:00:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	ok if it does ill have to go try find a 8.10 disk image
2009-06-18T21:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	ok
2009-06-18T21:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	you won't have 2.6.30 in 8.10, but I think you get 2.6.28

2009-06-18T21:03:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	just found out iu have to go modiufy a setting first grr
2009-06-18T21:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	which setting?
2009-06-18T21:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	well you got to tell it to do non LTS releases as well
2009-06-18T21:04:00.000Z	sedontane|2	sebsebseb	the one in update sources
2009-06-18T21:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sedontane|2	8.10 is the release before 9.04 the current latest,  but  I have my reasons for suggesting skipping that one
