2012-01-05T09:31:00.000Z	joallard		My display lags like hell, how do I diagnose it?
2012-01-05T09:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	what GPU do you use?
2012-01-05T09:32:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	Nvidia Quadro 1000M with the 290.10 drivers
2012-01-05T09:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	do you use 2 video cards in a laptop?
2012-01-05T09:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	good :)
2012-01-05T09:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	can you give the output of: sudo lshw -C display; dpkg -l | grep nvidia; xrandr; cat /etc/lsb-release
2012-01-05T09:35:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	 Wow that's quite the command ;)
2012-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	its not that fancy really, use http://pastie.org (or similar) to host
2012-01-05T09:38:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	https://gist.github.com/a561adc4f10c2d5380bc
2012-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	I have two different driver versions installed, is that problematic?
2012-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	did you make the pastebin?
2012-01-05T10:00:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	I did multiple, about what?
2012-01-05T10:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	were you having the issue with the quattro 1000 earler?
2012-01-05T10:01:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	though we found out with Chipzzz I had 'vesafb' loaded
2012-01-05T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	if you want to make changes to the file using GUI you will need to run:  gksudo nvidia-xconfig
2012-01-05T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	you can then click the 'save to xorg config file'
2012-01-05T10:40:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	actually, I took the cli and xorg.conf was definitely written to
2012-01-05T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	its old school but some displays still need xorg.conf no matter how many people say it's not used now
2012-02-09T11:03:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	no difference.
2012-02-09T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	report a bug is all I can suggest
2012-03-27T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	remove the boot options: quiet splash   and you can watch the boot
2012-03-27T02:52:00.000Z	joallard	ActionParsnip	I just did that. Last line is "starting timidity++ ALSA midi emulation [OK]". This doesn't seem to be the problem. What should I be looking for?
2012-03-27T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joallard	look in /var/log/dpgk.log
