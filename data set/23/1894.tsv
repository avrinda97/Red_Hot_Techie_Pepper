2009-09-19T17:15:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel		IdealOne: What is that?

2009-09-19T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	apparently the touchpad has a kill switch to turn it off and on. Is the device enabled?
2009-09-19T17:20:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	The device must be on
2009-09-19T17:20:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	I followed the solution given here: http://start.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1009417
2009-09-19T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	thats just a whole lot about installing the video drivers
2009-09-19T17:22:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	What the thread I sent you?
2009-09-19T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	yes, I'd try a reboot, then press alt+f2, type gnome-terminal, press enter and then run: dmesg | less
2009-09-19T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	that output will hopefully show the device coming online
2009-09-19T17:24:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	What the thread I sent you?)
2009-09-19T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	as well as any issues, you may want to try some bootoptions to disable kernel functionality to hopefully get the device up
2009-09-19T17:24:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	Ok how do I do that
2009-09-19T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	all I could see in thee forum you pasted was about installing the nvidia drivers
2009-09-19T17:25:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	yeah that's the only problem I have
2009-09-19T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zermelo-Fraenkel	i'd read dmesg first, see whats going on
2009-09-19T17:26:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	I know what is boot options, my questions was what to be disabled in kernel
2009-09-19T17:26:00.000Z	Zermelo-Fraenkel	ActionParsnip	thanks, I' ll try that
