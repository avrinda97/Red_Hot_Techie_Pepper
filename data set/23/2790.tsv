2009-07-04T03:42:00.000Z	joebodo	deco	you can use the init scripts to restart services - like /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2009-07-04T03:43:00.000Z	deco	joebodo	but it won't be permanent right?
2009-07-04T03:43:00.000Z	joebodo	deco	if you stop a service with an init script it will be restarted on bootup
2009-07-04T03:44:00.000Z	joebodo	deco	there's some configuration you can do in Administration->services that will make it permanent
