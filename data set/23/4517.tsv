2007-12-09T00:10:00.000Z	bullgard4		Where to store a foreign DEB program package on my own Gutsy computer?
2007-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	what program do you want to install?
2007-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	I do not want to install a program. First I want to download a package.
2007-12-09T00:12:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	what do you mean by "foreign"? Is it not in the repositories?
2007-12-09T00:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	No, it is not. It is in sourceforge.
2007-12-09T00:13:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	are you sure it is a DEB package for Ubuntu? Otherwise it may not work. Just grab it, save it wherever you want, like your home directory and install it. What was your question again?
2007-12-09T00:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	I have put my question at the outset at 20:10 GMT +1. --  It is a DEB program package. Do you know what a DEB program package is. It is not in the Ubuntu repositories, probably intentionally because it might interfere with upstart.
2007-12-09T00:18:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	I was just asking if you solved your problem.  What does this program do (the one you want to download)?
2007-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	It provides the programs s2ram, s2disk and s2both. I need s2ram for analyzing. Sourceforge says: "It provides Linux suspend."
2007-12-09T00:59:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	maybe it is a a very new program not fully tested by the Debian distribution.
2007-12-09T01:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	I suspect that you are not well-informed. s2ram is a rather old program whose creation was suggested by Linux Torvalds himself. Linus Torwalds himself wrote an instruction for use. You will find it in the kernel documentation.
2007-12-09T01:04:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	I didn't know. Most of the people in here are not experts, please provide some background when asking some question of this kind.  Maybe the program is obsolete now.
2007-12-09T01:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	README shows a lot of changes made during this summer.
2007-12-09T01:06:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	you mean in the SourceForge page?   Or maybe it is updated with the kernel. Why would they provide a deb package for a small utility?
2007-12-09T01:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	I thought there was a DEB program package providing s2ram, s2disk and s2both altogether. But there is none.
2007-12-09T01:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	I just got an answer from one of the Ubuntu kernel developers: " We use the acpi-support scripts in gutsy and pm-utils in hardy." So I will re-arrange my thinking and troubleshooting accordingly.
2007-12-09T01:13:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	so,  what happened to the utilities? They are no longer used?
2007-12-09T01:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	My interpretation is: s2ram is no longer to be used as an analytical tool for Gutsy and Hardy. Rather, other tools are provided.
2008-03-08T11:36:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	I guess those things like USB controllers, to which you attach devices.
2008-10-05T13:49:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	what? Read the manual? This is usually not the place to discuss kernel hacking.
2008-10-05T13:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	Your message is not helpful.
2011-01-10T08:49:00.000Z	vocx	bullgard4	perhaps some program you downloaded from the university
2011-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	vocx	Yes indeed. But so far I was not able to figure out which one.
