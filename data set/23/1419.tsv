2010-04-24T14:08:00.000Z	liminal		i got the log from xsession errors
2010-04-24T14:08:00.000Z	liminal		I can't put it in paste bin, because chrome and firefox crash
2010-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	liminal		can I PM someone the log output
2010-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	liminal		its only a few lines
2010-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	all your browsers crash? have you tried epiphany-browser?
2010-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	liminal	hunahpu	everything crashes
2010-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	you can also use elinks or links (command line browsers)
2010-04-24T14:12:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	you said everything crashes; do you mean web browsers only? no GUI at all?
2010-04-24T14:20:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	no, there is not a problem with ddr3 and Ubuntu
2010-04-24T14:23:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	I read your pastebin, doesn't seem to be your graphic card's driver but your X server
2010-04-24T14:24:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	no, Xserver is what generates the graphics, the driver works at a lower level it's what links your hardware with your OS
2010-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	xserver installs by default, without it you have no Graphical User Interface (GUI)
2010-04-24T14:31:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	understand, xserver and a driver are different elements
2010-04-24T14:31:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	for what I saw in your pastebin, xserver is the one that's failing, not your video card's driver
2010-04-24T14:31:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	because you do have a driver loaded
2010-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	because there is no proprietary driver for your vcard, you're using the open source/free one; you're probably using either a old ati card or a very new ati card
2010-04-24T14:34:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	if you want to use proprietary driver go to ati's site and look for it; but I really think your problem is caused by a faulty xserver; are you by any chance using Lucid (10.04)?
2010-04-24T14:35:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	is a fresh install or it used to work fine before?
2010-04-24T14:37:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	fixing your problem can be difficult for not experienced users, you may try reinstalling as you don't have many stuff configured/saved as it is a fresh install; reinstalling xserver is not as trivial as reinstalling a regular application
2010-04-24T14:37:00.000Z	hunahpu	liminal	you may try reinstalling that driver (from the ati's website) but I wouldn't be very optimistic
2010-04-24T14:38:00.000Z	liminal	hunahpu	seems pointless as you say, I havent configured it much, ill just end up back where i started
