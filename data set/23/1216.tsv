2010-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	this morning their was a talk about installing ubuntu from usb you might want to check out plop, it boots usb devices as hard disks independent from bios, I haven not tested it but it is possible and you could install the iso that way
2010-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	plop you say? i will google for it
2010-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	good luck tell me how it goes
2010-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	thx, ok i will
2010-07-04T14:53:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	is it possible to just install on usb stick kernel + initrd + syslinux from ubuntu installer, and fetch all the rest from the network?
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	dont think why not considering ubuntu supports network install however you may want to look into that as long as you can point it to the usb it shouldn't be a problem
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	by the way did you try plop did it work as it stated on the site at least did it detect the usb?
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	i get the same errors still
2010-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	which error where you getting
2010-07-04T14:57:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	what is the error you're getting
2010-07-04T14:57:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	one second...
2010-07-04T15:07:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	interesting. i've put installer on the usb. it boots, says 'gfxmode unknown keyword' and the screen goes black
2010-07-04T15:07:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	i can pres esc, and if i'm fast enough i can get the boot menu
2010-07-04T15:07:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	than i have a choice. well, let's try 'live-install'
2010-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	hmmm is that when using plop, f so you might want to search online or check if they got a forum and ask their
2010-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	nah, that's what i get using normal syslinux
2010-07-04T15:09:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	squashfs_error, etc
2010-07-04T15:10:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	weird I thought with plop if you're using it you wouldn't have needed syslinux etc to boot the usb it would've just picked up the iso file, hmmm tell me how it goes if you manage right a tutorial for me to follow, I'll bookmark it until I can get my hand on an old machine
2010-07-04T15:10:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	 right > write
2010-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	michal|3s	Pirate_Hunter	plop can pick iso?
2010-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	it stated on the site it makes the usb pickup as a hd so I would've thought so
2010-07-04T15:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	if it is fooling the machine to pick up the usb as a hd shouldn't it react like one? but than I ahvent tested it myself,
2010-07-04T15:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	michal|3s	im going away for a bit be back in 30min or so
