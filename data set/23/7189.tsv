2005-12-05T12:01:00.000Z	nelsmar		you asked what i was doing with my kernel so i typed it again(3rd time this login lol)
2005-12-05T12:02:00.000Z	nelsmar		leaner the better it runs...
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		0.o
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		i dont want them there lol
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		i thought modules still slow down the loading modules or something
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		larger module map? something?
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		still the fact i cannot compile a new kernel?
2005-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nelsmar		cause i want to be able to compile my own kernel XD
2005-12-05T12:04:00.000Z	nelsmar		still the point, why can i NOT compile a new kernel... it doesnt make sense?
2005-12-05T12:04:00.000Z	nelsmar		i didnt change anythign at all in the kernel....
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	Kensey	nelsmar	have you compiled kernels on Ubuntu before?
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	nelsmar		if you dont change you shouldnt have a problem with your hard drive being found....
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	nelsmar		kensey no i havnt
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	nelsmar	crimsun	what is initrams? that intitrd thing?
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	Kensey		did you pull a known-good configuration from some system without Ubuntu?
2005-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	nelsmar	crimsun	i built kernels wiht initrd 0.o i got ONE to work and it took 6+ hours to get it to boot
2005-12-05T12:06:00.000Z	nelsmar		and now my FN keys dont work on my laptop all i removed was hotswap
2005-12-05T12:06:00.000Z	nelsmar		pci hotswap*
2005-12-05T12:06:00.000Z	Kensey		I compiled my first kernel on Ubuntu recently (2.6.10 on Hoary) and after futzing with initrd for a few minutes I said "screw it" and just compiled ext2/ext3 and ide in :)
2005-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	nelsmar		kensey so your kernel worked or no?
2005-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	Kensey		yep
2005-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	nelsmar		myn wont... its crazy... i changed NOTHIGN from the curent kernel i basicly recompiled the kerne with NO changes... and it didnt work
2005-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	Kensey	nelsmar	did you tell grub to use the existing initrd?
