2012-10-28T19:15:00.000Z	rlw980		*Shall
2012-10-28T19:15:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	are you sure USB booting is suppported?
2012-10-28T19:16:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	How do you mean, when I boot up the Computer
2012-10-28T19:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	go into the bios and see if USB is offered as a boot option.
2012-10-28T19:17:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Righto, I shall do that for you now and I will be right back right now
2012-10-28T19:22:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Yeah, It's showing on the boot menu
2012-10-28T19:23:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	OK, select USB, SAVE THE OPTION, exit and reboot...
2012-10-28T19:29:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Done that for you
2012-10-28T19:29:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	did it boot?
2012-10-28T19:30:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Yes It boot, then went into the OS
2012-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	success?
2012-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	What you mean success?, the OS isn't picking my USB up though
2012-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	maybe I misunderstood.  I thought you had an ubuntu USB and it wouldn't boot?
2012-10-28T19:33:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	No Ubuntu is running off my Hard Drive, not my USB
2012-10-28T19:33:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	awkward.  I apologize.  Totally misunderstood.  So it does not see the USB
2012-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	does the USB run on other computers?
2012-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Yes. I know that, and don't worry it's fine and yes, that's right the OS Isn't picking it up
2012-10-28T19:35:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Yes It does?
2012-10-28T19:36:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rlw980	do you use this usb in a Mac/Apple?
2012-10-28T19:36:00.000Z	rlw980	cfhowlett	Windows 7
