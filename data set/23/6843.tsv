2005-12-16T17:00:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	seems that your pam configuration is broken. when did this happen?
2005-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	/etc/pam.d/ should contain both su and sudo -files
2005-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	well, I was emerging various things, and while compiling, I decided to emerge another thing, and it didnt work
2005-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	then you have broken pam in the process :-)
2005-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	check for those files first though
2005-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	what do you mean by 'emerging'?
2005-12-16T17:04:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	/etc/pam.d/ contains both su and sudo, what now?
2005-12-16T17:05:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	what did you mean by 'emerging'?
2005-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	I used "emerge glib"
2005-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	emerge? on ubuntu?
2005-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	yes, it's possible
2005-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	and stable
2005-12-16T17:07:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	I don't support gentoo, shoo :-)
2005-12-16T17:07:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	it's not emerge, it's sudo and su
2005-12-16T17:07:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	it's not sudo nor su. your PAM is broken
2005-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	how do I fix my PAM?
2005-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	and I've never been able to break it in ubuntu, so it's not an ubuntu problem
2005-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	try unemerge? ;-)
2005-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	probably you have overwritten some system criticial files that PAM uses
2005-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	it's not PAMs problem. it's you and your emerge
2005-12-16T17:10:00.000Z	Alvi1	czr	just one question, I'm emerging something at the moment while in su, could that be why?
2005-12-16T17:11:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	I don't support gentoo
2005-12-16T17:11:00.000Z	czr	Alvi1	sorry to be anal, but IMHO gentoo users should fix their own problems
