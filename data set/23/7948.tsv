2005-06-22T07:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia		Unlike Ubuntu or Kubuntu (other popular Debian derivatives), Groovix software maintains 100% compatibility with Debian sources.
2005-06-22T07:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia		umm, that is FUD
2005-06-22T07:32:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	so why wouldn't i just use debian?
2005-06-22T07:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	Ubuntu is source compatible, not neccesarily binary compitable (though it usually is)
2005-06-22T07:33:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	again, i have to wonder why that's a feature.  it means being stuck with ossified versions of KDE and so forth
2005-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	say again?
2005-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	ok why don't you tell me what binary compatibility means
2005-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	binary compatibility means that you can install a deb from anywhere on Ubuntu
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	i can already do that
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	most will work, but some will not
2005-06-22T07:36:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	right, like those with library version skew.  this usually isn't a big priority with binary distros
2005-06-22T07:36:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	anyone really paranoid about binary version skew either runs debian stable or gentoo.  two approaches to the same end
2005-07-05T09:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	w32codecs and the totem thing doesn't work
2005-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	the upgrade path in ubuntu is about the best on any distro I have seen, but is far from perfect
2005-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	the upgrade mechanism comes from debian.  naturally it ain't perfect
2005-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	mostly you just need to iron out changes in programs
2005-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	god knows every patchlevel to the kernel requires fglrx changes.  they just rearranged the agp and pci api for whatever reason between 2.6.10 and 2.6.12
2005-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	linus and co don't care about binary drivers. It is too hard to support them
2005-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	apparently he doesn't even care about the source parts of drivers, since he can't keep an API stable between *patchlevels*
2005-08-08T12:05:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	i'm not asking for a stable abi, but a stable source level api between 0.0.x revisions isn't too much to ask for
2005-08-09T11:10:00.000Z	sproingie	Burgundavia	"install gnome" isn't the answer i'm looking for
2005-08-09T11:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2005-08-09T11:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	sproingie	;)
