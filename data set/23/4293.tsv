2008-06-02T07:20:00.000Z	m11		cant boot into ubuntu after several hardware failures which are not HDD's, it reports EXT3-fs error and group description corrupted , then it fails to mount disk and reports target fs dont have /sbin/init and finish in busy box. any help is really appriciated.
2008-06-02T07:20:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	have you tried a clean install?
2008-06-02T07:21:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	u recomend to reinstall ?
2008-06-02T07:21:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	well, you are saying hardware failure, did you fix that?
2008-06-02T07:22:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	hardware error fixed, dead cooler on chipset
2008-06-02T07:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	well, either it permanently damaged your mobo, or corrupted some data on your harddrive, am I right?
2008-06-02T07:24:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	it just cant boot into system, rest is working ok
2008-06-02T07:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	but did you follow my logic?
2008-06-02T07:26:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	some data got corupted
2008-06-02T07:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	hopefully, thats the case, and a clean install should fix that
2008-06-02T07:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	do you have a separate /home partition?
2008-06-02T07:27:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	OS works
2008-06-02T07:27:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	it is just not loading
2008-06-02T07:27:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	EXT3-fs error and groupd size description
2008-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	so I guess its booting, and you get that error?  I dunno mate, sorry.  Maybe you need to run fschk.  There is a way to get it to run on boot, but I cant find that atm
2008-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	yes , i think fschk would solve problem but i dont know how to stsart it after in livecd
2008-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	great :) now how i do that from busybox as livecd dont do nothing with that command =
2008-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	I dunno anything about busybox
2008-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	how about run sudo shutdown -F -r now from livecd ?
2008-06-02T07:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	so your system won't boot?  I think you should run fsck from the livecd
2008-06-02T07:35:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	how would i go with that ?
2008-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	m11	I dunno, I would check the man page.  Again, it may be easier to just do a clean install.  Thats what I would do.  Expecially if you have a separate /home
2008-06-02T07:37:00.000Z	m11	danbhfive	reinstall out of question :/
