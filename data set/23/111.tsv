2012-07-03T23:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	Could you run boot info script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt which it produces?
2012-07-04T00:16:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	Did you have a chance to look at the Boot Info Script?
2012-07-04T00:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	It's still loading in my browser (I am using a *very* bad connection at the moment :)
2012-07-04T00:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	Can you easily remove all drives except sda? It will make testing easier.
2012-07-04T00:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	I do mean to test booting.
2012-07-04T00:22:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	same error
2012-07-04T00:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	This problem is happening before linux starts and uses its own drivers to access the hard drive. .
2012-07-04T00:38:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	it was booting ok with windows 7 and 8
2012-07-04T01:14:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	I just installed and booted FreeBSD 9 without any issues.
2012-07-04T01:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kosher	If I made you a CD image would you be able to try booting it and doing some tests?
2012-07-04T01:35:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	sure, no problem
2012-07-04T01:36:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	that would be great actually.  What's on it?
2012-07-04T02:21:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U	for some reason this freebsd install is taking forever.  I will ping you after I get this CD booted.
