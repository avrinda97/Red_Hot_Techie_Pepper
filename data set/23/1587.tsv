2011-09-13T04:52:00.000Z	phong_		serious, how can i connect a sharefolder in ubuntu to windows?
2011-09-13T04:52:00.000Z	phong_		i have a folder which is shared in windows 7, how can i map it with ubuntu?
2011-09-13T04:53:00.000Z	jkoltner	phong_	Yes.  Try just going to Nautilus and enter smb://name_of_the_windows_pc and see what happens -- if you're lucky it'll display the share names, you'll be able to click on those to open them, etc.
2011-09-13T04:53:00.000Z	jkoltner	phong_	Oh, hit Ctrl+L in Nautilus to get an editable address bar
2011-09-13T04:54:00.000Z	phong_		it said error
2011-09-13T04:54:00.000Z	jkoltner	phong_	What kind of error?  Like, "...can't find the computer specified?"

2011-09-13T04:56:00.000Z	phong_		i press Ctrl+L:  a box open, what should i type in the box?

2011-09-13T05:00:00.000Z	jkoltner	phong_	If that works (using the IP address directly), you'll want to install the "winbind" package, I believe, if you want to use the name instead
