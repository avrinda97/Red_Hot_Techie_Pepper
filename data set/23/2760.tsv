2008-11-20T20:29:00.000Z	hmw		I am looking for a way to make a SOUND with HTML in Firefox!
2008-11-20T20:30:00.000Z	fde	hmw	this isn't a web site creation channel
2008-11-20T20:30:00.000Z	fde	hmw	there are a couple of standard ways add sounds to a site... or you just want to play back a sound?
2008-11-20T20:31:00.000Z	fde	hmw	please don't use opera, its crap and not a valid answer to your issue  :/
2008-11-20T20:32:00.000Z	fde	hmw	that is the preferred way... your browser isn't displaying it?
2008-11-20T20:33:00.000Z	fde	hmw	no idea... firefox isn't a qt app, so I'd just ignore that
2008-11-20T20:34:00.000Z	fde	hmw	no... please answer my questions regarding what exactly is wrong, your question isn't very clear right now.
2008-11-20T20:37:00.000Z	fde	hmw	forget about qt... you want wav playback in firefox? sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras, close out firefox and restart it and try again
2008-11-20T20:40:00.000Z	hmw	fde	any reason why using aptitude?
2008-11-20T20:41:00.000Z	fde	hmw	I just prefer it, much more powerful than regular apt-get...
2008-11-20T20:43:00.000Z	fde	hmw	while that's going though, can you type: dpkg -l totem-mozilla | grep ^ii  ... then paste the output here so I can ensure it will indeed work? (its only one line, if it was more, you'd get in trouble for pasting here)
2008-11-20T20:45:00.000Z	fde	hmw	yes, that's fine... so once that aptitude command is done, you should be good to go
2008-11-20T20:46:00.000Z	hmw	fde	no :(
2008-11-20T20:50:00.000Z	fde	hmw	hmm... you restarted firefox? you can try installing 'sudo aptitude install wavpack totem-xine && sudo aptitude purge totem-gstreamer
2008-11-20T20:51:00.000Z	fde	hmw	they work here, but I use the xine backend for movies so that libdvdcss works... so it might be an issue with gstreamer idk
2008-11-20T20:53:00.000Z	fde	hmw	you certainly shouldn't have
2008-11-20T20:55:00.000Z	hmw	fde	in firefox' settings, wav can be set to "Totem Web Browser Plugin" or "Movie Player (default)" and "Ask", "Save"... it neither asks nor asks me to save!
2008-11-20T20:55:00.000Z	hmw	fde	i pasted your command badly... retrying
2008-11-20T21:01:00.000Z	hmw	fde	in FF: Edit/Preferences/Applications/WAV there is still those 4 options: Always Ask/Save/Movie Player(default)/Totem Webbroser Plugin and CHOOSE. Could I choose something? And: I thought i just purged the Totem plugin!?
2008-11-20T21:01:00.000Z	fde	hmw	no, you switched backend
2008-11-20T21:02:00.000Z	hmw	fde	either i have become a normal user this night, or someting is wrong with my ubuntu. i dont have had much luck with it *g* only my 800MHz machine is doing really fine with ubuntu
2008-11-20T21:04:00.000Z	fde	hmw	idk what is wrong at this point.... it should be working as your setup matches mine  :/
2008-11-20T21:04:00.000Z	hmw	fde	thanks for trying anyways
