2006-07-10T13:06:00.000Z	dbmata		anyone familiar with monitor setup in x server?
2006-07-10T13:06:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	whats your problem?
2006-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	ive been fooling around with dual head setups and tvout
2006-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	Alright, I have two monitors, an lcd on the left, crt on the right... xorg.conf doesn't have any info for the crt, yet my display defaults to it.
2006-07-10T13:08:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	I'd like to set my screen to either my lcd, or to dual monitors... but I just can't figure out how to force the display output to the lcd.
2006-07-10T13:08:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	 the lcd is a common lcd or a laptop lcd?
2006-07-10T13:08:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	common lcd. this is a desktop system with an lcd and a crt.
2006-07-10T13:09:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	oh yeah, running DD, and an nvid 7800gtx vid card.
2006-07-10T13:10:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	I was previously pointed toward xinerama, but I couldn't find a download other than a bunch of txt files that were confusing.
2006-07-10T13:11:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	in a nutshell: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common
2006-07-10T13:11:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	you could almost imagine the scene, I'm upped on turkish coffee, 3am, trying to make heads or tails of those txt files, when I barely even know how to find my /home folder.
2006-07-10T13:12:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	Heh, well, I'm already using the nvidia-glx, and it's working...
2006-07-10T13:12:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	here's something funny, if I switch back to the nv driver, the display output reverts to my lcd, but I get 4 color ghosts on the crt.
2006-07-10T13:12:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	yeah, to either be dual desktop, or just force display to my lcd.
2006-07-10T13:13:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	unplug... the... crt? HAHAHA, haven't tried it, seems to logical.
2006-07-10T13:14:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	dual head would be my optimal choice though. That's how I run my XP side, and it's perfect for my workflow.
2006-07-10T13:14:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	ofcourse
2006-07-10T13:15:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	dualhead should work for sure, and i you have a nvidia, with not that much troubles
2006-07-10T13:16:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	is there a walkthrough for the extended desktop for the nvidia driver? Hopefully I can get it to see both of my screens.
2006-07-10T13:20:00.000Z	woot	dbmata	http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8762/README/index.html especially appendix G or P
2006-07-10T13:20:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	Ok, it's up also. Thanks. I hope I can get it rolling.
2006-07-10T13:22:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	I'm getting my streams crossed. Heh, thanks for the help.
2006-07-10T13:22:00.000Z	dbmata	woot	thanks again.
