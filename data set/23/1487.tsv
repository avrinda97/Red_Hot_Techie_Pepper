2011-01-28T09:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh		hey all.  i have that dell laptop that GRUB isn't picking up on win7
2011-01-28T09:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh		i just reinstalled grub
2011-01-28T09:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh		rebooted, did the update-grub... and still no windows in the boot menu.
2011-01-28T09:39:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	did you delete any partitions?
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	there were three.  i removed a recovery partition... maybe that was it?  that wasn't the boot partition tho, it's not where windows is installed.
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	i've done this before without this problem.
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	what model is it?
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	how can i fix it?  windows is still installed
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	inspiron n4010
2011-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	fawk, seriously!??!
2011-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	well, atleast that's what happened with my Inspiron 1545
2011-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	oh noes.  this isn't my laptop.
2011-01-28T09:42:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	well, if you have an external you could backup your stuff then reload it
2011-01-28T09:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	hrm.  i'd really prefer to avoid that.  i think i'll try to add a manual grub entry.
2011-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	so what about blowing up the mbr thru the windows recovery disc, then reinstalling grub?
2011-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	that's what I meant
2011-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	that didn't work?  oh man.
2011-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	lol when you tried to restore win7 did it basically say you have no OSes installed?
2011-01-28T10:08:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	no, I just didn't know how to do it
2011-01-28T10:11:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	tell him that you can back up his data and restore it if it doesn't work
2011-01-28T10:12:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	so reinstall windows, then recover GRUB?
2011-01-28T10:12:00.000Z	Crisco	arrrghhh	that should work
2011-01-28T10:13:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Crisco	oh yea, i'll backup his data.  thanks.
