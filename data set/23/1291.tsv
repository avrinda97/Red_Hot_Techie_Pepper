2010-05-29T08:11:00.000Z	ausnomer		I just booted from a 10.04 desktop cd, it gets to a purple background and displays an error window: "Installation failed, The installer encountered an unrecoverable error. A desktop session will now be run so that you may investigate the problem or try installing again."
2010-05-29T08:12:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	At what point does it fail? During partitioning or copying system files?
2010-05-29T08:13:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	it was just the live cd running.
2010-05-29T08:13:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	so you never made it to the gui installer?
2010-05-29T08:13:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	no. But it has 10.04 installed on it already.
2010-05-29T08:15:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	You can chroot into the system to try and get a cli for it
2010-05-29T08:15:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	could you please step me through that.
2010-05-29T08:16:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	Ok, can you say what device node your disk is? Like /dev/sda1 or sda2
2010-05-29T08:17:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	I mean for the partition where you have the broken 10.04 upgrade. Is it sda1 or something else?
2010-05-29T08:17:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	I mounted it from the gui. It's mounted /media/ee279660-d645 etc
2010-05-29T08:17:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	ah ok
2010-05-29T08:18:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	is there a 'repair installation' gui wizard?
2010-05-29T08:18:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	Can you say what device name it is though? See the output of 'mount'
2010-05-29T08:19:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	sdb3
2010-05-29T08:19:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	ok
2010-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	Open a file with 'gedit chroot && chmod +x chroot' and paste the contents into the file then save it and close http://pastebin.org/289303
2010-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	so what should I do next? Is there a 'repair installation' available from the live disc or is it more involved than that?
2010-05-29T08:23:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	ok one sec, thank you.
2010-05-29T08:23:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	make sure not to get the line numbers (select from the bottom half of the page)
2010-05-29T08:31:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	ok done.
2010-05-29T08:32:00.000Z	soreau	ausnomer	Now run it with 'sudo ./chroot' and it should give you a prompt to your broken system
2010-05-29T08:35:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	sorry didn't put 'soreau' in that last msg. Did you see the error message I got?
2010-05-29T08:40:00.000Z	ausnomer	soreau	are you still there?
