2006-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	ukjadoon		hello i just got ubuntu 6.06 but my installation seems to hang up at 23% and there is no hard disk or cd activity, what could be wrong? I haven't slept all night trying to figure this out but nothing seems to make the installation continue=(
2006-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	ukjadoon		i have the live CD i ordered it through ship it
2006-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	ukjadoon		i have both kubuntu and ubunti 6.06
2006-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	ukjadoon		and both have their installations hanging up
2006-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	ukjadoon		at first it would just hang up at the mounting root thingy...but i figured i had to add ide=nodma in the boot command line to fix it
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	ukjadoon		now when i install it...i made a 512mb swap partition and a 5 gb partition of ext3 for ubuntu or kubuntu both seem to have the same problem
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	ukjadoon		the installation gets stuck at 28% on ubuntu and 15% on kubuntu
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	ukjadoon		ohhh
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	ukjadoon		what did u do?
2006-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	ukjadoon		thr problem is that i cannot download the alternate version on a dialup! =/
2006-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	what hardware? how much ram?
2006-09-25T06:16:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	sata interface?
2006-09-25T06:17:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	actually that should be able to install from the Desktop CD... There's some PCI-troubl going on, I suspect
2006-09-25T06:20:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	to find out more change to another VT during install (i thing VT10 is used for logging) and try if you can run lspci or demsg from VT2 or so. BTW ubuntu and kubuntu  use the same underlying infrastructure, so when ubuntu doesn't work, kubuntu will neither
2006-09-25T06:20:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	your optical drive is 100% ok?
2006-09-25T06:21:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	what's your motherboard?
2006-09-25T06:26:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	so your motherboard should be supported, there are several sources which say they have it running
2006-09-25T06:27:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	are you trying 64bit or 32bit installation
2006-09-25T06:28:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	ah, ok... to be short and brutally honest: forget that. use 32 bit, it's more fun
2006-09-25T06:29:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2005/07/msg00011.html
2006-09-25T06:31:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	we all do the same... the dapper kernels leave somwhat to wish...
2006-09-25T06:32:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	you could try to use 'noapic' as a  additional parameter. Maybe that changes something. but don't bother to install 64bit anyway.. half of your multimedia stuff won't have codecs, and several other glitches
2006-09-28T14:47:00.000Z	stefg	ukjadoon	you wouldn' been asking this if gtk wasn't already installed :-)
