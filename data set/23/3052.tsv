2009-08-07T03:23:00.000Z	codeshah		hey guys why are there so many apache instances urnning ?
2009-08-07T03:23:00.000Z	codeshah		I have a bunch of /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
2009-08-07T03:25:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	it has usually ~5 processes running "just in case", but that is configurable
2012-03-20T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	try   sudo service ssh start
2012-03-20T01:47:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	unknown service ssh
2012-03-20T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	 what does apt-cache policy  ssh-server say?
2012-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	something wrong with install? uninstall it?
2012-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	no, the service is named ssh
2012-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	any ideas what should I do?
2012-03-20T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	I'm searching
2012-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	letm e paste somewhere sec
2012-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	http://paste.ubuntu.com/891383/
2012-03-20T01:54:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	I get exec: 34: /lib/init/upstart-job: not found … when trying to run it from /etc/init.d … I wonder why. upstart-job shouldn't be missing
2012-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	the problem (in my eyes) is that we are in the middle of a migration from sysv to upstart - and very often cannot know which mechanism will work
2012-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	sorry can you elaborate? sysv to upstart?
2012-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	should I maybe install an older openssh version?
2012-03-20T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	not very important (sorry for the aside) - no installing another version will not help - my concern was that there are several ways to start a service
2012-03-20T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	lets start simple:    type  /etc/init.d/ssh status     (no sudo needed)
2012-03-20T02:02:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	sorry give me 1 sec...
2012-03-20T02:02:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	I am on web console so a bit slow :(
2012-03-20T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	no worries
2012-03-20T02:06:00.000Z	codeshah	guntbert	agh web console is crashing sec :(
2012-03-20T02:07:00.000Z	guntbert	codeshah	try again afterwards - but I'm on my way to bed -- Good luck :-)
