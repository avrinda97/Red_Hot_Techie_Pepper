2006-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	heatxsink		hahaha
2006-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 j/k
2006-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	uh, yeah, i do... it's actually way more popular than gnome
2006-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 I was just joking around
2006-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 are there numbers or some kind of metric that keeps track of that?
2006-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	um. there's polls and stuff... nothing rigorous
2006-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 ahh, hrm....there should be though don't you think?
2006-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	graft		well rhythmbox was pretty coo last time i tried it... which was like... four years ago
2006-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	sure... how would you do it, exactly?
2006-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 probably make some kind of web service that talks to clients
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	90% of linux users wouldn't do it on account of privacy concerns
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 so that when KDE / GNOME is installed  it'll +1
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 there's a metric for that too?
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	you could get statistics from, e.g. debian servers
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	heatxsink		hrmm..
2006-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	graft		that's probably doable.... actually they post package popularity counts
2006-04-29T10:15:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 well check out banshee it's far from polished but it works with browsing iTunes shares
2006-04-29T10:17:00.000Z	graft	heatxsink	will do
2006-04-29T10:18:00.000Z	heatxsink	graft	 sweet
