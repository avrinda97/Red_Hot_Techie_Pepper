2005-09-06T09:55:00.000Z	DrJonez		hi :)
2005-09-06T09:56:00.000Z	DrJonez		so I put in a new video card in my linux machine, and now X won't start because it says "no screens found". I assume I just have to configure the new card, but how do I do that? :)
2005-09-06T09:58:00.000Z	DrJonez		bah
2005-09-06T09:58:00.000Z	DrJonez		sure, everyone ignore poor little me :P
2005-09-06T09:59:00.000Z	bimberi	DrJonez	sometimes it's hard to see posts when it gets busy
2005-09-06T09:59:00.000Z	DrJonez		it's ok :)
2005-09-06T09:59:00.000Z	DrJonez		I've got a really dumb newbie one after this one
2005-09-06T09:59:00.000Z	DrJonez		so I'm willing to bear with everyone if they'll do the same for me :)
2005-09-06T10:00:00.000Z	bimberi	DrJonez	try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" at the shell prompt.  You'll be asked lots of questions, read carefully, the defaults are usually pretty good
2005-09-06T10:01:00.000Z	DrJonez	bimberi	isn't there a way to do this for JUST the video card?
2005-09-06T10:02:00.000Z	bimberi	DrJonez	probably ... give me a minute
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		alright so
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		I'm a pretty big newb at this
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		I've got a program I want to install and run
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		I've got it in .rpm format, and .tar.gz
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		how the hell do I install and run it? :P
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		I know I sound like an ass for saying this, but installing/running isn't much like Windows :P
2005-09-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrJonez		what?
2005-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	DrJonez		it's called Synergy
2005-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	DrJonez		it's basically like a software/network based KVM switch
2005-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	DrJonez		I can mouse across multiple monitors/pc's with one keyboard and mouse
2005-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	DrJonez		and it syncs the clipboards
2005-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	bimberi	DrJonez	(to the best of my knowlege) ... only if you know what your new video driver is called ... otherwise you should use the dpkg-reconfigure procedure (painful i know)
