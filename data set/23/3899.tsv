2008-01-13T06:29:00.000Z	robdig	drgonzo00000	sec, let me see which repository its in
2008-01-13T06:33:00.000Z	robdig	drgonzo00000	don't see which one it is in, but if you go to system->administration->software sources, make sure that all of the repos on the first tab are checked. then run sudo apt-get update and then try installing it again

2008-01-13T06:47:00.000Z	robdig	drgonzo00000	that's cool, but if you have internet on your linux machine, you can paste the info to pastebin, and then just put the url here. the ubuntu pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org

2008-01-13T06:54:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	robdig	thanks man i appreciate it. just trying to get my sound card to work
2008-01-13T06:54:00.000Z	drgonzo00000		its frustrating
2008-01-13T06:54:00.000Z	robdig	drgonzo00000	ok, think I found your answer. looks like you need to install two more packages, gettext and ja-trans. once installed, then do make Clean, then ./configure, then make install.
2008-01-13T06:56:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	robdig	did what you said and i get a lot farther but then i get another eroor
2008-01-13T06:57:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	robdig	just needed to use sudo
