2007-05-13T13:56:00.000Z	RawSewage		Linux system files are password protected and we dont have that lame registry
2007-05-13T13:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	not quite, but let's not get into that :)
2007-05-13T13:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	I don't use one, but I think KDE has a Kcron. I prefer 'crontab -e' myself
2007-05-13T13:58:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	'man 5 crontab' explains it. Only wart is that day and day of week and 'or'ed
2007-05-13T14:11:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	the # means that line is a comment
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	thats what I thought.  When it was uncommented, it said there were errors
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	yeah, you've got a field too many I think
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	ok ty
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	remove one of the 0s (assuming this is crontab -e output)
2007-05-13T14:13:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	still doesnt like it
2007-05-13T14:13:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	what's the exact error?
2007-05-13T14:13:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	oh,  bad day of month
2007-05-13T14:14:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	actually, I'll eliminate that one too
2007-05-13T14:14:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	makes sense. You only want to run this once a year?
2007-05-13T14:14:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	no, every 5 minutes
2007-05-13T14:14:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	so all I need is 1 number then?
2007-05-13T14:14:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	*/5 * * * * /path/to/script
2007-05-13T14:15:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	ok thanks
2007-05-13T14:15:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	/ means every ?
2007-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	yes (but only on newer crons)
2007-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	home system?
2007-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	RawSewage	bbrazil	yes
2007-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	bbrazil	RawSewage	misdirected question :)
