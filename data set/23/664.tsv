2012-03-04T11:49:00.000Z	ziyadb		Hello, how do I enable audio jack sensing in unity?
2012-03-04T11:50:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	define 'sensing'
2012-03-04T11:51:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	the built-in speakers are not enabled once external speakers are plugged into the audio jack.
2012-03-04T11:52:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	I would like for it to detect if something is plugged and then disable the built-in speakers.
2012-03-04T11:52:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	s/enabled/disabled/
2012-03-04T11:56:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	any thoughts?
2012-03-04T11:58:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	I think that looking into pulseaudio configuration would be a good idea
2012-03-04T12:04:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	it's past the point of modifying things from gnome-volume-control, alsamixer, or pulseaudio.
2012-03-04T12:05:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	the only lead I have thus far is the greying out of the "headphones" setting on alsamixer, so it is likely to be a compatibility issue.
2012-03-04T12:07:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	So who knows a thing or two about audio troubleshooting?
2012-03-04T12:30:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	oh that reminds me, I have a simple issue too. It doesn't suspend nor hibernate, if I issue those commands, it just dims the screen (presumably in an attempt to performed the specified action) and returns the login screen.
2012-03-04T12:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	are you using unity or gnome-shell?
2012-03-04T12:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	I had this issue for a while but it went away...
2012-03-04T12:35:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	Unity.
2012-03-04T12:35:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	I did however install compiz which disabled unity at first, but then I re-enabled it. This started happening before I installed it.
2012-03-04T12:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	try setting your computer to hibernate when the lid is closed (if it's a laptop) and see if that works
2012-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	negative, perhaps I should configure it to auto-suspend once the lid is closed.
2012-03-04T12:40:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	sorry, I meant suspend, not hibernate, suspend is what works for me.
2012-03-04T12:42:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	yeah, I tried both. Neither worked.
2012-03-04T12:43:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	what happens when you close the lid?
2012-03-14T13:49:00.000Z	hydrox24	ziyadb	what are you fiddling with? pulseaudio or JACK or alsa?
2012-03-14T13:49:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	well, that's the thing. I'm not aware of what their functions and where their responsibilities end.
2012-03-14T13:50:00.000Z	ziyadb	hydrox24	I know however that I have both pulseaudio and alsa installed.
