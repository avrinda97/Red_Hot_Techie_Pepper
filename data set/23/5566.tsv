2006-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# what kind of control are you talking about?
2006-11-02T14:07:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	create connection on a simple click, watch the online status, and kill the connection with one klick, as simple as possible ;-)
2006-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# so you don't want to leave the connection on?  or is that not an option?
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	bun-bun	strabes	pianoboy3333 look into runlevels
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	no thats a bad option since the provider count the minutes
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# ahh i see
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	when their is no ADSL Tools is there one for modem or ISDN Connections?
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# i'm pretty sure i've seen a tool for that in kde, i'm sure gnome has one too
2006-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# i just can't think of one offhand
2006-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# there are lots of tools for manipulating modem and isdn connections for linux
2006-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	bun-bun		!es
2006-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	mh i can't find a userfriedly GUI Tool, such as Username, Passwd, (Telephonnumber) ...
2006-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# is it using pppoe?
2006-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	the adsl stuff yes, but not the ISDN stuff
2006-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# you have both adsl and isdn?  i'm confused
2006-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	 i have ADSL but my Grandmother have ISDN :-)
2006-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# ohhh ok
2006-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# for your grandmother then i would recommend getting an isdn router like the old combinet (now cisco) routers
2006-11-02T14:15:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# you can configure them to dial on demand and timeout after so much inactivity
2006-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	yes that is an option, that means that ubuntu is missing such a tool and the recommend option is a router
2006-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	?
2006-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	bun-bun		bag83# it would be the option *i* would personally prefer, but as i said, i'm sure there are tools for this
2006-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	bag83	bun-bun	ok thanks, i will investigate
