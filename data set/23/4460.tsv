2007-09-05T06:15:00.000Z	switchcat		Q: Anybody have a recommendation on testing line-in/audio recording?  I havent been able to get it to work yet.. I have an non-microphone device that outputs audio to the right type of jack that I typically record on a voice recorder... running 7.04, soundcard: audigy z2
2007-09-05T06:17:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	does alsamixer show green on line in?
2007-09-05T06:18:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	does alsamixer show green on line in?
2007-09-05T06:19:00.000Z	switchcat	gnuskool	- hmmm interesting  I've never used alsamixer before
2007-09-05T06:19:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	type alsamixer in terminal
2007-09-05T06:22:00.000Z	switchcat	gnuskool	- thanks I figured out _that_ part... hmmm.. what I think is Line in (displaying as "line") was first marked Mute.. then I un-muted it and I got a green double 00
2007-09-05T06:23:00.000Z	switchcat		or double OO.. rather
2007-09-05T06:25:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	you should be ready to go now, put level up if you ned to with arrow keys
2007-09-05T06:25:00.000Z	switchcat		what proggie is the easiest/best to use for recording from?
2007-09-05T06:27:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	there are heaps. if youre after a cubase-type install rosegarden4
2007-09-05T06:28:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	jackd is a good 'sound server' to use within audio applications, it has no latency
2007-09-05T06:28:00.000Z	switchcat		heck I dont even know what cubase is, but I've heard of it before.  I just wanted the one that is least likely to need troubleshooting.. for example when I wanted to test video with audio playing, VLC was recommended, and it worked off the bat.
2007-09-05T06:29:00.000Z	gnuskool	switchcat	audacity is simplicity mate, start there
