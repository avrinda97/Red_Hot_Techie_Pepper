2004-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	squirrel		hi, I've just installed ubuntu on my main machine and I've lost my win XP install somehwere, can someone help me please?
2004-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	squirrel		I've only got 1 hard drive in at the moment, a 120 Gb one partition in to 2 NTFS partitons, and 1 FAT32 partion and I left 20 gig for my ubuntu install, i installed it there and after I restarted grub doesn't list windows on it's menu
2004-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	during installation do you choose "automatically partition my entire disk" or the manual option?
2004-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	squirrel		manual
2004-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	sid77		ok
2004-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	sid77		:)+
2004-12-26T07:06:00.000Z	squirrel		~[ sid77 ] ~ I just chose the freee space and then partition automatically if I remember correclty
2004-12-26T07:08:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	try opening a terminal and run "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda" (substitute /dev/hda with your correct drive)
2004-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	it should display your current partitions
2004-12-26T07:11:00.000Z	squirrel	sid77	- I've done that and it does list my win xp partition there
2004-12-26T07:12:00.000Z	squirrel		but it doesn't have a star next to boot
2004-12-26T07:16:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	ok, now you have to check grub (or lilo) configuration, what do you have installed?
2004-12-26T07:18:00.000Z	squirrel	sid77	I just installed staright off the amd64 cd and then rebooted and updated my packages, X isn't working yet
2004-12-26T07:18:00.000Z	squirrel		I've got grub installed as my boot loader
2004-12-26T07:20:00.000Z	sid77		ok, take a look at /boot/grub/menu.lst it is the configuration file, there should be a voice about win partition somewhere
2004-12-26T07:23:00.000Z	squirrel	sid77	- my windows partition isn't listed in there
2004-12-26T07:24:00.000Z	sid77		ok
2004-12-26T07:25:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	it is strange, because it should have been added, anyway: read carefully how to add one entry to grub configuration file with "man grub" (some info should also be present in the menu.lst file)
2004-12-26T07:26:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	then modify (using "sudo <editor> /boot/grub/menu.lst") that file and run "sudo update-grub"
2004-12-26T07:33:00.000Z	squirrel	sid77	- do I need to put "makeactive" and "chainloader +1" in there? and do I use "root" or "rootnoverify"?
2004-12-26T07:34:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	urgh! that is something above my knowledge: I use ubuntu/x86 only at home and I cannot get it until this weekend
2004-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	squirrel		ok, thanks for the help, I'll just keep trying asn see what happens - thanks again
2004-12-26T07:36:00.000Z	sid77	squirrel	np
