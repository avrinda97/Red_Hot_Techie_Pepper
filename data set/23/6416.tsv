2006-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	errpast-wc		What's recommended way to get syntax highlighting when editing a perl script?
2006-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	with vim?
2006-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	edit /etc/vimrc and enable syntax highlighting
2006-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	will try.  thx
2006-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	it's near the top, one of the first things.
2006-06-14T09:01:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	hmm. my /etc/vimrc is empty file.  Am running Ubuntu BB
2006-06-14T09:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	erm, is vim installed?
2006-06-14T09:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	d'oh, I mean /etc/vim/vimrc
2006-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	I can't seem to edit vimrc?
2006-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	what do you mean?
2006-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	huh?
2006-06-14T09:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	no, as in, when do you get that?
2006-06-14T09:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	are you editing with sudo?
2006-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	both with and without
2006-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	without of course won't work since the file's in /etc
2006-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	yup
2006-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	are you sure you know how to use vim?
2006-06-14T09:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	edit with gedit: alt+f2 -> gksudo gedit /etc/vim/vimrc
2006-06-14T09:09:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	thx
2006-06-14T09:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	search for "syntax"
2006-06-14T09:15:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	perfect
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	errpast-wc	apokryphos	that weird error seemed to be related to the .vimrc I had put in ~
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	errpast-wc	really?
