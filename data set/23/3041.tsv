2008-08-15T17:19:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-08-15T17:20:00.000Z	Starwiz	xnv	 Ubuntu 8.04
2008-08-15T17:20:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	System > Administration > Hardware Drivers ... does that list your card?
2008-08-15T17:20:00.000Z	Starwiz		Yes it does
2008-08-15T17:21:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	Then your card is being detected. What happens when you enable the drivers and restart?
2008-08-15T17:21:00.000Z	Starwiz		It tells me im running in low graphics mode.
2008-08-15T17:22:00.000Z	Starwiz		Asks me to configure or continue, or shutdown, but no matter what I do, doesn't seem to work :S
2008-08-15T17:24:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	I don't know off the top of my head. If you haven't already done so, I'd suggest getting the exact error message and asking Google.
2008-08-15T17:24:00.000Z	Starwiz		Well, there is something else you might recognize?
2008-08-15T17:25:00.000Z	Starwiz		System>preferences>Appearance>Visual affects> anything other then none give me:   "destop effects could not be enabled"
2008-08-15T17:26:00.000Z	Starwiz	xnv	 ﻿System>preferences>Appearance>Visual affects> anything other then none give me:   "destop effects could not be enabled"
2008-08-15T17:28:00.000Z	Starwiz	xnv	 ﻿System>preferences>Appearance>Visual affects> anything other then none give me:   "destop effects could not be enabled"
2008-08-15T17:28:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	Exact error message + Google. That's all I can suggest.
2008-08-15T17:28:00.000Z	xnv	Starwiz	Others might know more, but the exact error message would probably help.
