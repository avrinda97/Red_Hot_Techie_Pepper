2011-09-25T23:31:00.000Z	michal_		Hey, have anyone couple minutes to help me with grub 2 please ?
2011-09-25T23:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	sure whats up?
2011-09-25T23:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	this can happen when windows needs a chkdsk some times, you may need to do this and releoad the mbr. Did you remove any partitions in this install as well?
2011-09-25T23:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	here is the chroot for reloading grub. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2011-09-25T23:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	there is aboot script that may help you, you can pastebin the results.txt as well. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2011-09-25T23:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	I didn't see you post it hold on
2011-09-26T00:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	it loos correct as far as I can see, you have done a reload of the mbr recognizing the difference between sdX=mbr and sdaXX as a partition correct?
2011-09-26T00:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	sorry sdx=mbr sdxx=partition\
2011-09-26T00:05:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	yes in my case hda is hd -mbr and hda3 is ext4 linux partition
2011-09-26T00:06:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	i installed ubuntu from flashdrive , but it doesn't matter?
2011-09-26T00:08:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	any ideas ?
2011-09-26T00:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	there is no hda, that is grub legacy, did you use the chroot link I gave and reload using sda and sda3, you have to run a fdisk -l when using a thumb to make sure it is seeing the HD as sda not sdb, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2011-09-26T00:10:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	 " make sure it is seeing the HD as sda not sdb"  maby this is the problem, i'll try to do it this way
2011-09-26T00:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	yeah with a thumb the hd gets switched to sdb often, always run that fdik -l it will save you alot of trouble.
2011-09-26T00:29:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	i double chcek i still have problem
2011-09-26T00:30:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	how i can boot OS from grub rescue
2011-09-26T00:33:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	how i can boot OS from grub rescue
2011-09-26T00:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	you might try a supergrub disc. http://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/  If that gets you in you can reload the mbr from the desktop
2011-09-26T00:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	is that a script run after your last try?
2011-09-26T00:35:00.000Z	michal_	urlin2u	can i use this superdiskgrub with flashdrive ?
2011-09-26T00:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	it is spradic there I use a actual cd
2011-09-26T00:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	michal_	your choice but with the script any changes made will need a new scipt to be accurate.
