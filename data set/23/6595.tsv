2006-03-09T09:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	wastrel	ah well I still get to play with my meger 5 gig nix partition.
2006-03-09T09:11:00.000Z	wastrel	chuckyp	 is there a way to test which files are fresher?
2006-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	wastrel	what you want to like dynamically rsync?
2006-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	wastrel	based on date or something.
2006-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	wastrel	chuckyp	 i just don't want a brainless copy to overwrite changes yeah.   if i've made modifications on the laptop i want them copied to the desktop, and vice versa
2006-03-09T09:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	wastrel	hrmm... I'm not in nix now but i'm sure there is a way to do that.
2006-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	wastrel	try the man pages for rsync like I say i'm not in nix now and I have to go to work.  I'm sure someone has done what you are trying.  I'm also sure if there isn't an app for it you could do it with a simple shell script.
