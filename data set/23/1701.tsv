2010-01-11T07:00:00.000Z	david_		hi i am getting segmentation faults when sshing into myself - does anyone have any suggestions?
2010-01-11T07:01:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	you are typing   ssh localhost   and getting a segfault?
2010-01-11T07:02:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	yes. plus putty wont connect either
2010-01-11T07:02:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 from the same machine?   do you have any entries in /etc/hosts.deny   ??
2010-01-11T07:03:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	yes, but im not denied
2010-01-11T07:03:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	  anything in /var/log/auth.log
2010-01-11T07:04:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	receive signal 15
2010-01-11T07:05:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	any of those helpful?
2010-01-11T07:05:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 any updates recently that might mean that your current sshd is out of date?
2010-01-11T07:05:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	im still on feisty fawn. i havent updated for ages
2010-01-11T07:05:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 restart sshd
2010-01-11T07:06:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	tried that, plus a reboot
2010-01-11T07:06:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 verify the package.   Sounds hacked
2010-01-11T07:07:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	how do i do that?
2010-01-11T07:07:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	dunno.    some dpkg command should be able to do it, but I know rpm betterer
2010-01-11T07:07:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	i apt-get removed ssh and installed it
2010-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 ssh-server?
2010-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	what would be the best way to update feisty fawn?
2010-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	to a newer distro
2010-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	hmm
2010-01-11T07:14:00.000Z	david_	sync3times	one distro at a time?
2010-01-11T07:14:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	 I dunno.   I would be tempted to do a fresh install, but thats just me.
2010-01-11T07:15:00.000Z	sync3times	david_	do you have a separate home partition?
