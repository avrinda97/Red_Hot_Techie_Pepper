2008-03-04T08:24:00.000Z	Jdaniels		hi, after setting up java runtime environment i somehow broke my browsers and get this error: INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Could not get the plugin manager, any help?
2008-03-04T08:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	have you tried removing java?
2008-03-04T08:25:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	yeah I've removed what I can several times.
2008-03-04T08:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	maybe you can reinstall firefox
2008-03-04T08:26:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	also i've reinstalled it a couple times, relinked in.
2008-03-04T08:26:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	yeah did that too... a llot.
2008-03-04T08:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	did you remove with --purge?
2008-03-04T08:27:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	no! please elaborate, i dont know how to do that.
2008-03-04T08:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	sudo apt-get remove --purge whatever
2008-03-04T08:28:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	okay so that has me wondering how do I figure out what to put in for <whatever>
2008-03-04T08:29:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	i'll try it. any idea what whatever's value would be for java runtime environment?
2008-03-04T08:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	you don't remember what you installed?
2008-03-04T08:35:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	not precisely what it would be called package wise, no. also, when I run --purge i get: E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-03-04T08:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	are you running synaptic? or update manager?
2008-03-04T08:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	you have to close those, only one can be open at a time
2008-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	you should have gotten a pm from ubotu
2008-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	ha oh thanks for the tab comment
2008-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	I think I missed a comment of yours awhile back...  I really pay attention to the highlighting :)
2008-03-04T08:39:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	im gonna rm the direcotry and reinstall, so i'll be back when i break something else =)
2008-03-04T08:39:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	the purge worked this time.
2008-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	Jdaniels	danbhfive	whats the best way for reinstalling firefox?
2008-03-04T08:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	I would think sudo apt-get install firefox       maybe add a --reinstall
2008-03-04T08:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	Jdaniels	after you have done whatever, you may want to run this for good measure: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^               and dont forget the ^,   I gota run, later
