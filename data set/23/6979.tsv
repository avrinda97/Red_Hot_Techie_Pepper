2005-12-07T15:14:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	what kind of printer?
2005-12-07T15:14:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: HP Deskjet 3550
2005-12-07T15:16:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: any idea?
2005-12-07T15:17:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	not on that particular model, but on the Z22 I use on my lan here, I just opened the print admin and right-clicked to properties, then clicked on Advanced and there was an open to change to b/w
2005-12-07T15:18:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	System > Administration > Printing
2005-12-07T15:18:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	right-click printer > Properties
2005-12-07T15:18:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	then check to see if there's an Advanced tab
2005-12-07T15:18:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: yes, I didn't think of that. Thanks!
2005-12-07T15:18:00.000Z	cdubya		np
2005-12-07T15:19:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	sethk is right....good suggestion
2005-12-07T15:22:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: didn't seem to work for the evince pdf printout, though
2005-12-07T15:24:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	sorry, what were you trying to print?
2005-12-07T15:24:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: a pdf from evince
2005-12-07T15:24:00.000Z	cdubya		ah
2005-12-07T15:25:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	did you happen to go ahead and try sethk's suggestion and create two different instances of the printer......
2005-12-07T15:26:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: it's not possible, as I can't rename the printer, I think... I'm still working on it
2005-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	double click on New printer, then set the name to be something unique, like HP_ModNum_BW.....
2005-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	then make that one set by default to B/W
2005-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	then make sure to set your other to color and remember which one you're spooling to when you send the pdf...;)
2005-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	Simira	cdubya	: Ubuntu doesn't allow me to manually name printers. It's just "producer - model"
2005-12-07T15:32:00.000Z	cdubya	Simira	just tested it and I added an identical printer and the print manager just assigns the second instance with a -1 in it's name to keep it unique
