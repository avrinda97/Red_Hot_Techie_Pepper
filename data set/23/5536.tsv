2007-09-23T13:15:00.000Z	Red-Sox		Hey
2007-09-23T13:15:00.000Z	Red-Sox		I need to replace OS X with ubuntu on an intel mac
2007-09-23T13:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Probably want to keep OSx on a small partition if only for firmware upgrades
2007-09-23T13:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	What model?
2007-09-23T13:16:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	It's a mini
2007-09-23T13:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	I think you can pretty much use boot camp to resize ( I would not trust parted with resizing HFS+ yet ) then install from the LiveCD
2007-09-23T13:18:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	Boot camp doesn't exactly work for me
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Yes
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Why does Boot Camp not work for you?
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	great
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	hold on I'm trying again to get the exact error message
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	All you are using from it really is an extention to diskutil
2007-09-23T13:20:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	I think it freezes at "pratitioning disk"
2007-09-23T13:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Not good, but then again you don't seem to care about your OSx partition anyway
2007-09-23T13:21:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	Not really.
2007-09-23T13:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	I would re-install OSx and just start out with a small partition, make sure to disable all extras like language support and printer support that take up a lot of space so you can have more room for Ubuntu
2007-09-23T13:22:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	Couldn't I just un install everything?
2007-09-23T13:23:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	Okay I got the error message
2007-09-23T13:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Yes, but it would still be on a huge partition :) I am saying it would be faster and easier just to start out with OSx already small and already on it's own partition
2007-09-23T13:24:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	I kinda lost the disks I think
2007-09-23T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	Shame on you ;)
2007-09-23T13:24:00.000Z	Red-Sox	Jordan_U	I know :(
2007-09-23T13:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Red-Sox	What is the error?
