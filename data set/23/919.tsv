2011-01-30T21:50:00.000Z	induz		I am removing the GTKpod and re-installing it maybe as i connected it to the wrong/old iPod not the iPod touch
2011-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	maco	induz	remove doesnt remove config
2011-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	maco	induz	per-user configs like that would be in your home directory
2011-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	induz	maco	 i dont know what to do with config
2011-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	maco	induz	if it has its own directory like ~/.gtkpod then delete it
2011-01-30T21:52:00.000Z	maco	induz	otherwise, might need to run gconf-editor and dig through there to find its settings and remove them
2011-01-30T21:52:00.000Z	induz	maco	yes i am going to delet the .gtkpod folder too
2011-01-30T21:58:00.000Z	induz	maco	i have deleted the .gtkpod folder too
2011-02-12T04:52:00.000Z	maco	induz	ffmpeg is hte usual for video & audio file conversions
2011-02-18T03:32:00.000Z	maco	induz	sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/your.iso  /mnt
2011-02-18T03:34:00.000Z	maco	induz	no, no gui. there should be. hrmph. i should take that as a papercut next release cycle
2011-02-18T03:34:00.000Z	maco	induz	the thing i said will work
2011-02-18T03:34:00.000Z	induz	maco	 what is -t there?
2011-02-18T03:35:00.000Z	maco	induz	it tells it the filesystem type. iso9660 is what cds are.  it shouldnt be necessary to include that bit, but it also won't hurt anything
2011-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	induz	maco	 i used sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/your.iso  /mnt but its just giving me details about commands
2011-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	maco	induz	did you change /path/to/your.iso to actually be the path to your iso?
2011-02-18T03:40:00.000Z	maco	induz	Desktop is the folder. you need the actual iso
2011-02-18T03:48:00.000Z	induz	maco	Yes its mounted now thanks
2011-02-18T03:49:00.000Z	maco	induz	wine?
2011-02-18T03:50:00.000Z	maco	induz	oh
2011-02-18T03:50:00.000Z	maco	induz	yeah, and its based on an old enough version of wine that its not really got an advantage anymore
2011-02-18T04:00:00.000Z	induz	maco	the iso files is installed but i can not use it on Ubuntu
2011-02-18T04:05:00.000Z	maco	induz	if you're just sending it for someone to look at but not edit, id just go with pdf
