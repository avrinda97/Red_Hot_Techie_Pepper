2010-05-06T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	googlr "grub2 error codes"
2010-05-06T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	google "grub2 error codes"
2010-05-06T15:12:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	I have done and found forum responses but no clear result.
2010-05-06T15:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	but you found the exact meaning of error code 17 ?
2010-05-06T15:13:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	: it was stated that error code 17 refers to incorrect file system
2010-05-06T15:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	what partition is this ? maybe it needs a fsck ?
2010-05-06T15:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	what you did to brake grub? you resized partitions ? or it just broke by itself ?
2010-05-06T15:17:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	it is very strange. I have moved no partitions or made system changes. I only plugged in a spare sata drive once, then removed it.
2010-05-06T15:18:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	that drive I pluged had bad sectors. reboot. NTLDR NOT FOUND. reboot about 11x = now its error 17. Using puppylinux right now to inspect my menu.lst etc
2010-05-06T15:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	tried to follow instructions on recovering grub when installing windows ?
2010-05-06T15:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	menu.lst is not used anymore.... is /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2010-05-06T15:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	in grub2
2010-05-06T15:19:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	yes I have done that many times now. but now when I attempt to fix grub it is not appearing in the old fashioned curses menus.hmm. i will check my default/grub files.
2010-05-06T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	sometimes the menu is hidden... press shift during boot
2010-05-06T15:24:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	wow it can be hidden ?!?! my grub entries are correct. XP on hda0,1 and 9.10 on hda0,2. I will reboot and try shift. Perhaps plugging in sata drives mucked up the volumes.
2010-05-06T15:26:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	: grub loading stage 1.5 grub loading plese wait. error 17. hmmmmmmmmmmm. I may have to re install. Its ok I have a seperate HOME partition.Its just fustrating with 64k internet. thank you for your help
2010-05-06T15:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	no problem
2010-05-06T15:29:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	is it normal for 9.10 to NOT have 'recover a broken system' on boot cd menu ?
2010-05-06T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	neddludd2	dunno; been ages i needed something like that
2010-05-06T15:30:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	yes I have it on my older 8.04 etc but I think that wont help with newer grub version now.
2010-05-06T16:00:00.000Z	neddludd2	erUSUL	i have reinstalled 9.10. grub still broken. I unplugged my 4gB USB stick. Now it is working fine,no more grub error 17 :P goodnight all!
