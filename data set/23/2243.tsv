2010-11-24T00:37:00.000Z	zer0rez		how do i check to see where an upgrade is in the repo cycle?
2010-11-24T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	can you expand on "repo cycle"please
2010-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	do you mean when the package will be updated on the official repo?
2010-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	looking to see if calibre 0.7.28/29 is on it's way
2010-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	correct.
2010-11-24T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	the package maybe reported on launchpad someplace, you could use a ppa to maybe get it now if one exists for your release
2010-11-24T00:41:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	thanks, i haven't really been serious w/ linux since the 90s this whole not building from source and having apps managed is quite nice, but different.
2010-11-24T00:41:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	yea i have a launchpad account, just loading it up  now
2012-01-03T04:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	try:  xforcevesa

2012-01-03T04:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	tried the text installer?
2012-01-03T04:43:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	this is off the text installer.
2012-01-03T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2012-01-03T04:46:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	actually i DLed it via a torrent shouldn't that handled error checking?
2012-01-03T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	yeah should be ok, did you use a CD?
2012-01-03T04:48:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	sorry forgot to preface your nick, USB via usb-creator-gtk.
2012-01-03T04:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	very weird, could try unetbootin
2012-01-03T04:49:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	but if there was an issue w/ the writing of the image wouldn't it not boot or wouldn't the restore setting in grub not boot either after the install?
2012-01-03T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zer0rez	not sure, just something to try really
2012-01-03T04:50:00.000Z	zer0rez	ActionParsnip	yea fair enough.
