2007-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21		can someon help me out? im running gutsy and trying to compile a program but keep getting an error saying pkg-config can't find gtk+-2.0.pc file (i have gimp installed and working so i know gtk+ is instaled, and i just installed the dev files) so what am i missing?
2007-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	you want the second one
2007-12-14T08:05:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	clearly it's not installed
2007-12-14T08:06:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	pastebin the exact error
2007-12-14T08:09:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	hmm what are you building?
2007-12-14T08:11:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	any ideas ?
2007-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	what does this say: pkg-config --exists gtk+-2.0 && echo exists
2007-12-14T08:19:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	pkg-config --exists gtk+-2.0 && echo exists doesn't return anything (sorry for delay had anetwork hiccup)
2007-12-14T08:21:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	then pkg-config doesn't recognize/see the .pc file
2007-12-14T08:25:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	make sure you don't have anything in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig (particularly not a gtk+-2.0.pc)
2007-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	gtk+2.0 was in there
2007-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	you've manually installed gtk for some reason, which is a bad thing
2007-12-16T01:18:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	did you do what I said to fix it?
2007-12-16T01:18:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	refersh mymemory? tried so much stuff the past few days don't know what ive done anymore lol
2007-12-16T01:18:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	you've got an install of gtk in /usr/local that's breaking things
2007-12-16T01:19:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	its gone
2007-12-16T01:19:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	you have nothing in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ now?
2007-12-16T01:20:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	contents of /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/: atk.pc       gmodule-2.0.pc         gmodule-no-export-2.0.pc  gthread-2.0.pc  libpcre.pc   libpng.pc
2007-12-16T01:20:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	you really should get rid of what you have in /usr/local
2007-12-16T01:20:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	installing core libraries in /usr/local is bound to cause problems
2007-12-16T01:22:00.000Z	crdlb	NeoPhyte21	everything in /usr/local is from stuff you've installed manually
2007-12-16T01:24:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	would you recomend i reinstall ubuntu?
2007-12-16T01:25:00.000Z	NeoPhyte21	crdlb	?
