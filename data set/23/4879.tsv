2007-07-12T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	it shouldn't be
2007-07-12T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	how did you mount it
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Well, it automounts normally.  But I've tried mounting it manually as rw, but still doesn't work.
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	I was able to ADD files to it, but not move or remove.
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	mount it with umask=000
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	wait, you could add files but not delete?
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Yep.
2007-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	When trying to delete, it says read-only file system.  But it lets me add files?
2007-07-12T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	yeah that is really weird
2007-07-12T08:53:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Well, it let me add files before trying to delete them. Let me see if I can add them now.
2007-07-12T08:53:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Yep  I can still add them just fine.
2007-07-12T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	there is no reason you shouldn't be able to delete then unless I am missing something
2007-07-12T08:54:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	I can delete the files I just added, but none of the other ones.
2007-08-25T06:07:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	this is ubuntu christian edition?
2007-08-25T06:07:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	No... straight 7.04
2007-08-25T06:07:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	So basically you have no idea... thanks.
2007-08-25T06:08:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Then don't be an asshole about it.
2007-08-25T06:09:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Are you serious?  You refuse to help because you disagree with my nickname? lol
2007-08-25T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	like ubotu said, this is a channel of volunteers which means that they make their own rules on who they help
2007-08-25T06:11:00.000Z	TheCreationist	bruenig	Granted... but if you have nothing but insults for someone asking for help, then keep your mouth shut.
2007-08-25T06:11:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	I was just trying to get some specifics
2007-08-25T06:12:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	are you saying we should take god having smited your pc off the table?
2007-08-25T06:14:00.000Z	bruenig	TheCreationist	have you tried to play it in firefox/
