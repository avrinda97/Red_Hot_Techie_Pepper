2012-02-21T13:21:00.000Z	gogo_		hi, I need help....My BIOS is not detecting hard disk, Windows is not detecting hard disk, Ubuntu is not detecting hard disk but disk utility in live mode is listing 'PATA Host Adapter' and 'Sata Host Adapter' but no options under them. What happened?
2012-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	sounds like the drive died, BIOS not detecting the drive is bad
2012-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	may need to open the system and check connectors (with the power OFF)
2012-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	I pulled it out and replaced firmly...still
2012-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	sounds like its dead, does it spin up?
2012-02-21T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	is it PATA or SATA?
2012-02-21T13:23:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	uhm I don't know...both? I think disk is spinning...should i remove disk guard and check?
2012-02-21T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	those are the controllers on the motherboard
2012-02-21T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	with no drives attached, they'd still show
2012-02-21T13:29:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	I think hard disk is spinning...its warm and i can feel vibrations from it after touching it
2012-02-21T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	could try a different cable if you have one
2012-02-21T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	if its a PATA drive, mke sure it's set as master and on it's own controller to avoid complications with conflicting devices on the same channel
2012-02-21T13:30:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	uhm cable?....there are two slots in which disk fits in laptop...there is no cable :(
2012-02-21T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	oh, laptop makes it a bit trickier
2012-02-21T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	try resetting BIOS to failsafe defaults
2012-02-21T13:31:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	did it already
2012-02-21T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	i'd say dead drive then
2012-02-21T13:31:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	is there a utility to confrim it in Ubuntu?
2012-02-21T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	you may be able to test it using the manufactrers tool on the ultimate boot cd
2012-02-21T13:34:00.000Z	gogo_	ActionParsnip	thanks...i will try ultimate boot cd
2012-10-05T09:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gogo_	buy a tv card or find a website with a stream
