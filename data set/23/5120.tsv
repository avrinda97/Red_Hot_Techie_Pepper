2007-02-14T12:21:00.000Z	Meltdown79		Hey guys, ive been running ubuntu for some time at home and im thinking about installing linux dist at work too, but.. since im a webdesigner i need photoshop and dreamweaver and phpED... I just cant find any similar programs.... I could live without photoshop, but not Dreamweaver... any suggestions?? Been trying to get DW working using wine without any results. =)
2007-02-14T12:23:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	aptana is good XHTML/CSS/JS editor, just doesn't have WYSIWYG
2007-02-14T12:24:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	does it have sftp support?? =)
2007-02-14T12:24:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	check www.aptana.com, i'm not sure
2007-02-14T12:26:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	check out this thread. I didn't read it, but looks informative, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=266627&highlight=dreamweaver+on+ubuntu
2007-02-14T12:29:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	no prob. It looks like aptana supports SFTP
2007-02-14T12:30:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	yepp, im having a look at it right now.
2007-02-14T12:32:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	hehe... seems like it got everything i wont.. but the most important thing... PHP support..hehe
2007-02-14T12:33:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	easy eclipse can help with that. you're going through the same steps i went through. I also do webdev work
2007-02-14T12:34:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	yeah, but all programs i have checked does miss one thing that i need... no program does have all the support that dreamweaver has =)
2007-02-14T12:35:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	thats the conclusion i came to
2007-02-14T12:37:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	if i would only be working with php etc i could be using phpED wich is a very nice phpeditor.... then linux would work really nice.. but when needing photoshop and dreamweaver this looks hard.. Gimp is just not good enough and there is no program similar to dreamweaver..hehehe... I guess i will just have linux at home for now... to play with
2007-02-14T12:40:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	is vmware overkill for u?
2007-02-14T12:41:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	im running vmware... thats how i survive =) Got DW and photoshop installed heheh
2007-02-14T12:42:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	only problem with running windows xp in vmware is that it is kind of slow.... it slows my computer down a bit... i only have 1 gig of ram.... probably need more to make vmware to run nicely =)
2007-02-14T12:43:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	i can't say the same, although I've got more RAM. I can run 3 vm, beryl, on dual desktops no problem
2007-02-14T12:44:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	yeah.. Im able to run Windows Xp nicely.... it works good, but... it doesnt work as good as a windows machine... with only windows installed..hehe... When im running photoshop, dreamweaver, browser and a few more apps in windows.. it get very slow.. =)'
2007-02-14T12:45:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	, i love having Windows xp virtual machine on one desktop.... and using beryl makes it really cool... =)  Very easy to switch between linux and windows.. =)
2007-02-14T12:46:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	yea, beryl works well for me
2007-02-14T12:48:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	... I got this program that bugged on me and I just cant make it shut down... I know there is a way to find out what the process id is and then kill it in shell.... you know how to do it, i have forgotten. lol
2007-02-14T12:50:00.000Z	MystaMax	Meltdown79	i like to use htop from the commandline
2007-02-14T12:52:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	you know if there ar any tweaks to get vmware to work better? =) I just gave my windows xp virtual machine 20gig of HD and 512 mb of ram i think.... any other setting so make it run better? =)
2007-02-14T12:52:00.000Z	Meltdown79	MystaMax	and when im running it, it seems like its faster to run it using vmware player, is that how you are suppose to run it right?
