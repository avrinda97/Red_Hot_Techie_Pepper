2009-12-21T05:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	steven_Laptop	if it isn't installed for you, install the xserver-xorg package usign apt-get
2009-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	steven_Laptop		Xorg.conf = /etc/X11/xorg correct? not there
2009-12-21T06:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	steven_Laptop	there can be a /etc/X11/xorg.conf though, but usually Xorg automatically configures itself using HAL and DBus
