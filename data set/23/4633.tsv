2007-12-03T11:26:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	download it manuaally and try it
2007-12-03T11:27:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	you mean the update?
2007-12-03T11:27:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	yup
2007-12-03T11:28:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	I have issues with the mouse for live cds. and i'm generally too lazy to try and download another cd and burn it.
2007-12-03T11:28:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	a sec
2007-12-03T11:39:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	apperently my software index for Apt-get is broken...
2007-12-03T11:39:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	get the update from here http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cupsys/
2007-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	i've got broken dependencies. until i fix those i'm not going anywhere
2007-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	okay :)
2007-12-03T11:42:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	yeah. It kinda decided that while it was gonna stop the upgrade it was gonna take my computer with it.
2007-12-03T11:43:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	that is one reason I never upgrade clean install ftw
2007-12-03T11:43:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	i would if i could.
2007-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	whay cant u? no cd drive?
2007-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	it rejects anything above 6.06 for install. it freezes up.
2007-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	network install?
2007-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	and yeah. it doesn't have a cd drive either.
2007-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	u try with alternate cd?
2007-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	when i tried to download it it gave me the same exact cd. I don't have any more CD-R's
2007-12-03T11:46:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	I think alternate cd is text based installer
2007-12-03T11:48:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	that's what i thought too.
2007-12-03T11:48:00.000Z	FluxD	kravlin	take a look at the names again when u download I am pretty sure its not sam
2007-12-03T11:49:00.000Z	kravlin	FluxD	Probably not.
