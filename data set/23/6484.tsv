2006-11-14T06:51:00.000Z	emilia		i have two ubuntu pcs, this one is online, the other is on a crossover connection into this one, and when i browse network places, it says windows network?
2006-11-14T06:51:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	yes, i have that too - and mine is a standalone PC
2006-11-14T06:51:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	do you know how to add my other pc there?
2006-11-14T06:52:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	Places -> Connect to Server...
2006-11-14T06:53:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	:  do you know how to find the ip of it :) ?
2006-11-14T06:53:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	ifconfig
2006-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	im lost :)
2006-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	if i ever get internet on the other pc itll be a miracle
2006-11-14T06:56:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	get to a command prompt and type 'ifconfig'.  Look for a line like "inet addr:192.168.0.10" or the like
2006-11-14T06:57:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	192.168.2.10 ?
2006-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	sounds plausible.  try 'ping 192.168.2.10' from the other pc
2006-11-14T07:01:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	: hrmm, 192.168.2.10 is this computer im on, there is no ip address for the other network card
2006-11-14T07:08:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	you need to set one up on the other card and on the other machine - 'man ifconfig' will help
2006-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	something like 'ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.1' on one  and then 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2' on the other PC  (my eth# numbers are guesses)
2006-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	Desktop (Capital D)
2006-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	the desktop doesnt display anything
2006-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	but i see the files in ~/Desktop
2006-12-20T11:04:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	and i can't right clickon it
2006-12-20T11:04:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	is this Gnome?
2006-12-20T11:04:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	yeah
2006-12-20T11:05:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	hmm. perhaps it's a gconf setting.  ALT-F2 "gconf-editor" and see if there's someting in /apps/nautilus/...
2006-12-20T11:06:00.000Z	emilia	bimberi	no, nothing in there :(
2006-12-20T11:07:00.000Z	bimberi	emilia	sorry, out of ideas for now :/
