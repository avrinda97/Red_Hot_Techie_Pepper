2006-03-07T13:19:00.000Z	hungry-hobo		well im familiar with using the mount command but for the life of me i cant get it to mount..
2006-03-07T13:21:00.000Z	hungry-hobo		also when i use the gnome menu and navigate to system >  preferences > disks i can see my hd that i'm referring to...and the 'enable' key is not greyed out for the partitions but when i click enable nothing happens!!it's gfotta be something simple.i mean surely i don't need it in /etc/fstab just to mount it?! but thats alli know to think about
2006-03-07T13:22:00.000Z	hungry-hobo		but any help any of u uber reet power users could throw my way would be greatly appreciated...just not sure how to google it is the only reason i come to  u guys for help

2006-03-07T13:23:00.000Z	hungry-hobo		in case anyone cares or is listening..i just needed to enter an 'access path' for it through the gui 'disks' manager :)
2006-03-07T13:24:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	aka   mount point
2006-03-07T13:24:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	lol man
2006-03-07T13:25:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	what's your mount command on that?   if you really want to learn what happened there.
2006-03-07T13:27:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	well i would use 'mount -t fat32 /dev/hdb2 /media/hdb'
2006-03-07T13:29:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	the type is  -t vfat   on that also.
2006-03-07T13:30:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	you can find partitions with  'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hd* /dev/sd* '
2006-03-07T13:31:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	or use ? in place of * to expedite
2006-03-07T13:31:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	thank u for your input and help bro i appreciate it
2006-03-07T13:33:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	yeah uwere right about the no fat32..it is vfat after all.....i can mo unt it manually now like i like to do..i try to use command line a lot cuz i get more verbose output for debugging rather than looking at a launch feedback bouncy cursor for 30 seconds lol
2006-03-07T13:34:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	i don't have a gui here.
2006-03-07T13:35:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	you are in runlevel 2 atm
2006-03-07T13:35:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	so then could u tell me..when u install a brand new hd and format it and junk..is there somethiing u need to do b4 u can start mounting it??
2006-03-07T13:35:00.000Z	hungry-hobo	intelikey	yeah my brain is :)
2006-03-07T13:37:00.000Z	intelikey	hungry-hobo	i've never owned a new hdd    hehhe   but no there should not be any special requirements.
