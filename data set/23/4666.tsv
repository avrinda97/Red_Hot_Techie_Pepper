2008-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	did you set those colors?
2008-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	because those aren't proper color codes. they have too many digits/etters
2008-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	im just getting used to using it, what do you mean by setting the colours?
2008-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	change your theme to something else
2008-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	how do i set the colours at the moment my desktop has my own theme which is outside openbox
2008-03-17T23:13:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	wherever those colors, i.e. #7eee8cf, are indicated. I don't use openbox but I assume it's in the theme file mentioned at the bottom.
2008-03-17T23:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	ok so i should remove it before running openbox is that what your saying
2008-03-17T23:14:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	not really, but you could try that. the problem is that whatever is calling for those colors is written wrong. those aren't color codes. look up html color codes and you can see how they're supposed to work.
2008-03-17T23:15:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	they're six digits, not seven
2008-03-17T23:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	yeah i noticed that now since you mentioned it, the problem is how do i locate what is calling those colours
2008-03-17T23:15:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	I'm thinking it's probaby that macos theme
2008-03-17T23:16:00.000Z	skarface		it shows you the location of that
2008-03-17T23:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	probably is going to try changing it and see what happens or better dwnlaod an openbox theme
2008-03-17T23:17:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	it looks like a bad theme in general, but you could probably fix it
2008-03-17T23:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	doubt that unless i get help, wouldnt know where to start
2008-03-17T23:19:00.000Z	skarface	Pirate_Hunter	http://blog.myspace.com/blog/rss.cfm?friendID=179436880

2008-03-17T23:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	will read that thanx
2008-03-17T23:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	skarface	i took out the macosx theme but i dont think that is the problem im now using an open box default theme and it gives me this when i run obconf http://pastebin.ca/946509 what can you suggest?
