2010-10-16T05:04:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		OK, this is my idiotic question for the day: Is there a way to get the grub bootloader to open the CD-ROM drive?
2010-10-16T05:06:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		Or, I guess, some way to open a CD-ROM drive on a non-bootable computer where there's no button on the front to open it?
2010-10-16T05:06:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	plug the drive in another machine?
2010-10-16T05:06:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	or if you dont care about the drive, screwdriver :)
2010-10-16T05:07:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	you dont have to boot to open the CD, you can do that any time power is on
2010-10-16T05:08:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	or if there is no open button, plug it into another pc :)
2010-10-16T05:08:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	you could try booting a usb stick instead
2010-10-16T05:08:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	or for real hacker cred, theres network booting with tftpd :)
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	tftpd ? no risks, your network card has to support it though
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	most modern cards do
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	you need a second linux box to run tftpd and dhcp on
2010-10-16T05:10:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	tftpd has been arround for dozen years plus, should be in all distributions as a package
2010-10-16T05:11:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	otherwise, ftp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp/
2010-10-16T05:12:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	you have to setup dhcp and tftpd though, dhcp you put the mac address of the box and the information about which tftpd server, which boot files to grab from it, and then the tftpd server has to be setup to server those files
2010-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	no, on the other computer
2010-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	then when your broken pc boots (you might need to go into bios to enable network booting) it will ask dhcp for an ip address, and dhcp will also tell it which tftpd server to get boot files from
2010-10-16T05:15:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	if you dont get a network boot screen that flashes for a second on the machine before booting, go into bios and make sure network boot is in there somewhere
2010-10-16T05:15:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	it might call it PXE boot or something
2010-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	network boot? no live cd, although you do have to have some sort of boot image
2010-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	a small livecd would probably work
2010-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	it has to fit in memory of the other machine
2010-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	most of them have a pinhole you can push a paperclip into
2010-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	ddilinger	ConduitConvectio	make sure its not the LED though :)
