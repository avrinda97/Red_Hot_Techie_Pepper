2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		guys, I installed Ubuntu 10.10
2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		err
2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		11.4
2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		And it refuses to boot right
2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		Unity won't work right, that is
2011-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Tiktalik		It refuses to start
2011-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	zvacet	Tiktalik	didn't boot at all or you can not boot unity
2011-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	I tried Ubuntu Classic, not working right either
2011-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	zvacet		from login menu select ubuntu classic
2011-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	I tried that, it didn't work either
2011-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	zvacet	Tiktalik	are you sure that cd is right ( md5sum checked)
2011-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	it's not a fresh install
2011-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	Tiktalik		I upgraded
2011-05-04T12:59:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	I upgraded ubuntu to 11.4, then when I tried to log in the login window just disappeared, then I tried again with ubuntu classic selected
2011-05-04T12:59:00.000Z	Tiktalik		After that, I tried safe mode
2011-05-04T12:59:00.000Z	Tiktalik		It worked
2011-05-04T12:59:00.000Z	Tiktalik		Then, I tried unity again, and it kinda worked. No menu bar though
2011-05-04T12:59:00.000Z	zvacet	Tiktalik	if you can boot in recovery then
2011-05-04T13:00:00.000Z	zvacet	Tiktalik	maybe your gpu I don't know
2011-05-04T13:00:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	brb, imma try classic again
2011-05-04T13:03:00.000Z	Tiktalik	zvacet	okay, classic works now
2011-05-04T13:03:00.000Z	Tiktalik		that was odd
2011-05-04T13:03:00.000Z	zvacet	Tiktalik	good  :)
