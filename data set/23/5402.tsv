2007-03-26T07:12:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	so I will need to compile it from SVN then
2007-03-26T07:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	libc6 (>= 2.5-0ubuntu1)  is not in edgy so you would upgrade that and nothing will work
2007-03-26T07:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	yes
2007-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	i have a minimal install.. webserver.. thats all .no gnome etc
2007-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	yes majorly
2007-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	libc is the main lib it is very important you use only the version compatible with your install
2007-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	so there is no chance sombody compiled a binary if mencoder rc1 for Ubuntu 6.10 right..
2007-03-26T07:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	no but if i look at it i might
2007-03-26T07:14:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	so to compile it myself I need to install tons of libraries and stuff I guess
2007-03-26T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	read the documentation i dont know without looking at it
2007-03-26T07:18:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	Ok I will go for it -- install all the dev tools libs and stuff and compile it myself :)
2007-03-26T07:18:00.000Z	robdeman	gnomefreak	probably it will scre up my webserver... mm
2007-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	instead of complaining try asking for help installing them
2007-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	stop complaining and ask a question
2007-05-24T06:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robdeman	this is support only. not complaining place
