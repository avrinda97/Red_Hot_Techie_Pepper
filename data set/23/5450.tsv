2007-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	Math^		hello, I've got some script, where to put it/make it active?
2007-01-30T08:13:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	chmod 755 to make it executable. Copy it to /usr/local/bin to put it on the path
2007-01-30T08:13:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	ok
2007-01-30T08:14:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	not something like a+x?
2007-01-30T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	man chmod
2007-01-30T08:15:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	it does not work
2007-01-30T08:15:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	what, man chmod?
2007-01-30T08:16:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	Ive copied the file in to my /usr/local/bin dir
2007-01-30T08:17:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	enter 'which file' (substituting file with the name of your script)
2007-01-30T08:18:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	ha?
2007-01-30T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	how are you getting on?
2007-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	Pixma printers tend to not work, unless you buy a driver from Turboprint. This may change in feisty. Still, go for an HP printer if you can -- better support.
2007-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	So then I cant convince my neighbour... :(
2007-02-14T11:22:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	so the question is for your neighbour whether to install ubuntu?
2007-02-14T11:22:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	yes
2007-02-14T11:22:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	he will stay at windows when he cant use he's printer/scanner :/
2007-02-14T11:22:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	give me a second
2007-02-14T11:24:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	feisty will support printing on various Pixma and Multipass printers, but I can't find that specific model number listed. Turboprint is always an option.
2007-02-14T11:24:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	thnx :)
2007-02-14T11:28:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	were can I see wich printer-models will be in the feisty release?
2007-02-14T11:29:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	install feisty and you'll see it in the Add Printer dialog ;)
2007-02-14T11:29:00.000Z	Math^	soundray	ok, ill try in vmware
2007-02-14T11:30:00.000Z	soundray	Math^	all to check compatibility? Good luck ;)
