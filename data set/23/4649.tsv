2007-06-27T15:27:00.000Z	dannyboy79		I have a hard drive icon on my desktop that I can't figure out how to change?
2007-06-27T15:28:00.000Z	dannyboy79		anyone know how to rename a hard drive icon on the desktop?
2007-06-27T15:29:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	you have to change a value in the registry, would you like me to walk you though it?
2007-06-27T15:29:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	yes please. I wasn't aware of linux having a registry
2007-06-27T15:30:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	well its more a gnome registry.. first press alt-f2 and type gconf-editor
2007-06-27T15:31:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	 I figured that's what you were talking about, got it open
2007-06-27T15:31:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	now go to apps->nautilus->desktop
2007-06-27T15:31:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	ok
2007-06-27T15:31:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	and uncheck the value 'volumes visible'
2007-06-27T15:32:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	why is that? I'll do it but I would just like an explaination
2007-06-27T15:32:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	WOW, they are all gone.
2007-06-27T15:32:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	it will hide the hard drive icon on your desktop, that is what you want no?
2007-06-27T15:32:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	no, I want to change a name of 1 of them.
2007-06-27T15:33:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	oh.. sorry! then think you need to change the mount point in /etc/fstab
2007-06-27T15:33:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	nope, mount is correct but it's showing me some weird name
2007-06-27T15:34:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	it's showing as DRV8_VOL1. really strange?
2007-06-27T15:35:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	ya thats kind of strange alright
2007-06-27T15:35:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	any suggestions?
2007-06-27T15:35:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	is it called something completely different in /etc/fstab?
2007-06-27T15:37:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	it's wrong under Places also. but when I look in /dev/disk/by-label there is only 1 symlink pointing to that drive's device id which is /dev/hdb1. do you think I can just delete that symlink?
2007-06-27T15:37:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	I actually just noticed this now!!! this might be the solution I hope.
2007-06-27T15:38:00.000Z	brk3	dannyboy79	let us know if it works :)
2007-06-27T15:38:00.000Z	dannyboy79	brk3	so you think that's it? No damage if I delete it?
