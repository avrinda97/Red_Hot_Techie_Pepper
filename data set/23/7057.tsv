2005-11-15T14:13:00.000Z	wezlo		hey all - is anyone else having overheating problems with breezy that didn't occur in hoary?
2005-11-15T14:15:00.000Z	wezlo		yah
2005-11-15T14:16:00.000Z	wezlo		it's like the fan decides to go away or something
2005-11-15T14:17:00.000Z	wezlo		I'm going to run another liveCD with the 2.6.12 kernel to see if it's just with breezy, or with the 2.6.12 tree
2005-11-15T14:17:00.000Z	wezlo		yah
2005-11-15T14:18:00.000Z	wezlo		Sgershon are you using gnome or kde?
2005-11-15T14:19:00.000Z	wezlo		not sure where it is because I'm in kde
2005-11-15T14:20:00.000Z	wezlo		Sgershon, select hebrew as one of the keyboards
2005-11-15T14:21:00.000Z	wezlo		Sgershon, then you need to go into OOo go to tools ==> options and in that window select "language settings"
2005-11-15T14:22:00.000Z	wezlo		Sgershon under languages, check the "CTL" box - and then select hebrew at the default CTL language
2005-11-15T14:24:00.000Z	Kovecses	wezlo	what video card u got?
2005-11-15T14:14:00.000Z	Kovecses	wezlo	no but strangly enough i did have that problem in hoary
2005-11-15T14:14:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	weird
2005-11-15T14:14:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	what kernel are you running?
2005-11-15T14:15:00.000Z	Kovecses	wezlo	2.6.12-686-smp  .........  not on my ubuntu machine so i dont know the exact kernel
2005-11-15T14:16:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	when I run that kernel, I get the overheating problems, when I run 2.6.10 - no problems
2005-11-15T14:18:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	the bummer is that I've got 3d acceleration working in the 2.6.12 kernel!!!
2005-11-15T14:18:00.000Z	Kovecses	wezlo	thats easy enough to use with the 2.6.10 kernel though
2005-11-15T14:19:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	nope - I need the k7 kernel or the module won't compile!
2005-11-15T14:19:00.000Z	Kovecses	wezlo	oh
2005-11-15T14:23:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	I guess I could just download the 2.6.10 source package and recompile it to be k7 optimized!
2005-11-15T14:24:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	it's a S3 Unichrome
2005-11-15T14:25:00.000Z	wezlo	Kovecses	the REAL bummer is that the unichrom dri module is included in the latest kernel!
