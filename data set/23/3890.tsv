2008-01-14T20:12:00.000Z	fairyEneried		hahaha XDDDD
2008-01-14T20:12:00.000Z	fairyEneried		i have a tricky question
2008-01-14T20:13:00.000Z	fairyEneried		how can i say ubuntu, gnome, kde, or whatever designed such stupid feature of windows stealing the focus?
2008-01-14T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	you can drop the attitude
2008-01-14T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	and ask politly
2008-01-14T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	thats no reason to behave like that
2008-01-14T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	try again
2008-01-14T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	I think that's default baehaviour for any window manager
2008-01-14T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	I'm not sure there is an option to change that
2008-01-14T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	I don't think you can, but someone mentioned you could earlier
2008-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	fairyEneried	ikonia	we have the same problem in windows, and we found a very rude way to solve it, but it works, now i want to do that to in gnome, cause that "nice feature" is breaking my nerves
2008-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	I personally don't believe you can set that in gnome/kde
2008-01-14T20:29:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	I don't think you can do anything about that
2008-01-22T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	ask the question then
2008-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	caller id ? do you have your phone routing through your computer ?
2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	fairyEneried	ikonia	give me a second
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	fairyEneried	ikonia	yes, the phone line is attached to the modem and the phone to the modem
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	caller id need to be enabled by your phone provider
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	fairyEneried	ikonia	we have the caller id service on the provider, and we were using it in windows, but, we're moving to linux now, and we need an alternative
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	look at the documentation for things like astrix, see if it has any recommendations
2008-01-22T20:57:00.000Z	fairyEneried	ikonia	but asterisk is not too big for such little task?
2008-01-22T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	fairyEneried	astrix is too big, hence why I said look at what it uses ad see what you can adapt
