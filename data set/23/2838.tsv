2008-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	Uplink		my pc powered off in the middle of dist update, and now my ubuntu wont load :(
2008-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	can you get a terminal
2008-11-02T04:34:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	can you get a terminal?
2008-11-02T04:35:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	anywhere, if you can boot, thats preferable, but you can use the livecd also
2008-11-02T04:35:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	then can you get a terminal at boot?
2008-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	well, its not too hard to recover, just run: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-11-02T04:43:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	did you get any of my messages?  pidgin was acting way weird
2008-11-02T04:44:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	yeah, can you get a terminal?
2008-11-02T04:45:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	anywhere in ubuntu
2008-11-02T04:49:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade            and if it says it cant continue because you need to run another command, run that command
2008-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	did the commands I gave you fail?
2008-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	well, you can use a livecd too
2008-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	well, you boot up with the livecd, and then mount your drive, then chroot, and proceed
2008-11-02T08:30:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	Im sure you may not follow that, but the first step would be to get a livecd.    Buuuuut, you may want to go a different direction: create a separate /home partition, rsync your settings, then do a clean install of whatever ubuntu you are going for
2008-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	conflicts?
2008-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	I dunno, either way, if you don't have a bootable system, then you kinda have to get a bootable cd.  Its up to you
2008-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	then maybe order a cd through shipit.  That will take like 2 months...
2008-11-02T08:40:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	I can't help with that.  If you can't burn a cd, and you cant get a cd, and you cant boot, then you are stuck.  right?
2008-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	oh, brilliant!  boot that baby!
2008-11-02T08:43:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	does the livecd support your internet?
2008-11-02T08:44:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	do you know how to mount and chroot?
2008-11-02T08:46:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	do you know the partition location of your linux install?
2008-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	temppy	Uplink	mk, but do you know about partitions?  and can you figure out which one is your linux partition?     anyway, you would mount that partition to a location, then chroot to that
