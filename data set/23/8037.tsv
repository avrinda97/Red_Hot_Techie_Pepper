2005-12-22T06:48:00.000Z	ryanpg		mediaplayerconnectivity looks really nifty
2005-12-22T06:49:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	it's really nice indeed
2005-12-22T06:49:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	I need to now find a good test case for it's use
2005-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	if you have the codecs needed, try the movie trailers at the apple website
2005-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	oh yeah good one thanks
2005-12-22T07:20:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	do you have codecs for quicktime then?
2005-12-22T07:20:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	I'm pretty sure... totem plays *.mov
2005-12-22T07:21:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	could be that the quicktime versions are not supported by the codecs
2005-12-22T07:21:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	I have gstreamer-pitfdll installed and all my /lib/win32 codecs are registered
2005-12-22T07:22:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	if totem is able to play the embedded file format, then you should be ok...i can't imagine that's a problem with the extension
2005-12-22T07:24:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	dunno... does apple.com/trailers/ work for you?
2005-12-22T07:25:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	some of them, not the hd versions, or what they are called
2005-12-22T07:26:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	I'll try a few others
2005-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	Totem could not play 'http://movies.apple.com/movies/universal/nanny_mcphee/nanny_mcphee_h.480.mov'. The file you tried to play is an empty file.
2005-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	what player do you use for quicktime?
2005-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	xine-ui
2005-12-22T07:29:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	ahh.. ok well xine doesn't play *.mov well for me at all, hehe I guess linux (ubuntu) multimedia really is a bit of a mess
2005-12-22T07:31:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	well, most things work very well. quicktime is hard to get going I guess...
2005-12-22T07:34:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	apples in this particular case :)
2005-12-22T07:35:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	heh good one
2005-12-22T07:35:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	or apples and sour grapes
2005-12-22T07:35:00.000Z	Xappe	ryanpg	;)
2005-12-22T08:13:00.000Z	ryanpg	Xappe	yay! it works now that I have mplayer installed
