2012-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	don't do any fsck!
2012-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	the disk isn't detected properly!
2012-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	I haven't yet
2012-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	your USB interface is lying
2012-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	it says the disk has 4K logical sector size, while it should be 512 bytes
2012-11-30T18:41:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	I don't know if there is any way to override it
2012-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	I guess you could modify partition table to fit if your partitions were 4k aligned, but they are not
2012-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	Possible. I tried another 2.5" HDD and it worked easily opening the file manager
2012-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	I'm not sure what could have caused that issue to 750GB drive
2012-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	older hard drives may be detected properly by your USB adapter, never drives - 512k logical / 4k physical may be mangled to 4k logical / 4k phys.
2012-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	your USB adapter is probably lying intentionally, they do it to make bigger drives than 2TB work on Windows
2012-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	Both the drive 2.5" are newer
2012-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	it's a trick to make 2TB+ drives accessible with msdos partition table
2012-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	it's probably working fine for drives with 512k log. / 512 k phys. sector size
2012-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	and it's probably lying for 512k log / 4 k phys
2012-11-30T18:50:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	either connect the drive directly without the USB adapter, or buy an adapter which doesn't mangle sector sizes
2012-11-30T18:50:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	sector size detected for first is 4096bytes and second working one is 512bytes
2012-11-30T18:51:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	yep, that's what I thought
2012-11-30T18:51:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	I'll try connecting it directly to laptop
2012-11-30T18:52:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	Can encryption report wrong sector size to protect or something?
2012-11-30T18:55:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	don't confuse encryption block with hard drive sector size
2012-11-30T18:55:00.000Z	regf	deffrag	two independent things
2012-11-30T18:56:00.000Z	deffrag	regf	do you mind if I pm you on the same?
