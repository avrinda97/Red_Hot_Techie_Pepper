2007-01-15T12:55:00.000Z	rohan		vmware does not support 3d
2007-01-15T12:55:00.000Z	rohan		is there any kind of addon cd for edgy, that would make installation of extra codecs, software etc easy ?
2007-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	unop	rohan	well, there are repositories you can add to your sources.list that make software installation easy -- among the software are quite a few coedcs packages
2007-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	rohan	unop	yes, but it would be great if it were all on a cd
2007-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	rohan	unop	to facilitate install on many machines, as well as so that i can distribute it to people interested in ubuntu
2007-01-15T12:57:00.000Z	unop	rohan	it would be indeed .. but most codecs are not released under an open license and therefore debian and ubuntu cannot officially include them in their distributions
2007-01-15T12:58:00.000Z	unop	rohan	well, you can do two things -- create your own CD or setup your own "public" repository -- like !seveas has done
2007-02-11T14:08:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 ubuntu tries to provide packages as current as can be afforded .. but stability comes first
2007-02-11T14:09:00.000Z	rohan	unop	i am just talking about updated cd's
2007-02-11T14:10:00.000Z	unop	rohan	you mean CD's for packages already available in the repositories?
2007-02-11T14:10:00.000Z	rohan	unop	yes
2007-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 heh, arent you happy enough that they provide a free service? :) you're on the net, why not download the packages
2007-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	rohan	unop	that was just a request .. ofcourse i am grateful. and, it is pain to download packages in areas with slow internet, like me
2007-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 is there a reason you must have the latest and greatest?
2007-02-11T14:15:00.000Z	rohan	unop	err.. i dont think you got me. i meant, cd's like the fedora respins, or 6.06.1, i.e. updated cd's with the latest packages in repo.
2007-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 yes, i got you -- but why must you have the latest version of KDE and whatnot, why dont the current packages cut it?
2007-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	rohan	unop	the current packages are the latest - 3.5.6. only, the cd is outdated
2007-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 so the only reason you want the latest packages is because you think what you are running is outdated?
2007-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	rohan	unop	that, and because of the changes listed on http://kde.org/info/3.5.6.php
2007-02-11T14:21:00.000Z	unop	rohan	 man o man, why do you assume that it's best to have what's newest -- i bet you if you were sent a CD, the KDE you got would be obsolete :)
2007-02-11T14:21:00.000Z	rohan	unop	true, but kde 3.5.6 has its advantages :)
2007-02-11T14:24:00.000Z	unop	rohan	it's not feasible to use CDs .. especially as the install ones are already given out free .. which is why you have the online repos .. now, if you spent a couple of hours everyday running update (even of 2kbps dialup) you'd have no problems
2007-02-11T14:25:00.000Z	rohan	unop	true ..
