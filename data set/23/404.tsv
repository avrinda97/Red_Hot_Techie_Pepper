2011-10-05T04:27:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish		hi all; not sure if this is the correct place to ask, but does anyone have a method for extracting jpegs from an online flv presentation?
2011-10-05T04:28:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish		how do i pass data to it? it's a map viewer.
2011-10-05T04:28:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish		it's not a movie.
2011-10-05T04:30:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish		it's not a video stream
2011-10-05T04:30:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish		that's my problem

2011-10-05T04:32:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	what do you need the images for? would a screenshot do the trick?
2011-10-05T04:33:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	oh nevermind, beat me to it
2011-10-05T04:33:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	they kinda would, but i need the images perspective-corrected
2011-10-05T04:33:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	anyway, without the source .fla I don't know of any other way to go about it
2011-10-05T04:34:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	actually, can you use a converter of some kind and convert it to a sequence of jpegs, then go through and find the ones you need?
2011-10-05T04:34:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	i need to pass location data to the flv in order for it to ask the host server for the correct images. should i be looking into packet forming?
2011-10-05T04:35:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	that's what i was thinking; something akin to the way curl can ask for a sequential range of urls
2011-10-05T04:36:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	oh, so you dont even have the file locally, ya, I'm afraid you're stuck with screenshots, unless there is enough of them that it really would save you time to automate it in scripting lang of your choice
2011-10-05T04:37:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	well, i can get the file locally, but that doesn't help anything
2011-10-05T04:37:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	right, cause it needs data
2011-10-05T04:38:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	script it or continue on with your evening of screenshots
2011-10-05T04:38:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	i'm wondering how hard it would be to write my own javascript for this
2011-10-05T04:48:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	if I were you, depending on how many there were to do, I would automate the whole process with python, or java using xuggler. but I'm a developer
2011-10-05T04:48:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	i'm looking into their javascript at the moment
2011-10-05T04:48:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	great minds, etc.
2011-10-05T04:52:00.000Z	a_cuttlefish	noisewaterphd	what do you develop?
2011-10-05T04:54:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	a_cuttlefish	I'm currently paid to write java, but I use multiple languages
