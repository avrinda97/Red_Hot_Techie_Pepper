2005-04-20T08:42:00.000Z	Jet2k5		umm did I mention I don't have a cd
2005-04-20T08:42:00.000Z	Jet2k5		I said an Online install update?
2005-04-20T08:43:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	that was quick!
2005-04-20T08:43:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	umm well I didn't do it
2005-04-20T08:44:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	oh. heh
2005-04-20T08:44:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	I'm looking for an online update
2005-04-20T08:47:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	sure.. Method 2 and 3 look identical to me.
2005-04-20T08:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	bah I just erased all the sources and added the ones in the code box
2005-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	is that upgrade done yet?
2005-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	replacing everything right now as we speak :)
2005-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	cool. When you logout/reboot, come back to tell us if/that it worked.
2005-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	sure thing
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	is it safe to update /etc/bash.bashrc ?
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	have you modified it yourself?
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	if not, then it's safe. If so, then you may lose your custom changes.
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	never even heard of it
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	then it's probably safe to replace it.
2005-04-20T10:22:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	awesome!
2005-04-20T10:22:00.000Z	dcraven_	Jet2k5	nice eh?
2005-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	very, but I think I might still be getting some proplems from running apt-get update & upgrade
2005-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	Jet2k5	dcraven_	says somethinga bout authenticating?
