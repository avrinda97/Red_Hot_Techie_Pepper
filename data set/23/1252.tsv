2011-01-17T18:52:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	maybe you are missing the correct drivers
2011-01-17T18:53:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	 can you help me regarding that
2011-01-17T18:53:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	Im on it
2011-01-17T18:54:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	supposedly in ubuntu you have this package for SIS graphic cards -> xserver-xorg-video-sis
2011-01-17T18:54:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	do you have it installed?
2011-01-17T18:54:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	i am newbie to linux
2011-01-17T18:55:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	ummm... try doing this -> sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-sis
2011-01-17T18:57:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	sometimes X not displaying the correct resolution is because the monitor refresh rates haven't been detected correctly but that's an old issue that usually does not happen in actual versions of xorg
2011-01-17T18:59:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	thanks for help & i will take a look and will tell you if this works
2011-01-17T19:25:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	will you again provideme the link  again

2011-01-17T19:28:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	when i typed command , terminal message was that newest version is already installed
2011-01-17T19:29:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	follow the instructions in the link shcherbak suggested, it may not work with own sis drivers but the vesa ones as the url suggests
2011-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	kanhiya	ezra-s	how do i edit x org .conf file and where it is located
2011-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ezra-s	kanhiya	it is possible when you edit it is an empty file since xorg does all automatically
