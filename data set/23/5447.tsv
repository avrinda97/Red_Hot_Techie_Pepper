2007-01-14T11:31:00.000Z	mnoir	gurkZor	1.  what goal for your changes.  2.  maybe restore all your backups of those files and start over slowly?

2007-01-14T11:31:00.000Z	gurkZor	mnoir	1. I was at a LAN-party, 2. Backups? :-D

2007-01-14T11:32:00.000Z	mnoir	gurkZor	hmm - so you were just making it all work on the temp lan?
2007-01-14T11:33:00.000Z	gurkZor		Yup mnoir
2007-01-14T11:33:00.000Z	mnoir	gurkZor	my files are pretty plain vanilla on 6.10 - you want me to pastebin?
2007-01-14T11:33:00.000Z	gurkZor	mnoir	no thx, I'll try to use my backups
2007-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	mnoir	gurkZor	ok - if you figure out exactly what went wrong let me know :)
