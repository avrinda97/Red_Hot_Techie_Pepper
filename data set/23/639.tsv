2011-04-30T11:40:00.000Z	lumbert		Getting an error when trying to do a live session of ubuntu 11.04. ||initramfs||  using the same usb stick earlier today on another machine worked fine, this is an x64 compatible machine
2011-04-30T11:40:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	what is the error
2011-04-30T11:42:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	at that point in the boot process, everything is logged to the screen
2011-04-30T11:43:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	no it wont write boot error logs to your flash drive
2011-04-30T11:44:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	is what i mentioned enough information?
2011-04-30T11:45:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	"something about live" is not
2011-04-30T11:49:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	unfortunatly no
2011-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	what filesystem is on the USB?
2011-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	how did you make the USB?
2011-04-30T12:04:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	do you have a linux system available to you to follow linux based how to's for making bootable USBs?
2011-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	the problem is that, the initramfs is supposed to wait a few seconds for your USB device to be ready, but its not so it cant find the needed files. I recommend installing grub2 and using the isoboot method, but I cant find a good guide for it... yet
2011-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	different machines have different USB controllers, and some chipsets are faster than others
2011-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	this page explains how to make a grub2 isoboot setup but dosent explain how to install grub2 http://www.ubuntudoctor.com/content/blog/08/ISO-Booting-with-Grub-2-in-Ubuntu
2011-04-30T12:09:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	regardless of chipsets and computers, the problem is that the deice is not ready
2011-04-30T12:46:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	still around?
2011-04-30T12:46:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	yeah
2011-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	i was using a usb 3.0 port
2011-04-30T12:48:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	used a 2.0, fixed
2011-04-30T12:48:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	ahh, that makes no sense, but ill jot that issue down
2011-04-30T12:50:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	now that i'm inside, its not detecting my usb 3.0 HDD - i'd assume the two problems are related?
2011-04-30T12:51:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	my guess, is that usb30 kernel modules have not made it into the initramfs/livecd
2011-04-30T12:53:00.000Z	lumbert	pfifo	is that to say if i installed the full version it would recognize my external 3.0 drive?
2011-04-30T12:54:00.000Z	pfifo	lumbert	speaking from the linux kernel standpoint, USB 3.0 is supported... in ubuntu i have no idea
