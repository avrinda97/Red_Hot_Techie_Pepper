2009-08-09T06:02:00.000Z	kelli		i would like to get them back if i can
2009-08-09T06:03:00.000Z	cast	kelli	whatcha lost?
2009-08-09T06:03:00.000Z	cast	kelli	and how did you lose them?
2009-08-09T06:04:00.000Z	cast	kelli	ok, this is probably doable
2009-08-09T06:04:00.000Z	kelli	cast	whats that?
2009-08-09T06:04:00.000Z	cast	kelli	recovering deleted jpgs
2009-08-09T06:05:00.000Z	cast	kelli	this is the tricky bit, as soon as it happened you should stop writing to the filesystem ASAP
2009-08-09T06:06:00.000Z	cast	kelli	switch to mounting it ro, or umount it,
2009-08-09T06:06:00.000Z	cast	kelli	it's *very* important you stop writing to the FS, as it's likely you'll overwrite the jpgs
2009-08-09T06:07:00.000Z	kelli	cast	is there any way to recover deleted files from hd?
2009-08-09T06:07:00.000Z	cast	kelli	that's precisely what i'm talking about, presumably you're new to computers as well as ubuntu
2009-08-09T06:08:00.000Z	cast	kelli	so where were the deleted files
2009-08-09T06:10:00.000Z	kelli	cast	 show that i have over 4oo items when i hover over the bin apt.but when i open onlu 62 show
2009-08-09T06:11:00.000Z	kelli	cast	 and there not hidden
2009-08-09T06:12:00.000Z	cast	kelli	i suggest booting off a livecd and using photorec, or similar program. i'm afraid i don't feel energetic enough to help beyond that
2009-08-09T06:13:00.000Z	kelli	cast	thanks anyway
2009-08-09T06:27:00.000Z	kelli	cast	worked it out
2009-08-09T06:28:00.000Z	kelli	cast	went in trash- view--reload    and there all back
2009-08-09T06:28:00.000Z	cast	kelli	so they were never deleted...
2009-08-09T06:29:00.000Z	cast	kelli	FWIW there, their and they're are worth learning about
2009-08-09T06:30:00.000Z	cast	kelli	for what it's worth
2009-08-09T06:30:00.000Z	cast	kelli	presumably you're...14? :P
2009-08-09T06:46:00.000Z	cast	kelli	there's a way but i doubt its easy
