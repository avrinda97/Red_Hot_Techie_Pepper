2006-01-09T07:31:00.000Z	AtomicB_		can somone help me with a fresh breezy install and an NVidia CK8S? (I'm getting no sound, but it seems installed ok)
2006-01-09T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	pastebin the output from ``amixer''
2006-01-09T07:33:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org is a Web site. Go to Applications> Accessories> Terminal, type: amixer , and paste all the output onto the Web site. Then give me the url you used.
2006-01-09T07:33:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	thankyou, a moment please :)
2006-01-09T07:35:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6564
2006-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	you're using normal speakers directly, correct? No digital receiver?
2006-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	in that Terminal, type: amixer sset 'IEC958' off
2006-01-09T07:37:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	still can't hear anything, let me just double check all the outputs... is there anything else it could be?
2006-01-09T07:38:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	then, amixer sset 'External Amplifier' off
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	still nothing.. and I'm pretty sure all my levels are correct :(
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	is this a dist-upgrade from Hoary or a fresh Breezy install?
2006-01-09T07:40:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	do you have multiple sound cards in the computer?
2006-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	nope, just this inbuilt nvidia card
2006-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	are you positive you're using the line-out jack?
2006-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	(and not, say, Mic)
2006-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	99% but I will now double check :)
2006-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	ok, yep 100% sure, tried them all just for the sake of it.. it's 100% the right one
2006-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	use the speaker-test util
2006-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	ok, where will I find that?
2006-01-09T07:44:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	command line
2006-01-09T07:49:00.000Z	crimsun	AtomicB_	speaker-test has a man page, too.
2006-01-09T07:49:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	yeah was just browsing it :)
2006-01-09T07:52:00.000Z	AtomicB_	crimsun	sorry to bug you, do you know of anything else I could look into for getting this stupid nvidia onboard sound to work?
