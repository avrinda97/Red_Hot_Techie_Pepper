2004-12-27T10:35:00.000Z	farruinn		it's all on the ubuntu website
2004-12-27T10:36:00.000Z	farruinn		it is the current development release
2004-12-27T10:36:00.000Z	farruinn		so people are testing it
2004-12-27T10:37:00.000Z	farruinn		yeah, but it's the _unstable_ development branch - not really recommended unless you know what you're doing
2004-12-27T10:38:00.000Z	farruinn		ctrl-shift-pageup
2004-12-27T10:39:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	that just beeps and prints a ~
2004-12-27T10:40:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	oh wow you're right - that always worked in debian for me
2005-02-25T11:14:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	yeah, I guess.. because that doesn't give cpu temperature :)
2005-02-25T11:15:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	it doesn't lie.. it just doesn't say at all, at least here :)
2005-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	taht doesn't make sense, gnome doesn't load until after you login...
2005-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	unless you mean gdm by gnome
2005-02-27T09:44:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	oic.. well I want to run "xmodmap /home/calamari/.gkb_default.xmm" so that my custom keyboard settings take place
2005-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	I figure there is a default file somewhere that I could just change and be done with it.. but nobody knows much about keyboards in linux :)
2005-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	I think that's more of a general X configuration thing
2005-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	oic
2005-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	probably belongs in some xinitrc or something or other, but I have no clue :/
2005-02-27T09:47:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	no prob.. is there a good x channel on freenode?
2005-03-14T12:22:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	curl for the cmd line
2005-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	apt-get check
2005-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	thank you :)
2005-11-07T15:57:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	is there also a way to build a list of files on my system that are not a part of any package?
2005-11-07T15:58:00.000Z	farruinn	calamari	hm, that's an intriguing idea, but I don't know how
2005-11-07T15:58:00.000Z	calamari	farruinn	np, thanks :)
