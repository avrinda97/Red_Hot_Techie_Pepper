2009-08-23T02:17:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	I downloaded it 3 times
2009-08-23T02:18:00.000Z	mcphail	MatBoy	I have used the unr.img to boot from a usb stick. How did you burn it?
2009-08-23T02:18:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	using imgburn...
2009-08-23T02:18:00.000Z	mcphail	MatBoy	and what do you see on the disk if you browse it?

2009-08-23T02:19:00.000Z	mcphail	MatBoy	can't be accessed even from within a running linux/windows/mac session?
2009-08-23T02:20:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	nope
2009-08-23T02:20:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	tried 3 different dvd's and downloads
2009-08-23T02:20:00.000Z	mcphail	MatBoy	as i said, haven't tried burning the .img to dvd but worked like a charm on a 1 gig USB drive. Try that?
2009-08-23T02:21:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	same issue on the USB drive :S

2009-08-23T02:24:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	to a DVD ?
2009-08-23T02:25:00.000Z	mcphail	MatBoy	you _can_ burn to DVD from command line, but as I recall it is a world of pain
2009-08-23T02:26:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	ok, found it... let's see
2009-08-23T02:26:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	burning CD's was always easy
2009-08-23T02:29:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	ok seems to be burning now :D
2009-08-23T02:48:00.000Z	MatBoy	mcphail	weird, it just reads the disk and after it... it boots the HD :S
