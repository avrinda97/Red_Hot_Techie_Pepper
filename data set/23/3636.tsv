2008-03-12T07:21:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	lol i'm downloading it right now, although my gfx card isn't too great
2008-03-12T07:22:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	dont feel bad i dont have an actual gfx card, i have a built in intel chipset but i think i might try it out aswell xD
2008-03-12T07:22:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	lol intel gm965 here >.<
2008-03-12T07:26:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	hey when you get it installed message me your IGN so i can play you in game once i get it down xD
2008-03-12T07:26:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	will do
2008-03-12T07:29:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	maybe try an alternative? i use "SwiftWeasel"
2008-03-12T07:29:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	i like swiftweasel, but my mouse buttons don't work on it and ff3 i'm used to
2008-03-12T07:30:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	wow what do you mean your mouse buttons dont work on it? >.> that sounds really weird lol
2008-03-12T07:30:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	the back and forward buttons i have on my mouse lol
2008-03-12T07:31:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	you might just need to install a driver for it? Google it up or post it on the ubuntu support forums, someone should have an answer there if no one here knows =]
2008-03-12T07:32:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	i'll give it a try sometime but ff3 is my cup of tea lol
2008-03-12T07:45:00.000Z	[dcr]	l815	my download is done, about to install xP
2008-03-12T07:46:00.000Z	l815	[dcr]	firefox just froze >.<
