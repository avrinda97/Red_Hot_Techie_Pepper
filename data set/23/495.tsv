2011-07-25T18:22:00.000Z	lenshark		hi guys
2011-07-25T18:23:00.000Z	lenshark		if you accidentally deleted some files in the / ... is there a way to find out who did it ? on the logs perhaps ?
2011-07-25T18:24:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	to dlt something from / u'll need root permisions
2011-07-25T18:24:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	so those should be logged in the Auth.0 log
2011-07-25T18:27:00.000Z	lenshark		hmm. i logged in to the server via winscp, i was in a windows machine. then i did "rm -rf /*" accidentally ... somehow i was able to stop the operation. but then afterwards, i can no longer do any commands line "ls, reboot, etc...."
2011-07-25T18:28:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	wow ! you do "rm -rf /" "accidentally" ?!
2011-07-25T18:28:00.000Z	lenshark	damno_	.... yeah :( it was meant to be rm *
2011-07-25T18:29:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	you have some sort of backup of ur /  ?
2011-07-25T18:30:00.000Z	lenshark		yeah.. but how ? i can no longer do anything.. and i can't logged back in via winscp...
2011-07-25T18:31:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	that maybe bcoz of vital files are deleted
2011-07-25T18:31:00.000Z	lenshark		my last option would be just to reinstall the os
2011-07-25T18:31:00.000Z	lenshark		yeah. :X now i just want my boss to not find out it was me
2011-07-25T18:32:00.000Z	lenshark		else i'm dead
2011-07-25T18:32:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	i'll tell u to backup ur home and reinstall :/  if you cant get anything out of backup
2011-07-25T18:32:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	or maybe you can restore the back up login into a live session
2011-07-25T18:32:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	that'll atleast let you use the commands
2011-07-25T18:34:00.000Z	lenshark		okay i will look that up... so.. is my ip going to be registered in the logs doing the "rm -rf" ?
2011-07-25T18:35:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	should be.. the xternal ip  or atleast the hostname
2011-07-25T18:36:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	btw, is it a within a company's subnet?
2011-07-25T18:36:00.000Z	lenshark		yeah
2011-07-25T18:37:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	u r in problem mate
2011-07-25T18:38:00.000Z	lenshark		damn.. but if they reinstall the os, the logs will be deleted as well, right ?
2011-07-25T18:38:00.000Z	damno_	lenshark	try to login into the a computer using a live sesion and see if u can restore the backups
