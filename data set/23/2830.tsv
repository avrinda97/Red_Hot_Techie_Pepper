2009-08-15T18:12:00.000Z	Segaja		hi, how can i see weither my ubuntu has recognized my TWAIN scanner in the correct manner?
2009-08-15T18:14:00.000Z	Segaja		xsane sais no device found. so does sane-find-scanner
2009-08-15T18:14:00.000Z	Segaja		the modules parport_pc and parport are loaded
2009-08-15T18:16:00.000Z	Segaja		according to mustek.com sane should be able to support it
2009-08-15T18:16:00.000Z	Segaja		the sane homepage aggrees
2009-08-15T18:17:00.000Z	Segaja		so, does anyone else has any idea why my system does not recognise the scanner?
2009-08-15T18:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	make and model?
2009-08-15T18:18:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	mustek MFS-6000SP
2009-08-15T18:21:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	so, andy ideas?
2009-08-15T18:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	should work no problems
2009-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	that is what mustek.com and sane-project.org say :)
2009-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	you installed all the libsane packages?
2009-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	oehm... sane was installed so i guessed they are all installed. but i will check
2009-08-15T18:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	should be at least three
2009-08-15T18:24:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	the following are allready installed: libsane, xsane, xsane-common, sane-utils, sane
2009-08-15T18:26:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	still nothing
2009-08-15T18:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	using what app to scan
2009-08-15T18:26:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	at the moment i'm trying sane-find-scanner, xsane and quiteinsane
2009-08-15T18:32:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	what would you use for scanning?
2009-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	okay thanks. i'll work my way through this doc
2009-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsScannersMustek << this list has not the MFS-6000SP so ubuntu does not support it?
2009-08-15T18:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Segaja	that list is likely out of date, nothing on ubuntuforums show anything wrong, just some eastern european mailing lists
2009-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	Segaja	bazhang	agreed. the SANE homepage is listing the scanner as fully supported
