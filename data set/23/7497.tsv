2005-07-13T09:58:00.000Z	bddebian		heh
2005-07-13T09:58:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	I may be nearing the end of my installation.
2005-07-13T09:59:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	Nice
2005-07-13T10:00:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Okay, gotta go finish up.
2005-07-13T10:01:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Guess it's still installing ubuntu-desktop.
2005-07-13T10:01:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	Good luck :-)
2005-07-13T10:01:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Thanks, I'll need it, with this old PowerBook.
2005-07-13T10:02:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	I love this PowerBook, but boy has this installation been a killer on 'er.
2005-07-13T10:02:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	I have yet to see an Ubuntu GUI.  It's not *the* most important thing, but i'd like to see one, anyway.
2005-07-13T10:37:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Exactly.
2005-07-13T10:36:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	You never told me it was a Smash-n-toss :-)
2005-07-13T10:36:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Sure I did.  Didn't I?
2005-07-13T10:36:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	I think you impied it :-)
2005-07-13T10:36:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	It's a PowerBook.
2005-07-13T10:36:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	Wallstreet?
2005-07-13T10:37:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Why, do I have some more pain to look forward to?
2005-07-13T10:37:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Was that an "Ah" or an "Ahhhhh!"
2005-07-13T10:37:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Or rather, an "aaargh!"?
2005-07-13T10:37:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	Dunno, I haven't tried Ubuntu on one.  I used to run Debian on a few.
2005-07-13T10:38:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Okay, I'm off to starx.
2005-07-13T10:38:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	Good luck :-)
2005-07-13T10:38:00.000Z	Harold_installin	bddebian	Before I begin, how will I get out of X/return to the terminal?
2005-07-13T10:39:00.000Z	bddebian	Harold_installin	That's always the fun part on Mac's isn't it :-)
