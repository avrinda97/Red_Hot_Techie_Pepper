2007-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	gantrixx		It's been a while since I installed Ubuntu
2007-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	gantrixx		are the iso images "live" CDs where you need an internet connection to complete the install?
2007-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	gantrixx		cool, thanks guys
2007-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	the live cd and the alternate cd can install without a net connection; the live cd depends more on the net though
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	use the tab key to get to ok
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	thanks
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	that will take a bit to find, had the same issue here
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	the ms fonts that is
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	yes
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	how do I recover from the ms fonts error?
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	what error do you get from apt-get
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	Errors were encountered while processing:
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	does update/upgrade/install packages otherwise work ok
2009-11-04T17:45:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	yes it runs, but it can't install any packages, it always reports this error
2009-11-04T17:46:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	and the same thing if I run the graphical package manager
2009-11-04T17:47:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	what were you trying to install? the ubuntu-restricted-extras package, correct ? what about other items, what errors (apart from the ms fonts error) do you get
2009-11-04T17:48:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	yes
2009-11-04T17:48:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	but since then I've tried to install other things
2009-11-04T17:49:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	none of them seem to complete because it always hangs on the ttf-mscorefonts thing
2009-11-04T17:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	they do install
2009-11-04T17:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	and the ms fonts issue will eventually connect with those outside repos
2009-11-04T17:50:00.000Z	gantrixx	bazhang	what do you mean "eventually connect"?
2009-11-04T17:51:00.000Z	bazhang	gantrixx	it took me 5 tries of erroring out before they installed (error out/time out)
