2005-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	pland		hello all
2005-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	pland		could someone give me a good sources.list line for debian testing packages? I need ruby 1.9
2005-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	pland		everything I try gives me 'couldn't stat packages'
2005-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	don't mix debian and ubuntu pacakges
2005-11-07T13:46:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	can't find ubuntu package for ruby 1.9 and I'm in a hurry :-(
2005-11-07T13:47:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	if you mix debian and ubuntu packages you will most likey break your machine
2005-11-07T13:47:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	right now all I need is that one package...unless someone can tell me that there is an ubuntu ruby 1.9 package, I'll have to grab from debian
2005-11-07T13:47:00.000Z	pland		or compile ruby
2005-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	ruby 1.9 isn't in debian testing
2005-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	testing has 1.8.2
2005-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	actually I mean debian unstable
2005-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	but there isn't a ruby 1.9 in ubuntu, right?
2005-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	unstable is also 1.8.2
2005-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	you'll have to compile from source
2005-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	I can see a 1.9 package in unstable
2005-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	looking at it
2005-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/ruby
2005-11-07T13:51:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ruby1.9
2005-11-07T13:52:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	so download the deb and install it, see if it works
2005-11-07T13:52:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	huh yup ok
2005-11-07T13:53:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	wait, ruby1.9 is in breezy
2005-11-07T13:53:00.000Z	NoUse	pland	apt-get install ruby1.9
2005-11-07T13:53:00.000Z	pland	NoUse	huh, oh ok! but need breezy lines in sources.list?
