2008-05-11T18:29:00.000Z	ak5		so nothing apart from failed cd integrity test that could be the cause for install hanging up at 75% ?
2008-05-11T18:30:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	you removed quiet and splash from boot parameters to see the exact errors yet?
2008-05-11T18:31:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	I am using alternate cd - and no
2008-05-11T18:31:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	ah the alternate cd; then there is no splash--you check iso against md5
2008-05-11T18:31:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	yes
2008-05-11T18:32:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	this a dual boot or only ubuntu
2008-05-11T18:33:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	only xubuntu
2008-05-11T18:33:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	what are the system specs
2008-05-11T18:33:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	pretty bad - 500mhz p3 and 64mb ram
2008-05-11T18:34:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	it is the ram most likely--you might try fluxbuntu
2008-05-11T18:34:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	hmm, wouldn't that give me an error message before trying to install?
2008-05-11T18:34:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	:/
2008-05-11T18:35:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	no real idea; just a guess on my part; 64mb is pretty slim in the ram department
2008-05-11T18:35:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	yeah
2009-08-20T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	they co-exist
2009-08-20T17:46:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	yes, thank I know, I was wondering if there was a package that replaces 3.0 instead of me having to do it manually
2009-08-20T17:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	you need to keep 3 installed when installing 3.5
2009-08-20T17:47:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	why, exactly?
2009-08-20T17:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	see the link above?
2009-08-20T17:49:00.000Z	ak5	bazhang	I stumbled across that, when I googled, I was just wondering why something like this can not be a end-user choice - upgrading 9.04 to karmic (isn't that unstable?) because I want to use a newer version of my browser seems kind of strange, for the lack of a better word
2009-08-20T17:52:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	from the repos? using the package manager? no.
2009-08-20T17:53:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	3.5 is in the repos for jaunty. and is final.
2012-05-21T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ak5	#ubuntu-cn
