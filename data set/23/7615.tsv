2005-06-11T15:54:00.000Z	Chislon		why is it that freebsd doesnt use gnome or kde by default and that the linux things all seem to like those best?
2005-06-11T15:55:00.000Z	Chislon		also do you all recommend freebsd if im just not doing servers but using it more as a desktop/workstation
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	Chislon		oh
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	Chislon		no it snot

2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	Chislon		sorry i got confused, but im basically trying to decide between ubuntu or freebsd
2005-06-11T15:57:00.000Z	dennis__	Chislon	what are you using the pc for?
2005-06-11T15:58:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	i want to get into programming, i hear starting with python is good, and id like to do blendering and stuff, id also like to do flash like stuff, flash is for windwos though, but i dont know if there is an equivalent linux type software or bsd software?
2005-06-11T15:59:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	why do you say that, just so i cna understand please? i thought you said it was good for workstation, is that what using it for programming and such is?
2005-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	how do you mean
2005-06-12T16:02:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	well take flash out of hte picture then what do you think
2005-06-12T16:03:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	there is netbsd, freebsd, and openbsd, im talkinga bout freebsd
2005-06-12T16:03:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	could you explain why that is then over ubuntu?
2005-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	otherwise ud do fbsd?  what do you use wine/cedega for
2005-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	right, but i figure ill need to keep windows to do most games
2005-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	 and there is a free version of cedega right
2005-06-12T16:13:00.000Z	dennis__	Chislon	you are very very new right?
2005-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	Chislon	dennis__	yep, but that doesnt mean i dont understand the differnece between being nice, and someone trying to way two options against each other, what better source is there then those two places, to ask them about themselves adn there ideas of the other, i think that is very typical and reasonable way people make decisions all the time
2005-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	dennis__	Chislon	pm me if you need more info on FreeBSD
