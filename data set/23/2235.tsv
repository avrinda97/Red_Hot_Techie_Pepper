2010-11-19T19:34:00.000Z	jyg		Hello all
2010-11-19T19:34:00.000Z	jyg		every since I upgraded to 10.10 my phone no longer mounts
2010-11-19T19:34:00.000Z	jyg		i'm looking at /var/log/messages and it seems to recognize usb storage
2010-11-19T19:34:00.000Z	jyg		and it does a usb mode switch
2010-11-19T19:35:00.000Z	jyg		but I never get a device (let along an automount)
2010-11-19T19:35:00.000Z	jyg		er, let alone
2010-11-19T19:35:00.000Z	jyg		i just did an apt-get upgrade, didn't help
2010-11-19T19:35:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	jyg	dmesg would be the place to look, not syslog
2010-11-19T19:38:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	yes i mean dmesg
2010-11-19T19:41:00.000Z	jyg		logs from my computer trying to mount the phone's disk   http://pastebin.ca/1996342
2010-11-19T19:45:00.000Z	jyg		ugh i think i'm going back to 9
2010-11-19T19:47:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	jyg	are you grepping for that pastebin?
2010-11-19T19:47:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	nope, just showing the relevant lines
2010-11-19T19:49:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	jyg	just seems odd that since it is recognized as a generic usb mass storage device but not creating a device address
2010-11-19T19:50:00.000Z	jyg		conv1ct, exactly
2010-11-19T19:50:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	usb drives, building sd card slot, all load find
2010-11-19T19:51:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	jyg	tis why i asked if you were grepping, since `grep usb` would not show the relevant info
2010-11-19T19:51:00.000Z	jyg		if i take the sd card out of th ephone and put it into the sd slot, it reads fine
2010-11-19T19:51:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	not grepping, just cut and paste of relevant lines
2010-11-19T19:52:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	all those lines are contiguous'
2010-11-19T19:59:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	jyg	it does the same to my phone actually...
2010-11-19T19:59:00.000Z	jyg		blargh
2010-11-19T20:02:00.000Z	jyg	c0nv1ct	bbiaf
