2011-02-08T01:27:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- this is a windows machine i am on trying to browse a ubuntu share
2011-02-08T01:29:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	edit your .conf file to allow guests
2011-02-08T01:30:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- http://pastebin.com/5jgw8eqX <-- that is my conf file
2011-02-08T01:30:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- line 240
2011-02-08T01:32:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- any thoughts now you can see my conf ?
2011-02-08T01:35:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	this should help you http://www.debuntu.org/guest-file-sharing-with-samba
2011-02-08T01:37:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- by you referencing my to that link can you see why my smb.conf is not working?
2011-02-08T01:37:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- because I don't really want to have a no user/pass login on this share
2011-02-08T01:37:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- I would prefer to just get it working if possible
2011-02-08T01:39:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	did it work
2011-02-08T01:39:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- I didnt try it cos I don't really want to not use a password.. but I will test it now 1 sec
2011-02-08T01:42:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	oh, then sudo smbpasswd -a username
2011-02-08T01:47:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- my smb.conf doesnt match to what it is telling me to do
2011-02-08T01:49:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	try sudo smbpasswd -a username
2011-02-08T01:51:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	- ok 1 sec
2011-02-08T01:52:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	 - hmm ok it accepted the password but it doesnt show any files
2011-02-08T01:52:00.000Z	Kingsy	hk4l	 - hmm ok it accepted the password but it doesnt show any files
2011-02-08T01:55:00.000Z	hk4l	Kingsy	dumb question is there any files in the folder?
