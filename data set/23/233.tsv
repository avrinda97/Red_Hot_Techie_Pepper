2012-03-07T05:58:00.000Z	che687		roasted_: if you are running ati cards you have to be careful of driver selection
2012-03-07T05:58:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	as I mentioned I'm on Nvidia.
2012-03-07T05:59:00.000Z	che687		with nvida it isn't too bad...
2012-03-07T05:59:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	which is why I went with Nvidia. But no dice :(
2012-03-07T06:01:00.000Z	che687		you have to EXPORT DEVICE 1:2 to get the third.... but make sure you have them properly defined in xconfig
2012-03-07T06:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	can this not be done through nvidia-settings?
2012-03-07T06:01:00.000Z	che687		i know i have syntax wrong... but you can look it up
2012-03-07T06:01:00.000Z	che687		no... nvida dose not have gui tools to do this
2012-03-07T06:03:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	I have 3 ati cards running for some gpu number crunching and the crossfire thing screws umbuntu all up
2012-03-07T06:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	sigh. I wish I hadn't gotten this card now.
2012-03-07T06:05:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	its not that bad.... just look up some multi monitor set ups in google... you can export as many displays as you want... just have to set up xconfig and all
2012-03-07T06:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	so you're actively running 3 monitors?
2012-03-07T06:06:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	I have in the past run 4... but i only use them now for # crunching
2012-03-07T06:07:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	do you just manually edit xorg?
2012-03-07T06:08:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	yea... but same as ATI .. there are command line utilities for Nvida that u can use that do part of it for you ...
2012-03-07T06:08:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	I have yet to find any in my googling. :*(
2012-03-07T06:09:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	.... what card are you using
2012-03-07T06:09:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	Nvidia GT440 and Nvidia 6200.
2012-03-07T06:10:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	you have to be carfull about using different cards togeather in linux... x will do weird things
2012-03-07T06:10:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	I was told it would work. sigh...
2012-03-07T06:10:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	this is definitely a bummer. So glad I bought this darn card.
2012-03-07T06:12:00.000Z	Roasted_	che687	it's a shame I can't run all 3 off my GT440. It had 3 ports, but it sounds like I can only use 2 at a time.
2012-03-07T06:12:00.000Z	che687	Roasted_	 type   "nvidia_xconfig  --help" in a shell and see what you get
