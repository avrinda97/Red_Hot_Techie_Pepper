2006-11-29T11:28:00.000Z	scena		IS anyone here familiar with Ubuntu BIND9 and Windows systems?
2006-11-29T11:29:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	with bind9 and with ubuntu, and with windows systems, but not together. What problem do you have?
2006-11-29T11:30:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	I'm running BIND9 on my Ubuntu 6.06.1LTS station. I've got other Ubuntu boxes taht use it & DNS works fine. However, if I have any Windows box try to query it I get either time outs or non existant domains.
2006-11-29T11:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	what command are you using on windows to query? Have you doublechecked the windows machines query your dns servers?
2006-11-29T11:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	I assume you are using   dig  in ubuntu to test dns?
2006-11-29T11:31:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	I do: nslookup "machine name" ex: nslookup herbie.sjc-net.com
2006-11-29T11:31:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	their primary DNS is set to my DNS server
2006-11-29T11:33:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	Even I do not herbie.sjc-net.com , actually not even sjc-net.com
2006-11-29T11:34:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	whois claims the domain does not exist.
2006-11-29T11:34:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	if I perform the look up from any Ubuntu/Linux box I get what I expect. But if I try it from Windows, it fails. The only thing I can think of is I only have a forward zone. Do I need the reverse as well?
2006-11-29T11:34:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	you were trying some local fake domain setup?
2006-11-29T11:34:00.000Z	scena		lynoure: yes. its all local. its an internal network only. its not exposed to the outside world.
2006-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	I'd recommend not using real toplevels for that.
2006-11-29T11:36:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	This would not happen to be for schoolwork or something? :)
2006-11-29T11:36:00.000Z	scena		lynoure: no. experimenting with Ubuntu in server roles here at work.
2006-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	my wild guess would be that the windows machines are checking with toplevel name servers about  sjc-net.com and then give up as they get "does not exist" for it, but I do not know how to change it.
2006-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	scena		lynoure: see thats what i cant get... they are part of sjc-net.com, and the DNS server is set to be my server.
2006-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	I told you there does not seem to be sjc-net.com, or at least whois says so, so if .com is asked about it, those name servers will also say it does not exist
2006-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	not a problem you,d have with a real domain
2006-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	its a private domain. so why wouldnt the first DNS server which holds the sjc-net.com domain return it?
2006-11-29T11:43:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	I can poke around a bit if you tell me what the nameserver is
2006-11-29T11:43:00.000Z	scena	Lynoure	You cant get to it. Its not exposed.
2006-11-29T11:43:00.000Z	Lynoure	scena	ok, then I think I'll leave you to it, it just being a trial anyway
