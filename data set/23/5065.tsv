2007-03-04T07:05:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Gaim? As IM Client? Yes, once in a while.
2007-03-04T07:06:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	What protocoll?
2007-03-04T07:11:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Let me set up a Yahoo account for testing. Second.
2007-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	comosicus	paradroid	how it's working?
2007-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Got the account set up.
2007-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Sorry, I had to think a lot to remember my password. ;)
2007-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Long time I used the Yahoo account.
2007-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Anyway, so now...
2007-03-04T07:23:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	You want to add a buddy and then ...
2007-03-04T07:31:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Yeah, go on. You need to tell me what happens when you want to add a buddy.
2007-03-04T07:31:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	I'll try to reproduce.
2007-03-04T07:34:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	So I just added you (using this nick) to my buddy list.
2007-03-04T07:34:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	It told me also you were not on the server list, then I querried your info
2007-03-04T07:34:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Now you show up fine.
2007-03-04T07:50:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	What version of Gaim do you use?
2007-03-04T07:51:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	What is the server you are trying to connect to?
2007-03-04T07:51:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	scs.yahoo.com or scs.msg.yahoo.com
2007-03-04T08:02:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	I'm reading it right now.. a second, please
2007-03-04T08:04:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	I can only second IndyGunFreak. One work-around seems to be to add those buddies using the "official" client.
2007-03-04T08:06:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	I am not sure, they should be stored on the server along with their permissions.
2007-03-04T08:07:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	Actually, I would say yes. They should migrate.
2007-03-04T08:12:00.000Z	paradroid	comosicus	;)
