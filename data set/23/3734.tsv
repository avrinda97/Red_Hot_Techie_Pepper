2008-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	 why do you think he needs that line?
2008-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	 to allow it to do a masquerading
2008-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	eth0 is his WAN interface, not eth0
2008-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	could you care to elaborate on why it is not a good  idea?
2008-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	okay he change it to eth0 , i have it posted to him as  EXTERNALINTFCHERE
2008-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	but he has it configure to pick off the assigned ip address on eth0  so effect is same noh?
2008-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	i never assumed anything on his setup
2008-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	but the QoS cannot be seen from iptables noh? it would be from his route tables?
2008-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	right, tc does QoS, iptables does firewall. but they work together.
2008-02-24T11:02:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	he's using vmware to virtualize the router.
2008-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	one heck of a complex setup, each interface vmware provides external is natted, so each guest has a separate ip address and usually in different subnet
2008-02-24T11:05:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	not my network.
2008-02-24T11:06:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	i thought so ...having switches in there didnt seem to make sense if he was using vmware
2008-02-24T11:14:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	I do tech support for this crap. this is my day in, day out.
2008-02-24T11:15:00.000Z	amenado	rjune	i knew, i have done it far far too long..thats why the thin hairline..haha

2008-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	rjune	amenado	he's in europe, e1 or e3. e1 == 2Mb, I forget what an e3 is
