2005-10-05T16:27:00.000Z	jebus2		hello?
2005-10-05T16:28:00.000Z	jebus2		as do I
2005-10-05T16:28:00.000Z	jebus2		Mine is a dual boot question
2005-10-05T16:28:00.000Z	jebus2		any takers?
2005-10-05T16:29:00.000Z	jebus2		I have xp running on a RAID 0 and I have a spare hard drive to set up Ubuntu on..how can I dual boot these?
2005-10-05T16:30:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	and you want to use this additional hdd for ubuntu only?
2005-10-05T16:30:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	well I think that it should run without problems
2005-10-05T16:31:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	if you can then you could temporarily unplug your raid matrix
2005-10-05T16:31:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	then install ubuntu on additional drive
2005-10-05T16:31:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	and after this just add windows entry to grub
2005-10-05T16:32:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	but this is 'safe' method 'paranoid' :)
2005-10-05T16:33:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	in fact you should just install ubuntu on additional drive (just select partitions where you want to install) and grub entry for windows should appear automagically
2005-10-05T16:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	hmm
2005-10-05T16:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	but you got ubuntu installed properly?
2005-10-05T16:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	and you can boot to ubuntu if you unplug raif?
2005-10-05T16:35:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	is this hardware raid? scsi?
2005-10-05T16:38:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	well first thing is that it propably isn't fully hardware solution - for linux
2005-10-05T16:39:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	but if you wand to install linux on additional hdd
2005-10-05T16:39:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	it shoudn't matter
2005-10-05T16:39:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	if you can just temporarily unplug your raid devices - and install ubuntu on this additional hdd
2005-10-05T16:40:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	make sure that your ubuntu installation is ok - then plug your raid and then you can fight with boot manager again
2005-10-05T16:41:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	theoretically you should have an ability to run linux or windows from grub and linux or windows from nt loader
2005-10-05T16:41:00.000Z	marcin_ant	jebus2	it depends from your hardware
