2006-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	NeF		hey, if i wanted to play games on a linux box, would it be better to use ubuntu or xubuntu
2006-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	It wouldn't matter.
2006-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	If your system is low of resources xfce might give you a bit of an advantage
2006-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	remember that not all games run in ubuntu well / at all
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: which linux works the best with games then?
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	They're all about the same. What games are you looking to play?
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: Savage and warcraft 3
2006-12-17T09:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	have a look at http://appdb.winehq.org and also their websites. They may run under ubuntu natively or you may need to emulate windows (thats what WINE does)
2006-12-19T14:21:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: doesnt work for both, gives same error, i want 6.10 to work
2006-12-19T14:21:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	ext3?
2006-12-19T14:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	wrong person, sorry
2006-12-19T14:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	How did you get the CDs? Download and Burn?
2006-12-19T14:23:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: i dled the 6.10 from the ubuntu site
2006-12-19T14:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	The Desktop CD or the Alternative CD?
2006-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	When you load the 6.10 CD, do you get a prompt which says like "Just hit enter to install", or does it boot into an environment where you can use the mouse and click "Install"?
2006-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	And does it boot fully, until you get to the state I just described?
2006-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: i get to a basic menu, u cant use a mouse, it asked to 1- start/install ubuntu 2- start the graphics in safe mode and i cant remeber the rest of the options
2006-12-19T14:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	And when you go to Start/Install, what happens?
2006-12-19T14:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	Okay. How did you download your .iso file, torrent or normally?
2006-12-19T14:30:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	: normally
2006-12-19T14:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	It could be one of three things. 1) The ISO you downloaded didn't get downloaded completely/properly. 2) The CD you burnt was a bad burn 3) Ubuntu genuinly can't handle your video setup
2006-12-19T14:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	NeF	Please boot the CD, and on the initial menu, select "Check CD for defects", and press enter.
2006-12-19T14:32:00.000Z	NeF	Stormx2	and Cyber_Stalker : ty
