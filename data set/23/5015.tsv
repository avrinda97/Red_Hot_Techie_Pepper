2008-12-18T17:39:00.000Z	badserii		Hi. I'm running an application with Wine. Unfortunately the executable was deleted, but the application still runs. Is it possible to recover the executable from the operative memory? Thank you in advance!
2008-12-18T17:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	yes
2008-12-18T17:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	amazingly
2008-12-18T17:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	as for how...
2008-12-18T17:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	pidof wine
2008-12-18T17:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	that returns what?
2008-12-18T17:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	and try pidof wineserver as well
2008-12-18T17:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	are you there?
2008-12-18T17:43:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	one minute.
2008-12-18T17:43:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	the computer is in other room
2008-12-18T17:44:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	The problem solved! I had a backup. Thank you all!
2008-12-18T17:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	can i help though?
2008-12-18T17:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	supposee you have an application open with a file that you deleted. you need to do something like.
2008-12-18T17:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	pidof <app> or ps aux | grep app
2008-12-18T17:46:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	thanks for hint. One more lesson for me!
2008-12-18T17:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	now, (the pid for the latter command is the 1st number) you need to go to /proc/<pid>/
2008-12-18T17:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	then to task/<pid>/fd
2008-12-18T17:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	ls -l in there
2008-12-18T17:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	notice thaat there are symbolic links that refer to the actual file. the trick here is that these links ARE the actual file
2008-12-18T17:48:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	yes, I see!
2008-12-18T17:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	so you can do something like cat number > /original/path/
2008-12-18T17:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	badserii	and you've just recovered the file from app memory!
2008-12-18T17:49:00.000Z	badserii	kbrooks	It works like magic! Thank you!!!!
