2010-12-14T22:56:00.000Z	Ziber		Whats the easiest way to upgrade a package to the newest version rather than reinstalling it?
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	Ziber		if a package says it needs two others... why wont apt-get build-dep work?
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	just apt-get install <packageName>  will fix dependencies
2010-12-14T22:59:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	seemingly not. http://paste.ziber.org/57071
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	you have broken packages?
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	without the package name it gives http://paste.ziber.org/57072 and with it:
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	http://paste.ziber.org/57073
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	Are version of Ubuntu are you using?  It seems to think you're using unstable or something?
2010-12-14T23:03:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	oh yeah?
2010-12-14T23:04:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	This is a new VPS that I recently bought. Out of habit, I tend to copy /etc/apt/sources.list from other servers I have. I think I copied a 9.04 sources.list to 9.10.
2010-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	possible
2010-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	yay!
2010-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	There are so few sources in the default sources.list tho
2010-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	haha, try slackware!
2010-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	any place i can get a file with more sources, tho?
2010-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	Well you should probably pick each one up individually so that you don't get one in the mix that is malicious
2010-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	true, that'd be smarter.
2010-12-14T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	:)
2010-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	jsut so used to having a myriad of sources. iirc, the ubuntu 9.10 one has... 2? 3?
2010-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	But those 2 or 3 have 20,000 + packages
2010-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	yeah... guess the number of sources dont matter.
2010-12-14T23:11:00.000Z	Ziber	edbian	thanks for your help
2010-12-14T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	Ziber	you figured it out
