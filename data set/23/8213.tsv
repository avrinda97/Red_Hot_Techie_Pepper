2005-04-30T10:04:00.000Z	farruinn		I think xmms calls it esound
2005-04-30T10:05:00.000Z	farruinn		because esd has control of /dev/dsp
2005-04-30T10:05:00.000Z	farruinn		if you killed esd you could use oss I guess
2005-04-30T10:06:00.000Z	farruinn		I think there's also a command that you can run that forces other apps to use esd
2005-04-30T10:08:00.000Z	farruinn		oi, no flood please
2005-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	8 lines is a flood?
2005-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	it may be somewhat quiet in here now, but when this place is really hopping it gets extremely annoying
2005-04-30T10:12:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	grumpysmurf, what is the threshold considered for flooding?
2005-04-30T10:12:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	a couple lines is tolerable, but as little as possible is best
2005-04-30T10:13:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	can you explain the commands you were suggesting I run with sudo?
2005-04-30T10:13:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	apt-get build-dep gets the packages necessary to build kernel-patches-mppe from source
2005-04-30T10:14:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	and then I would still need to apt-get install it?
2005-04-30T10:15:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	thank you.
2005-04-30T10:16:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	out of curiousity, what architecture do you use?
2005-04-30T10:17:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	I use k7
2005-04-30T10:18:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	have you run apt-get update recently? the package should be available for all archs
2005-04-30T10:18:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	it's in universe btw
2005-04-30T10:19:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	I have the universe repo enabled.
2005-04-30T10:21:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	I'd ask in #ubuntu-motu, they should know what's going on with it
2005-04-30T10:49:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	no-one in #ubuntu-motu is responding. At all.
2005-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	perhaps none of them maintain it, you could post to the ubuntu-users mailing list
2005-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	farruinn	WebMaven	this defintely seems like a broken package though
2005-04-30T10:54:00.000Z	WebMaven	farruinn	I mean, I can't even get anyone to say anything. Not even whether the fact that the package isn't listed is sugnificant. Or 'hello'.
