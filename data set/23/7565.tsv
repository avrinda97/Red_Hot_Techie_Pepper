2005-07-02T08:51:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	so if I drop a crontab file in /etc/cron.d, will attention be payed to it?

2005-10-27T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	sudo apt-get install mplayer-k6
2005-10-27T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	look at what apt says
2005-10-27T10:02:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	ok. thanks.
2005-10-27T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	(that command means "yo, try to upgrade that package specifically")
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	... is it going to report any errors before or after it tells me it's going to upgrade a million other packages besides?
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	it of course asks you
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	so I should tell it 'yes' to see the error?
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	no
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	davidmccabe	were you using apt-get upgrade earler?
2005-10-27T10:04:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	nope. I was using synaptic.
2005-10-27T10:04:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	(I haven't actually upgraded anything yet, just changed the repos and downloaded the new packages)
2005-10-27T10:05:00.000Z	davidmccabe	bob2	thanks for your help. I'm gonna go ahead and deal with mplayer later. :)
