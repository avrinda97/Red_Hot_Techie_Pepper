2009-12-26T20:18:00.000Z	adalal		right
2009-12-26T20:18:00.000Z	adalal		anyone knows why i would not be able to get keys of the ubuntu keyservers but other computer in the same network can?
2009-12-26T20:20:00.000Z	adalal		anyone knows why one computer in a network wouldn't be able to connect to keyserver.ubuntu.com while other cmputers in the network can?
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	can it ping it and nslookup it, can it ping it?
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	yup
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	how would i perform an nslookup?
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	can you traceroute to it?
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	nslookup keyserver.whatever.fish
2009-12-26T20:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	just replace the command in your ping with nslookup, make sure it resolves to the same IP on a system which is ok
2009-12-26T20:22:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	on it
2009-12-26T20:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	you can also install traceroute on a good system and the bad system to see where they differ
2009-12-26T20:23:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	yup.. came back.. will try tracerouting it
2009-12-26T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	you can also use an alternative keyserver like: pgp.mit.edu
2009-12-26T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	they all sync with each other so its the same data
2009-12-26T20:24:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	oh okay :)
2009-12-26T20:26:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	traceroute in both the bad and the good one stops at a canonical server
2009-12-26T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	use pgp.mit.edu   instead
2009-12-26T22:48:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	i'm trying to use add-apt-repository :P
2009-12-26T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	i always add the repo in sources.list then use the right command to import the key
2009-12-26T22:49:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	guntbert: i dont mind using that, but why is my computer in the entire network the only one not accessing that server?
2009-12-26T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	you asked ealier and I have no idea based on what you reported from the tests
2009-12-26T22:55:00.000Z	adalal	ActionParsnip1	guntbert: can't import from there either :S timed out as well when i used 'sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 28CBC482'
2009-12-26T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adalal	you can manually download the key and import it
