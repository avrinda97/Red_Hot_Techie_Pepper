2010-11-16T17:04:00.000Z	idodeisuke	gogeta	the network manager says that networling is disabled and all efforts to change this have failed (ticking the enable networking menu entry becuase it is grayed out, deleting the networkmanager.state file, using sudo /etc/init.d/networking start or restart). do you know what to do?
2010-11-16T17:05:00.000Z	gogeta	idodeisuke	yea that likes to bug itsself gone

2010-11-16T17:06:00.000Z	gogeta	idodeisuke	otherwise wicd will fail
2010-11-16T17:08:00.000Z	gogeta	idodeisuke	yea you have to remove network-manager after installing wicd or they like to conflict
