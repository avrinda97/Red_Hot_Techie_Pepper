2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	Creationist		Is it possible to have Sound Juicer rip CDs faster?  Right now it's only reading at 4.5x for some reason.
2008-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Owe me a beer. :-p
2008-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Yes, but you forgot to mention OpenGL.
2008-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	You could also look into Crossover Games.
2008-04-06T14:25:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	GnomeBaker
2008-04-06T14:26:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	That rips too, huh?  Faster than 4.5x?
2008-04-06T14:26:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Yep.
2008-04-06T14:26:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Actually, gimme one second and I'll check the speed to be sure.
2008-04-06T14:28:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	Hmm... I can't even find the option to rip it lol
2008-04-06T14:29:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Or not.  My bad.  It just copies.  Why not just use VLC?
2008-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	Will that rip to .OGG?
2008-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Quick open the disc, then select wizard, transcode as vorbis, select bitrate, save as whatever.  Yeah.
2008-04-06T14:31:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	THanks for the tip, but I'm looking for something a little more straightforward - like Sound Juicer but faster than 4.5x (which is ridiculously slow)
2008-04-06T14:34:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	And again.. you're more detailed ;)  The program question was my next one.
2008-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	I've been a tech support slave.
2008-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	Man, I get so frustrated just telling my mother how to login lol.... over, and over, and over again.
2008-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	I did AOL support... [there's nothing worse].  And Dell Corporate Business Group, and Dell Small Business.
2008-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	Worse than AOL could be MS.
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	I hate totem too, but can't get rid of it without getting rid of the mozilla plugin (the only plugin that works for me)
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Eh.  Support for Dell = Windows + Hardware.
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	Good point.
2008-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	Creationist	ChaosParser	If you're into comedy, search Google for "neurotically yours tech support" :)
2008-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	ChaosParser	Creationist	Foamy is my hero.
