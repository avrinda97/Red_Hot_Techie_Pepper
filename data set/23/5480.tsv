2008-02-20T06:13:00.000Z	Dante123		so levander if I edit the fstab file- do I just comment out the drives I don't want to mount on startup by putting a # in front of the line? like this:
2008-02-20T06:14:00.000Z	Dante123		# UUID=C654A0BD54A0B19B /media/sda1     ntfs    defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
2008-02-20T06:15:00.000Z	Dante123		I'm not sure I understand levander.  My friend has a DellRecovery partition that gets automounted.  We would like to get rid of that particular partition from mounting at all.  How do we do this simply?
2008-02-20T06:17:00.000Z	Dante123		okay danbhfive....that will just affect that one partition...not say the sda1 partition we still want mounted
2008-02-20T06:17:00.000Z	Dante123		danbhfive..u got me scared cause its my friends computer.
2008-02-20T06:19:00.000Z	Dante123		okay danbhfive I will only comment out lines...no editing or deleting.
2008-02-20T06:19:00.000Z	Dante123		And just the line that has to do with those partitions
2008-02-20T06:19:00.000Z	Dante123		such as Dellrecovery etc.
2008-02-20T06:19:00.000Z	Dante123		Thanks for the help.
2008-02-20T06:20:00.000Z	Dante123		One last thing.  How can i create a launcher on desktop to open a terminal, switch to a directory, and run a command?
2008-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Dante123	shell script
2008-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	Dante123	Agent_bob	how do you create one of those
2008-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	Dante123		just a text editor
2008-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Dante123	 in a text editor
2008-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	Dante123		So would this work:  terminal
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Dante123		cd Desktop
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Dante123		cd CODSERVER
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Dante123	something like     cd /some/dir ;exec some command --with args
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Dante123		codserver
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Dante123	  you can make a link to your script and have it open in a terminal.
2008-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	Dante123		okay...how is this look:  cd /som/dir; exec codserver
2008-02-20T06:23:00.000Z	Dante123		its for my kids to start the call of duty server
2008-02-20T06:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Dante123	when you save your shell script.  put it some place you wont accidently delete it    mkdir -p $HOME/bin   <<< maybe  put it in ~/bin  and make it executable.      it's real simple.
