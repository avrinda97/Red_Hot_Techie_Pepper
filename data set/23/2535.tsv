2009-11-25T22:16:00.000Z	blck		how do I cut the last 5 signs out of a string via the bash
2009-11-25T22:17:00.000Z	Slart	blck	last 5 signs?? last 5 lines? or 5 last characters?
2009-11-25T22:20:00.000Z	Slart	blck	hmm.. perhaps grep can do it..
2009-11-25T22:20:00.000Z	Slart	blck	let me fiddle around with it for a second..
2009-11-25T22:26:00.000Z	Slart	blck	you could do something like this   tail -n 1 yourfile | egrep -o .{5}$
2009-11-25T22:26:00.000Z	Slart	blck	there's probably an easier way.. but that's at least one solution that works
2009-11-25T22:27:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Thanks, I'll try
2009-11-25T22:30:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Now http://pastebin.com/d3974d12f he says that he  couldn't find text
2009-11-25T22:31:00.000Z	Slart	blck	don't you need to use $text on line 3 ?
2009-11-25T22:32:00.000Z	Slart	blck	or just do it all on one line smartctl -A /dev/sda | grep -E 'Load_Cycle_Count|193' | tail -n 1 | egrep -o .{5}$ > /.conky/hdd_spin.txt
2009-11-25T22:34:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Cryptic bash :) Your line does not echo anything, when I edit the 5 to 10 or whatever I get more characters back or?
2009-11-25T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	blck	correct.. that's the number of characters it should return
2009-11-25T22:36:00.000Z	Slart	blck	hmm.. let me check
2009-11-25T22:37:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Get it... the sudo was missing
2009-11-25T22:37:00.000Z	Slart	blck	ah.. tricky
2009-11-25T22:38:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Now he echos something like this: http://pastebin.com/d20b893be
2009-11-25T22:39:00.000Z	Slart	blck	can you include the command line in that pastebin?
2009-11-25T22:40:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Sure have a look here -- http://pastebin.com/m746f7f43 :)
2009-11-25T22:41:00.000Z	Slart	blck	odd.. it works on my machine
2009-11-25T22:42:00.000Z	Slart	blck	here.. http://pastebin.com/m74b2670c
2009-11-25T22:44:00.000Z	blck	Slart	Get it! The $ in the end was missing, thanks for help
2009-11-25T22:44:00.000Z	Slart	blck	ahh.. you're welcome
