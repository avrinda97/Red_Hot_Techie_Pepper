2010-05-31T14:34:00.000Z	jake__		anybody here using lucid?
2010-05-31T14:35:00.000Z	jake__		i have a machine running an amd sempron! any specific bugs or otherwise that i need to be aware of Dr_Willis. i have intrepid right now and i want to update :)
2010-05-31T14:36:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	I don't think you will have any problem, I have another pc on celeron and no problem
2010-05-31T14:37:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	If it's a cleen install, you shouldn't have any problem, but some of us had problem with update... (just "some", as : not often)
2010-05-31T14:38:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	I had no problem with my wireless card...
2010-05-31T14:39:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	livecd is a good way to find out about the wireless
2010-05-31T14:41:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	It wasn't related to the driver, just the update, If you do a clean install, you should be good
2010-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	or burn a DVD... ?
2010-05-31T14:48:00.000Z	jake__	Galerien	once i do a clean install, which will be a dual boot, do i need to do anything to the grub for my windows xp to show up?
2010-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	I don't think that grup add a windows partition just like that...
2010-05-31T14:51:00.000Z	jake__	Galerien	so there is something that i would need to do! sorry, i am a complete n00b :)
2010-05-31T14:51:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	hold on a sec
2010-05-31T14:52:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	RTFM ==> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto ;)
2010-05-31T14:53:00.000Z	jake__	Galerien	it says these notes do not apply to a clean install of karmic or later :)
2010-05-31T14:53:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	then you are safe I guess :D
2010-05-31T14:53:00.000Z	jake__	Galerien	sounds good :D

2010-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	ok
2010-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	wait
2010-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	wait a sec
2010-05-31T15:03:00.000Z	Galerien	jake__	To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install » - See also !automate
