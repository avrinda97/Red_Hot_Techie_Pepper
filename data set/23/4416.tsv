2007-08-28T16:40:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	try samba
2007-08-28T16:40:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	:)
2007-08-28T16:41:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	im on a shared network, they don't have samba or anything i just want something similar to a My Network Places if your familiar with the primitives of windows
2007-08-28T16:42:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	i may be wrong, but it works for me. i am able to view the windows network. you only configure samba on the linux end, but the windows side is good already

2007-08-28T16:43:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	ooh thanks haha =D
2007-08-28T16:46:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	my problem i guess is my internet is very much a plug and play, i just have an cat5 port in my appartment that my net plugs into, i cant port forward, set static ips, configure routers or anything =(
2007-08-28T16:46:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	one thing that was missing with that tut is to add the IP of the windows box in /etc/hosts
2007-08-28T16:46:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	im sure wireshark can do that
2007-08-28T16:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	i didn't do those and my xp and fiesty communicates quite well.
2007-08-28T16:47:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	i guess all i can do is try
2007-08-28T16:49:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	the ip's are only needed for name resolution or something like that... well it's supposed to speed up the access times. that's one of the problems i encountered
2007-08-28T16:49:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	no expert here.... just sharing what worked for me.. :)\
2007-08-28T16:49:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	i guess a windows partition would be handy to get the IPs aslong as they are static i guess
2007-08-28T16:49:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	no problem im far far far from expert so any advice helps
2007-08-28T16:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	if you only want to connect to the windows network, i think samba should do the trick.
2007-08-28T16:51:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	does it suport a novel client login? or should i not be asking so many lazy questions heh
2007-08-28T16:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	lost me there... haha
2007-08-28T16:53:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	some networks you have to login through a "secure" network identifier Novell is just that but i guess i will just find out
2007-08-28T05:09:00.000Z	boontoo	gvsa123	it asks for a password but i have no password policy on that machine this is odd isnt it =(
2007-08-28T05:10:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	if i recall correctly, when your windows machine doesn't have a password, you leave it blank... or create a password for it would be easier and safer i guess.. :)
2007-08-28T05:10:00.000Z	gvsa123	boontoo	juuuust a little bit... :)
