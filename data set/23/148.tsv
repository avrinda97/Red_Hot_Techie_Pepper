2012-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		Hi, I think I had trashed my entire system. How do I reinstall Linux from cmd line?
2012-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		I dont have cd, Do I need to redo the USB thing again?
2012-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	you have the iso on computer?
2012-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	ImperialDroid	cfhowlett	I do not know. How do I find out?
2012-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	kinda hoping you had saved it to the hdd.  If not, download the iso, make a usb/cdrom and reinstall.
2012-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		Anyone have a link to a good explanation about reinstalling linux with a USB device?

2012-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		I dont have Windows, how do I get into the boot menu?
2012-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	windows has nothing to do with bios.  During initial boot, you'll see "press *some Key* for boot options.
2012-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		Ok, I will try that cfhowlett, thanks
2012-08-29T17:35:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		Hi, I was just in here talking about how to get into my BIOS. I restarted my machine and there was no "press this or that to get into BIOS" prompt. How the heck do I get into the BIOS?
2012-08-29T17:36:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	what's your computer make/model?

2012-08-29T17:39:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	looks like F2 might bring up bios.  reboot and hit f2 after the beep
2012-08-29T17:39:00.000Z	ImperialDroid		I cant really look under it because it has so many wires running into it right now
2012-08-29T17:39:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	wait 1

2012-08-29T17:40:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ImperialDroid	tell you what, reboot, hit F2.  doesn't work, reboot hit F3.  Eventually you'll get the bios menu
