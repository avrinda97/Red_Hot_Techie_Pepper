2011-02-17T22:29:00.000Z	juso		damn ubuntu needs to become more mainstream in the eyes of major retailers and such.
2011-02-17T22:29:00.000Z	juso		cant use ubuntu as a main desktop until then.
2011-02-17T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	go ask Dell about Ubuntu
2011-02-17T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	wait, so just because ubuntu isn't "mainstream" you won't use it?
2011-02-17T22:31:00.000Z	juso	ActionParsnip	i said i CANT, not wont. I have too many external devices that arent supported in linux.
2011-02-17T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	then thats the peripheral sellers fault, you could bother them to support Linux more
2011-02-17T22:33:00.000Z	juso	ActionParsnip	so you're saying if all major retailers sold linux as an option OS, the manufactures wont start supporting? come on now.. lets get serious
2011-02-17T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	if Linux got as much support as the companies give to Window there wouldnt be an issue. Sadly many are ignorant. Companies like IBM, Nvidia, Intel, Brother and HP make great Linux drivers and support very well
2011-02-17T22:35:00.000Z	juso	ActionParsnip	exactly. so my point stands..
2011-02-17T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	I think the companies would have to support the OS if they want the "new OS" users to buy their products
2011-02-17T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	amen to what soreau said, vote with yor wallet. Don't give money to companies not supporting Linux
2011-02-17T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	what make / model is the printer / scanner (please not lexmark).....?
2011-02-17T22:38:00.000Z	juso	ActionParsnip	i can print to it, but I cant use the scan to computer options and such, which is why i use it mainly.
2011-02-17T22:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	doesn't answer the question does it
2011-02-17T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	what make / model is the printer/scanner please?
2011-02-17T22:40:00.000Z	juso	ActionParsnip	i need the specific software to run NOT an alternative.
2011-02-17T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	my girlfriends does as I take the SD card out and jam it in a card reader. Ironically it's a Kodak whom HATE linux
2011-02-17T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	what make / model is the printer / scanner please?

2011-02-17T22:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	how can we "google" what hardware YOU have??
2011-02-17T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	I found about 50 different Canon EOS model, care to narrow it down?
2011-02-17T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	what model EOS do you have>?
2011-02-17T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	juso	until you reply to my perfectly reasonable question, nobody can help you at all
