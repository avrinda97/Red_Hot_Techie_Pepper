2007-04-09T09:58:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	Did you backup your system?
2007-04-09T09:59:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	If you are installing beta software, I reccomend a backup in the future. It will save you a lot of headaches
2007-04-09T09:59:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	Didnt think it would be this bad
2007-04-09T09:59:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	What problems are you having?

2007-04-09T10:00:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	ouch
2007-04-09T10:00:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	and the mythtv backend segfaulted
2007-04-09T10:00:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	You may have to uninstall and then re-install
2007-04-09T10:01:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	backup everything you have saved on it so you can keep it of course
2007-04-09T10:01:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	rsync is your friend
2007-04-09T10:02:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	Wish there was a way to get a list of packages that I have installed that DONT come as standard
2007-04-09T10:02:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	then I could make a apt-get list when i reinstall
2007-04-09T10:03:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	hmmm, I bet I could do that in emacs...that's a good idea
2007-04-09T10:04:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	I wouldn't uninstall the whole system just mythtv
2007-04-09T10:04:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	Hows that gonna help, I will still have a unstable mythtv
2007-04-09T10:05:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	I found sometimes an update will break a package but a re-install will stablize it
2007-04-09T10:05:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	acidrip broke on me when I upgraded then a uninstalled and reinstalled and it's been fine for instance
2007-04-09T10:06:00.000Z	richw	clearzen	heh cool.. well i did upgrade from edgy
2007-04-09T10:07:00.000Z	clearzen	richw	I know. I do it to. That's why I back things up now.
