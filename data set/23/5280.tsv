2007-02-01T16:23:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		I know everyone here wants to be in the position that they could donate a supercomputer and an OC connection, but how many of you are? :P
2007-02-01T16:23:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	beowulf cluster up a bunch of old xboxes off ebay now that the christmass kiddies got their new gamesystems
2007-02-01T16:25:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	I need monies! D:
2007-02-01T16:25:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	that is a common theme everywhere
2007-02-01T16:26:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	are you just playing games with us?  You are not being serious i hope, lol!
2007-02-01T16:27:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	I can get a superman sticker and slap it on an old pc/xt for you... does that count?
2007-02-01T16:27:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	Send me a standard computer and it'd be a dream come true. :P
2007-02-01T16:28:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	dead serious:  if i could i would. but i am between jobs and can't even afford the gas to get to interviews... talk about a catch 22 i am worried about a place to live in a few weeks.
2007-02-01T16:29:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	Borrow your parent's car.
2007-02-01T16:29:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	but if you go to www.freecycle.org with an HONEST plea and explanation of why posted to a local list, I am sure you'll find someone who will donate a computer for you .. you'll just have to pick it up.
2007-02-01T16:30:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	I once gave away a 1986 Camaro to a family thru freecycle
2007-02-01T16:30:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	Maybe if you'd sold it you would've had the money for gas. :P
2007-02-01T16:31:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	I have a car and do get gas money loaned to me by my brother.  I will have a job soon... it is just really tight.  I was trying to illustrate the point, not piss and moan.  I will survive anything.  I like camping ;)
2007-02-01T16:31:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	that was like 2 or 3 years ago man
2007-02-01T16:32:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	I'd have spent that money. I have been unemployed since November... christmas season sucks for finding tech jobs, but it is picking up.
2007-02-01T16:32:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	Just what do you need this computer for anyway, if I may ask?
2007-02-01T16:34:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	The hard drive in my Ubuntu computer just crapped itself. It was shitty to begin with though. The on board graphics is faulty.. Everything's just thrown together from spare parts.
2007-02-01T16:35:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	mojo_	I also need some sort of access point or to run wires through my house so I can have more than one computer in my room connected to the net.
2007-02-01T16:36:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	Find your local freecycle list, i am not kidding.  Schools also get donated junk-puters and may have more than they need, so you can rummage for parts.  Churches too sometimes.  But remember, asking for charity usually should be backed up with a reasonable need, like you need it for school or something.  Not I'm broke and can't afford a new toy, understand?
2007-02-01T16:36:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	we can talk off channel if you want me to go on.
2007-02-05T17:04:00.000Z	mojo_	NoEvidenZ	You can have both installed, and the libraries mean you can run KED (QT) programs in GNOME or GNOME (GTK) programs in KDE.  You can log in to either session thru the graphic display manager login (GDM)
