2009-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	blazon		is there a way to find out exactly what needs to be restarted
2009-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	blazon		why the fuck is the kernel auto upgrading
2009-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	blazon		are you serious?
2009-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	blazon		on a server release
2009-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	blazon		wow
2009-12-05T20:43:00.000Z	blazon		i shouldnt have to tell apt, to NOT upgrade the kernel
2009-12-05T20:43:00.000Z	blazon		i should have to tell it TO
2009-12-05T20:44:00.000Z	jrib	blazon	upgrades don't happen unless you tell apt you want to upgrade
2009-12-05T20:44:00.000Z	blazon		it shouldnt requier a reboot
2009-12-05T20:44:00.000Z	blazon		this is a server insyall
2009-12-05T20:44:00.000Z	blazon		i dont ever want to reboot
2009-12-05T20:44:00.000Z	jrib	blazon	to load the new kernel, you need to reboot
2009-12-05T20:46:00.000Z	blazon		i guess im just used to redhats insanley long lifetime and rock solid reliability
2009-12-05T20:46:00.000Z	jrib	blazon	so what happens on redhat if there is a kernel vulnerability and you need a new kernel version?
2009-12-05T20:46:00.000Z	blazon		did you read my first sentence
2009-12-05T20:46:00.000Z	blazon		i just started using Ubuntu server because a developer i work with requested it, and its saying *** System restart required ***
2009-12-05T20:47:00.000Z	blazon	jrib	i think i have been forced into a kernel upgrade once in 8 years
2009-12-05T20:48:00.000Z	blazon		lol
2009-12-05T20:49:00.000Z	blazon		start it d4n1s
2009-12-05T20:49:00.000Z	jrib	blazon	well as I said, ubuntu doesn't force you to upgrade your kernel.  It only gets installed if you ask it to
