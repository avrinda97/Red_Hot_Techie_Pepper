2010-11-13T12:03:00.000Z	Nikkk		Hello - I'm trying to configure LAMP server on my ubuntu 10.04 OS. However, during the mySQL install, the system hasn't prompt me to enter root password. But, all the articles on the web shows it prompts for pasword. What could be the MYSQL password now ? :(

2010-11-13T12:38:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- Hey, but, what wud be the password as default coz, phpMyAdmin installation is prompting me to enter the root password for mySql..but, i donno :(
2010-11-13T12:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	actually the easiest way to rectify this problem is: purge mysql-server then reinstall it... it should re-do the configuation process
2010-11-13T12:42:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	you just want a brand new mysql server, so: sudo apt-get purge mysql-server && sudo apt-get install mysql-server
2010-11-13T12:42:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- I tried that as well. However, it's not prompting for password whatsoever..
2010-11-13T12:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	yeah, if you apt-get remove it will just remove everything but the configuration... which leaves behind the problem you have right now
2010-11-13T12:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	come back and let us know how it went
2010-11-13T12:47:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- Sure ! Right now, I'm updating the files...Once, it's done..I'll be purge..
2010-11-13T13:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	well, you could take a shot with "mysql -u root -p" and try your main User's password... dirty but it might just work

2010-11-13T13:05:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- Take a look at the output and let me know if i must proceed with your last suggestion..http://pastebin.com/g6DqXSb3
2010-11-13T13:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	well, the purge and install seem to have gone well, no issues there
2010-11-13T13:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	that obviously didn't help though, so its time dig a little more and get dirty with mysql
2010-11-13T13:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	so you can try $ mysql -u root -p ;;;;; this will attempt to login as root@localhost and ask for a password
2010-11-13T13:07:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- Yep, i did..n here is the output :'( http://pastebin.com/zDiWwqXp
2010-11-13T13:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	try your 'favorite' password and some random spacebar stuff to see if you can get in
2010-11-13T13:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	see if you can get in w/out password: mysql -u root
2010-11-13T13:08:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	It says "access denied for your 'root@'localshot'(using password:No)"
2010-11-13T13:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	yeah, try what jep1985 said ;)
2010-11-13T13:18:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	sudo sudo sudo!
2010-11-13T13:19:00.000Z	Nikkk	rdw200169	- Didn't get you ? sudo ?
2010-11-13T13:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	Nikkk	haha, sorry, that was rude, i noticed it on line 3 ;)
