2009-07-24T20:15:00.000Z	Milostrife		anyone help me with something im trying to limit the internet so that at 9pm disconnects and will not reconnect until 8am the next day is there anyway i can do that? im running ubuntu on the laptop in question and the internet connection is wireless.
2009-07-24T20:16:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	a little cron job to run iconfig eth0 down would do the trick, however anyone with sudo access could simply bring the interface backup
2009-07-24T20:18:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	the people im trying to limit to dont know about sudo or theterminal but i can i set it up so that it would do it everyday without having to type the command into the laptop each night?
2009-07-24T20:19:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	that is what cron is for
2009-07-24T20:19:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	so the idea is that you would wite a little bash script to bring the interface down and use cron to schedule that, and another script to bring it back upt
2009-07-24T20:20:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	okies i will have a look thanks for help :)
2009-07-24T20:20:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	np
2009-07-24T20:24:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	how would i tell it tell it to disconnet from the internet though i understand the basics but i lack the understanding on how to actual write what i want as in the user/ part
2009-07-24T20:25:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	if you dont need other network connectivity 'sudo ifconfig eth0 down' would do the trick
2009-07-24T20:26:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	eth0 may change if you pastebin the output of ifconfig i can give you the command for your system
2009-07-24T20:26:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	sorry i didn't understand that
2009-07-24T20:27:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	done
2009-07-24T20:28:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	see your pm from ubottu and paste the lnk
2009-07-24T20:29:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	http://paste.ubuntu.com/230651/
2009-07-24T20:30:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	ok so you only have wifi connection to the net/?
2009-07-24T20:30:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	yes
2009-07-24T20:31:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	ok so to bing your interface down you would use the command; sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
2009-07-24T20:31:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	sudo ifconfig wlan0 up would bring it back on again
2009-07-24T20:32:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	 but would i have to enter that everytime i want to disconnet them?
2009-07-24T20:33:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	indeed, so what you do is find out how to write a little bash script that runs the command, once you have that you can use cron to schedule that to happen at a certain time
2009-07-24T20:33:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	where can i find out how to write a bash script
2009-07-24T20:34:00.000Z	moncky	Milostrife	try here http://www.linuxconfig.org/Bash_scripting_Tutorial
2009-07-24T20:35:00.000Z	Milostrife	moncky	Pici thanks :)
