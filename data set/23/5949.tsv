2010-10-15T01:02:00.000Z	Jacen		I'm having some problems with the installation of Ubuntu. After it installed and reboots it stops at the black screen with the horizontal bar. Any ideas what to do?
2010-10-15T01:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	hmm
2010-10-15T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	Which graphics card?
2010-10-15T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	How old is the computer?
2010-10-15T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	black screen with horizontal bar, I guess you mean  boot up screen that went wrong
2010-10-15T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	for the Wubi  did you use an ISO that you downloaded?
2010-10-15T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	maybe just a bad download
2010-10-15T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	still got the ISO?
2010-10-15T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	puts a file on the Windows partition for Ubuntu
2010-10-15T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	lap tops tend to get the problems,  and some computers Ubuntu doesn't like at all,  may depend on the version though.  However sometimes other distros work much better on a computer than Ubuntu,  but I would suggest trying a previous version of Ubuntu such as 10.04, before considering trying another distro.
2010-10-15T01:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	same problem?
2010-10-15T01:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	I am not sure which Nivida card you got, but its not a really fancy one right?
2010-10-15T01:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	Ubuntu tends to work best with standard hardware
2010-10-15T01:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	also as ace_steel is suggesting 9.10 may be a good idea to try
2010-10-15T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	it may just be a Plymouth issue
2010-10-15T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	the boot up
2010-10-15T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	that 10.04 and 10.10 use
2010-10-15T01:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	may be an issue with Plymouth itself, or just the way Ubuntu has done it.  9.10 uses Xsplash instead, and that may work better
2010-10-15T01:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	9.10 also is still supported untill the end of April next year
2010-10-15T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	make sure to md5sum check as well ideally
2010-10-15T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.10
2010-10-15T01:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	and the codes you compare the ISO to are on that 9.10 section as well
2010-10-15T01:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jacen	^^^^^
