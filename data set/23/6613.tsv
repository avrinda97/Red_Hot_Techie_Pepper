2007-01-20T10:46:00.000Z	LycoLoco		anyone around to help a noob out?
2007-01-20T10:46:00.000Z	LycoLoco		heh, ok
2007-01-20T10:47:00.000Z	LycoLoco		I'm trying to copy over my profile from Firefox in Windows to Ubuntu
2007-01-20T10:47:00.000Z	LycoLoco		but no matter where I copy it, Firefox doesn't see the profile
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	LycoLoco		true, I didn't notice that
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	copy it to ~/.mozilla/firefox and then edit profiles.ini
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	I copied it there, but what should I edit profiles.ini to have in it?
2007-01-20T10:49:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	In profiles.ini change Profile0, enter at "Path=" your profile
2007-01-20T10:49:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Just change the path of the default existing profile to the folder name of your windows profile
2007-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Works usually instantly... I share a profile between Win32 and Linux :-)
2007-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	that won't work if I want to update the profile, and I don't trust CaptureNTFS to write to my partition
2007-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Capture Su** ... Use ntfs-3g
2007-01-20T10:51:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	lemme change what I said then, I don't trust ANY NTFS writing utility in Linux, just because if something does happen in that 1% of the time when it screws up, I'm sunk
2007-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	ntfs-3g doesn't screw up. try out.
2007-01-20T10:53:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	I don't trust it with my data that I haven't backed up. now, if I could get some help with getting firefox to recognize this profile... :-)
2007-01-20T10:54:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Well... Usually it works how I told you, just copy over the folder and enter it in profile.ini as path
2007-01-20T11:17:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	could I get a little more help on the firefox profile issue?
2007-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Yep... So... Did you copy the profile dir over? Let's make the example: Copy the profle over (just the folder with extensions.ini and so on in it) ... rename it to "zero" (just an easy to remember name)
2007-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Then use the profile name I'll paste to you as msg
2007-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	yeah, lemme show you what I've done
2007-01-20T11:19:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Okay, showme...
2007-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	LycoLoco	PSIplus	got it working - not sure why it wouldn't take before, but now it did
2007-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	PSIplus	LycoLoco	Thougth so ;-) ... Have Fun!
