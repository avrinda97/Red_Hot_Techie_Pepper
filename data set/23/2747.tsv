2009-01-27T06:34:00.000Z	poutine		Is there anyway to completely disable pulseaudio and switch back to primarily using alsa?
2009-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	exodus_ms	poutine	I have a link to troubleshooting pulseaudio from the forums, do you want to take a look?
2009-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	poutine		no
2009-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	poutine		I want to disable it
2009-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	poutine		not troubleshoot it
2009-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	poutine		linus should have gotten on the whole audio problem before OSS/ALSA matured
2009-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	poutine		I know there's got to be many others who hate pulseaudio as much as me
2009-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	exodus_ms	poutine	I believe you can just select alsa everything
2009-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	poutine	exodus_ms	Where? In Ksolitaire?
2009-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	exodus_ms	poutine	sure try that, let me know how it goes
2009-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	poutine	exodus_ms	you gave a poor answer
2009-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	poutine		I was pointing that out
2009-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	poutine		not that I don't appreciate any help given
2009-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	poutine		just "Select <x>" when you don't specify _where_ is pretty useless
2009-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	exodus_ms	poutine	you seem to know enough about how certain things get integrated into a release, surley you can figure out how to kill pulseaudio?
2009-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	poutine	exodus_ms	Yes, I'm more than aware of how to kill it, in fact, I'm even more aware that it's silently crashing/stopping. Unfortunately everything seems to want to still use pulseaudio
2009-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	poutine		I'm asking how to completely bypass pulseaudio
2009-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	poutine		as just killing it doesn't magically make alsa work again
2009-01-27T06:40:00.000Z	poutine		I think I got it
2009-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	poutine		thanks exodus_ms, and kitche
2009-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	exodus_ms	poutine	http://paste.ubuntu.com/110107/
2009-01-27T06:42:00.000Z	poutine		now that is wonderful, thanks a bunch exodus_ms
2009-01-27T06:48:00.000Z	poutine	exodus_ms	on second thought, this isn't really removing it at all, simply doing sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio; apt-get install esound seemed to do the trick, oh and removing pulseaudio references from rc levels
