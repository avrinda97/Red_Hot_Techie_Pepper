2010-08-07T15:15:00.000Z	ManDay		Guys, please help me. In Ubuntu my Rt2573 Wireless stick (RT2501) chipset works out of the box, in gentoo it doesnt. as opposed to ubuntu, dmesg does not report "rt73.bin" being loaded although i installed the according tools. What do I have to do to get it working?
2010-08-07T15:15:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	everyone has issues with USB wireless adapters.
2010-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	well on ubuntu it worked so I sposed id get it wokring on gentoo
2010-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	This is an ubuntu forum. I haven't used Gentoo.
2010-08-07T15:17:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	well im more generally asking what it TAKES to get it working - how ubuntu managed
2010-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	Not sure. Ubuntu may have come with the drivers intalled. For instance, that adapter may use prism drivers.
2010-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	What Linux drivers does it use?
2010-08-07T15:19:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	Try '/join #gentoo.
2010-08-07T15:20:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	thanks but im already in #gentoo
2010-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	Have you tried using a windows driver with ndiswrapper?
2010-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	not at all. the driver is there in the kernel
2010-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	Are you asking what items are compiled into the kernel to get that specific driver working? Then you'll have to tell me which driver that adapter uses.
2010-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	what is the definite way to find that out if im ubuntu ? lsmod?
2010-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	The best way is to find out from the driver. Trying to find out what's going on in the kernel as it's running isnt easy.
2010-08-07T15:24:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	how?
2010-08-07T15:24:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	But the list of supported drivers using prism2_usb driver is to look up prism2_usb
2010-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	?
2010-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	i dont understand you
2010-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	If you know how to program, check out prism2_usb.c
2010-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	for what purpose? please make clear what you are refering to
2010-08-07T15:26:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	You want to find out why Ubuntu runs it and not Gentoo. In order to know that, you'll need to know what Gentoo doesn't have that Ubuntu does. Ubuntu compiles it in, so the easiest way is to take that USB stick, and look up the specific driver using Google.
2010-08-07T15:27:00.000Z	ManDay	israfel	i can tell you what dmesg says upon plugging it in, it gives to warning about failing to allocate the device with rt2500 driver then loads rt73.bin and then it works - is this enough?!
2010-08-07T15:30:00.000Z	israfel	ManDay	rt73 driver is a mainline kernel since 2.6.24 So shouldn't gentoo have it?
