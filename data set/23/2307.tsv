2010-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	icedwater	subspider	Ah, you're on another computer, then?

2010-05-14T01:02:00.000Z	icedwater	subspider	I would have recommended booting from a liveCD or liveUSB, then going into chroot and fixing your grub with an update-grub

2010-05-14T01:06:00.000Z	subspider	icedwater	yes
