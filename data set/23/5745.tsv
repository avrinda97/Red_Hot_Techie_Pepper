2006-09-20T07:39:00.000Z	Kewlb		if anyone deals with cisco a lot or is studying for the CCIE, I have a program that can save you many thousands on hardware :).

2006-09-20T07:40:00.000Z	Kewlb		I already tried solarix on x86.. no go

2006-09-20T07:42:00.000Z	Kewlb		I had to manually install it RedGhost
2006-09-20T07:43:00.000Z	Kewlb		before I spend hours with vmware (in case I dont need it) -- can it do full-screen of the guest-os -- but still allow you to switch workspaces easily?
2006-09-20T07:44:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	not sure, been awhile since I played with it. But from what others said it wont do sparc
2006-09-20T07:52:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	what version is that sorry?
2006-09-20T07:52:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	sorry wine
2006-09-20T07:54:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	thats the one I am using, but patched for WoW
2006-09-20T08:02:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	have you tried rdesktop with the window just almost full screen?
2006-09-20T08:03:00.000Z	Kewlb	TigerCR1200	I tried.. either I get overlap and can't see everything (one above 1024x800) or I have to do 1024x800 which is just not large enough
2006-09-20T08:03:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	ahhh the switching desktops seems to be a common issue
2006-09-20T08:24:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	there is a firefox plugin to use mplayer
2006-09-20T08:26:00.000Z	Kewlb	TigerCR1200	when I try to install that it tells me I also have to install mplayer (the ubunto supported one) and like 10 other things
2006-09-20T08:26:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	welcome to dependency hell
2006-09-20T08:29:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	check the mplayer site (assuming you configured it yourself) see if you can find the plugin there
2006-09-20T08:30:00.000Z	Kewlb	TigerCR1200	doesn't seem to be a firefox plugin for it on mplayerhq.hu
2006-09-20T08:33:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Kewlb	hmmm search google for the plugin instructions?
