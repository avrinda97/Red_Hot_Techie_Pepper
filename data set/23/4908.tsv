2007-04-11T08:00:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: yes, if you upgrade instead of reinstalling, and if you're comfortable with beta versions
2007-04-11T08:01:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: not really
2007-04-11T08:01:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: there are some probs at the beginning related to window managr conflicts
2007-04-11T08:01:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: but having compiz installed doesn't do anything to the beryl installaion
2007-04-11T08:02:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: mine works fine
2007-04-11T08:02:00.000Z	sohum		puppy: yes, but they can coexist -- just not run at the sae time
2007-04-11T08:02:00.000Z	sohum		*same
2007-04-11T08:03:00.000Z	sohum		devurandom: compiz is also a window manager
2007-04-11T08:03:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	that's why you ought not run 2 at once..?
2007-04-11T08:04:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	thats why basically every window manager will complain if you run a second one
2007-04-11T08:06:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	the cube thing is .. well.. let's say: it's ok.
2007-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	i liked it when i saw it first.. then i used wmii and ion3 and i must say
2007-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	dont see the usefulness in transparency
2007-04-11T08:08:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	mu terminal is a 1280x1024 4 tabbed Eterm, each one running a screen with yet another 5 shells
2007-04-11T08:11:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	yeah thats nice
2007-04-11T08:12:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	but well.. i bought 2 22" widescreen tfts.. and i got 8 workspaces in ion3. i know where my stuff is
2007-04-11T08:14:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	well.. got xfce running .. maybe i could fiddle beryl in there
2007-04-11T08:15:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	got debian testing though
2007-04-11T08:15:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	well.. i know, but after learning the entire vim / screen / awk / sed / zsh thing
2007-04-11T08:17:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	not that it's an ideology
2007-04-11T08:18:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	well im gonna google some debs
2007-04-11T08:18:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	but well.. its likely to get killed again
2007-04-11T08:19:00.000Z	devurandom_	sohum	beryl
