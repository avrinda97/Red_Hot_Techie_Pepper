2005-03-05T16:42:00.000Z	Jerub		oh.
2005-03-05T16:42:00.000Z	Jerub		if you want windows. run windows.
2005-03-05T16:42:00.000Z	Jerub		if you want games, get an xbox and a tv tuner.
2005-03-05T16:43:00.000Z	Jerub		;)
2005-03-05T16:43:00.000Z	Jerub		I want a mac mini
2005-03-05T07:42:00.000Z	Jerub		okay, finally got warty installed :)
2005-03-05T07:42:00.000Z	Jerub		I didn't realise you couldn't use LVM for /
2005-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	great, now you should upgrade to hoary. much shinier :).
2005-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	LVM does work for / but it's really difficult to recover if anything goes wrong. at least, that's my understanding of it.
2005-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	Jerub	mg	can't until the end of the month. download quota.
2005-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	:(
2005-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	Jerub	mg	the installer said not to use LVM for / or /boot becuase the machine wouldn't boot
2005-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	it lies - i tried it one
2005-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	mg		hmm, it may have been with debian actually. probably no real difference though.
2005-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	mg		s/one/once
2005-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	Jerub	mg	drat.
2005-03-05T07:46:00.000Z	Jerub	mg	I now have a / that's 3gig and /usr thats 17G
2005-03-05T07:46:00.000Z	Jerub		I hope it'll be okay
2005-03-05T07:46:00.000Z	Jerub		wtf?
2005-03-05T07:46:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	it's probably safer that way. i don't use lvm anymore anyway but at the time i had a whole series of smallish partitions scattered acrosss physical disks.
2005-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	Jerub		this window manager is whacked. it doesn't respond to completely normal things like alt-rigtclick
2005-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	Jerub	mg	I have 2 10 gig drives.
2005-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	mg	Jerub	yeah, that's what i'd called smallish. mp3s take up a lot of room :)
