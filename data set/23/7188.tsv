2008-01-07T09:30:00.000Z	lgc		Hi. How can I enable my laptop to accept remote ssh requests? (I mean, set up my box as a remote server for others).
2008-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2008-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	it is pretty self-explanatory
2008-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	then start the ssh server with the command /etc/init.d/sshd start'
2008-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	let me do that...
2008-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	did you look over the config file?
2008-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	I am looking at it, but I'm kinda' lost... what should I look for?
2008-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	RhostsRSAAuthentication yes, perhaps?
2008-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	it will work out of the box. When you have time, take a look at searcher.myvnc.com/geek ... I have some notes about what I did regarding remote access. For now....let it remain as is
2008-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	leave the config file, and start the server with '/etc/init.d/sshd start'
2008-01-07T09:39:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	 /etc/init.d/sshd doesn't seem to exist.
2008-01-07T09:39:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	did you install openssh-server?
2008-01-07T09:40:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	 /etc/init.d/ssh start perhaps?
2008-01-07T09:40:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	yep.
2008-01-07T09:40:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	oops...wait a sec....I run both ubuntu and suse...and might have confused them again <argh>
2008-01-07T09:41:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	it is a command /usr/sbin/sshd start ... sorry
2008-01-07T09:41:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	you will need sudo with that
2008-01-07T09:41:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	trying to follow two at once is going to get confusing....you two work on it
2008-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	'Extra argument start'.
2008-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	check 'ps ax | grep sshd'...see if it is running
2008-01-07T09:43:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	16073 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2008-01-07T09:43:00.000Z	th0r	lgc	ok...it is up and running...try to access it
2008-01-07T09:46:00.000Z	lgc	th0r	how do I get the 'good' IP then?
