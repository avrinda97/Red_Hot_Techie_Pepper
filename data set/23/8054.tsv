2005-08-27T15:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	what is it?
2005-08-28T16:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	are you sure you're on warty?
2005-08-28T16:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	cat /etc/issue
2005-08-28T16:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	put that upgrade line in, then; make sure you paste it properly. It will update you to hoary
2005-08-28T16:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	you're not entering it correctly, then.
2005-08-28T16:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	that's it. Everything past sudo; make sure you don't have the last "
2005-08-28T16:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	you need the sudo there
2005-08-28T16:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	I take it you're logged in as root or something... nevermind.
2005-08-28T16:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	reasonably long. It should give you a time-limit till the end of the download; but installing the packs takes quite some time too
2005-08-28T16:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	Quanta+
2005-08-28T16:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	as in, you can of course use it to edit php files online
2005-08-28T16:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	once you install it it will probably get an entry
2005-08-28T16:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	if not you can use smeg or another menu editor that gnome uses, I guess
2005-08-28T16:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	_Dom_	yes, but you can't do it at the moment. APT is being used; wait till it finishes
