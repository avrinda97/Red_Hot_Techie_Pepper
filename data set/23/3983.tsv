2007-12-15T08:54:00.000Z	katakaio		Is your raid config done in your mobo setup?
2007-12-15T08:56:00.000Z	katakaio		It's the best partitioning software that I've tried
2007-12-15T08:56:00.000Z	katakaio		You can set up partitions on a clean install of Ubuntu, but it's smart to have gparted on hand
2007-12-15T08:57:00.000Z	katakaio		OK, then roll with that
2007-12-15T08:57:00.000Z	katakaio		If things go south, use the gparted CD
2007-12-15T08:57:00.000Z	katakaio		OK, perfect
2007-12-15T08:58:00.000Z	katakaio		Ideally, you would have (for Ubuntu) a swap partition, a home partition, and a root partition
2007-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	katakaio		It's nice because you can do clean OS installs without losing your data
2007-12-15T09:00:00.000Z	katakaio		If by "after" you mean at the end of the disk, then yes
2007-12-15T09:00:00.000Z	kayce	katakaio	can that be used for 2 250gb hdd's while in ubuntu setup from the live cd?
2007-12-15T09:01:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	if the two hard drives are set up in the bios/motherboard for raid, then yes
2007-12-15T09:02:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	the Ubuntu install CD can partition, but the best IMHO is gparted
2007-12-15T09:06:00.000Z	kayce	katakaio	any advice on partition sizes for my hard drives?
2007-12-15T09:06:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	did you say you had two separate hard drives, or were you RAIDing them together?
2007-12-15T09:07:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	can you raid them on your motherboard (i.e. in your BIOS) ?
2007-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	do they have data/operating systems on them currently?
2007-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	good and good :-D
2007-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	I would raid them in the mobo setup and then install ubuntu
2007-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	you ready to roll?
2007-12-15T09:20:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	Then if space is not an issue, I recommend 1 GB swap, 10 GB root, rest as home
2007-12-15T09:21:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	remember, you can always adjust your partition sizes later
2007-12-15T09:21:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	with 2 GB ram, the swap won't be in use too much
2007-12-15T09:22:00.000Z	katakaio	kayce	I'm not familiar with that program
