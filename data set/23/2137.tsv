2009-07-19T18:23:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	None imho
2009-07-19T18:23:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	thx
2009-07-19T18:26:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Use virtualbox, install windows xp, use seamless mode and run foobar2000, and share all your drives with it.. :)
2009-07-19T18:26:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	nice idea
2009-07-19T18:27:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	ChoK, but if u use a few windows programs, then it hardly takes any time to bring up a windows xp vm (saved state) (few seconds)... and then run your apps... speed is not required to play media anyway...
2009-07-19T18:28:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	i have a xp-VM set up. but the memory usage is heavy
2009-07-19T18:29:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Right.. you often tend to overlook points which are not important to you... since ive got lots of ram...
2009-07-19T18:29:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	lol
2009-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Well 2g is not less.. ubuntu on my box takes up around 512 mb.. so u still have 1.5 gb... xp can take another 512.. with 1 g still free.. not bad... i find 3 g more than enough....
2009-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	what player do you use?
2009-07-19T18:32:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Any.. i don't even use the play list feature of any player.. :).. i just "play"..
2009-07-19T18:33:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	that works when you library is organized. else you spend mor time searching than listening
2009-07-19T18:34:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Hmm.. I know where my songs are.. probably since they are not more than a few hundred...
2009-07-19T18:36:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	im kind of a music explorer. always looking for new sounds so i kind of have lost the overview... therefore i use the rating
2009-07-19T18:37:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	Just for a learning experience, you could write a program that maintains a meta-file with the rating you made for each of your media files and organise them and show them when you want and then spawn a player when required.. :)
2009-07-19T18:38:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	 lol - just give me a sec to become pro coder...
2009-07-19T18:39:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	:)
2009-07-19T18:40:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	write your own os... thats easier..
2009-07-19T18:48:00.000Z	transMIssion	vise	shure, since ther are only lame ones ;-)
2009-07-19T18:49:00.000Z	vise	transMIssion	yay! that's motivating!
