2011-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	cache_surplus		how can i switch between the 5 diff edubuntu desktops,  i saw during install.
2011-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	cache_surplus	 most likly different themes in the settings
2011-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	cache_surplus		nope, its not themes
2011-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	cache_surplus	 ir do you mean virtual desktops?
2011-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	cache_surplus		its actually diff desktops, that have completely diff programs loaded for say 3 graders, vs 8th graders.
2011-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	cache_surplus		nope
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	cache_surplus		edubuntu is a 2.7 gig install DVD
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	cache_surplus		needed over 15gigs to install
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	dr_willis		look in rhe gdm.sessions menu perhaps
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	cache_surplus		they are seperate desktops
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	cache_surplus		ill check
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	dr_willis		desktop is a vague term.in  thus case
2011-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	cache_surplus		so
2011-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	cache_surplus		you get the point
2011-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	dr_willis		I thinj the term is session. ;p
2011-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	cache_surplus		xsession i know
2011-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	dr_willis		each gdm session can be a very different desktop enviroment
2011-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	cache_surplus		not here for all that, if you know, great. enlighten me, as i do not see any options at login splash to change from say kde to gnome, but in the edubuntu sense
2011-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis		check edbuntu docs I guess. no other ideas where they would hide it.
2011-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	dr_willis		!edubuntu
2011-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis		hmm no #edubuntu mentioned
2011-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis		bbl
2011-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	cache_surplus	dr_willis	i know you dont know, its ok,,, someone else might
