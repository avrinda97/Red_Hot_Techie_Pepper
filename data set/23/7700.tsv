2005-06-13T10:37:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	for YOUR box only
2005-06-13T10:38:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	you'd be surpised at the number of peeps in here, NOT using linux
2005-06-13T10:38:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	you have a router, but your particular box is feeding other puters after it?
2005-06-13T10:39:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	how many NICs are in your box?
2005-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	like jeroen_ sez, you only spec your IP in the DMZ setting
2005-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	at that point, only yer puter is exposed
2005-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	nalioth	Tommy|	not if you use linux
