2006-04-20T06:16:00.000Z	graveson		how do i set agppart to no
2006-04-20T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	in the kernel build there is a config option for that.
2006-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	accessing via ssh is so easy, I doubt you'll find a guide for it
2006-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	it's two minutes
2006-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	on the server, install the package  openssh-server
2006-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	then, that's it.  you're done.  use ssh on the client.  (If it's windows use ssh from cygwin, although many people use putty which is just as good but not my personal preference)
2006-10-05T08:16:00.000Z	graveson	sethk	is that it, do  i need to know my NAT address
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	you also get sftp and scp as a no cost bonus.
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	you need to know your public address, yes, to log in from the 'net
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	there are a bunch of web sites that will tell you your public IP if you don't know it.
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	and, if you order right now, at absolutely no cost ...  :)
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	graveson	sethk	is sftp as simple
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	graveson	sethk	:)
2006-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	yes, because it uses the same binaries as ssh.
2006-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	sftp is just:   sftp username@ip
2006-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	very easy.  and cygwin is nice because the windows side and the unix side use exactly the same syntax, in either direction.
2006-11-19T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	are you sure one isn't personal toolbar?
2006-11-19T09:37:00.000Z	graveson	sethk	sorry what do you mea by personal bar
2006-11-19T09:38:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	I've seen two slightly different bookmark folder names in firefox, one with "personal" and one without.  just asking if that might be relevant
2006-11-19T09:39:00.000Z	graveson	sethk	i have a live feed toolbar,and although i am allowed to add an additional toolbar i just cannot see this 2nd toolbar
2006-11-19T09:39:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	sounds like your problem is different than what I'm thinking of
2006-11-19T09:40:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	only one of them shows up, I presume,
2006-11-19T09:40:00.000Z	sethk	graveson	how it got there I really can't even theorize about.
