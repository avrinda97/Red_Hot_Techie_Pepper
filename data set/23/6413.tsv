2007-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight		I salute all my Comrades!
2007-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight		i have an rm file which i can't open
2007-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	realmedia rm?
2007-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	helix player doesn't play rm files
2007-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	that's odd, considering it's supposed to be the "open" realplayer
2007-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	maybe mplayer will
2007-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	precisely
2008-05-15T20:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	that sounds like you've got a rubbish signal
2008-05-15T20:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	no, the signal is excellent
2008-05-15T20:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	with xp it picks it up right away but only every time... the problem lies with Ubuntu i'm afraid to say
2008-05-15T21:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	by the way my signal is perfectly good
2008-05-15T21:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	it's probably not the network manager
2008-05-15T21:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	what kind of card are you using?
2008-05-15T21:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (
2008-05-15T21:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	hm, Intel cards are usually OK
2008-05-15T21:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	i know... and sometimes it works right away and other times it doesn't (in Ubuntu) with XP it works right away everytime, so i know its not the signal. Ubuntu has issues with networking. Don't you believe it?
2008-05-15T21:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	all OSes have issues with networking
2008-05-15T21:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	you mean all linux based OSes? XP is perfect
2008-05-15T21:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gordonjcp	or don't you believe me?
2008-05-15T21:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	I've never had problems with networking in Linux, except ones I've caused myself ;-)
2008-05-15T21:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	conversely I've only ever seen XP a couple of times and used it once
2012-11-02T22:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	livingdaylight	mint (and mate) aren't supported here, but give the instructions on that link a go and see what happens
