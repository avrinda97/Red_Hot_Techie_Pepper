2010-05-12T20:49:00.000Z	Kingsy		ok, I have just installed ubuntu 10.04 and I have a VGA lead going from my VGA out on my graphics card to my TV. . if I go into Nvidia X Server Settings I can see two displays there but I cant get the desktop to show up .. what am I missing here?
2010-05-12T20:49:00.000Z	Kingsy		I just wanna get the TV out working
2010-05-12T20:50:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	you have to enable the second display
2010-05-12T20:51:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- yea I have done
2010-05-12T20:52:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- ok you are right, its disabled.. you can click on it to enable it but there doesnt seem to be a way of saving the changes
2010-05-12T20:52:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	you're right -- that blows
2010-05-12T20:53:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	doesn't work
2010-05-12T20:53:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- any ideas how to get it going?
2010-05-12T20:53:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	can't you even get an image out of the second display?
2010-05-12T20:53:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	that I can do, it's just that the settings can't be made permanent
2010-05-12T20:54:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	did you set the second display's configuration to twinview?
2010-05-12T20:54:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- 1 sec I will try again
2010-05-12T20:54:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- yep just done it .. no luck
2010-05-12T20:55:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	you did press "apply", right?
2010-05-12T20:56:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- yup
2010-05-12T20:56:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	and both displays look fine in the layout view? both have a resolution etc?
2010-05-12T20:58:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	if you can't get it to work, you could toss out the proprietary driver, although you'll lose 3D support
2010-05-12T20:58:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- ahh it works now.. I turned the res down
2010-05-12T20:59:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- hmm so how do you o about getting the settings saved?
2010-05-12T20:59:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	if there is, I haven't found one
2010-05-12T21:00:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- so what do you do? just set the monitor as enabled everytime you boot?
2010-05-12T21:00:00.000Z	agronholm	Kingsy	yup :(
2010-05-12T21:00:00.000Z	Kingsy	agronholm	- thankyou for your help tho .. :)
