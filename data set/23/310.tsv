2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		hi, I've got some problems with 3D games, I asked at #kubuntu, but nobody responded
2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		when I'm playing nexuiz with ondemand which is a default governor nexuiz performance is weak
2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		when I switch to performance governor nexuiz becomes playable
2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		is there any way to make the switch automatic?
2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		or maybe ondemand is broken, because it doesn't maximize CPU frequency when playing demanding games?
2011-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Deckard_25		I had the same in Fedora and Arch
2011-12-25T15:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	i7 is broken they will not go into ful power aka turbo boost
2011-12-25T15:18:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	i dont think they have that mode
2011-12-25T15:19:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	also note in some cases linux drivers suck compard to the windows counterparts
2011-12-25T15:19:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	I know, but with os drivers and performance governor nexuiz is playable :)
2011-12-25T15:20:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	nice but i gave up on linux game years ago
2011-12-25T15:20:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	being you have bugs like yours on nativ games or  wines fails
2011-12-25T15:20:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	I'm doing different, I'm giving up on windows :)
2011-12-25T15:21:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	or i still have linux on my netbook
2011-12-25T15:21:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	I think it's not a bug, but there aren't optimal settings used
2011-12-25T15:21:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	but for gaming there win7 boxes
2011-12-25T15:22:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	i ran all linux all the way threw the vista nightmare on all my boxes and gameing did not get better it got worse
2011-12-25T15:22:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	I have xp, but I'm just playing few games on it
2011-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	benchmarks are not real perforance anyways
2011-12-25T15:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	its been proven card makers will use softwhere tweaked to there advantage to look better.
2011-12-25T15:25:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	I heard once about some Intel cheats ;)
2011-12-25T15:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Deckard_25	they all cheat
2011-12-25T15:26:00.000Z	Deckard_25	gogeta	then everything is fair ;) just kidding
