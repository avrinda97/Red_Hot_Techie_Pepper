2005-10-18T06:09:00.000Z	TerminX		it removes the actual files
2005-10-18T06:10:00.000Z	TerminX		which is what I thought he meant
2005-10-18T06:10:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	without autoclean, unused/unnecessary warty packages will remain on an upgraded breezy computer?
2005-10-18T06:10:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	files in /var/cache/apt/archives
2005-10-18T06:11:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	what's that .../apt/archives about?
2005-10-18T06:11:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	it's where debs go when retrieved by apt
2005-10-18T06:12:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	i just checked my  /var/cache/apt/archives, are these files still in use?
2005-10-18T06:13:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	they're never in use unless you're installing the package ;p
2005-10-18T06:16:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	autoclean and clean don't uninstall packages
2005-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	what then do autoclean and clean do?
2005-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	I told you, they remove the debs for old packages
2005-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	sorry .
2005-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	 so debs from old packages aren't automatically removed?
2005-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	 is there a reason to keep debs from old packages+
2005-10-18T06:24:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	not really, unless you're running the devel branch
2005-10-18T06:25:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	do you recommend i do clean and autoclean before, after, or both before and after i upgrade to breezy?
2005-10-18T06:25:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	are you talking to me?
2005-10-18T06:26:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	see above line.
2005-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	me?
2005-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	yes, you
2005-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	TerminX	looga	apt-get clean
2005-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	is apt-get for hoary?
2005-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	looga	TerminX	how come i can't find clean nor autoclean in synaptic?
