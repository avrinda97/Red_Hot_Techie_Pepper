2011-04-13T21:53:00.000Z	irv		i like ext4 :)
2011-04-13T21:54:00.000Z	irv		isn't there some business with the grub bootloader wiping out the windows boot partition which you then have to repair?
2011-04-13T21:54:00.000Z	irv		or is that fixed up now
2011-04-13T21:54:00.000Z	irv		shieet
2011-04-13T21:54:00.000Z	irv		i've been doing something wrong then lol
2011-04-13T21:55:00.000Z	irv		every time i installed grub2, it wiped out the windows boot loader loader from its little partition and wouldn't boot windows
2011-04-13T21:55:00.000Z	irv		but sweet i will try just doing that
2011-04-13T21:56:00.000Z	irv		so i should just leave the space that i will allocate to linux as unused in the windows install and then partition that part within the ubuntu setup
2011-04-13T21:57:00.000Z	irv		and windows requires 2 right?
2011-04-13T21:57:00.000Z	irv		or would it just need 1 as long as its not at the start of the disk
2011-04-13T21:57:00.000Z	acicula	irv	the default setup is that grub2 wipes the windows bootloader and lets you load windows via grub. If you want to use the windows bootloader instead you will have to setup grub2 to install on the ubuntu partition only and have the windows bootloader point to grub2
2011-04-13T22:01:00.000Z	acicula	irv	yes
2011-04-13T22:01:00.000Z	acicula	irv	unless you have a tiny harddrive there is little reason to not have one
2011-04-13T22:05:00.000Z	acicula	irv	it doesnt
2011-04-13T22:16:00.000Z	acicula	irv	it will just abort the hibernate if your swap is to small to fit the current memory
2011-04-13T22:20:00.000Z	acicula	irv	it doesnt matter, doubt windows or linux will have a problem with your partition sizes
2011-04-13T22:23:00.000Z	acicula	irv	normally windows shouldnt make a separate partition like that, are you using a retail disk or something prepackaged ?
2011-04-13T22:25:00.000Z	acicula	irv	the system reserved partition
2011-04-13T22:28:00.000Z	acicula	irv	yeah but you want it for things like bitlocker and such. you can just leave the small partition and put the ntfs and swap inside their own extended partitions
2011-04-13T22:30:00.000Z	acicula	irv	that depends on how you define the benchmark
2011-04-13T22:30:00.000Z	acicula	irv	nothing wrong with extended partitions really
2011-04-13T22:31:00.000Z	acicula	irv	none that matter, i think ubuntu by default dumps everything in one big extended partition to begin with
2011-04-13T22:34:00.000Z	acicula	irv	yup
