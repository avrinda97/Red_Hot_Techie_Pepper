2011-02-06T04:11:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	my question is, why do i get that page
2011-02-06T04:11:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	They put that up there because it's chineese new year. They are advertising that they have a china version of the OS
2011-02-06T04:11:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	thats some bullshit
2011-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	Well it's what they wanted to do. They've had it up there since then. Complain to the webmaster.
2011-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	luckally the iso has english on it as well
2011-02-06T04:13:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	What is the name of the ISO you downloaded?
2011-02-06T04:14:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	normal... just ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso
2011-02-06T04:14:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	And everything was english until when?
2011-02-06T04:15:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	If you got it from http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download-zh You got the china ISO.
2011-02-06T04:16:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	i clicked the download ubuntu image on the front page. it was in english.
2011-02-06T04:16:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	You clicked the big banner or the little button that said Download Ubuntu?
2011-02-06T04:17:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	the little button
2011-02-06T04:17:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	And when did it stop being english?
2011-02-06T04:18:00.000Z	Shards_of_Narsil	r000t_laptop	^
2011-02-06T04:18:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	I really don't know what's wrong then... seems like you did everything right
2011-02-06T04:19:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	Shards_of_Narsil	Try getting it from BitTorrent. If it downloads fast it's probably the english version, and if you still have problems, I'll Priority Mail you a working CD
