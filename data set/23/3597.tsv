2008-03-10T18:59:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	you need to install the appropriate graphics drivers :)
2008-03-10T19:00:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	so the one that came with ubuntu are the problem.. ok thanks ill search it up
2008-03-10T19:00:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	you installed the restricted driver?
2008-03-10T19:00:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	no i didnt!
2008-03-10T19:01:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	try the restricted driver manager :) system -> manage -> restricted driver manager
2008-03-10T19:01:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	it says your hardware doesnt not need any restricted drivers
2008-03-10T19:01:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	which grahics card do you have in your laptop :)
2008-03-10T19:02:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	i believe its an intel one....
2008-03-10T19:03:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	now im not sure of the exact model.. i forgot what the cmd was to list hardware on the computer...
2008-03-10T19:03:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	in a terminal, try "lspci"
2008-03-10T19:06:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	that graphics chip seems ot be blacklisted
2008-03-10T19:06:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	what do you mean?
2008-03-10T19:07:00.000Z	StefanW	high-bass	in a terminal, do "compiz --replace &" and show us the output via http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2008-03-10T19:07:00.000Z	high-bass	StefanW	so there are no drivers for that graphics card?
