2005-10-23T15:59:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
2005-10-23T15:59:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	you have sth wrong in xorg.conf
2005-10-24T16:00:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	I didnt set anything in xorg.conf manually, any suggestions?
2005-10-24T16:00:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	pastebin content of your xorg.conf
2005-10-24T16:02:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	coming right up

2005-10-24T16:07:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	well thats what i thought...
2005-10-24T16:07:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	is there any way to default to the driver that X was using before i installed the Nvidia drivers?
2005-10-24T16:08:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	I don't have much experience with nv. I have ati card
2005-10-24T16:08:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	no probs, thanks for listening tho
2005-10-24T16:10:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	try to find it on google. just type in the message you get and browse through all the possible discussion bards
2005-10-24T16:10:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	i have another question..
2005-10-24T16:10:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	yes?
2005-10-24T16:10:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	ive been attempting to playback some xvid files, now i can get them to play in totem okay and mplayer
2005-10-24T16:11:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	but neither will let me go full screen without some funny graphical glitches, any ideas on what that could be?
2005-10-24T16:13:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	well totem has been really shitty recently. I don't know about mplayer. just try using various video drivers. are you using mplayer -zoom? or sth else?
2005-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	no i was just setting the view to fullscreen in totem and in mplayer, the problem seems to be identical in each so i assume its not their fault
2005-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	I also noticed that after installing everything i needed for totem it was rubbish, so i installed totem-xine which apparently cleared up the problems i did have
2005-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	WebLOCH	well totem-xine is much faster. the only solution I can think of at the moment is to wait for gstreamer 0.10
2005-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	thanks then i guess ill have to resort to windows for watching movies :P
2005-10-24T16:16:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	all assistance is helpful
2005-10-24T16:29:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shutdownrunner	LasseL, I cant remember which of you told me to use that binary guide to  install drivers again, but either way, it doesnt appear to have worked again
