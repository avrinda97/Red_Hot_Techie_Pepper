2006-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	eno__		so, earlier tonight I was told that to compile a kernel you just tupe make and that does it, bt it did not work, it says "command not found"
2006-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	eno__		so how do I do it?
2006-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	even if make is found, it isn't anywhere near that simple
2006-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	but first, it appears that you need to install make, which is part of the development essentials
2006-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	don't panic, it is quite possible, but not quite that simple
2006-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	you have me on an emotional rollercoaster
2006-01-20T10:02:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	start by installing the  missing development stuff, you'll get nowhere without it
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	that's ok, just hit control-c
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	if you type make, it will ask you a bunch of questions
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	but why is it you insist that you want to "just type make"?
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	someone told me to do that ealrier
2006-01-20T10:08:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	so, after a bit of work, you'll compile the kernel
2006-01-20T10:08:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	but if you convince yourself that you don't have to do any work, what happens when you get to a step you don't understand?
2006-01-20T10:08:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	I dig down deep, swallow my pride and move onwards
2006-01-20T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	there is no need to swallow anything.  Just take ten or fifteen minutes, read a how-to, and go do it.
2006-01-20T10:10:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	I think you are helpful... this time I will try harder to find a tutorial
2006-01-20T10:10:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	go to kernel.org, there are several of them
2006-01-20T10:10:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	that was easy... I am dumb :P
2006-01-20T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	a developer is just a user who isn't scared to compile.  :)
2006-01-20T10:35:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	don't delete the kernel you already have that works.  Add the new one, don't replace the old one
2006-01-20T10:35:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	then, if it doesn't work, you can always boot the old, working kernel
2006-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	eno__	sethk	smart move
2006-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	sethk	eno__	make the older one the default, then select the new one at the grub menu
