2011-06-18T21:58:00.000Z	StevenR		Hi. What's the current standard desktop kernel on natty? (i.e. output of uname -rv and package name)... I'm not sure if I've got it back to where it should be. Thanks :)

2011-06-18T22:01:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	I'm still not sure if what I've got is right though
2011-06-18T22:02:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	dpkg -l |grep linux-image
2011-06-18T22:04:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	but that still doesn't answer my question. There are lots of kernel packages installed, and more available to me. I asked "What's the current standard desktop kernel on natty?"
2011-06-18T22:05:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	and I told you. if you don't want to read it's not my problem
2011-06-18T22:06:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	I have read. I don't understand how your answers answer my question.
2011-06-18T22:06:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic, linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic-pae depending on your hardware
2011-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	hmmm.. I seem to have 3 of those installed. The #42-Ubuntu refers to me running the kernel provided by the linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic             2.6.38-8.42
2011-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	package, right?
2011-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	dpkg -l |grep linux-image  pastebin the output
2011-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/628847/
2011-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	pastebin your sources.list? looks like you had proposed updates or such
2011-06-18T22:15:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/628850/  I tried the server kernel to see if it would fix an issue, but it turned out to be something else that cause the problem. Now I'm trying to get back to the default desktop kernel
2011-06-18T22:16:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	well, the 2.6.32.8-22 is the one you want to boot. and you can remove all those old ones
2011-06-18T22:27:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	ok, so I should have linux-image-generic installed, and it's dependencies... or the linux-image package?
2011-06-18T22:28:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	the linux-image package. so that the upgrades later work properly
2011-06-18T22:28:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	thanks, lots of apt-work now to  :) (and to mrdeb)
2011-07-30T17:34:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	which driver?
2011-07-30T17:36:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	it's an intel mobile 4 chip... not sure how to tell which driver is actually running.
2011-07-30T17:36:00.000Z	wols	StevenR	Xorg.0.log tells you. in your case, normally intel
2011-07-30T17:38:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	yes, intel is the driver.
2011-07-30T17:44:00.000Z	StevenR	wols	jrib: when it freezes, mouse still moves, but clicking and keyboard have no effect. All the processes still see to be running. Switching back to the vt with X11 on it gives me whatever was on my tty vt, plus a moving cursor
