2008-10-01T16:38:00.000Z	dew5	b64aa6	yea it is runs like a dream. might be technical for her though
2008-10-01T16:38:00.000Z	b64aa6	dew5	i'm testing on interpid, but wondering... might be a silly question, but anyone know what the manifest file is used for?
2008-10-01T16:39:00.000Z	b64aa6	dew5	yeah, i use puppy on browsing, such a charm /speed.
2008-10-01T16:40:00.000Z	dew5	b64aa6	 Perl's MakeMaker assumes that you want to run all of the .t files in the t/ directory in ascii-betical order during `make test` unless you say otherwise.  This leads to some interesting naming schemes for test files to get them in the desired order.  Test::Manifest looks in the t/test_manifest file to find out which tests you want to run and the order in which you want to run them. It constructs the right value for MakeMaker to do the right thing.  
2008-10-01T16:42:00.000Z	dew5	b64aa6	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hu/intrepid/libtest-manifest-perl cheak this out
2008-10-01T16:43:00.000Z	b64aa6	dew5	wait... that's new to me. :-) ... and I've learnt that I must be clearler in what i say... But thanks, learned someting new :-) ... Any info on the other manifest /casper/filesystem.manifest-desktop ???
2008-10-01T16:45:00.000Z	b64aa6		sew5: I was extracting the stuff from interpid iso image (using puppy, as my edgy does not support squashfs v3.1) and found that i need to build the manifest... can i leave it out :-) ?
2008-10-01T16:47:00.000Z	dew5	b64aa6	not to sure mate
2008-10-01T16:47:00.000Z	dew5		sorry]
2008-10-01T16:48:00.000Z	b64aa6	dew5	The true question is where is the /casper/filesystem.manifest used.... it's not on the ubuntu forum, and no info from debian... no prob, mate, thanks for the effort, anyway....  :-)
