2006-07-23T12:14:00.000Z	Tonren		So who knows how to mount my hard drive from teh Live CD?
2006-07-23T12:14:00.000Z	Tonren		Thanks apokryphos
2006-07-23T12:15:00.000Z	Tonren		also, does anyone know what the difference between Apt-Get and Aptitude is on the command line?
2006-07-23T12:15:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	aptitude has a interface, and it also installs recommended packages.
2006-07-23T12:16:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	So the only difference on teh command line is dependency handling
2006-07-23T12:16:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	yes, but typing "sudo aptitude" brings you to a UI of sorts, while apt has no such interactive interface.
2006-08-09T16:17:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	you tried "gimpshop"
2006-08-09T16:17:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	I haven't tried it yet, actually
2006-08-09T16:17:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	how seriously do you use photoshop? if you dont require cymk and shit and you dont want to buy pixel, use gimp or gimpshop
2006-08-09T16:18:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	or buy pixel, itz pretty awesome - http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=12
2006-08-09T16:18:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	I have over six years of Photoshop experience.  It's second nature to me.  I almost literally can't use GIMP.
2006-08-09T16:19:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	I'm a graphic designer, and I don't have six years to re-learn GIMP.
2006-08-09T16:19:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	gimpshop hacks the gimp UI to make it identical to PS
2006-08-09T16:19:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	Does it really have the same functionality?
2006-08-09T16:19:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	Because if it does, I'd be happy to try it out.  But I really do NEED Photoshop.
2006-08-09T16:20:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	What is Pixel, exactly...?
2006-08-09T16:20:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	like a cheap PS alternative, basically the same functionality, runs on anything, and only costs 25 dollars or so.
2006-08-09T16:21:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	check i t out here - http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=12 - i need photo manip enough to justify buying it.
2006-08-09T16:21:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	I'll check it out.  I think I'm going to have to end up dual booting, though.
2006-08-09T16:22:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	if you REALLY need cs2 features etc. then yes dual boot or virtual machine is your only way really.
2006-08-09T16:22:00.000Z	Tonren	Subhuman	I'm interested in VMing.  I haven't been able to find a cogent tutorial anywhere, though.  Is it a wise choice, or is it too slow?
2006-08-09T16:23:00.000Z	Subhuman	Tonren	don't know, ive never done it personallu.
