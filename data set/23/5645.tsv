2006-10-21T12:08:00.000Z	tamale		can someone please help?  I don't think I'm asking for much.. I just want 1680x1050 resolution :\
2006-10-21T12:10:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	does your monitor support that big of a resolution? and if so do you have your video card driver?
2006-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	tamale	strabes	 I have a new laptop, HP NC8430 with a 1680x1050 screen and an ATI X1600 gpu
2006-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	tamale		the ATI driver install failed.  I tried to use the guide on the main ubuntu guide
2006-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	ok are you using dapper?
2006-10-21T12:12:00.000Z	tamale		Currently I've only got an edgy install disc with me.
2006-10-21T12:12:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu
2006-10-21T12:13:00.000Z	tamale	strabes	 Which section should I follow?
2006-10-21T12:13:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	depends if you are using dapper or edgy
2006-10-21T12:13:00.000Z	tamale		edgy:
2006-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	tamale		but i mean, within there there are several methods
2006-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	use method 1
2006-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	you are using edgy right?
2006-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	tamale		Yes, I'll give it a shot again.
2006-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	ok then follow method one on the edgy page
2006-10-21T12:18:00.000Z	tamale		by the way, I love the orange on  black look of edgy's startup splash :)
2006-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	strabes	tamale	you mean the bootsplash?
2006-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	tamale		yah I guess
2006-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	tamale	strabes	 No luck.  I'm still suck at the boot splash (almost all the way loaded) with some screen artifacts.  Hard freeze.. can't get to virtual terms.
2006-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	tamale		This is after following Method 1.
2006-10-21T12:21:00.000Z	tamale	strabes	Should I try method 2?
2006-10-21T12:21:00.000Z	strabes		if you want
2006-10-21T12:22:00.000Z	tamale	strabes	 I just want it to work :)
