2008-06-20T01:59:00.000Z	leachim6	Jack_Sparrow	you know I was working on this yesterday
2008-06-20T02:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	It does not excuse ranting and rude behavior
2008-06-20T02:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	form better questions.
2008-06-20T02:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	If I remember right you are not running off a standard install ..
2008-06-20T02:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	that is where you started. but what else did you do and install
2008-06-20T02:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	please use enter after complete sentences..
2008-06-20T02:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	leachim6	I have asked you to stop hitting enter like that... it spams the channel and makes it hard to understand you.
2008-06-20T02:16:00.000Z	leachim6	Jack_Sparrow	I'm sorry about the enter thing it's a bad habit
