2009-09-09T03:56:00.000Z	goddard_		who runs a web server here
2009-09-09T03:57:00.000Z	goddard_		do you use a dns service?
2009-09-09T03:58:00.000Z	goddard_		well I have been trying to set it up properly
2009-09-09T03:58:00.000Z	goddard_		but for some reason some firewall or sercurity feature is blocking it
2009-09-09T03:59:00.000Z	goddard_		The router is setup properly I believe it actually has my DNS update client inside it
2009-09-09T03:59:00.000Z	goddard_		Let me say it this way port 80 is forwarded to the server
2009-09-09T03:59:00.000Z	goddard_		that is what ive done
2009-09-09T04:00:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	can you access the webpage from outside you network by using your IP?
2009-09-09T04:00:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	then port 80 is not forwarded
2009-09-09T04:01:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	 is your webpage accessable from inside your network?
2009-09-09T04:04:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	what kind of router do you have?
2009-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	you want to put your server's internal ipaddress into the DMZ ... this will put the ubuntu server on the outside ip
2009-09-09T04:08:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	yes, but only for the ubuntu machine, and if you have ubuntu setup properly it will be secure ... DMZ'ing will work
2009-09-09T04:10:00.000Z	goddard_	fccf	would filtering multicast traffic or NAT redirection affect the DNS service?
2009-09-09T04:11:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	yes, but I don't think that is the issue here, ubuntu by default is very secure, putting the server into DMZ shouldn't be a problem, especially if you are using a dynamic ip sitiuation
2009-09-09T04:18:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	you are online, and the king
2009-09-09T04:20:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	yep
2009-09-09T04:21:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	got your info from your username
2009-09-09T04:22:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	what IRC client are you using?
2009-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	look at man irssi ... I am in a GUI of pidgin .. and by right clicking on a name in the userlist and clicking info I get information about any user ... although there are ways to hide yourself, which I am working on for myself too
2009-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	goddard_	fccf	i am supposed to be cloaked thats why i asked
2009-09-09T04:27:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	your cloakable username is goddard not goddard_ you have to /nickserv identify password for user goddard
2009-09-09T04:32:00.000Z	fccf	goddard_	did you get that?
