2009-01-02T05:49:00.000Z	ZellSF		any way to get eeepc hotkeys working?
2009-01-02T05:50:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	have you tried looking at ubuntu-eee
2009-01-02T05:50:00.000Z	ZellSF	tyranos	uh?
2009-01-02T05:50:00.000Z	ZellSF		No I have ubuntu installed atm
2009-01-02T05:50:00.000Z	ZellSF		I just need to get the volume control working
2009-01-02T05:51:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	i have ubuntu-eee running on my eee it is the same as the nomal version but with only hardware drivers forr eeepc and everything works out of the box
2009-01-02T05:51:00.000Z	ZellSF		installing another distrobution isn't an option atm
2009-01-02T05:52:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	well u dont have to , just check www.array.org
2009-01-02T05:52:00.000Z	ZellSF		tyfoo2: that page tells me nothing
2009-01-02T05:53:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	read carefully before doing anything , all u have to do is to add that repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list and then u get another kernel so u wont lose anything
2009-01-02T05:54:00.000Z	ZellSF		well I'd rather just get the package that's supposed to allow the keys to work
2009-01-02T05:55:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	well each approach should work the other kernel is just optimized for the eee
2009-01-02T05:56:00.000Z	ZellSF		well each approach *should* work, but installing eeepc-acpi-scripts just gives an error
2009-01-02T05:57:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	just read carefully you ll find out  y
2009-01-02T05:58:00.000Z	ZellSF	tyranos	I read carefully searched for it and ended up on the ubuntu bug tracker
2009-01-02T05:58:00.000Z	ZellSF		oh wait it's the ubuntu-eee bugtracker
2009-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	ZellSF		http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/eeepc-acpi-scripts
2009-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	ZellSF		how am I supposed to install then when acpi-support-base isn't available?
2009-01-02T06:01:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	you have to add the repository to your sources.list
2009-01-02T06:01:00.000Z	ZellSF	tyranos	WHAT repository?
2009-01-02T06:03:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	http://array.org/ubuntu/setup-hardy.html
2009-01-02T06:04:00.000Z	ZellSF	tyranos	told you I would rather not do that.
2009-01-02T06:07:00.000Z	tyranos	ZellSF	sry didnt try normal ubuntu on my eee
