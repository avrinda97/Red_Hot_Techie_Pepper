2009-04-19T08:49:00.000Z	planegenius		how to i go back to a previous version of ubbuntu?
2009-04-19T08:51:00.000Z	planegenius		going from jaunty back to intrepid, because of audio issues, rec'd no help on subject, and need to revert back to stable version
2009-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	9.04 is stable this Thursday
2009-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	maybe you should go back to 8.04 instead
2009-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	longer suppourt after all
2009-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	download the ISO
2009-04-19T08:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	md5sum it, burn it to CD, and install
2009-04-19T08:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	which settings?
2009-04-19T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	probably can get sound working in 9.04 some how by the way
2009-04-19T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	you can keep some stuff, but may as well start over
2009-04-19T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	really ISO's should be md5summed before burning
2009-04-19T08:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	well don't expect much help for 9.04 just yet
2009-04-19T08:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	the final release is only this Thursday
2009-04-19T08:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	and if your going to downgrade,  then yeah for various reasons I think 8.04 rather than 8.10
2009-04-19T08:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	sure, but  security updates run out for 8.10 much before 8.04.  and  no KDE3 in the repo for 8.10 or 9.04
2009-04-19T08:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	and there isn't that much difference between 8.04 and 8.10
2009-04-19T08:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	did you do 9.04 with Ext4?
2009-04-19T08:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	if not well 9.04 is rather pointless
2009-04-19T09:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	you won't have, unless you  told 9.04 to install it
2009-04-19T09:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	which you woudn't have, since you woudn't have known what to do
2009-04-19T09:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	in fact you should have stuck with 8.10 since your new
2009-04-19T09:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	and only got 9.04 on the final release
2009-04-19T09:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	planegenius	 was that message aimed at me though?
