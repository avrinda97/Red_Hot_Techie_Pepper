2007-06-29T08:05:00.000Z	Phil_E		Lenoxus:what post?

2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Lenoxus		but just now, I was confusing you with someone else
2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Phil_E	Lenoxus	yeah i was trying to find out what /ping does
2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Lenoxus		who had asked about the largest irc channel
2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Phil_E		and found out on ##linux...
2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Phil_E		:(
2007-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	Lenoxus	Phil_E	Why the :(
2007-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Phil_E		cause
2007-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Phil_E		i pinged the whole channel
2007-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Phil_E		and according to someone there that's not a smart thing to do...
2007-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Phil_E		i didn't /ping ##linux
2007-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Lenoxus		I'm not sure I get this "pinging" of which people speak
2007-06-29T08:08:00.000Z	Phil_E	Lenoxus	it gives you the amount of time it takes for someone to get a message, and then reply, as i found out
2007-06-29T08:08:00.000Z	Lenoxus		but I know something about a certain number always being one's own connection
2007-06-29T08:08:00.000Z	Phil_E	Lenoxus	it's apparently bad and can get you banned from freenode if you do it on a large channel, though i don't know hwy
