2011-02-22T03:35:00.000Z	joseph_		My system is reporting that I have low space on my root partition. Any recommendations for clearing space or resizing it? (Current size:4 GB)
2011-02-22T03:37:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	you want at least 20gig for root (/)
2011-02-22T03:38:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	OK. Anyway to safely resize?
2011-02-22T03:39:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	livecd and always backup important data first! it happens....
2011-02-22T03:40:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	the live has a program called gparted. the install cd isa livecd
2011-02-22T03:41:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	Alright, so I'll just need to back up and run g parted. Anything else I should know?
2011-02-22T03:43:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	thats about it... youll need that much atlesat for ROOT (/) because it has TMP and VAR under it, im assuming you have a seperate HOME and possibly BOOT....
2011-02-22T03:44:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	USR get pretty big aswell
2011-02-22T03:44:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	Yes to both. I have a seperate /tmp as well.
2011-02-22T03:49:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	maybe 10gig for root would be enough. If you plan to use your OS and not wipe it every 5 sec yoyull prob want 20gig
2011-02-22T03:50:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	20 gig it is. One last thing. How do I put my seperate /tmp partition back into root with gparted? Do I just unmount?
2011-02-22T03:52:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	Alright, well, I'll have a look at those. Thank you very much for your help!
2011-02-22T03:53:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	tmp should be as simple as a new fstab entry....
2011-02-22T03:54:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	and somewher to mount it =)
2011-02-22T03:55:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	I'll have to look into fstab for that. Possibly in your links.
2011-02-22T03:56:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	also note the file permissions tmp has, r+w+x for all user/groups
2011-02-22T04:03:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	I assume r+w+x means read/write/delete, correct?
2011-02-22T04:05:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	read/write/execute
2011-02-22T04:06:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	thank you as well. I appreciate your help.
2011-02-22T04:06:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	in a terminal     sudo chmod 777 /tmp     will do it ifnthere is a /tmp
2011-02-22T04:07:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	I have a terminal open. should I input the command?
2011-02-22T04:09:00.000Z	iflema	joseph_	do it the livecd, move ya poartitions make a new /tmp and assign the file permissions, fstab, happy days =)
2011-02-22T04:10:00.000Z	joseph_	iflema	alright. I'll write it down and use it via LiveCD. Thank you again!
