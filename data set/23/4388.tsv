2007-10-31T11:47:00.000Z	penba		How could I go about executing a script right after gdm/kdm is loaded?
2007-10-31T11:47:00.000Z	penba		(automatically, that is)
2007-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	warbler	penba	add it to sessions - app - pref - sessions - startup
2007-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	penba	warbler	I dont use gnome
2007-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	penba	warbler	do you know what config file that program affects?
2007-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	warbler	penba	what do you use?
2007-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	penba	warbler	fvwm
2007-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	warbler		????
2007-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	penba	warbler	or KDE if you prefer
2007-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	warbler	penba	there should be at the login a kde session so in the menu there will be an option to add to it
2007-10-31T11:52:00.000Z	penba	warbler	what you said about sessions - apps - prefs - sessions - startup is just not there
2007-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	warbler	penba	sorry - in gnome it is in the main menu - applications - sytem(which I left out) - preferences - asessions - startup
2007-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	warbler		*seesions
2007-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	warbler		*sessions
2007-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	penba	warbler	thatf for gnome, though. I want it for GDM
2007-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	warbler	penba	GDM=gnome
2007-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	warbler	penba	KDM=kde
2007-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	penba	warbler	no, gdm = gdm.. gnome = gnome. I can run gnome with kdm and kde with gdm for all I care
2007-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	warbler	penba	that is the method in feisty to add to startup - are you gutsy?
2007-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	penba	warbler	It doesnt matter. It'll add to gnome's startup either way. I need something similar to adding to /etc/init.d/gdm
2007-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	penba	warbler	byt adding to gnome's I mean it won't add to gdm's
2007-10-31T11:58:00.000Z	warbler	penba	try adding in /etc/rc5.d
2007-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	warbler	penba	did you edit your main menu and remove sessions?
