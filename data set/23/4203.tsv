2007-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	werent u the one looking for a disk checking software?
2007-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	yes
2007-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	werent u saying u thot u needed a new HD?
2007-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	now it has gone bigtime
2007-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	well i think you may have proved your point ...
2007-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	is there anyway to fix this error and get it to mount so I can get the data back
2007-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	there may be, you could try Super Grub Disk, or fsck
2007-10-12T11:06:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	super grub disc?
2007-10-12T11:06:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	whats that then ;0)
2007-10-12T11:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	google super grub disc, and fsck is the equivalent of chkdsk in windows
2007-10-12T11:07:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	this is not a good situation there was about 80gb not backed up
2007-10-12T11:07:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	how many times do I have to learn that lesson?
2007-10-12T11:07:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	i just lost about that much data, but that was my own stupidity
2007-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	this is pretty stupid of me to be fair
2007-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	Ie had at least 6 drives die over the years
2007-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	do I ahve to use sgd to boot then fsck or what?
2007-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	wow, bad luck, never had a drive die on me really, well one or two, but i had my data backed up on usb drive, accidentally intalled ubuntu somehow on my usb drive lol
2007-10-12T11:09:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	super grub disk has its own tools, you can boot off it and look, fsck u can run from the recovery console off the livecd
2007-10-12T11:10:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	that looks like my first port of call then.. trust me, you really wanna back up your shizzle
2007-10-12T11:10:00.000Z	keito7812	Evanlec	Im a bit dubious as to the state my data will be in after this
2007-10-12T11:10:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito7812	yea i hear ya
