2010-03-13T11:47:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		okay there has to be a way to automatically assign two different mount points with different permissions to a folder on my external hard disk, it pretty much stays connected to this pc 90% of the time. or... is there a way to sort of create a "virtual" mount point which just directs to another folder on your pc but with READ ONLY permissions?
2010-03-13T11:48:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	two mount points to the same folder ?
2010-03-13T11:55:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	have you looked at the way fstab handles users and groups on mountpoints ?
2010-03-13T11:55:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	so there is a user called "apache" or something?
2010-03-13T11:56:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	the apache user is   : www-data and the apache group is www-data
2010-03-13T11:56:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	my ext. HD gets automatically mounted when i bott my PC, but it is not mentioned in my fstab file anywhere
2010-03-13T11:57:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	your external hardrive isnt listed in fstab most probably because its being auto  mounted via hal or dbus or voodoo
2010-03-13T11:59:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	so could i create another mount point that just loops back to /media/EXTHDD?
2010-03-13T12:00:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	im not an expert on fstab but i have a suspicion that fstab can assign user and group permissions on the mount point for you
2010-03-13T12:01:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	isn't this what you wanted ? two mount points that point at the same destination but have two different sets of access/write/execute permissions ?
2010-03-13T12:01:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	what about: sudo mount --bind /media/EXTHDD /var/www/exthdd
2010-03-13T12:02:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	yes, problem is its not in fstab
2010-03-13T12:02:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	like i said.. not an fstab expert and i have no idea what the bind param means./
2010-03-13T12:02:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	aha! but... you can add them :)
2010-03-13T12:03:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	you might like to read his first ? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=283131
2010-03-13T12:04:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	but if i place an entry in fstab, for EG. using "/dev/sdb1" would this not change to "/dev/sdb2" one day?
2010-03-13T12:05:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	you can refer to a device via uuid instead
2010-03-13T12:05:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	okay....
2010-03-13T12:05:00.000Z	airtonix	ae86-drifter	this page is also useful : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab
2010-03-13T12:27:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	i am getting error Unprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE, after i mounted it using fstab
2010-03-13T12:28:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	airtonix	i created two entries in fstab for the same UUID, one with "rw" and the other with just "r" access. only one of those mountpoints work
