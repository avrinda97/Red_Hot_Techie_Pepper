2006-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	Ropechoborra		Thats why =/
2006-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	Ropechoborra		Thanks
2006-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	You have two per kernel (regular, and rescue mode)
2006-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	they're probably all the same kernel, just different versions (upgraded), so, the most recent is the one to keep.
2006-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	when ubuntu upgrades, it adds the most recent kernel to the top of the list.  If you remove the older ones with apt (or any frontend) the others will go away
2006-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	uninstall them, and they will be removed from grub
2006-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	right
2006-07-19T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	no, type that at a terminal, and you'll get the kernel you're currently using
2006-07-19T07:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	celerons are 686
2006-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	386 is generic, 386 works on 686, 686 doesn't on 386.
2006-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	install linux-image-686, it'll keep you updated on the 686 kernels
2006-07-19T07:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	get the alternate install CD, install just the server (type "server" at the first screen), then install some other WMs (*box, etc)
2006-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	partitions don't have owners
2006-08-19T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	you need to fix your umask, in fstab
2006-10-12T07:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	update what?
2006-10-12T07:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	read that page
2006-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	don't read that page ;)  read what Madpilot wrote
2006-11-30T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	You might look into firestarter, it's a GUI frontend to iptables
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	you can.  I don't know how.  But, you could ask in #iptables, I'm sure they can help you
2007-06-17T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Ropechoborra	I think that'd be a security risk.
