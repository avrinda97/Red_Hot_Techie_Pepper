2010-12-18T17:08:00.000Z	jurgentje		http://paste.ubuntu.com/545226/   <- trying to run ./configure on the entangle-0.2.0 source. Anyone with a clue?
2010-12-18T17:08:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	well it's pretty self-explanatory. "Package 'hal' not found"
2010-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	jurgentje	dnivra	it is installed, it's version 0.54-ubuntu
2010-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	Do read even below-"you may set the environment variables...."
2010-12-18T17:10:00.000Z	jurgentje	dnivra	well... there's my question... what should I set those variables to?
2010-12-18T17:10:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	"PKG_CONFIG_PATH" i guess.
2010-12-18T17:10:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	neither do I :). maybe you should check the forums.
2010-12-18T17:10:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	forums of entangle that is.
2010-12-18T17:11:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	entangle also has an IRC channel #entangle on OFTC.
2010-12-18T17:12:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	you joined #entangle on OFTC and you became OP?
2010-12-18T17:13:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	wow! now that is surprising.

2010-12-18T17:13:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	well i have no clue; lemme check.
2010-12-18T17:15:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	maybe somebody could help. i don't know :).
2010-12-18T17:16:00.000Z	jurgentje	dnivra	thanks for looking with me :D  ... I just wanted to join their mailing list... and got the developer's email address... I'll mail with him :)
2010-12-18T17:17:00.000Z	dnivra	jurgentje	could you try install libhal-dev and try?
