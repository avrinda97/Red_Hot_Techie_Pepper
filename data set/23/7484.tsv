2006-06-30T15:29:00.000Z	mbirkis		how do i change the direction my delete key deletes?
2006-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	the keys are in /home/username/.keys directory. so "cd ~/.keys" will get you there.
2006-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	they aren
2006-06-30T15:32:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	they aren,t
2006-06-30T15:33:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	what keys are you talking about exactly. pgp or ssh or something else?
2006-06-30T15:34:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	my keyboards delete key deletes the wrong direction...  no ssh or stuff like that
2006-06-30T15:34:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	oh. totally misunderstood that one. bummer.
2006-06-30T15:35:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	i probably wasn
2006-06-30T15:35:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	clear enough in the question
2006-06-30T15:37:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	It is hard to say what might be wrong. maybe you have either 1. wrong keyboard in /etc/X11/xorg.conf 2. wrong language setting in /etc/X11/xorg.conf or 3. both. do you have any experience in altering that file?
2006-06-30T15:37:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	i have muckled about abit in it yes
2006-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	have a look at the Option "XkbModel" "pc10x" if the wrong number of keys are set there you might have that sort of problem. example: you have 102 key keyboard and have 105 in xorg.conf
2006-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	Option  "XkbModel" "pc105" <-- i have a laptop, what should i use here?
2006-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	i can't say for sure. I don't have a laptop anywhere near here. try pc102, and also see that Option "XkbLayout" is set to your language ("se" for swedish, "fi" for finnish etc)
2006-06-30T15:42:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	after changing i need to restart x right?
2006-06-30T15:42:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	normally, if you have a "windows" key and a "menu" key on your keyboard it should be 105. but then again, i can not say for sure. yes, after the change you need to restart X.
2006-06-30T15:42:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	make a backup of xorg.conf before changing it
2006-06-30T15:42:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	ok... thnx
2006-06-30T15:46:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	it didn't work... it is like my delete key and backspace key are mapped to the same key
2006-06-30T15:47:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	try to hit "num lock" and see if that's what messing it up
2006-06-30T15:47:00.000Z	mbirkis	Jowi	i don't have numlock, it is a laptop, and it is in all apps
2006-06-30T15:50:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	you absolutely have a num-lock even on a laptop. on a laptop, if the numlock is disabled (or enabled, depends on the laptop model usually), some keys on the keyboard act as a normal numerical keypad. tunring it on/off will enable/disable this feature.
2006-06-30T15:53:00.000Z	Jowi	mbirkis	if all else fail, run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and chose the default options, then restart X. your keyboard should (hopefully) be set to the correct settings.
