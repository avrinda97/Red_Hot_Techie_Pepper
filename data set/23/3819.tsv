2009-07-29T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	i'd agree but I can name people who disagree
2009-07-30T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	no as it will be massively unsecure, like windows
2009-07-30T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	sudo makes linux more secure
2009-07-30T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	it may be pesky, but if a malicious java or flash command has full access to your system then it can and will run rife copying and changing everything i twants
2009-07-30T01:15:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	then he can get five people to tell him how to chown -R andy.andy /etc
2009-07-30T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	that needs sudo
2009-08-06T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	run top while it runs, look at how resource hungry it is
2009-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	it's using 132M memory and 0.3% of my cpu
2009-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	and it's been running and caching all day
2009-08-06T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	132mb just for a browser. bit excessie dont you think
2009-08-06T02:44:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	40M after a restart
2009-08-06T02:46:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	40M isnt' too bad is it?
2009-08-06T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	try Kazehakase ;)
2009-08-06T02:52:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	i got the crashies with the kazehakase-webkit backend so far
2009-08-06T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	works great here, its the defalt in fluxbuntu which i made to be small and punchy, midori is pretty nice too
2009-08-06T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	it may hav isues as you have a ~/.mozilla folder and kazenhakase uses gecko like firefox
2009-08-06T02:54:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	yeah it's looking for gecko
2009-08-25T00:33:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	ircyop FATAL: Could not open '/boot/System.map-2.6.28-13-generic
2009-08-25T00:35:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	ircyop FATAL: Could not open '/boot/System.map-2.6.28-13-generic'  that's the show stopper
2009-08-25T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	try: sudo touch /boot/System.map-2.6.28-13-generic
2009-08-25T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	then run: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get -f install
2009-08-25T00:41:00.000Z	bucky	ActionParsnip	ircyop was the one that had the problem and pasted the error to you
2011-01-04T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bucky	you can run ubuntu with a different DE if you like
