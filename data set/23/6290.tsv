2007-01-16T16:49:00.000Z	mzuverink		So I still get the error when gnome starts stating that it det4ects another gnome panel running and it will now exit  That leaves me with no panels.  Please, how do I fix this?
2007-01-16T16:49:00.000Z	tarun	mzuverink	: open a terminal n type "pkill gnome-panel"
2007-01-16T16:50:00.000Z	mzuverink		That did not work
2007-01-16T16:50:00.000Z	tarun		it works
2007-01-16T16:50:00.000Z	tarun		type ps -A n see if theres an instance of gnome-panel running
2007-01-16T16:50:00.000Z	mzuverink		that command does not work
2007-01-16T16:51:00.000Z	tarun		n then pkill that process
2007-01-16T16:51:00.000Z	mzuverink		no gnome panels running
2007-01-16T16:51:00.000Z	tarun		then how is it detecting that theres a panel already running
2007-01-16T16:52:00.000Z	mzuverink	tarun	youve got me, but I have no panels....
