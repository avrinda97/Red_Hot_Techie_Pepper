2008-10-10T06:52:00.000Z	gluonman		I'm having difficulty playing some DVDs on my laptop (Ubuntu 8.04). I wanted to rip my library of movies to my external HDD for my own personal portable use. Libdvdcss2 seemed to perform nicely on most of my DVDs, but a couple of them have difficulty with copying over their .VOB files because of input/output errors I'm assuming are associated with encryption. After installing some DVD related packages from synaptec, Movie Player won't even play
2008-10-10T06:52:00.000Z	gluonman		the same DVDs that won't rip. What should I do?
2008-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	dvdfabdecrypter hd in wine
2008-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	alright. And how about solving my DVD playback issue with movie player?
2008-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	I'm using DVDFab HD Decryptor to rip my No Country For Old Men to my external, which has 21 GBs available. The DVD itself is just under 7 GBs but it's telling me that there's not enough disk space for me to write to. Do you know what gives?
2008-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	try ripping to your hdd and copying it to the external
2008-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	my HDD has less than 5 GBs of available space.
2008-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	your system is too old
2008-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	probably a memory problem somewhere
2008-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	my system isn't too old.
2008-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	it is if you've only got 5 gb left
2008-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	that says nothing about age. More like usage.
2008-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	mine's seen plenty of usage, i've never been down to less than 120 gb
2008-10-10T07:11:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	doesn't matter. Just because I have less than 5 Gigs left doesn't mean my system is old.
2008-10-10T07:11:00.000Z	badfish	gluonman	it means your system won't play a dvd
2008-10-10T07:11:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	no, it means my system won't hold the space a DVD will take up.
2008-10-10T07:14:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	does the specific name of the DVD matter?
2008-10-10T07:15:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	well it's No Country For Old Men by the Coen brothers.
2008-10-10T07:15:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	again, it has nothing to do with the system, perhaps some codec issues, possibly hardware differences as well.
2008-10-10T07:16:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	or No Country For Old Men is just really well encrypted. I've only had two DVDs that are this stubborn. The rest are a piece of cake.
2008-10-10T07:16:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	I'm not dual booting, but that doesn't really matter.
2008-10-10T07:17:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	if it works in Windows but not in Linux, I'll just have to figure out how to make it work in LInux.
2008-10-10T07:17:00.000Z	gluonman	badfish	that's nice. I've also been ripping them for quite some time. I just ran into a problem with this one.
