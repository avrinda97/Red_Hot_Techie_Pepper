2012-09-16T15:52:00.000Z	Chiko		has anyone here used/setup mono?
2012-09-16T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	ask your real question
2012-09-16T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	what version?
2012-09-16T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	pastebin the command you run and the full output
2012-09-16T15:57:00.000Z	Chiko	jrib	http://pastebin.com/Hf3ZSS40
2012-09-16T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	you'd probably benefit from the script ActionParsnip just posted
2012-09-16T16:02:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	just rename your current /var/lib/dpkg/available to something like /var/lib/dpkg/available.broken, then copy /var/lib/dpkg/available-old to /var/lib/dpkg/available, and finally, run « sudo apt-get update »
2012-09-16T16:04:00.000Z	Chiko	jrib	dpkg: parse error, in file '/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 2:missing package name
2012-09-16T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	delete that file then (you have backups), and run « sudo apt-get update » then
2012-09-16T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	you /are/ running "update" and not "upgrade", right?
2012-09-16T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	what's the output from upgrade now?
2012-09-16T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	after, deleting the file, then doing « sudo apt-get update » and nothing else
2012-09-16T16:11:00.000Z	Chiko	jrib	i did that before "file deleted", "ran apt-get update"
2012-09-16T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	right, so then what's the output of upgrade?
2012-09-16T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	pastebin the full output
2012-09-16T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	run « dpkg --clear-avail », then « sudo apt-get update » and pastebin the output
2012-09-16T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	now try upgrade
2012-09-16T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	although I am seeing taht you have hardy and lucid repositories... you should fix that...
2012-09-16T16:27:00.000Z	Chiko	jrib	it's doing a lot more now how was you able to influence this? :S
2012-09-16T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	it should be rebuilding the available file... "dpkg --clear-avail" told it to clear its knowledge about the old one
2012-09-16T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	you should only have repositories for the version you are running
2012-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	 mono is in the repositories
2012-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	Chiko	maybe "mono-complete", but I'm on 12.04
