2012-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	Devvie		I'm having trouble with a hard-drive, have finally managed to boot up systemrescuecd but not sure how to go about recovering it now - any suggestions or where should I look for help? :x
2012-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	what do you want to recover?
2012-08-09T03:39:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	As much as I can, or at the very least my Ubuntu-wubi install so I can get my passwords and files back. :x
2012-08-09T03:40:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	i'm new to ubuntu (i used several different distr.) but i think you want to backup your /home/dvvie (example) folder
2012-08-09T03:42:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	whats your problem with your current ubuntu installation on your disk?
2012-08-09T03:42:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	The problem isn't with the installation itself, the disk has just become unopenable, and I'm trying to recover its data somehow.
2012-08-09T03:43:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	is your home directory encrypted?
2012-08-09T03:43:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	It doesn't even get to the OS-selection screen, just errors out and asks me to press CtrlAltDel to reboot. And it's not encrypted as far as I know.
2012-08-09T04:05:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Thanks! I'll go try those now and see how it works. Thanks for your help!
2012-08-09T03:44:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	mount for example a ubuntu-live-cd and check if you can access your hdd. if its possible, backup your /home/ folder to a different place, like a second hdd or usb-device
2012-08-09T03:45:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	I tried accessing it with Linux Mint earlier, but it gave me "exit code 2" when trying to mount.
2012-08-09T03:47:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	do you know where you installed your wubi exactly?
2012-08-09T03:47:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Hm, probably in C:\ubuntu\ I think, not sure though. And just being able to copy the file itself would be great.
2012-08-09T03:49:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	read the part "How can I make a backup of my Wubi install?" https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide/
2012-08-09T03:49:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Okay, thanks. I'll see if that helps, but I'm afraid I'll still have problems mounting my hard drive.
2012-08-09T03:50:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	and backup wubildr.mbr wubildr wubildr.cfg
2012-08-09T03:51:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Thanks. I'll see if I can.
2012-08-09T04:01:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	its very risky, but you could try UBCD4WIN and try to repair your hdd
2012-08-09T04:02:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Thanks, what is that? Another distro like SystemRescueCD?
2012-08-09T04:02:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	something like that, only specific for windows and hdd problems etc...
2012-08-09T04:03:00.000Z	calzifer	Devvie	just read it carefully
2012-08-09T04:03:00.000Z	Devvie	calzifer	Okay, thanks!
