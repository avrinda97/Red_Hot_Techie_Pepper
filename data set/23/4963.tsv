2007-04-13T14:53:00.000Z	||arifaX	k-edgy	it should auto-mount but will not if ntfs file system has errors. this could happen if you unplug it without unmounting (win/lin). to fix this just plug it on a windows machine and unplug it using the wizard, then connecting to ubuntu should automount it
2007-04-13T14:54:00.000Z	k-edgy	||arifaX	: so, if a portable hdd mounted with read-only, it means dat it was not unplugged correctly, right?

2007-04-13T14:56:00.000Z	||arifaX	k-edgy	with ntfs-3g it should mount r/w maybe you have to install package ntfs-config and do a sudo ntfsconfig to enable r/w
2007-04-13T14:56:00.000Z	||arifaX	k-edgy	err sudo ntfs-config
2007-04-13T14:57:00.000Z	k-edgy	||arifaX	: sudo ntfs-config - no such command
2007-04-13T14:57:00.000Z	||arifaX	k-edgy	you have to install it first   sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
2007-04-13T14:57:00.000Z	k-edgy		owh
2007-04-13T14:57:00.000Z	k-edgy		okay
