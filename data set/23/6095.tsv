2011-03-08T17:57:00.000Z	dkam		Hi guys - trying to mount an NFS share with pretty default values - get "mount(2) invalid argument"
2011-03-08T17:58:00.000Z	dkam		mount.nfs: mount(2): Invalid argument
2011-03-08T17:58:00.000Z	dkam		mount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified
2011-03-08T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	what are you actually typing?
2011-03-08T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	hmm... try dropping final '/' in the paths?
2011-03-08T18:02:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	no dice
2011-03-08T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	does it work if you don't pass "-t nfs" explicitly?
2011-03-08T18:04:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	no - nor if I run mount.nfs
2011-03-08T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	with -v, the full output is just that one line "mount(2) invalid argument"?

2011-03-08T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	looks like http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=568288, there's a workaround with adding -o nfsversionblahblah in there
2011-03-08T18:17:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	adding "-o nfsvers-3" or "-o nfsvers-4" doesn't help
2011-03-08T18:17:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	it is correctly parsed though because -v displays it
2011-03-08T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	'=', not '-'
2011-03-08T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	not sure if you missed it, you need to use nfsvers=3, not nfsvers-3
2011-03-08T18:24:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	that certainly does give a different error...
2011-03-08T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	ha
2011-03-08T18:30:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	Humiliation. 1. /etc/hosts.allow on the server wasn't configured with the host.  2. had to force version 3 - even though the other client doesn't require that.
2011-03-08T18:31:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	but - original client is Ubuntu 10.04 and new client is 10.10
2011-03-08T18:31:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	so - the default must have changed.
2011-03-08T18:31:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	thanks for your help
2011-03-08T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	dkam	maybe default nfs version changed
2011-03-08T18:31:00.000Z	dkam	jrib	I guess it must have.
