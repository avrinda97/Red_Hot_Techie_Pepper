2008-11-03T07:41:00.000Z	daiv		any other channels good for ubuntu-generic or ubuntu-386 support?
2008-11-03T07:41:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	if you dont have any luck here, try the forums
2008-11-03T07:42:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	thanks, I'll give them a shot
2008-11-03T07:42:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	dont give up
2008-11-03T07:43:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	I don't want to, but I work too much to spend too much time on a PC
2008-11-03T07:43:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	99% of ubuntu 'just works'
2008-11-03T07:43:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	i missed your question so i cant say
2008-11-03T07:44:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	ps/2 didnt work either??
2008-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	ohhhh. its not a mouse problem. the box is crashing
2008-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	that flashing means bad bad bad heh.
2008-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	Works fine from a 7.something or 8.04 live disc though
2008-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	i might guess a video driver bug
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	8.04 is a fine distro too, you could use that till its worked out
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	I hate to reinstall is the big thing
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	yeah
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	you can probably tweak xorg.conf to get it to stop.
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	How can I access it?  Telnet?
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	ssh. telnet is dead.  and no, its locking up i think. you'd need to boot to safe (non xorg) mode
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	do you know any good tutuorials?
2008-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=19897 maybe? could be too old though.
2008-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	i dont understand. how did you fix it?
2008-11-03T07:52:00.000Z	daiv	Rubin	no mouse, no usb at all, only ps/2 keyboard
2008-11-03T07:52:00.000Z	Rubin	daiv	good idea. i gotta run, so good luck
