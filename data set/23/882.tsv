2011-02-02T21:52:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	i used sudo chown in the terminal
2011-02-02T21:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	i was just suggestion a possible cause for permission issue in your home dir.  Your "sudo chown ..." is fine.
2011-02-02T21:53:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	can i also force this command somehow? and what is the correct command?? and which permissions are standard??
2011-02-02T21:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	"sudo chown $YOURUSERNAME:$YOURUSERNAME filename"  you could also use -r on directories.  (REPLACE $YOURUSERNAME with your actual username)
2011-02-02T21:55:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	and if i want to change permissions for my complete home directory i use this recursive command??
2011-02-02T21:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	"cd /home && sudo chown -r $USER:$USER $USER" should work
2011-02-02T21:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	SORRY it's -R for recursive on chown, my bad
2011-02-02T21:59:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	chown invalid option -- 'r'
2011-02-02T21:59:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	heheh
2011-02-02T21:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	did you see my last message?  sorry it's -R
2011-02-02T22:00:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	yes, thanks
2011-02-02T22:00:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	it looks like it would work...
2011-02-02T22:00:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	i really hope this will solve a lot of problems...
2011-02-02T22:01:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	hm, if i do ls -l the owner and group are still root
2011-02-02T22:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	what file/directory is this?
2011-02-02T22:02:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	the one from my home/dee01
2011-02-02T22:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	i have no idea then?  sorry.
2011-02-02T22:03:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	it somehow got fu^# up when i upraded from 10.4 to 10.10
2011-02-02T22:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	i don't to upgrades (i think they are a BAD idea) - and don't even use #* for language like that.
2011-02-02T22:05:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	i like the ^#()$ language like that! ;) i use it in all my 6 languages! regualarly! and it is fun! at least the last fun on this strange ^#)%Y# planet :D
2011-02-02T22:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dee01	it's no appropriate here.  don't use that language at all.  best of luck.
2011-02-02T22:08:00.000Z	dee01	ZykoticK9	i am sorry that you don't like my expressions. as i said: when you know it in 6 spoken languages then you will start to like it! anyway, many thanks! and don't take the digital life too serious... it is too short! have a nice time!
