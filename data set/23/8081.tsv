2006-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	Linux101		so what is the biggest and best package list -- Edgy, Dapper, Breezy, Warty, etc..
2006-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Dapper
2006-10-29T07:03:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	if you need to ask, you should be using Dapper. it's stable.
2006-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	that is 1) pointless and 2) not the same as a list of packages, as some are mutually exclusive.
2006-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Feel free to ignore me, but don't be giving me lip, I'm just trying to help you.
2006-10-29T07:07:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Yeah, fine.
2006-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	No, installing *all* packages. Go have a google for 'knapsack problem' and you'll see what I mean <heh>
2006-10-29T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	.. which is what I said ;-)
2006-10-29T07:11:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	A normal base install of Dapper is ~ 2GB and will install just fine.
2006-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Based on what you said I thought you were going to try and install as many of the 25,000 available packages as possible.
2006-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Anyway, obviously  a misunderstanding.
2006-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	Anyway, the best version currently is still Dapper... Edgy isn't really stable yet.
2006-10-29T07:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	packages.ubuntu.com should give you a list I think
2006-10-29T07:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Linux101	I use it on a few machines.
