2005-12-25T06:51:00.000Z	yoav		can anyone help me?
2005-12-25T06:53:00.000Z	yoav		heeeeeellllllllllllllllllppppp p. should i come back later?
2005-12-25T06:54:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	you can only erase an entire CDRW
2005-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	'sudo cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 blank-fast'
2005-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	adapt your device (0,0,0)
2005-12-25T07:05:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	do you use nautilus?
2005-12-25T07:06:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	do you use nautilus?
2005-12-25T07:07:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	if you use nautilus to write something to CDRW, it'll automatically offer to erase it before writing.
2005-12-25T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	how many cd drives in your system?
2005-12-25T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	then you should be able to erase the CDRW with 'sudo cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 blank=fast'. Pls try it.
2005-12-25T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	if you want to learn precisely what you are doing there, read 'man cdrecord'
2005-12-25T07:12:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	is this a SCSI drive?
2005-12-25T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	can you run 'sudo cdrecord -scanbus' and tell me how many lines of output roughly?
2005-12-25T07:17:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	no, that is why we use sudo.
2005-12-25T07:17:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	it runs the following command as root.
2005-12-25T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	do you see a line of the format 0,0,0 (possibly with other numbers)?
2005-12-25T07:24:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	I'm sorry, I'm digging in the dark. The cdrecord command I gave you should have worked.
2005-12-25T07:25:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	perhaps the way forward for you is to install a CD-R utility program: gnome-baker or k3b and check whether they work for you.
2005-12-25T07:25:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	can you not back up via the net?
2005-12-25T07:28:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	you could tar your important files and ftp them - probably easiest to 'get' them from Windows.
2005-12-25T07:29:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	or scp them if you have ssh on Ubuntu and puttyssh on Win
2005-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	soundray	yoav	okay, I'll stop. Again, sorry I couldn't really help. Hope you manage with gnome-baker/k3b
