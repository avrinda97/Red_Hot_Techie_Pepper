2011-06-23T23:12:00.000Z	ak5		does anyone here have a lenovo thinkpad edge 11 with the newest bios and tell me how he/she did it? I am trying to fool around with grub4dos and its not pleasent
2011-06-23T23:12:00.000Z	ak5		pleasant*
2011-06-23T23:14:00.000Z	winut	ak5	grub is easy if you have another partition
2011-06-23T23:14:00.000Z	winut		how many do you have?
2011-06-23T23:14:00.000Z	ak5	winut	I have one USB disk
2011-06-23T23:14:00.000Z	ak5		usb thumbdrive that it
2011-06-23T23:14:00.000Z	ak5		is*
2011-06-23T23:15:00.000Z	winut		doesn't grub pick up the internal disc then?
2011-06-23T23:15:00.000Z	ak5	winut	I have nothing installed on the internal disk, I want grub to boot the update bios iso
2011-06-23T23:16:00.000Z	winut		cant you just change the boot order to cd first?
2011-06-23T23:16:00.000Z	ak5	winut	I have no cd drive (nor external)
2011-06-23T23:17:00.000Z	ak5		thats why I am playing around with grub4dos
2011-06-23T23:17:00.000Z	winut		oh, sorry!
2011-06-23T23:17:00.000Z	ak5		don't worry, I am probaby being short spoken because I am annoyed by this problem xD
2011-06-23T23:18:00.000Z	winut		maybe there is a generic guide you can follow for this, non ubuntu related on how to make a cd boot off a usb stick (separate one) ?
2011-06-23T23:18:00.000Z	winut		otherwise you can make a dos boot usb with the app and bios files
2011-06-23T23:18:00.000Z	ak5	winut	yeah, thats what I tried
2011-06-23T23:19:00.000Z	winut		what happened?
2011-06-23T23:19:00.000Z	ak5		grub4dos booted from my usb drive, but didn't boot my BOOT.iso (with the BIOS update)
2011-06-23T23:20:00.000Z	ak5	winut	^
2011-06-23T23:21:00.000Z	winut	ak5	never done this but it sounds plausable
2011-06-23T23:21:00.000Z	winut		what format is the usb stick?
2011-06-23T23:22:00.000Z	ak5	winut	vfat
