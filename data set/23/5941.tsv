2009-04-07T21:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	well there's easypeasy and such as well, but that one is not suppourted here apparantly
2009-04-07T21:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	 did you md5sum your installation  CD?  or however your installing it
2009-04-07T21:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	3 differnet versions of what? and which Ubuntu?  and how old is your graphics card?
2009-04-07T21:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	be careful what you say, or Pici will boot you
2009-04-07T21:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	interesting comment
2009-04-07T21:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	and no,  a lot of guys with Aspergers, and rather good at computers, and  can be pretty helpful,  and so your comment their could be offensive even
2009-04-07T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	yeah there are netbook channels
2009-04-07T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	#easypeasy for the similar version to Ubuntu's thingey
2009-04-07T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	easypeasy is pretty much the same thing as the thing Ubuntu has  for netbooks,   also I am not even sure  if Ubuntu's version is suppourted  anymore, or suppourted properly
2009-04-07T21:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	oclet	  type  /list in your client and that should list  all the channels on freenode
2009-04-07T21:39:00.000Z	oclet	sebsebseb	stop talking to me
