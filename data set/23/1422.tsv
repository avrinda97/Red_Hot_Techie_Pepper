2010-04-09T11:00:00.000Z	MailGon		is this the best way to go?
2010-04-09T11:00:00.000Z	MailGon		or can I just format the drive in my ubuntu?
2010-04-09T11:01:00.000Z	MailGon		Err
2010-04-09T11:01:00.000Z	MailGon		No I cant
2010-04-09T11:01:00.000Z	MailGon		so I cant install windows anywhere since theres no partition there (visually)
2010-04-09T11:01:00.000Z	MailGon		it doesnt show up
2010-04-09T11:02:00.000Z	MailGon		Well id need ANOTHER usb though D=
2010-04-09T11:02:00.000Z	MailGon		yeah
2010-04-09T11:02:00.000Z	MailGon		so.....the only way to do it is to use the live Cd on another usb then
2010-04-09T11:03:00.000Z	MailGon		I'm trying to remove ubuntu, however I cant use a live CD since netbooks dont take CD's
2010-04-09T11:04:00.000Z	crucialhoax	MailGon	if you really want to put windows back on, download gparted live cd and put that on a USB drive using ubuntu.
2010-04-09T11:04:00.000Z	MailGon		okay thnx
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	MailGon		gparted is an OS?
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	MailGon		o_O
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	MailGon	sebsebseb	I use my netbook for development purposes, some of my tools do not run on linux
2010-04-09T11:06:00.000Z	MailGon		no
2010-04-09T11:06:00.000Z	crucialhoax		!grub2
2010-04-09T11:06:00.000Z	MailGon		And also my webcam doesnt seem to work on linux, some sites dont work, lots of things I dont like
2010-04-09T11:07:00.000Z	MailGon		No Ive ran XP before on it, it runs smoothly, my cousin stupidly put ubuntu on it, removing all of my files and tools
2010-04-09T11:08:00.000Z	MailGon		okay so, I just use gparted (from the live CD 'USB'), format my ubuntu installation, and then it should show up on my windows installation partition list correct?
2010-04-09T11:08:00.000Z	crucialhoax	MailGon	in ubuntu. System > Administration > USB startup disk creator download the gparted live cd and use that iso and a flash drive to format the hard drive.
2010-04-09T11:08:00.000Z	MailGon		thnx crucial!
2010-04-09T11:09:00.000Z	crucialhoax	MailGon	you got it?
