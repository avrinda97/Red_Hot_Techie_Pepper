2011-04-04T13:40:00.000Z	Sik		Does anybody know why if Ubuntu installs correctly, then when I try to boot from hard disk the computer hangs at a blinking cursor?
2011-04-04T13:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	are you using an ati or nvidia card? the drivers installed might not do kms, or the login manager isn't able to restart
2011-04-04T13:42:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	S3 Chrome
2011-04-04T13:42:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	that might be a real problem
2011-04-04T13:43:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	s3 devices are kind of a tough thing in linux
2011-04-04T13:43:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	any idea of what might be causing it? It literally hangs before it even boots :|
2011-04-04T13:43:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	ok, do you get a grub menu to pick the boot label?
2011-04-04T13:46:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	ext4
2011-04-04T13:47:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	if you hold shift when it boots does it show a grub menu?
2011-04-04T13:58:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	tried what you told me to do, no GRUB menu (or anything for that matter)
2011-04-04T13:58:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	also tried using doing it wiht the LiveCD and the LiveUSB, just to make sure I was doing it right (GRUB command line appears on those)
2011-04-04T13:59:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	well, if it doesn't show grub theres a problem with it; i don't have the time at the moment to troubleshoot what, i _think_ that can happen when the bios map at install time for the drive is wrong
2011-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	i didn't intend for you to ask directly, merely to give you a lead; you'll probably need to google around :\ (people here are good at fixing small simple things, that sort of problem isn't)
2011-04-09T20:53:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	bro i got answers for you
2011-04-09T20:53:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	huh?
2011-04-09T20:53:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	first, use glxinfo it will tell you what is going on with rendering
2011-04-09T20:54:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	second, open volume properties and pick the device you want to use; pulse has a list of rankings but sometimes it picks the wrong output when there are some with the same rank, if there's 2 it's 50/50 :D
2011-04-09T20:54:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	the problem is that apparently the proper onboard sound drivers won't load unless it happens to be device #2
2011-04-09T20:55:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	it is random, or rather; can't be trusted to be the same on every boot, but pulse should be using bus addresses and outputting to the one you set regardless
2011-04-09T20:55:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	OK... now, how do I ensure it loads the proper drivers for the onboard sound always? (and the sound card is also hit and miss on getting it to work... ugh)
2011-04-09T20:58:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	you shouldn't have to worry about the driver loading if it is indeed a pulse problem
2011-04-09T20:58:00.000Z	ohsix	Sik	alsactl reload or whatever might bypass module blacklisting, so i'd look there
2011-04-09T20:59:00.000Z	Sik	ohsix	er, whatever, at worst I'll have to load it manually, not like I boot every two seconds :P Will come back later if I outright can't get sound working again
