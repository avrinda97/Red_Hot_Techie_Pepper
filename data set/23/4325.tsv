2009-08-24T16:42:00.000Z	jpastore		Is there a way to control which screen an application starts on from the "startup applications"
2009-08-24T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 often you can do a 'DISPLAY=0.1 runapp' and it might show up on the 2nd screen
2009-08-24T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 or somting like that.. :)
2009-08-24T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 but i cant rember the details.. i saw it done once befor.. but that info i gave seems to be incorrect.. trying to rember how i did it befor
2009-08-24T16:47:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	I always that you could do export DISPLAY=0 or 1,2 depending on the screen but how should I specify that in the launcher? export DISPLAY=1; application cmd?
2009-08-24T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 export does it for all following commands..  for one command you dont export
2009-08-24T16:48:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	ahhh ok let me try that afk
2009-08-24T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 could write a script that does it :)  bash takes the syntaz 'variable=foo  command' and ONLY that 'command' sees that variable changed..
2009-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	but i cant seem to get it working right here..   I recall it used to work.. ages ago.
2009-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 also compiz apraently has some way to rember where things are at also.
2009-08-24T16:50:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	it wouldn't just be display:1?
2009-08-24T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 twinview is special. :)
2009-08-24T16:51:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	oh right I don't have my twin view enabled right now on my laptop...my second monitor is in the other office
2009-08-24T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 so it depends.. twinview or not. xinerama or not.. 2 X sessions or not. :)
2009-08-24T16:55:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	I would be content with it starting on a screen regardless of which monitor it was.
2009-08-24T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 that wasent clear to me. :)  what are ya trying to do exactly
2009-08-24T16:57:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	I meant that sometimes I boot my laptop without a second monitor so controlling which monitor it lands on doesn't matter. I have the cube running with 3 sides. I want soem applications to start on 1 one side some on another side, and so on.
2009-08-24T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 those are 'virtual desktops' not screens..  totally diffrent thing. :)
2009-08-24T16:58:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	doesn't matter if they are on the left or right screen...that kind of granular control would be great, but ubunut has a hard enough time dealing with my other monitor sometimes not being there
2009-08-24T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	 if you are using compiz. it is supposed to have some way to save the 'location' from what i am reading
2009-08-24T16:58:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	sorry just woke up, you are absolutely correct
2009-08-24T16:59:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_Willis	the most I can find is in the "startup applicaitons" remember running applications when logging out.
2009-08-24T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jpastore	  I dont use compiz much. but thats what a trhead i jsut read said. 'startup applications' is just for launching.. not rembering..
