2010-06-27T17:36:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	what exactly do you want to do? You can do apt-get install -t $suite package, or apt-get install package=version. you get the version from apt-cache policy package.
2010-06-27T17:37:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	i'd like to roll back wine1.2-rc5 to rc4, rc3 or possibly rc2
2010-06-27T17:38:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	does the desired version show up in apt-cache policy wine? If so, use that to apt-get install wine=1.2-rc3 or so..
2010-06-27T17:40:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	i'm unfamiliar with the apt-cache policy wine, if you mean does it display when entering apt-cache policy wine into term, then no it does not
2010-06-27T17:41:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	hm. could you paste the output of apt-cache policy wine? :-) using dpaste.com or so.
2010-06-27T17:41:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	also, how did you install the 1.2-rc5?
2010-06-27T17:42:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	http://pastebin.com/iQhWcutA - through automatic updates, i added the wine repo previously
2010-06-27T17:43:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	if relevant i've only just upgraded to 10.04, and there were some 'cleanups' done
2010-06-27T17:44:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	hm. Is downgraing to  wine-1.1.42-0ubuntu4 good enough for you? If so, do a apt-get install wine=1.1.42-0ubuntu4 If not, try to find a .deb of your desired version :-\
2010-06-27T17:48:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/packages/show/198720 - 1.2~rc4-0ubuntu1 is listed there but only rc5 available to download :(
2010-06-27T17:48:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	you might have an appropriate .deb in /var/cache/apt/archives.
2010-06-27T17:52:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	wine1.2_1.2~rc4-0ubuntu1~karmicppa1_i386.deb found but it was before my updade to lucid so to google..
2010-06-27T17:53:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	you might be able to dpkg -i /path/to/debfile it.
2010-06-27T17:54:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	or just open wine1.2_1.2~rc4-0ubuntu1~karmicppa1_i386.deb from firefox with gdebi? also, should i sudo apt-get remove wine first and backup my .wine dir?
2010-06-27T17:55:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	eh. yeah. good suggestions. They shouldn't do harm after all. So yeah, go ahead :-)
2010-06-27T17:56:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	okay - and that's the version pinned because it's no longer installed in synaptic?
2010-06-27T17:57:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	ah. what? Sorry, I don't follow you. You can see the versions installed and available with apt-cache policy
2010-06-27T18:00:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	i just mean synaptic/apt-get won't upgrade my rc4 to rc5 because i've removed rc5? installing with gdebi is separate from apt-get and doesn't qualify the software for autoupdates?
2010-06-27T18:02:00.000Z	Muelli	laeg	hm. the next apt-get upgrade will probably upgrade to rc5. You can manually pin rc4, but don't ask me how to do it. It's easy enough though.
2010-06-27T18:21:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	i just forced the different version via synaptic, there's a force version under the package menu. strangley it only seems to let be backdate to the versions since upgrading to 10.04 today, which does make sense because the karma versions aren't intended for lucid but it would be nice if it gave the option to download previous versions for lucid also
2010-06-27T18:21:00.000Z	laeg	Muelli	ty for your help, i have learned some
