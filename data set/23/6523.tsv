2007-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	'sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/somewhere -o uid=1000,gid=1000'
2007-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	that'll make it writeable by your user
2007-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	that's a problem with the Windows CD
2007-01-12T06:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	The grub boot is in the first 512Kb of the HDD so that means you've passed by the BIOS's loading of a boot sector on the CD.
2007-01-12T06:39:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	so my windows cd is faulty? 'cos when i turn off my raid controller i get grub error 17
2007-01-12T06:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	the XP cd should just work so either that or the optical drive is stuffed.
2007-01-12T06:40:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	the raid/grub problem is probably normal. Do you already have drives in RAID that you installed grub/linux on?
2007-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	So xp-cd or drive is stuffed.
2007-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	burnt xp cd?
2007-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	no i realized that i have 2 identical drives so i thought i'd try RAID so i enabled it
2007-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	yea i have my own product just lazy to download updates
2007-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	do you have linux on one of the drives already?
2007-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	 no used too though
2007-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	so the grub is just from the old install?
2007-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	 prolly
2007-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	 'cos i've never seen that erorr till i turned on RAID
2007-01-12T06:44:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	 i'm using GParted now to format both my harddrives to fat32
2007-01-12T06:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	so get a working xp disc >> install xp on the raid'd drives >> install ubuntu after (it'll find xp just fine and include it in grub as an option)
2007-01-12T06:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	don't need to.
2007-01-12T06:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	You can just fdisk the drives though, might save any stupid grub stuff after installing xp.
2007-01-12T06:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	rkv	or 'dd' the first 512Kb of the drive will nuke grub (but anyway that isn't necessary)
2007-01-12T06:46:00.000Z	rkv	gyaresu	how do u 'dd' tje first 512 kb?
