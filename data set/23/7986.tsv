2005-03-12T08:26:00.000Z	evarlast		its debian based, but up to date and provides a refined user experience in comparison to debian and most other distro
2005-03-12T08:27:00.000Z	evarlast		I wouldn't say it is a lot better than MDK.  It is certainly better than MDK if you prefer a gnome desktop.
2005-03-12T08:27:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	how does debian not provide a refined user experience?
2005-03-12T08:28:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	once you got debian set up, it's as easy as ubuntu ;)
2005-03-12T08:29:00.000Z	Chipzz		Ubuntu is just easier to install :)
2005-03-12T08:29:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	Debian does very little to make things easy to use.  Debian says: edit this config file using your favorite editor.  And debian seems to think this is fine.  Other distributions try to provide tools to make common tasks easy.
2005-03-12T08:29:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	which is mostly one-time things
2005-03-12T08:29:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	debian is an excellent distribution.  I've run it on a single server since 1998
2005-03-12T08:30:00.000Z	Chipzz		though I must admit that the network administration thing is nice
2005-03-12T08:30:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	I have used it on my desktop for over 2 years
2005-03-12T08:31:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	ubuntu among other things does install some packages that are also in debian but that don't get installed by default
2005-03-12T08:32:00.000Z	Chipzz		Ubuntu is in some ways more polished then debian, especially the admin applications
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	Chipzz		and Ubuntu has more recent gnome packages :)
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	I understand.  I'm glad we agree.
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	Chipzz		but debian can be quite polished if you want it too ;)
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	Chipzz		it's just more effort :)
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	i.e. you have to polish debian yourself, but it provides nice tools to polish it with.
2005-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	Chipzz		and debian and ubuntu benefit _mutually_ :)
2005-03-12T08:34:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	I dunno, do you think debian will ever get Xorg?  ;)
2005-03-12T08:34:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	yes, after sarge
2005-03-12T08:34:00.000Z	Chipzz	evarlast	you should remember debian has a different scope from Ubuntu
2005-03-12T08:35:00.000Z	Chipzz		debian is just more focussed on stability IMHO
2005-03-12T08:35:00.000Z	evarlast	Chipzz	that is exactly what I am remembering and stating.
