2006-11-30T17:47:00.000Z	Math^	webben	I've installed it
2006-11-30T17:48:00.000Z	Math^	webben	when I want to connect and type my passwd it will not connect
2006-11-30T17:48:00.000Z	webben	Math^	oh
2006-11-30T17:48:00.000Z	webben	Math^	that could be a lot of things :(
2006-11-30T17:49:00.000Z	webben	Math^	I'd doublecheck the password settings for the share folder on windows
2006-11-30T17:53:00.000Z	webben	Math^	oh ... then check the shared folder settings in linux
2006-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	Math^	webben	I'll take a look, thnx :)
2006-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	webben	Math^	what windows are you connecting from btw?
2006-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	webben	Math^	and is this via domain or via workgroup?
2006-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	webben	Math^	ah XP shouldn't be /too/ bad.
2006-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	webben	Math^	hmm ... you need to make sure the machines are in the same workgroup then
2006-11-30T17:55:00.000Z	webben	Math^	I'm not much better. I hack at them until they work then try and forget about them.
2006-11-30T17:55:00.000Z	webben	Math^	Does your Linux machine appear when you go browsing local network in Network Places?
2006-11-30T17:56:00.000Z	Math^	webben	no
2006-11-30T17:56:00.000Z	Math^	webben	WindowsXP found my linux-pc :D
2006-11-30T17:58:00.000Z	Math^	webben	in my search results I can see: laptop server(Samba, Ubuntu) (laptop) and just laptop with message unknown
2006-11-30T06:00:00.000Z	webben	Math^	ah at least it sees it ... that's a start
2006-11-30T06:00:00.000Z	webben	Math^	there is a #samba channel, you might try asking there
2006-11-30T06:01:00.000Z	Math^	webben	alright, thnx :)
2006-11-30T06:03:00.000Z	Math^	webben	there's nobody there
