2012-04-22T00:25:00.000Z	Mrokii		Hello. Since a few days ago I have a problem with Flash. Whenever I start a Flash-movie in any browser the plugin either seems to crash after a few seconds or stalls the brwoser(s) for some seconds. It's impossible to watch any Flash movie anymore in Browsers because they all lag every few seconds, if they don't crash.
2012-04-22T00:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	what browser, and what version of flash?
2012-04-22T00:29:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	try installing flash manually
2012-04-22T00:31:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	I'll try, though I think I already did that. Do you know if I have to restart the system or should Flash be detected automatically?
2012-04-22T00:32:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	i would think automatically detected, i've never had a problem with it being auto detected
2012-04-22T00:32:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	how did you try to install it manually?
2012-04-22T00:34:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	I think I tried Synaptic, removing and reinstalling it. And then a Firefox-extension named "Flash Aid" that is supposed to install the correct version. Didn't help.
2012-04-22T00:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	thats not really installing manually
2012-04-22T00:34:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	So what exactly do you mean?
2012-04-22T00:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	what version of ubuntu are you using again?
2012-04-22T00:35:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	11.10 x64
2012-04-22T00:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	go to http://www.adobe.com  then click downloads then "get flash player"
2012-04-22T00:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	once on that page,  where it says "Select version to Download"... choose ".tar.gz for linux"
2012-04-22T00:39:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	if you do what i told you, this will resolve in about 10 seconds
2012-04-22T00:40:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	Just download and extracted the archive.
2012-04-22T00:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	right click the "libflashplayer.so" file   and click copy
2012-04-22T00:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	then go to /home/username/.mozilla  (you might need to click "View/Show hidden files/directories" too see this directory)
2012-04-22T00:41:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	Then into "plugins" I asssume?
2012-04-22T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	affirmative
2012-04-22T00:42:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	now, close any instance of a browser running
2012-04-22T00:47:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	Nope, didn't help. Flash in FX still stalls the whole browser every few seconds.
2012-04-22T00:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Mrokii	dunno, when i had the problem you were having, thats what i done, and it works fine.. is it working in other browsers? (chrome for example?)
2012-04-22T00:49:00.000Z	Mrokii	KM0201	Nope, doesn't work in other browsers either. Thanks anyway.
