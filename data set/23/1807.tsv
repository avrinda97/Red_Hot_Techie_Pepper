2009-11-01T08:46:00.000Z	flan_suse		On Karmic, I realized that the wireless WPA passphrase is not hashed anymore. If I got to Passwords and Keyrings, I find that the passphrase is stored in plaintext. With Jaunty it was hashed. Is there a way to store them as hashes again?
2009-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	flan_suse		Does anyone have any idea why Karmic does not store the hash anymore, but rather uses plaintext for passwords and keyrings?
2009-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	I have do idea it did...
2009-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	on Jaunty, it stored my passphrases as hash values.
2009-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	but now on Karmic, it's storing them as plaintext, which anyone can see if they look over your shoulder!
2009-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	yeah, I haven't looked into that, a bit slack though if it no longer encrypts/hashes things like that
2009-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	I hope it gets fixed soon. I even tried deleting everything and starting from scratch, but it doesn't work.
2009-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	I did a fresh install, not an upgrade.
2009-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	this is a fresh install, but restored ~ from a backup, so things like keyrings are from previous install
2009-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	so when you go to "Passwords and Encryption Keys" and check any item's properties, then click view password, you only see a hash value (looks like an md5sum or something) and not the plaintext password?
2009-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	ahhh, yes.. those are stored 'encrypted' and only gt unlocked when you log in...
2009-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	they should not be plaintext in a file anywhere
2009-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	but I mean, when you try to "view" them, do they show you the actual password, or a hashed value?
2009-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	it cannot be a 'hashed value', it needs the actual password to connect
2009-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	for example, say you go to a friend's house, and he types in the wireless password for you. Is his password stored as a hash, and you cannot view it in plaintext ever?
2009-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	this was the case with Jaunty.
2009-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	hmmmm not sure.
2009-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	at my cousin's house, he entered his wireless passphrase. I showed him "When I check the box to view your password, it only shows me a hash value, see?"
2009-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	but now on Karmic, checking that same box will display the actual password in plaintext!
2009-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	there's no security in that.. the hash value is the key, you can copy that to another computer and it will be able to connect
2009-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	this is the behavior I am trying to get on Karmic.
2009-11-01T08:58:00.000Z	flan_suse	zcat[1]	but I can't tell anyone "his password is..." And it might even be a password used for other things too.
2009-11-01T08:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	flan_suse	well, I have no idea...
