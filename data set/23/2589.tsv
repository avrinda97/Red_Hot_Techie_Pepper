2009-01-16T07:15:00.000Z	grkblood13		hello, im currently having issues getting a external usb wifi adapter to work on my desktop using centos and am thinking about switching to ubuntu
2009-01-16T07:16:00.000Z	grkblood13		i want to set up a NFS server
2009-01-16T07:16:00.000Z	grkblood13		should i get the desktop or server edition
2009-01-16T07:16:00.000Z	grkblood13		any1 havea suggestion?
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	runderwo	grkblood13	what is the problem under centos?  do you know who made the adapter?
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	grkblood13		i know what it is, im just wondering if i would be better suited with the ubuntu server edition over the desktop edition
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	grkblood13		yea, belkin
2009-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	runderwo	grkblood13	it could need some strange firmware in order to operate
2009-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	grkblood13		well, i tried installing wicd
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		and that didnt work
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		ithey pointed to to a linux driver page
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		and i found the driver it uses
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		so it must be in the distro i have
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		it just wont work
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	grkblood13		and i dont care about guis, i like the terminal
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	runderwo	grkblood13	what's the model number?
2009-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	grkblood13		FD59050
2009-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	grkblood13		oops, F5D9050
2009-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	grkblood13		its a desktop, this is external
2009-01-16T07:21:00.000Z	runderwo	grkblood13	looks like rt73 driver is needed.
2009-01-16T07:21:00.000Z	grkblood13	Gnea	other than having a gui is there anything the desktop is better at?
