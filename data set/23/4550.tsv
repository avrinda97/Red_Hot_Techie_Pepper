2007-07-19T11:07:00.000Z	hypertyper	krinns	i'm a bit out of touch with modem tech, guy, sorry. you might find more info at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-system-tools/+bug/22119
2007-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	hypertyper	krinns	 although from what i saw, it was connecting ok, then getting disconnected. try having it call your cell?
2007-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	krinns		ok
2007-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	krinns		wait
2007-07-19T11:09:00.000Z	krinns		yes it seems ok but its hangup in a seconf
2007-07-19T11:09:00.000Z	krinns		second
2007-07-19T11:10:00.000Z	hypertyper	krinns	you might try watching the console output while dialing. it'll prolly hang up when it doesn't detect a carrier, but if it gets that far, your problem may lie elsewhere
2007-07-19T11:10:00.000Z	krinns		am taking device as ttyS0
2007-07-19T11:11:00.000Z	krinns		well that works well on windows
