2007-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	dbus. you can create your own udev rules or use a file manager that does that for you automatically (like thunar)
2007-03-06T08:00:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	how do i know which device is my flash disk to so i can mount it automatically ?!
2007-03-06T08:00:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	lsusb gives this Bus 004 Device 003: ID 10d6:1000 Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd MP3 Player
2007-03-25T16:47:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	in a terminal "sudo -i" then "fdisk -l" to see what the name of the primary hdd is called.
2007-03-25T16:48:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	hd0, 3
2007-03-25T16:48:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	ill try grub-install once
2007-03-25T16:48:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	no, I meant which name it has. if it is /dev/hda or something else. hd0,3 should be hda4
2007-03-25T16:49:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	yes it's /dev/hda4, so in grub hd0, 3.. but after i mount it, chroot to it, and do a df see that it's /dev/sda4 and not /dev/hda4 :| strange though.. anyway what should i do ?
2007-03-25T16:50:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	ok i did it.
2007-03-25T16:50:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	you need to mount dev and proc to the new chroot.
2007-03-25T16:50:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	thanks..
2007-03-25T16:59:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	it didn't work.
2007-03-25T05:00:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	it sux... have a look here
2007-03-25T05:00:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	I thought so... you left before I could finish... A) in a terminal: "sudo -i"  B) "mkdir /mnt/chrootdir"   C) "mount -t proc none /mnt/chrootdir/proc"   D) "mount -o bind /dev /mnt/chrootdir/dev"   E) "chroot /mnt/chrootdir /bin/bash". now the devices should not change.
2007-03-25T05:01:00.000Z	albacker	Jowi	i sent you the output in prv, since i didn't want to paste here.
2007-03-25T05:01:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	read B) again
2007-03-25T07:24:00.000Z	Jowi	albacker	192MB I believe
