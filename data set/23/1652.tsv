2010-02-11T22:16:00.000Z	furythor		I am setting up my home server, now I do wonder that if I have address mysite.operator.com assigned on ISP side for my connection and they are redirecting to port 80 any traffic coming to that address, could I get multiple virtual hosts to work like mysite.operator.com/site1 and mysite.operator.com/site2 etc ?
2010-02-11T22:17:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	do you mean setting multiple pages to the same port?
2010-02-11T22:18:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	I mean that is it possible to have multiple independent websites with virtual host setup when I got solid address from my ISP for my home server
2010-02-11T22:19:00.000Z	furythor		adress is in form adress.operator.com
2010-02-11T22:19:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	do you have you apache server running on your machine , right?!
2010-02-11T22:19:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	Yes
2010-02-11T22:20:00.000Z	furythor		but I don't figure why I got errors of overlapping virtual host setting
2010-02-11T22:21:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	it is possible, have a look at reverse proxy on apache
2010-02-11T22:21:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	I will do that
2010-02-11T22:22:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	this will basically, tell the computer to handle all incoming connections to port 80, but inside apache you will tell it to assign to different ports , depending on the address
2010-02-11T22:22:00.000Z	furythor		I just want to get my home server secure before I put it to use I have planned to... since there comes confidential data and other things I want it to be secure
2010-02-11T22:23:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	i just google some stuff for you...it seems a nice source http://www.apachetutor.org/admin/reverseproxies
2010-02-11T22:32:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	I did check that out and it was not quite what I was looking for
2010-02-11T22:34:00.000Z	furythor		I am trying to get this to work : address.operator.com and adress.operator.com/otherwebsite to work with virtual hosts with apache
2010-02-11T22:34:00.000Z	furythor		But I don't think that just to be possible
2010-02-11T22:34:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	if i understood you well, you have one valid ip address assigned by your ISP. And all incoming requests to you go to port 80, right?
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	I actually got a valid subdomain adress, now what I try to figure out is that could I setup multiple websites on single apache server to my adress
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	Ganang		then you wanted somehow, that different request (using different addresses) www.myserver.com/site1 , www.myserver.com/site2 , would reach the correct ones ?
2010-02-11T22:36:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	Yeah something like that, but now when I start to more think of it, I think it just is not possible doe to factors not depending on me...
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	well i am not getting the idea...if you want to set up the thing i described above, is just going for reverse proxies
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	furythor		Because I think that I would need to have dns record somewhere for those multiple addresses and those would redirect to different virtual hosts on my server, which I don't have atm
2010-02-11T22:39:00.000Z	Ganang	furythor	but you just said that you ISP, provided you a subdomain, right? if you have a valid subdomain, then you already have a valid dns server where it is registered
2010-02-11T22:45:00.000Z	furythor	Ganang	yeah I do and what I am trying to get done is that I could have multiple websites which appear in different sub directories like (address.operator.com , address.operator.com/site2 address.com/site3) all served as apache virtual hosts from my home server and each in own directory
