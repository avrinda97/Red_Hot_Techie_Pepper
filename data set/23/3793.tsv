2010-07-26T21:20:00.000Z	webPragmatist		do cron.d files have to be executable
2010-07-26T21:22:00.000Z	webPragmatist		does the cron.d have to be executable?
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	why are you asking?
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	webPragmatist		because i am curious
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	webPragmatist		i mean… just for funzies of course
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	well for funzies it can be whatever you want I guess
2010-07-26T21:24:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	that doesn't really help me… the crontab file only has a line of configuration… it doesn't seem logical for it to be executable
2010-07-26T21:24:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	ask your real question instead of being so ambiguous
2010-07-26T21:24:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	I'm not being frickin ambigious… i'm asking if the files you put in /etc/cron.d have to be executable or not
2010-07-26T21:25:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	ah, before you asked if the directory itself had to be executable
2010-07-26T21:25:00.000Z	webPragmatist		sorry
2010-07-26T21:26:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	anyway, no they don't have to be executable
2010-07-26T21:26:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	okay thanks
2010-07-26T21:26:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	why aren't you using a user's crontab?
2010-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	hrmm i dunno ? whats the advantage?
2010-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	webPragmatist		this is a script that needs to be run no matter if the user is logged in
2010-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	yeah use the user's crontab
2010-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	whats the disadvantage? i like how /etc/cron.d you can see everything
2010-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	you organize things by user
2010-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	jrib		!language | metalgeek
2010-07-26T21:30:00.000Z	jrib		!es | Dosto
2010-07-26T21:30:00.000Z	webPragmatist	jrib	it seems nothing else does this by default…
2010-07-26T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	webPragmatist	what do you mean?
