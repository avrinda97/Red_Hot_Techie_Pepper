2008-08-08T06:32:00.000Z	phenom		Ok, Any one have any ideas/opinions about streaming video to a personal pc over the net?
2008-08-08T06:33:00.000Z	phenom		Has any one done this?
2008-08-08T06:33:00.000Z	phenom		:)
2008-08-08T06:33:00.000Z	phenom		I've installed Ubuntu on slow systems and it never took more than 30-40 mins
2008-08-08T06:34:00.000Z	td123	phenom	mine took 60 mins :) if not longer
2008-08-08T06:34:00.000Z	td123	phenom	try p3 with 450mhz w/ 192mb of pc100
2008-08-08T06:34:00.000Z	phenom	td123	What kind of system do you have? :)
2008-08-08T06:35:00.000Z	phenom	td123	hehe
2008-08-08T06:35:00.000Z	td123	phenom	I just installed ubuntu for kicks though, I will be using arch linux in about 3 weeks paired up with a 24" lcd :P
2008-08-08T06:36:00.000Z	phenom	td123	I haven't tried Arch linux myself, I guess I'm stubborn on Debian and Ubuntu
2008-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	td123	phenom	lets just say arch's package manager leaves apt in its dust
2008-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	phenom	td123	Really? Big words. :)
2008-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	phenom	td123	I'll give it a go in a vm
2008-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	phenom	td123	But, dpkg works good enough for me.
2008-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	td123	phenom	the only reason I can use that system with a 24" lcd is because I use awesomewm, (tiled) :P
2008-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	td123	phenom	you will notice how much faster pacman is when you work with 450mhz machines nowadays :)
2008-08-08T06:39:00.000Z	phenom	td123	Ever use xmonad?
2008-08-08T06:40:00.000Z	td123	phenom	no, I was going to try it though, I just ended up picking awesome. (I'm fairly new to tiled wms)
2008-08-08T06:40:00.000Z	td123	phenom	but I will try xmonad and stumpwm later on
2008-08-08T06:45:00.000Z	td123	phenom	did you ever try awesome or stumpwm/ratpoisen? and what did you think of it
2008-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	phenom	td123	No honestly, I have only tried xmonad on a vm in Debina about a year ago. hehe
2008-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	td123	phenom	you could try it again, since I bet they added a ton of stuff since you last tried it
2008-08-08T06:59:00.000Z	td123	phenom	gl
