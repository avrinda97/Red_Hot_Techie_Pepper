2007-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	joe4444		ok, for some reason i'm now seeing /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 when i plug in my ipod, but i can't mount either one b/c mount tells me neither is a valid block device...
2007-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	joe4444		if it makes any difference my ipod is a 4G (clickwheel) and was originally installed on Windows
2007-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	open a terminal, run "dmesg | tail", and then plug in your ipod. you should see some messages pop up
2007-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	specifically, you should see what dev node the ipod is given
2007-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	yeah i got that...
2007-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	http://dpaste.com/6753/
2007-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	perhaps try /dev/sda2?
2007-03-13T06:30:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	i've tried them all... mount always says not a valid block device
2007-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	any other ideas?
2007-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	you tried sda0 as well right? ls -l /dev/sd?? <- paste the output of that perhaps?
2007-03-13T06:33:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	sda0 does not exist... only /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2
2007-03-13T06:36:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	you have gtkpod installed?
2007-03-13T06:36:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	what does iTunes say about the filesystem of your iPod?
2007-03-13T06:37:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	but you formatted it for windows, correct?
2007-03-13T06:38:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	let me paste a little more from dmesg
2007-03-13T06:41:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	here's what dmesg shows if i plug in the ipod then wait 30-60 seconds: http://dpaste.com/6755/
2007-03-13T06:43:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	i'm googling that SCSI error, looks like a rare one
2007-03-13T06:44:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	rejecting I/O to offline device?
2007-03-13T06:44:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	0x50000 <- the error code.
2007-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	preaction	joe4444	looks like a very weird kernel bug. i'd start by using fsck to check the file system if you can
2007-03-13T06:47:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	actually now that i look a little closer i think that's unrelated..... to "safely" unplug the ipod i rebooted it and disconnected while it was rebooting... i think that error is caused by the system trying to establish communication with the device # the ipod was connected as before i disconnected it
2007-03-13T06:48:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	let me monitor dmesg a little longer while the ipod is disconnected before i plug it in again and see if these errors are related...
2007-03-13T07:15:00.000Z	joe4444	preaction	still around?
