2011-06-19T15:25:00.000Z	tweasy		Problem: I have a RAR file in 4 parts (part1, 2, 3 and 4) and after extraction the file is nowhere to be seen.
2011-06-19T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	you should just extract the first one, if you make your pwd the same as the files you extract, it will extract to the same folder
2011-06-19T15:27:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	I extracted the first one and it came out like this: "part1, part1 (1), part1 (2), part1 (3)"
2011-06-19T15:28:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	I mean, I extracted them all and they came like that
2011-06-19T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	ls
2011-06-19T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	that's it
2011-06-19T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	one command for most compression files rather than remembering syntax (not hard but the tool makes life easier)
2011-06-19T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	unp Flowers.part1.rar
2011-06-19T15:49:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	cheers.
2011-06-19T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	you should read man pages, they tell you more than we ever can
2011-06-19T15:51:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	what do you mean with "man pages"?
2011-06-19T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	run:  man unp     and read
2011-06-19T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	ESC or Q to quit, cursors to scroll
2011-06-19T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	you can use: rar x file
2011-06-19T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	unp is just a wrapper command
2011-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	foo is the file
2011-06-19T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	you are aware there are many guides onlne, have you not researched any?
2011-06-19T16:00:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	Sorry I didn't, came here because it's faster
2011-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	sure but if you can help yourself then you'll learn your OS fastr as well as rely less on others to do menial tasks like this
2011-06-19T16:03:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	yes sorry, I was lazy.
2011-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	tweasy	ActionParsnip	dr_willis, oCean, Lasers: Thanks for helping me and sorry for having to deal with me, I'm not used to chatting and can be unpleasant sometimes. Also, how do you "unignore" someone?
2011-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	which client?
2011-06-19T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweasy	if nobody knows, try asking in #freenode
