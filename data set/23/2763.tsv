2009-10-15T04:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	sudo apt-get remove firefox-3.5
2010-02-06T08:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	do you have a user named adminsrator ?
2010-02-06T08:44:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	 no
2010-02-06T08:45:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	administrator needs to be an actual user before you can give permissions to it.
2010-02-06T08:46:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	I am trying to set up a mount on a slave drive and I followed this once before and there was no issue http://tombott.com/Automatically_Mount_Additional_HD_in_Ubuntu_8.10_and_Ubuntu_9.04   ....... but now when I get to the command I showed you it wont allow me to add users and admins to the folder
2010-02-06T08:48:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	I dont need to know any of that I need to know how to add users and administrators to a folder so when I right click I can set permissions on that folder
2010-02-06T08:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	chown is the correct way, but you need a valid user:group
2010-02-06T08:56:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	any time I right click any folder I can set admin and users privileges so why would I need to add user administrator and users?
2010-02-06T08:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	right clicking and using chown are not the exact same. using chown you need an actual user or group that exists
2010-02-06T08:58:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	the point of me saying that I can right click on other folders and see users and admins wasnt to say that was equal to chown but to say I should be able to add admins and users to a folder then set permissions
2010-02-06T09:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	understood. using chown requires using an actual user .. if user fred does not exist then you can not chown fred file ..
2010-02-06T09:01:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	I am not trying to add a user but the option administrator and users so I can set the permissions
2010-02-06T09:02:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	http://tombott.com/Automatically_Mount_Additional_HD_in_Ubuntu_8.10_and_Ubuntu_9.04   <<< I am using this guild which worked on ubuntu 9.04 without adding anything
2010-02-06T09:02:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	 I assume the command line is the same in 9.10
2010-02-06T09:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	that guide tells you on the first few lines .. User = Administrator ... if your computer does not have a user by the name of administrator then following this guide to the T will not work.. substitute administrator with your user.
2010-02-06T09:06:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	and chelz  thank you ......... I should have read line 1 lol
2010-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	best of luck :)
2010-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	all  part of the learning process. :)
2010-04-25T02:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	for 10.04/lucid discussion/support you should /join #ubuntu+1
2010-04-25T02:40:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	I assume this could be a question for ANY dist
2010-04-25T02:40:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	U-b-u-n-t-u	but you're on 10.04 which means that is where you should be asking.
2010-04-25T02:40:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	bastid_raZor	if the question applies to any dist then its not a 10.04 specific question
