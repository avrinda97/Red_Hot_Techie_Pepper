2009-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	Name141		Does ATI work as well as nVidia ? (although I guess this is an opinion? )
2009-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	Name141		in terms of there being drivers avalable
2009-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	nvidia is most peoples preference, definately avoid ati
2009-11-22T08:35:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	eh, hanging around here, I will tell you that if at all possible, avoid ATI
2009-11-22T08:35:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	OK.
2009-11-22T08:39:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	Why are the ATI drivers the work of the devil for linux ?
2009-11-22T08:40:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	because ATI is closed source by nature
2009-11-22T08:40:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	I thought the nVidia driver was too?
2009-11-22T08:41:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	yes, but they actively develop the linux driver
2009-11-22T08:41:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	at least better than ATI has tried
2009-11-22T08:42:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	maybe, you haven't considered upgrading to a 450w or something?
2009-11-22T08:42:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	Dell claims it will provide too much power to the motherboard if I was to upgrade and void my warranty.  Then they go on saying I can run a 9500GT rated at a 350watt min power supply that wouldn't void the warranty.
2009-11-22T08:43:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	Now , as a cusomer..How am I supposed to make sense of that ?
2009-11-22T08:43:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	that is a farce... lol,  more wattage doesn't mean more power persay,  in their sense of the word
2009-11-22T08:44:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	that's what i say.. Why is it going to say "ooh look maw, I have a whole nother 150 watts I can use!! yay!! lets blow it!"
2009-11-22T08:44:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	but we are also talking about dell here.
2009-11-22T08:45:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	They tried to sell me an XPS also cause the "heat doesn't disapate in my systems setup"
2009-11-22T08:45:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	on that note though, some dell's dont abide by ATX standards, so you should really investigate others attempts at upgrading
2009-11-22T08:46:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	this isn't the slim version of the 530 Inspiron
2009-11-22T08:46:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	The power supply is a Bestek ATXsomethingsomethingsoon
2009-11-22T08:46:00.000Z	musikgoat	Name141	cool, have at it!
2009-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	OK
2009-11-22T08:48:00.000Z	Name141	musikgoat	some people have complained about the bestek in HP and Dell system , and Bestek in general saying no matter if I buy a video card the PSU is a "ticking time bomb" and needs to be replaced ASAP. *shrug*
