2012-08-03T02:10:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	ah
2012-08-03T02:10:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	if you are looking into wireless stuff..i would go D-Link. Cause they support linux straight out
2012-08-03T02:11:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	all i know is that my wifi dongle does not work in kernel 2.6

2012-08-03T02:12:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	i have no problems with my wireless devices. it's always good to research what works before purchasing
2012-08-03T02:14:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	ive noticed on my laptops wireless card in linux, sometimes does not like certain wifi protection
2012-08-03T02:24:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	change the channel on your router
2012-08-03T02:25:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	all devices will pick up on whatever channel you set your router to
2012-08-03T02:25:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	say like you turn on the radio, and one channel is fuzzy..but the next channel sounds great. That is pretty much all it is doing
2012-08-03T02:26:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	that's the fun of linux. you actually feel like your learning when you use it. Also, when you get stuff working. you feel very much accomplished
2012-08-03T02:26:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	that's why windows feels boring to me
2012-08-03T02:27:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	i have had my phones 4g be faster than wifi before..haha
2012-08-03T02:28:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	how far are you from your router?
2012-08-03T02:30:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	you got walls between you and the router? cause my router is down the hall in one room, and i get two bars
2012-08-03T02:30:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	That is like not even 10 feet
2012-08-03T02:31:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	also ive noticed, about wireless...dont put it above or below a microwave...you turn that on, and it drops your connection
2012-08-03T02:31:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	hmm
2012-08-03T02:34:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	you could try sudo iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M
2012-08-03T02:36:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	i had peppermint os three on here before i put ubuntu on it. i noticed the download rates were faster.  odd thing
2012-08-03T02:37:00.000Z	chuck	brophat	all i can say is keep pushing through with it until you can get something better man
