2005-12-14T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Acemaster		Rubin do you know if that's what wifi radar uses?
2005-12-14T10:19:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	check out the command 'iwconfig'
2005-12-14T10:19:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	most of those same config options can be used in that file i think
2005-12-14T10:20:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	ndiswrapper?
2005-12-14T10:21:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	oh, then nevermind. heh
2005-12-14T10:21:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	you tried taking it down and up again?
2005-12-14T10:24:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	i dunno.. type lsmod and figure it out :/
2005-12-14T10:26:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	theres a module called wlan? that sounds promising
2005-12-14T10:27:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	try that
2005-12-14T10:27:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	rmmod wlan; modprobe wlan
2005-12-14T10:27:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	then ifup ath0
2005-12-14T10:30:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	ahh. try rmmod ath_pci
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	ifup ath0
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	or use the gui to try and connect again
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	yeah. exactly
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	yep hehe
2005-12-14T10:33:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	basically, at least for me, the wifi drivers have bugs because the mean wifi manuf wont tell anyone how to make good drivers. so they break and get into a bad state.. reloading the module sometimes fixes it..
2005-12-14T10:33:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	course, could be something else
2005-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	hmm. when you ran ifdown, you did it as sudo right?
2005-12-14T10:35:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	sudo ifdown ath0
2005-12-14T10:37:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	then ifdown it again, and follow erUSUL's advise
2005-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	Rubin	Dr_Acemaster	yep
