2009-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	shaft0		Has anyone in here worked with VirtualBox?  I've just installed it, and it works well until I use the mouse in the VM and then want to use it in the host desktop
2009-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	shaft0		After I use it in the VM, if I use it elsewhere, I can move it fine, but clicks do NOT register.
2009-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	linny1	shaft0	rgt ctrl id the toggle
2009-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	linny1		 shaft0: you should install guest additions
2009-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	shaft0	n8tuser	well I have to click to get out of it, yes, right ctrl, and I can move it around the host desktop just fine
2009-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	shaft0		but clicks do not register after that.
2009-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	shaft0		guest additions?
2009-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	linny1	shaft0	in the top menus on the vm there will be an option to install guest additions

2009-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	shaft0		I can switch between XP and Ubuntu no problem, using the key combos, but if I use the mouse, it will work fine in the guest os, but when i try to go back to either of them it doesn't work
2009-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	shaft0		linny: there is no CD mounted.
