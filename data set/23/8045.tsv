2005-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	edon		anyway, I can switch from sid to ubuntu?
2005-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	edon		without reinstalling
2005-02-11T15:52:00.000Z	edon		anyone tried it?
2005-02-11T15:53:00.000Z	mpool	edon	i did that
2005-02-11T15:53:00.000Z	edon	mpool	alright ;)
2005-02-11T15:54:00.000Z	edon	mpool	what are the sources list I should add?
2005-02-11T15:55:00.000Z	edon	mpool	so I should remove everything I installed from debian repositories?
2005-02-11T15:59:00.000Z	edon	mpool	it shows like 10 unmet dependencies
2005-02-11T16:00:00.000Z	mpool	edon	try getting ubuntu-base first then
2005-02-11T16:00:00.000Z	edon	mpool	two unmet dependencies :)
2005-02-11T16:01:00.000Z	mpool	edon	try removing the depended-by packages
2005-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	edon	mpool	could a dist-upgrade help, what do you say?
2005-02-11T16:13:00.000Z	edon	mpool	what do you think, does an dist-upgrade take care of those unmet dependencies?
2005-02-11T16:13:00.000Z	mpool	edon	no, because the versions are inconsistent between debian and ubuntu
2005-02-11T16:14:00.000Z	edon	mpool	yes I am trying. If it doesn't work how should I get rid of those unmet dependencies and go on?
2005-02-11T16:15:00.000Z	mpool	edon	remove the thing that depends on them
2005-02-11T16:16:00.000Z	edon	mpool	I see, so let's say ubuntu-base depends on 'x' what should I remove?
2005-02-11T16:18:00.000Z	edon	mpool	I see, thank you
2005-02-11T16:40:00.000Z	edon	mpool	still here?
2005-02-11T16:47:00.000Z	edon	mpool	ubuntu-base now has only one unmet dependency libc6-dev, which has debian's libc6 remove which will remove apt which will really make my machine useless :)
2005-02-11T16:52:00.000Z	edon	mpool	the problem is that it leads to a debian installed libc6 which should be substituted with ubuntu's, but removing debian's libc6 will remove apt
2005-02-11T16:52:00.000Z	mpool	edon	well, you need to persuade it to upgrade to the ubuntu one
2005-02-11T16:55:00.000Z	edon	mpool	how should I upgrade it? apt-get upgrade does not work, remove and install removes apt
