2007-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	babo_		can we do the ubuntu community a HUGE favour and ditch the debian-esque apache install ?
2007-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	erm, why?
2007-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	erm, cause it sucks tornados ...
2007-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	actually it's 10x better than any install
2007-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	what don't you like about it?
2007-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	actually it's not. It's 10 times worse ...
2007-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	why does it have files like conf.d which are denoted as 'empty file' in the README ... ?
2007-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	erm, conf.d is a directory and it's not empty
2007-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	and symlinks are much better for better administration
2007-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	if it isn't conf.d then it's another one ...
2007-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	httpd.conf ?
2007-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	conf.d is good to store application settings
2007-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	like, for instance, installing phpldapadmin
2007-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	i've removed it from my system and i'm compiling from source. I don't have the README to hand ...
2007-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	and, like it says, httpd.conf is there for legacy modules
2007-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	it's the best configuration that can suit everyone's needs
2007-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	it makes things overly complicated. There's no way that a distro should inflict it's own idea of what apache is about on people ...
2007-05-23T16:24:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	it's rather easy.
2007-05-23T16:25:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	think about it. When, for instance, you install php4/5, dpkg doesn't have to modify apache.conf (wich you probably customised the way you want to), but it's simple to just add a new file
2007-05-23T16:26:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	there is no way that every distro should have it's own setup for each of it's programs. Don't the debian crowd have better things to do ?
2007-05-23T16:26:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	you can always use fedora.
2007-05-23T16:26:00.000Z	Znuff	babo_	if you don't like the way debian handles configuration
2007-05-23T16:27:00.000Z	babo_	Znuff	right. but I use Ubuntu as my desktop. I only use the server occasionally. I use RH for a production server, for this reason and others ..
