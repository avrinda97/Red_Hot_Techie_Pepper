2005-12-26T13:20:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	so you want x?
2005-12-26T13:20:00.000Z	blanky	phrizer	x? anything really, preferably just a command line with gcc and emacs lol
2005-12-26T13:21:00.000Z	blanky		but anything, something like slax popcorn
2005-12-26T13:21:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	ah. what about pebble? :o

2005-12-26T13:23:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	http://www.nycwireless.net/pebble/ though its more geared towards networking. might be useful.
2005-12-26T13:24:00.000Z	blanky	phrizer	thanks
2005-12-26T13:24:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	it has apt-get :)
2005-12-26T13:24:00.000Z	blanky		so it's debian based? WOO!
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	yep
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	blanky		cool!
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	blanky		hey phrizer, if I install it on my usb drive, and install some apps, they'll stay installed right? Cause I mean, it could store it on itself
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	blanky		it's not a CDROM where you cant store it on itself
2005-12-26T13:26:00.000Z	blanky	phrizer	read above
2005-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	its a read only distro, but remoterw will mount the system in read/write mode, then install stuff.
2005-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	blanky	phrizer	okay thanks
2005-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	phrizer		remountrw*
2005-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	phrizer		rather.
2005-12-26T13:28:00.000Z	blanky		hey guys, if i have amd64, can i still get a normal i386 distro instead of AMD64, i just wont get the benefits right? but it'll work?
2005-12-26T13:29:00.000Z	phrizer	blanky	the installer is very basic, just copies the files across, edits some scripts/confs and runs lilo.
