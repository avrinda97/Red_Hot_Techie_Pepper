2010-02-02T09:23:00.000Z	krysis		do i go from 2D drivers to 3D?
2010-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	krysis		ok thats fine coz_ im just worried about the requirements
2010-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	krysis		1, kernel module agpgart and drm;
2010-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	krysis		The source of kernel modules is included in Linux kernel.
2010-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	krysis		2, libdrm;
2010-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	krysis		Libdrm is included in freedesktop drm source.
2010-02-02T09:25:00.000Z	krysis		3, Xorg 2D driver: xf86-video-intel;
2010-02-02T09:25:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	ubuntu should come with the same driver as sabayon (though perhaps a different version)
2010-02-02T09:25:00.000Z	krysis	crdlb	the driver for sabayan seems more stable as the graphics actually show i left a description here :http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8753949#post8753949
2010-02-02T09:25:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	which is the driver on the intel linux graphics site
2010-02-02T09:26:00.000Z	krysis		im guessing it should be the only one on that site crdlb, as its based on the mobile intel chipset... though im not sure
2010-02-02T09:26:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	right, but there is no alternate driver to try
2010-02-02T09:26:00.000Z	krysis		so how could i get my driver to work right under ubuntu? if they are in fact using the same driver
2010-02-02T09:28:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	what does   glxinfo | grep renderer   say?
2010-02-02T09:28:00.000Z	krysis		OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) 965GM GEM 20090712 2009Q2 RC3 x86/MMX/SSE2
2010-02-02T09:29:00.000Z	krysis		I really want to find out what driver Sabayan uses (as it claims to be the gaming OS of linux) and compile that to my ubuntu... i dont like sabayan that much :/
2010-02-02T09:29:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	that looks ok; please try the #intel-gfx channel
2010-02-02T09:30:00.000Z	krysis		i'll try that thank you coz_
2010-02-02T09:35:00.000Z	krysis		oh oops sorry coz_ lol about my requirements though, im trying to use the git, but im not quite sure how to..
2010-02-02T09:35:00.000Z	krysis		and no one is responding in intel-gfx
2010-02-02T09:36:00.000Z	krysis		http://intellinuxgraphics.org/download.html
2010-02-02T09:36:00.000Z	krysis		http://intellinuxgraphics.org/install.html
2010-02-02T09:37:00.000Z	crdlb	krysis	you can't expect every channel to be as busy as #ubuntu
