2006-05-22T12:33:00.000Z	jadaz87	NoUse	yes it is the people in the dapper channel are not being to welcoming with their answers (ie no answers)
2006-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	NoUse	jadaz87	it'll probably get fixed in a couple days
2006-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	jadaz87	NoUse	but dapper refuse to update into it gets fixed
2006-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	jadaz87	NoUse	haha that is going to leave me with like 200mb in updates lol
2006-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	NoUse	jadaz87	and you expected something different from running a beta OS?
2006-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	jadaz87	NoUse	yes a beta not alpha near RC1 in two weeks
2006-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	NoUse	jadaz87	but 200mB of upates means you haven't been updating for a while
