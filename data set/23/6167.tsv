2009-08-04T01:52:00.000Z	roc		hey guys... i have a slight problem... im running the ubuntu netbook remix on an acer aspire one and it runs so goddamn slow... does somebody has an idea what i can do to make the system run faster? windows xp was working completely fine on this one...
2009-08-04T01:53:00.000Z	roc		nobody an idea?
2009-08-04T01:53:00.000Z	stefg	roc	the problem is the slow ssd...
2009-08-04T01:54:00.000Z	stefg	roc	and afaik it only has 512 MB
2009-08-04T01:54:00.000Z	roc	stefg	but can i fix that somehow??? i had ubuntu linpus on this system... that was running fine...
2009-08-04T01:55:00.000Z	roc	stefg	but how can it be that ubuntu needs more ressources than winxp? and all netbooks have ssd right? so since this is a netbook remix...
2009-08-04T01:56:00.000Z	stefg	roc	you need some fine tuning... winxp is an 8 year old OS, and linpus was custom tailored.
2009-08-04T01:56:00.000Z	roc	stefg	can you define finetuning?
2009-08-04T01:56:00.000Z	roc	stefg	im really not that into linux... but i really like ubuntu
2009-08-04T01:57:00.000Z	stefg	roc	i have an aspire one, too... i added 1 strip of RAM, and added an 60GB 1,8" hd... cost me 50 Euros, but it'S a whole new machine. i
2009-08-04T01:58:00.000Z	roc	stefg	but for this i neet to open the whole computer right???
2009-08-04T02:00:00.000Z	stefg	roc	there's vids on youtube and blogs on how to do it... but even if you don't want to upgrade the hardware you can custom install ubuntu to better fit the slow ssd and small ram
2009-08-04T02:00:00.000Z	roc	stefg	how can i custom ubuntu then for that?
2009-08-04T02:03:00.000Z	roc	stefg	still there?
2009-08-04T02:04:00.000Z	stefg	roc	googling for a tutorial... you need to start with a minimal install, put /tmp in tmpfs and avoid heavy apps. ext4 actually runs good on slow ssd'S
2009-08-04T02:04:00.000Z	roc	stefg	ext4 means what?
2009-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	stefg	roc	try http://www.geteasypeasy.com/
2009-08-04T02:09:00.000Z	roc	stefg	my computer already looks like that... it seems to be the same like the official ubuntu netbook remix
2009-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	roc	stefg	is there any difference to the original ubuntu netbook remix?
2009-08-04T02:11:00.000Z	stefg	roc	it's customized for atom based hardware... different kernel, some different apps, some differently tweaked defaults
2009-08-04T02:11:00.000Z	roc	stefg	ok ... i will give it a shot...
2009-08-04T02:14:00.000Z	stefg	roc	some useful link http://megabytemorsels.blogspot.com/2009/05/using-tmpfs-for-tmp-with-ssd-in-ubuntu.html
2009-08-04T02:53:00.000Z	roc	stefg	hey... just wanted to thank you for the site you sended me... with changing the write speed on the ssd helped really a lot!
