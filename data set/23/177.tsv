2012-09-17T03:26:00.000Z	brightsparks		I'm trying to install an nvidia card. It says that the headers and sources need to be installed. I'v installed the headers but how do I install the linux sources?
2012-09-17T03:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 you are trying to use the .run driver package from nvidia.com ?
2012-09-17T03:27:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	yes
2012-09-17T03:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 the ones from the repos dident work?
2012-09-17T03:29:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	not sure what you mean. I usually install the nvidia driver for this card.
2012-09-17T03:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 the addational-drivers tool *aka  jockey-gtk* is how one normally installs the nvidia drivers.
2012-09-17T03:30:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	so do you know how update and install the linux sources. Sorry I don't know anything about jockey-gtk (I think).
2012-09-17T03:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 You SHOULD be using the addational-drivers tool (gksudo jockey-gtk) first.. befor you try to use the .run package.
2012-09-17T03:34:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	I usually can manage to install the nvidia card by shutting down gdm and switching to a terminal. Running the package it automatically removes the nouveau or whatever and successfully installs.
2012-09-17T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 y You have been doing it wrongly.. even if it works..  try the ones in the repository FIRST.
2012-09-17T03:36:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	I must be using those at the moment. I have limited screen resolutions available. That's mainly why I want to install the nvidia card driver
2012-09-17T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 run the nvidia-setting tool and see what driver you are using..
2012-09-17T03:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 the ones in the repos are the same as what you would get with the .run drivers. tehy may be a little older version. but  the main thing is 'they are supported here'
2012-09-17T03:37:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	lspci?
2012-09-17T03:40:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	all running nvidia-settings tells me is that I don't appear to have the nvidia driver installed and that I need to edit my xconfigeration file
2012-09-17T03:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 run gksudo jockey-gtk and use the repos to install the driver is what everyone has been telling you to do.
2012-09-17T03:49:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	when I run the nvidia installation program it tells me that the driver I want to install is already install and do I want to replace it with the one I am attempting to install( the same driver). Normally reinstalling it gives me full nvidia resolution options etc.
2012-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 sounds like you are using the .run drivers allready.. and basically they are not supported here.. you have been ignoreing everyones advice.
2012-09-17T03:52:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	only ignoring in so far as I am not familiar with the advice you are giving me (not familiar with gksudo jockey-gtk). Anyway I'm pasting it into terminal now. But I don't want to mess up the system by trying the unfamilair if my usual run method works.
2012-09-17T03:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 and how long have you been using the .run method?   jockey-gtk has been the preffered method for extra drivers since.. well.. several releases backk.
2012-09-17T03:57:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	well I just upgraded to ubuntu 12.04 today from ubuntu 11.10-where the run method worked just fine for me. Anyway I have done what you suggested and installed the driver or activated it using gksudo jockey-gtk. If I'm not happy with it I'll still try my "run" method. But thanks for your help anyway. But I still don't know how to install the linux sources which was my original question.
2012-09-17T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brightsparks	 you dont need to.. and the .run method can cause problems in the long run.. do not use it as your first attempt..
2012-09-17T04:08:00.000Z	brightsparks	Dr_willis	well that seemed to work very. And thank you I will be using that method to install the nvidia driver in future. THanks v much.
