2009-01-16T09:55:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	http://psychocats.net/ubuntu
2009-01-16T09:58:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	there is also http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Intrepid which is more up to date but doesn't seem as full
2009-01-16T10:01:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	passwd <yourUsername> sets your password.  The other thing sets the root password (don't do that for security's sake)
2009-01-16T10:19:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	what do you mean?
2009-01-16T12:44:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	it's in the repositories.  type 'sudo apt-get install vlc'
2009-01-16T12:45:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	use Synaptic or Applications -> Add/Remove for the graphical way.. Otherwise, type 'apt-cache search somethingYouWant'
2009-01-16T12:51:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	you can change the size of folder icons in nautilus (the file manager) in the View menu.  http://gnome-look.org has icons etc
2009-01-16T12:58:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	it sounds like you need to install gtk2-engines-ubuntulooks
2009-01-16T13:01:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	yes but apt-get has no space.
2009-01-16T13:01:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	you're welcome
2009-01-16T13:16:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	Usually you just download a theme from gnome-look.org, then drag the archive to the Themes tab in System -> Preferences -> Appearance
2009-01-16T13:21:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	try to install it then, whatever it is.  Go to System > Administration > Synaptic and search for it.
2009-01-16T13:33:00.000Z	jken146	tenang	did you follow the instructions on that page?
