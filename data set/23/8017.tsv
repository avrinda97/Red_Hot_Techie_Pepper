2005-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	gangalino	bascule	my USB port or the dvd+rw is VIA?
2005-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	teh chipset on the motherboard
2005-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	gangalino	bascule	no, it's NEC/Ratoc subsystem
2005-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	well I never heard of that chipset on a motherboard ...
2005-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	on a cd drive, yes, but not a motherboard, It's OK you don't seem to know what I mean, or I am missing knowledge

2005-02-27T08:03:00.000Z	gangalino	bascule	sorry, now I get it. It's http://rafb.net/paste/results/pI4aWm26.html, I was too busy lurking around other parts of your site, trying to find where you got this paste page from. Also an aside about Fry's returns- I go off in there, they tried to make me stand in line to return their crap, I told them I don't work there, I don't get paid for dragging their defective crap around their mega-warehouses, I make them return it and just
2005-02-27T08:04:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	that isn't my site ...
2005-02-27T08:04:00.000Z	gangalino	bascule	now I see...
2005-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	I never resall seeing an NEC USB controller, wel I learn every day, is it a Dell?
2005-02-27T08:10:00.000Z	gangalino	bascule	it's like this- Dell Latitude CSx laptop with a broken USB port, so I put in a RATOC Cardbus USB adapter, that connects to the Microsolutions Backpack USB dvd+rw. The NEC part is probably the dvd's internal host controller
2005-02-27T08:11:00.000Z	bascule	gangalino	yes, I have seen USB devices not recogninised by some hubs before, usually VIA
