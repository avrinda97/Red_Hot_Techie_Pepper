2007-11-23T18:23:00.000Z	simmerz		does ubuntu have an easy way to add remote locations to the fstab? or is it manual editing?
2007-11-23T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	manual
2007-11-28T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	doesn't add anything to fstab
2007-11-28T20:56:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	ok. is there some helper app?
2007-11-28T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	no,
2007-11-28T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	you need to setup samba, and a samba auth system
2007-11-28T21:04:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	so just using the "shared folders" part of the admin won't do the job?
2007-11-28T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	it should do, does it give you an option on "how" to share
2007-11-28T21:05:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	no. it just gives me the option to add dirs. when i was using kde/gentoo, i had all the options available. yes I can edit the smb.conf file, but I'd like to see how ubuntu "should" do it
2008-04-24T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	hdparm
2008-04-24T01:37:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	heh
2008-04-24T01:39:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	hdparm doesn't seem to give me a way to see what the spindown time is
2008-04-24T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	hdparm -B
2008-04-24T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	I don't know if it will get it, I think your just supposed to set it to what you want
2008-04-24T01:41:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	the point is i want to see what it is currently.
2008-04-24T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	I (maybe wrongly) assumed disks came with it disabled and disks set it
2008-04-24T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	ok, so you've got CFLAGS="-Wall" and CXXFLAGS-"-Wall" too ?
2008-04-24T01:41:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	??
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	try setting it to 255 (disable) and see if it spins the disk down
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	sorry, wrong person
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	ok
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	simmerz	pschorf sorry, my typing is sloppy today for some reason
2008-04-24T01:43:00.000Z	simmerz	ikonia	no worries
