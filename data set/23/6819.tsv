2006-06-12T14:34:00.000Z	Hattori	chavo	what they start?
2006-06-12T14:35:00.000Z	chavo	Hattori	startx starts an xserver and it will launc whatever is in the xinitrc, gdm is a login manger and allows you to choose sessions
2006-06-12T14:36:00.000Z	Hattori	chavo	where that xinitrc is?
2006-06-12T14:36:00.000Z	chavo	Hattori	also with gdm you can do fast user switching, allow remote logins, etc
2006-06-12T14:36:00.000Z	chavo	Hattori	make a .xinitrc in your home to override the system
