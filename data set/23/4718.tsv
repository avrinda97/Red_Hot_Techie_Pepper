2007-05-23T16:53:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	couldn't you just burn that onto one (two) DVDs? chances are that you'll need an entirely new filesystem for that 250gb disk anyway, iirc
2007-05-23T16:53:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	uh... i can't burn dvds :(
2007-05-23T16:53:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	and how would that help?
2007-05-23T16:54:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	and you can't ssh and scp onto another spare computer?
2007-05-23T16:54:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	this is the only linux computer (and my other computers have no space :P)
2007-05-23T16:54:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	how would that help though....
2007-05-23T16:54:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	at any rate, i think what you're looking for is dd instead of cp
2007-05-23T16:55:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	yes i thought so, but what about resize2fs .... do you know about that?
2007-05-23T16:55:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	to get a larger partition
2007-05-23T16:55:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	nope lost me there, but you could simply mount the rest as a second partition, no?
2007-05-23T16:56:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	but I'd like to install some new software, and I can't with only 70MB left on that partition
2007-05-23T05:01:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	not sure, give it a try, though ... you can't really damage anything, i guess. was that vague enough? ;)
2007-05-23T05:03:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	how would i mount the sata drive correctly? (now it's just attached, just out of the box, no linformatting yet
2007-05-23T05:03:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	format/mount
2007-05-23T05:07:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	sorry i really couldn't say ... your hardware is off limits for me, financially :p
2007-05-23T05:08:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	actually, it was only 69 dollars...
2007-05-23T05:09:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	do you know how to format a standard drive? That's all I need to know, I can replace hda with sda
2007-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	with cfdisk or fdisk i guess ... i'm sure there's some flashy gui tool for ubuntu, though. haven't you got the ubuntu live dvd/cd? it should be on there
2007-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	i don't think i have a livecd... i had the beta and I upgraded from edgy...................
2007-05-23T05:13:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	i suggest also getting knoppix once you come by a dsl connection. strangely enough, sometimes it picks up hardware that ubuntu doesn't
2007-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	i have a dsl, just 30kbps
2007-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	gavintlgold	azamat	and I don't have a hardware problem....
2007-05-23T05:17:00.000Z	azamat	gavintlgold	well if there's nobody else here who knows about resize2fs drop by in #gentoo or #linux, people there should know
