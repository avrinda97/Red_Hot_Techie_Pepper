2006-08-28T16:08:00.000Z	lupine_85		 Andy: you can get the bcm43xx firmware here: http://www.lupine.me.uk/bcm43xx/bcm43xx-firmware.tar.gz
2006-08-28T16:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		just unzip the files into /lib/firmware
2006-08-28T16:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		yes
2006-08-28T16:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's a tarbomb (dumps everything into the current directory) so your best bet is to open a console...
2006-08-28T16:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		type 'cd /lib/firmware'
2006-08-28T16:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		then 'sudo wget http://www.lupine.me.uk/bcm43xx/bcm43xx-firmware.tar.gz' (which copies the file to your HD from the Internet)
2006-08-28T16:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		then 'sudo tar -xzvf bcm43xx-firmware.tar.gz'
2006-08-28T16:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		in /lib/firmware?
2006-08-28T16:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		...ok. no need though :)
2006-08-28T16:14:00.000Z	lupine_85		furestrtr: ...so where else would you put firmware
2006-08-28T16:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	download and extracting should be done in your home directory. Then, you should only move those files needed to /lib
2006-08-28T16:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	its not best practice, and we try to encourage best practices here.
2006-08-28T16:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	no, 'best practice' is not an opinion ;)
2006-08-28T16:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	that's a dumb deciding factor. Easy is never best practice. Just ask Microsoft.
2006-08-28T16:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	NO
2006-08-28T16:46:00.000Z	lupine_85	fyrestrtr	why not?
2006-08-28T16:46:00.000Z	lupine_85	fyrestrtr	:why?
2006-08-28T16:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	because it breaks ubuntu, that's why. Just because ubuntu is *based* on debian, doesn't mean you can install debian packages on it. Your system will break.
2006-08-28T16:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	trust me when I tell you, it will.
2006-08-28T16:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	*sigh* I'm not going to argue with you on this. Just trust me when I tell you, don't do it, and don't recommend it, okay?
2006-08-28T16:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	like I said, I'm not going to argue, just to tell you, do not recommend it.
2006-09-26T15:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	then don't tell him.
2006-09-26T15:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	lupine_85	so it stupidity.
