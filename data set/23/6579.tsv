2006-03-14T10:13:00.000Z	kristopher		Not to sound frantic, but I accidently did apt-get dbus and it tried to "upgrade" like 40 packages
2006-03-14T10:13:00.000Z	kristopher		now if I do apt-get upgrade it's trying to downgrade packages?
2006-03-14T10:13:00.000Z	kristopher		how can I undo this package issue :(!
2006-03-14T10:15:00.000Z	kristopher		oh, sorry, ok
2006-03-14T10:16:00.000Z	kristopher		Okay, I'm pasting
2006-03-14T10:17:00.000Z	kristopher		here is the output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9885
2006-03-14T10:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	what are you trying to do?
2006-03-14T10:18:00.000Z	kristopher	chuckyp	nothing, I want to keep all these packages AS THEY ARE
2006-03-14T10:19:00.000Z	kristopher	chuckyp	I did $sudo apt-get install dbus and it freaked out
2006-03-14T10:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	did you change your sources.list or something?
2006-03-14T10:20:00.000Z	kristopher	chuckyp	no, I just did apt-get install dbus
2006-03-14T10:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	what version of ubuntu are you running.
2006-03-14T10:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	^^^^
2006-03-14T10:25:00.000Z	kristopher	chuckyp	I'm not sure which I did first
2006-03-14T10:27:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	you are running dapper
2006-03-14T10:28:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	well did you install breezy or dapper?
2006-03-14T10:28:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	maybe not yet.
2006-03-14T10:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	not when you did yum update.  yum update just hits the repos and gets all the updated packages versions and info etc...
2006-03-14T10:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	err apt-get update
2006-03-15T13:30:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	which directory are you looking for where to put pages?
2006-03-15T13:30:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	typically uses /var/www but I would check your config to make sure.
2006-03-15T13:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	and the config would be in /etc/apache2 something or other.
2006-03-15T13:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	kristopher	I'm here every once in a while.
