2005-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	just wondering if  it's down
2005-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	Anyway, have a look at /etc/apt/sources.list and check the ones that fail
2005-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	that's all the repositories i have in my /etc/apt/sources.list file enabled
2005-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	 Paste your sources.list in paste---
2005-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	Or just use the normal ones. I'm having no problem

2005-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	what's yours? could you past one for me, please?
2005-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	Use the ones for a nearby country
2005-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	i tried to use fi.*, but they also didn't work :(
2005-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	The server is working perfectly
2005-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	I can browse yours perfectly...

2005-11-07T11:27:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	it is working, yes
2005-11-07T11:27:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	mamoru	As a matter of fact, if you use my last listed repository, you can get enlightenment DR17 -removing DR16), if you have any interest
2005-11-07T11:29:00.000Z	mamoru	EloraHRanma	thx, I'm satisfied with gnome :)
