2008-07-29T00:43:00.000Z	blockhd		i tried mic, line in
2008-07-29T00:43:00.000Z	blockhd		also PCM ...... so i could record what i play and so on
2008-07-29T00:44:00.000Z	blockhd		Gnea; any ideas?
2008-07-29T00:44:00.000Z	blockhd		and PCM capture
2008-07-29T00:44:00.000Z	blockhd		probably.
2008-07-29T00:45:00.000Z	blockhd		Gnea.... just one thought, please :P
2008-07-29T00:45:00.000Z	blockhd		i dont understand, why linux, Ubuntu to be exact, gives me 100s of diferent mixers to choose from
2008-07-29T00:46:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	i heard it's called choice
2008-07-29T00:46:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	get used to it
2008-07-29T01:06:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	many soundcards allow piping output into input, look at your mixer, record settings, if there's some "capture" toggle or slider, or something like that.
2008-07-29T01:06:00.000Z	blockhd	TiredWolf	yes, you udnerstand me!! :) but i cant found anything on that
2008-07-29T01:07:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	pastebin the output of "amixer" and i can try to guess what the right setting is, if any
2008-07-29T01:09:00.000Z	blockhd	TiredWolf	http://pastebin.com/d6b4fdddd
2008-07-29T01:10:00.000Z	blockhd	TiredWolf	http://pastebin.com/d6b4fdddd
2008-07-29T01:11:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	i don't think i see the right setting, unless it's "Analog Mix", but i doubt it
2008-07-29T01:14:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	another possibility is a program that steals the dsp output and writes it to a file, except the name of it escapes me right now. (alsa can possibly also do that, but i have no idea about the configuration to achieve it)
2008-07-29T01:16:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	i suppose that skype doesn't just have a function to send an audio file?
2008-07-29T01:17:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	well, do you absolutely have to do it real time, can't you pre-record the whole thing for him?
2008-07-29T01:18:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	i can't say it's impossible, but at least it's not trivial. as much as i hate hardware solutions, an actual loop cable is a cheap solution
2008-07-29T01:19:00.000Z	TiredWolf	blockhd	how?
