2006-03-21T10:26:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		i need help please! i have an external hard disk that ubuntu identifies, but i can't create any folders on it. help!
2006-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 what file system is on it?
2006-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 'fdisk -l /dev/sd#' where sd# is the proper dev name of the device
2006-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 has it beenused under windows befor?
2006-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 then i would guess its either NTFS or VFAT for the filesystem
2006-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 check out that !ntfs message/url - thers some other wiki/forum pages that discuss what going on in detail. You see the files? but cant make changes? or whats the exact problem?
2006-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 Writing to a NTFS partition - is not 'safe'
2006-03-21T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 writing to NTFS partitions is a 'work in progress' i hear that dapper can do it.. but no idea if it can, or how safe it is.
2006-03-21T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 yep.. sounds like  best to do READ ONLY then.
2006-03-21T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 backing up TO a usb ntfs - not good idea.
2006-03-21T10:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 how about this - install that tool that lets WindowsXP read/write Ext2/3 and use XP to backup your data.
2006-03-21T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 http://www.fs-driver.org/index.html
2006-03-21T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 what is it running then?
2006-03-21T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 Ick!
2006-03-21T10:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 if that usb drive is NTFS then windowsme - cant read it either.
2006-03-21T10:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 if that usb drive is VFAT then linux Can read/wriote to it.
2006-03-21T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 use mount, and 'fdisk -l' and see what file system the thing is.
2006-03-21T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 phrases like "not working" are sort of useless. :P
2006-03-21T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 also you dident need to 'reboot' to change to the root user. (which i think you did)
2006-09-02T09:52:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Dr_Willis	oh well, okay. Are the uTorrent people planning to create uTorrent for linux?
2006-09-02T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 i doubt it.
2006-09-02T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DJAdmiral	 why should they. :P  go to the utorrent site and ask them. They may come out with one tomorrow for all i know.. but i wouldent hold my breath. :)
2006-09-02T09:54:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Dr_Willis	true lol
