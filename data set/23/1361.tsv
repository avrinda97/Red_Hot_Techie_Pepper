2010-10-26T21:22:00.000Z	Guybrush88		little problem on maverick: when i'm playing on some games with snes9express on maverick, i get these games closed without any warning and after a little time after i start playing.
2010-10-26T21:23:00.000Z	Guybrush88		<chicca>ciao
2010-10-26T21:23:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Have you tried running the games from terminal and watching the output there? Usually if there's a crash without warning, the program spits out at least an error message.
2010-10-26T21:23:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	No error messages?
2010-10-26T21:24:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	pastebin please.
2010-10-26T21:29:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Does this happen with every game, or just some?
2010-10-26T21:29:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Also, props on the game choice there.
2010-10-26T21:29:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	well, it happened with every game i tried
2010-10-26T21:30:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Strange. I'm not horribly familiar with snes9x these days, unfortunately. Could you give zsnes a shot and see if something similar happens?
2010-10-26T21:31:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Believe it's available in the Ubuntu repos as long as you're not running amd64. Been a while though.
2010-10-26T21:31:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	ok, i can give znes a try, even though i always preferred snes9express xD
2010-10-26T21:32:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	since before maverick i never had any problem on snes9express xD
2010-10-26T21:32:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Heh, I'm the opposite. Always preferred zsnes, never had a single problem with it, and always had issues with snes9x =P
2010-10-26T21:36:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	with zsnes will i be able to use savefiles from snes9express?
2010-10-26T21:37:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	The saveram (SRM) files are compatible, not too sure about savestates.
2010-10-26T21:38:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	uhm, i'll give it a try
2010-10-26T21:50:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	zsnes seems to be working. thanks for the suggestion
2010-10-26T21:50:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	Happy to help.
2010-10-26T21:53:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	last question about zsnes: is there a shortcut to save states?
2010-10-26T21:54:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	f2 to save, f3 to pick, f4 to load
2010-10-26T21:54:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	ok, thanks
2010-10-26T21:54:00.000Z	taroven	Guybrush88	You can change all that through the options if you're used to something else.
2010-10-26T21:55:00.000Z	Guybrush88	taroven	i only changed the game buttons since i'm used to the buttons of snes9express, but shortcuts to save and load are ok
