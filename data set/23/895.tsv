2010-12-26T04:03:00.000Z	james1		you're using maverick, right?

2010-12-26T04:05:00.000Z	james1		did you check your alsa configs?
2010-12-26T04:06:00.000Z	james1		sometimes, programs will take over certain hardware, and keep other programs from accessing it
2010-12-26T04:06:00.000Z	james1		not sure exactly, alsa is a bitch at times.
2010-12-26T04:07:00.000Z	james1		you can, however, right click in your flash video, and check to make sure that it hasn't kept the sound card to istelf
2010-12-26T04:07:00.000Z	james1		some "settigns" option or something... i'm nto a fan of flash
