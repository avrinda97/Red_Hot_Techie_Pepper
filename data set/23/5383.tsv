2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	Apropos the first problem, are you using flash 7 or 9?
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	carutsu	arrenlex	flash 7
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	Upgrade to 9.
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	carutsu	arrenlex	isnt too risky in a beta?
2006-12-19T10:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	..."risky"? A multimedia plugin?
2006-12-19T10:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	You have significant demands of dependability from Flash?
2006-12-19T10:03:00.000Z	carutsu	arrenlex	no significant
2006-12-19T10:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	Install flash 9. It's far better than 7.
2006-12-19T10:04:00.000Z	carutsu	arrenlex	is it on adept pakages?
2006-12-19T10:04:00.000Z	carutsu	arrenlex	sorry i just tried to type fast
2006-12-19T10:13:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	If by "viva Linux" you mean "this just shows us ever more clearly that we are at the mercy of corporate players who decide whether or not they have anything to do with us out of nothing more than the goodness of their hearts", yes. Viva linux.
2006-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	We are not catching them, we are being given handouts when people feel sorry for us. But this conversation belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic.
2006-12-19T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	Yes
2006-12-19T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	carutsu	You can try
