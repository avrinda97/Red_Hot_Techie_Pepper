2010-10-09T07:02:00.000Z	Caleb1134		hello
2010-10-09T07:02:00.000Z	Caleb1134		Same here, but im sure mine will be more complicated
2010-10-09T07:04:00.000Z	Caleb1134		Ubuntu 10.04 64bit Server wont boot anymore. I updated it last week, and decided to restart just for good measure and now I get a fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2 message during the book and it looks like its checking my boot drive (SDA1) for errors, however it never gets anywhere
2010-10-09T07:05:00.000Z	Caleb1134		I booted from a livecd and updated it after chrooting in, and even ran touch /forcefsck to no avail
2010-10-09T07:06:00.000Z	Caleb1134		I ran fsck but it think it gave some error or something
2010-10-09T07:06:00.000Z	Caleb1134		whats the command for it?
2010-10-09T07:06:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	run man fsck it will tell you
2010-10-09T07:12:00.000Z	Caleb1134	Quantum_Ion	the livecd is still starting.... Ill let you know how it goes though
2010-10-09T07:13:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	Did you find out what fsck was for ?
2010-10-09T07:14:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	fsck - check and repair a Linux file system
2010-10-09T07:17:00.000Z	Caleb1134	Quantum_Ion	I got it to run in the livecd and it said its clean
2010-10-09T07:17:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	a clean filesystem okay
2010-10-09T07:18:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	hang what ???
2010-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	hard to tell why t would hang
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	what kind of pc do you have ?
2010-10-09T07:28:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Caleb1134	lol
