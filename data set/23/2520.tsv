2009-06-16T16:10:00.000Z	innociv		what about if i used subversion?
2009-06-16T16:11:00.000Z	innociv		well isn't it used for updating files on a server?
2009-06-16T16:12:00.000Z	innociv		eh i dont know :(
2009-06-16T16:14:00.000Z	innociv		the man page for chmod tells how to jail users? o_O
2009-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	innociv		but if they can't read index.html then nor can people viewing a website, harahauk
2009-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	innociv		IE i have home/website/public/jaileddir
2009-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	innociv		also in public is files everyone needs to be able to read
2009-06-16T16:17:00.000Z	innociv		or php files is a better example
2009-06-16T16:17:00.000Z	innociv		people need to be able to view the php files, harahauk, but not the person logged onto sftp able to see its source
2009-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	innociv		ya
2009-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	Have you looked into the scponly shell?
2009-06-16T16:19:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	Not sure if it works with sftp as well but it wouldn't surprise me if it did.  I know it works with scp (both use SSH protocols).
2009-06-16T16:21:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	The scponly shell is as easy as, "sudo apt-get install scponly" and then setting the user's shell to, "/usr/bin/scponly" in /etc/passwd.
2009-06-16T16:23:00.000Z	innociv	rob_p	does scponly do this?..
2009-06-16T16:23:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	Basically it limits them to utilizing scp for access to the server.  I guess you probably want some sort of chroot environment in which to jail the users.
2009-06-16T16:23:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	It's a good start but maybe not exactly what you are looking for.
2009-06-16T16:25:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	I've never messed with jailkit.  But I have manually set up chroot environments for things.
2009-06-16T16:27:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	I can't vouch for the accuracy, but here's a tutorial for Ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=248724
2009-06-16T16:27:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	perhaps you already found that...
2009-06-16T16:27:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	What errors did you get?
2009-06-16T16:31:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	Jyxt, That looks promising.  I was unaware that OpenSSH had that capability!
2009-06-16T17:30:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	I couldn't test the chroot functionality of OpenSSH because my version is pre 5.
2009-06-16T17:31:00.000Z	rob_p	innociv	But the chroot jail does indeed need to be owned by root according to the documentation I found.
