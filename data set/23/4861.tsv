2007-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	MannyZ		ok
2007-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	if you don't like the link that it gave you you could always go to winehq.com and get help there since it tells you how to get it working
2007-08-04T05:03:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	of course not you want the .exe
2007-08-04T05:03:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	you have to install installshield first for it to install a .msi
2007-08-04T05:03:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	sure you do
2007-08-04T05:06:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	check winehq.com it tells you how to install steam
2007-08-04T05:07:00.000Z	MannyZ	kitche	ok
2007-08-04T05:07:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	sicne it's pretty clear cut directions on their site in the AbbDB
2007-08-04T05:08:00.000Z	MannyZ	kitche	is this the one: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1554?
2007-08-04T05:09:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	seems so the url looks correctl
2007-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	MannyZ	kitche	what is wrong with this command? cd ~/Desktop/Tahoma.ttf && cp ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/fonts
2007-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	umm Tahoma.tff is not a directory most likely
2007-08-04T05:15:00.000Z	MannyZ	kitche	it says that not such file or dir
2007-08-04T05:15:00.000Z	kitche	MannyZ	you want to do cp ~/Desktop/Tahoma.tff ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/fonts
