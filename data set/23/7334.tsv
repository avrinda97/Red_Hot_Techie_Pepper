2005-09-01T16:19:00.000Z	oblib		for phil
2005-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	oblib		any ideas as to why I can't mount DVDs if 'nohide' is set in fstab?
2005-09-01T16:23:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	please, dude, no open advising of the 'guide
2005-10-03T08:55:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	is it in your fstab?
2005-10-03T08:55:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	as follows: /dev/sda1       /win/f          ntfs    nls=utf8,umask=0222 0       0
2005-10-03T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	you need "auto," in front of the nls part
2005-10-03T08:58:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	like this? /dev/sda1       /win/f          ntfs    auto,nls=utf8,umask=0222 0       0
2005-10-03T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	yes
2005-10-03T08:59:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	why do my other drives mount fine without that?
2005-10-03T08:59:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	do they have "auto" in their lines?
2005-10-03T09:00:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	no. I have two other IDE drives and they are identical to the first entry I pasted. They mount just fine
2005-10-03T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	that is weird
2005-10-03T09:02:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	thanks, I'm going to reboot and see if it works
2005-10-03T09:22:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	It didn't work -- it says it can't find the device or something
2005-10-03T09:23:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	weird
2005-10-03T09:31:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	can you help me?
2005-10-03T09:31:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	with what?
2005-10-03T09:33:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	I think I just need to put a manual mount command later in the boot process, after it has recognized the serialATA drive. Can I do that?
2005-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	that's a smooth script, but still doesn't help my serial ATA problem
2005-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	nalioth	oblib	well i guess a rewrite is in order, eh?
2005-10-03T09:57:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	Nah, it does what it's supposed to I would guess. I'm thinking my SATA is just special
2006-03-21T09:28:00.000Z	oblib	nalioth	can you help me with the USB question?
