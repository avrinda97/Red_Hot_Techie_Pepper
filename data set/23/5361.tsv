2009-07-02T22:25:00.000Z	elux		is the package manage on ubuntu and debian the exact same? i understand ubuntu uses debian' aptitude manager
2009-07-02T22:25:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	yes, both use apt, aptitude, synaptic and dpkg
2009-07-02T22:26:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	does ubuntu also do the stupid shit like stable/testing/unstable/experimental and back ports?
2009-07-02T22:27:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	I wouldn't call it stupid but thats me :)  no, Ubuntu just uses strange animal names for thier versions ;)
2009-07-02T22:27:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	i see.. i think its very stupid. the stable versions are also so much older.. its not practical
2009-07-02T22:28:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	maybe not for you but with their way of thinking, stable is just that, stable and if you were a sys admin running a server farm would you want stability or the latest untested packages?
2009-07-02T22:29:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	im a developer, and i cant be bothered using 1 year old versions of software..
2009-07-02T22:30:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	i dont mind apt-get install package/testing .. thats fine, but then if i run apt-get upgrade, it will try to upgrade everything to use testing.. ?
2009-07-02T22:31:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	then you are thinking as a developer who needs cutting edge, not someone who needs stability. what about the people running Ubuntu 8.04? are they stupid for running an old version if it suits their needs?
2009-07-02T22:32:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	there is a way of not upgrading everything if you have a testing repo listed but I'm not sure how as I use just testing myself
2009-07-02T22:32:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	no they're not stupid if it works. but when designer a new product, i consider the new features of the services available to me and leverage them to make a better product and then monitor stability closely and fix issues as they come.. but in my experiences nothing has been devastating if you have back ups
2009-07-02T22:32:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	ohh you make testing your default branch for all packages?
2009-07-02T22:33:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	it comes down to what you need and want in your daily use
2009-07-02T22:33:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	yes I do
2009-07-02T22:33:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	but testing doesnt have security updates.. no?
2009-07-02T22:34:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	yes it does
2009-07-02T22:34:00.000Z	elux	Halitech	btw. what about backports .. do those original from testing?
2009-07-02T22:34:00.000Z	elux		original == originate
2009-07-02T22:34:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	I'm not sure on backports, I've never used them and I don't feel I need the latest and greatest when what I get installed is working the way I feel it should
2009-07-02T22:35:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	if I wanted to be on the cutting edge I'd go SID or Sidux :D
2009-07-02T22:36:00.000Z	elux		yea i dont need cutting edge
2009-07-02T22:36:00.000Z	elux		i need a mix.. hand picked packages
2009-07-02T22:37:00.000Z	Halitech	elux	then Debian would be the better way to go as from what I know (and I stand to be corrected) there is no easy way to get packages from a newer version of ubuntu without PPA or backports which aren;t from Canocal
