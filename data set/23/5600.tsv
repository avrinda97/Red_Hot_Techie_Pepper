2006-10-27T15:31:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Start it from a console.
2006-10-27T15:31:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	ok thanks
2006-10-27T15:32:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	that is mplayer, not gmplayer or kmplayer or something.
2006-10-27T15:33:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	gmplayer
2006-10-27T15:33:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Try mplayer without the "g" :)
2006-10-27T15:33:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	gmplayer has that gui ...
2006-10-27T15:35:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	and yes it has a nice gui that i have select
2006-10-27T15:35:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	well start it from the console, you should see the debug output.
2006-10-27T15:38:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	http://pastebin.ca/225327 can you help me
2006-10-27T15:38:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	hangon
2006-10-27T15:41:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Looks evil. And you say, mplayer works like a charm, gmplayer does not?
2006-10-27T15:41:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	exactly
2006-10-27T15:42:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Can you compare used video and audio codecs when using mplayer/gmplayer? Are they identical? Maybe you should check those settings at gmplayer.
2006-10-27T15:42:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	i have make the echo 1024 bla bla in root for the rtc but the problem still is the same but that message its not coming more
2006-10-27T15:43:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	i will try to put them in default
2006-10-27T15:43:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	if maplyer works, than gmplayer works, too, when you are using the same codecs.
2006-10-27T15:46:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	i should give you this detail i have run some videos in windows that crash explorer like they create a problem in XP !! i have run then in linux all the system went crazy like i couldnt kill the process of the gmplayer i add to reboot the machine using sudo but now sometimes happens that gmplayer crashes with some other movies !! could it be a virus or i should not think like that because its linux ??
2006-10-27T15:47:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Hmm, not very likely, there have never been any Linux viruses in the wild (yet).
2006-10-27T15:47:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	But a corrupt movie file can cause problems, when played.
2006-10-27T15:47:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	but that gmplayer totally pause my system that is a fact
2006-10-27T15:48:00.000Z	Kannix	iturk	Well, don't play that file then.
2006-10-27T15:49:00.000Z	iturk	Kannix	in windows they just crash explorer in linux the process its impossible to kill so it takes the all the processor and if i run it in fullscreen then i will not see no more the X environment !!
