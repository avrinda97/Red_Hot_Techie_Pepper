2007-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	AgentOrannnge		Hey guys I have a question here
2007-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	AgentOrannnge		This is my first time messing with ubuntu or linux of that sort
2007-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	are you gonna be selfish and keep it to yourself ?
2007-08-17T09:02:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	 no
2007-08-17T09:05:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	 what videocard do you have on your computer ?
2007-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	 you wonT be able to use the live cd ,   ati and nvidia donT' make FOSS drivers so they are not part of the live cd , you will need to use the alternate install cd to instal, it is text based
2007-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	you'll be able to install proper drivers afterwards
2007-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	AgentOrannnge	Pelo	How do I access that? Do I need a new CD or is it on the Live one.
2007-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	 if you dled the dvd it is on it, otherwise you need to get a new cd from the site
2007-08-17T09:08:00.000Z	Pelo	AgentOrannnge	 ask a freind with a hispeed connection to get it for you
