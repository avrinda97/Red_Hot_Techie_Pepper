2006-04-01T15:53:00.000Z	Killgore		how does X know what resolution to use in xorg.conf
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	kuja	Killgore	It uses the first one listed.
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	kuja	Killgore	You have "x" "y" "z", it will use "x" for that specific depth.
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	Killgore	kuja	it says the depth is 1 tho
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	kuja		Is that what you set your depth at?
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	Killgore		oh does it use the default depth listed
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	Killgore		24
2006-04-01T15:55:00.000Z	Killgore		so if i change DefaultDepth to 16 then ill need to make res entrys for that depth?
2006-04-01T15:55:00.000Z	kuja		It should use whatever depth you tell it to use, *if* the specific graphics card driver works at that depth.
2006-04-01T15:55:00.000Z	kuja		Otherwise it should default to a lower depth.
2006-04-01T15:55:00.000Z	kuja	Killgore	Correct
2006-04-01T15:56:00.000Z	Killgore	kuja	i think windows could have 16bit @ 1280x1024
2006-04-01T15:56:00.000Z	Killgore	kuja	which i want now
2006-04-01T15:56:00.000Z	Killgore		i dindnt think so
2006-04-01T15:56:00.000Z	kuja	Killgore	You want a new SubSection for your display, where the Depth is set to 16, and Modes is a quoted list of resolutions (in the order of which to use)
2006-04-01T15:58:00.000Z	Killgore		kuju: gaim just died
