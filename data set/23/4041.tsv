2008-01-25T00:08:00.000Z	linduxed		is there any command to find (and if possible purge) all packages that were pulled in once as deps, but have lost their parent-packages? (removed)
2008-01-25T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	I think sudo apt-get autoremove does that.. might be clean too
2008-01-25T00:10:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	thx will check
2008-02-19T20:26:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	probably something the manufacturers proprietary driver took care of and the guy who wrote the linux driver didn't think was worth spending time on
2008-02-19T20:28:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	yeah i understand that, but what is it controlled by?
2008-02-19T20:29:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	probably some function only existing in the windows driver.. do you really really really need it?
2008-06-18T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	hard to write linus.. =) that last 'x' is almost automatic =)
2008-08-14T15:58:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	fsck?
2008-08-14T15:58:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	is the the most thorough tool at disposal?
2008-08-14T15:59:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	there might be some other stuff.. perhaps something that stress-tests the hard drive more
2008-08-14T15:59:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	what do you want to do?
2008-08-14T16:00:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	!eee
2008-08-14T18:26:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	hey sorry i had to run
2008-08-14T18:27:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	i was asking about fsck and stuff and suddenly a hing came up
2008-08-14T18:27:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	about 3 hours ago? :-P
2008-10-10T23:57:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	are you going to use hibernation or such functions? if so you need as much swap as memory.. if not 2Gb should be enough
2009-07-20T23:01:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	doesn't SELinux come with acl's?
2009-07-20T23:01:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	acl?
2009-07-20T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	access control lists.. who is allowed to do what to each directory and file.. kind of like the windows system
2009-07-20T23:03:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	will check that out
2009-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	install vim-gnome.. or vim-gtk
2009-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	linduxed	Slart	thx
2009-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	Slart	linduxed	I have no idea why it isn't installed together with plain vim.. perhaps both kubuntu and ubuntu use the same base package
