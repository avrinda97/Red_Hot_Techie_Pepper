2010-04-16T02:29:00.000Z	rsr		hello
2010-04-16T02:31:00.000Z	rsr		I am trying to boot kernel 2.6.31-19 instead of 2.6.31-20 by default. There is no more menu.lst and I cant alter grub.cfg not even as root. How can I remove other kernel options from the grub menu in ubuntu 9.10?
2010-04-16T02:31:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	sudo nano /etc/default/grub
2010-04-16T02:32:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	/default/grub has nothing regarding the order of the kernels
2010-04-16T02:32:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	/etc/grub/
2010-04-16T02:33:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	sorry mate, I dont understand your instructions
2010-04-16T02:34:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	look into /var/grub
2010-04-16T02:35:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	there is no /var/grub
2010-04-16T02:35:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	/etc/grub?
2010-04-16T02:36:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	only /etc/grub.d where it holds the themes
2010-04-16T02:36:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	well you can change the order of the files? numberswise
2010-04-16T02:37:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	or do you want to uninstall older kernels?
2010-04-16T02:37:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	I want to uninstall the newer kernel which is booting by deault...overwrote my older kernel which is what I want
2010-04-16T02:38:00.000Z	mickster04	rsr	well you could change which kernel gets booted by default by editing /etc/default/grub or uninstall the kernel thru synaptic
2010-04-16T02:38:00.000Z	rsr	mickster04	after an update it started booting into 2.6.31-20 instead of the kernel I want it to boot by default which is 2.6.31-19
