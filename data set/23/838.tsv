2011-01-16T22:48:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	ok, put the cd and select install to install it, then if you want a tool to wipe files go into synaptic and type wipe should bring up lots of programs that can do same thing
2011-01-16T22:50:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	if you want to use that exact package go to this site http://sourceforge.net/projects/wipe/files/
2011-01-16T22:51:00.000Z	el_copter	needlez	compile ? please explain
2011-01-16T22:52:00.000Z	el_copter	needlez	i got the archive, and i extracted it ..
2011-01-16T22:53:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	in there it should have an install file that explains what to do
2011-01-16T22:54:00.000Z	el_copter	needlez	 ./configure; make install_home        <-- all in the same line ?
2011-01-16T22:55:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	the ; means two different commands
2011-01-16T22:55:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	./configure
2011-01-16T22:55:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	make install
2011-01-16T22:56:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	what is the install error say??
2011-01-16T22:57:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	try running the commands as root
2011-01-16T22:58:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	sudo su
2011-01-16T22:58:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	that should put you into root mode then type those commands and you should be good
2011-01-16T22:59:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	if not give me a few min and ill write you a dpkg file for it but it might take some time
2011-01-16T23:00:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	if the program installed you can run it from terminal
2011-01-16T23:00:00.000Z	needlez	el_copter	exit from root with exit
