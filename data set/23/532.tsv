2011-07-03T12:25:00.000Z	faina		then look in the old-user/Desktop
2011-07-03T12:27:00.000Z	faina		Nikhilm, bring up folder viewer, hit the <| arrow on the 3rd line near your user name. a [home] button should appear. click on that, and you should see the various user directories
2011-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	faina		Tensor, but he mentioned he changed his username.
2011-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	faina		"<nikhilm> i changed my login username for the new version"
2011-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	faina		just quoting you for tensors benefit
2011-07-03T12:31:00.000Z	faina		I was thinking he created a new user for himself, and needs to navigate from /home/new-uid to /home/old-uid/desktop
2011-07-03T12:32:00.000Z	faina		if its not a encrypted home directory, he might be able to at least read it?
2011-07-03T12:33:00.000Z	faina		I think its an option. Most of my systems allow reading other user dirs.
2011-07-03T12:34:00.000Z	faina		natty doesn't need a ppa as its an official release...
2011-07-03T12:35:00.000Z	faina		Your other directory was encrypted, you 'll need to log in as that user to view the fieles
