2008-11-29T19:32:00.000Z	poopsniffer		prints /bin/sh
2008-11-29T19:32:00.000Z	poopsniffer		/bin/bash
2008-11-29T19:32:00.000Z	poopsniffer		chsh even confirms the change....
2008-11-29T19:34:00.000Z	poopsniffer		yah, that works correctly.
2008-11-29T19:34:00.000Z	poopsniffer		i think it's a gnome thing.
2008-11-29T19:34:00.000Z	poopsniffer		or terminal launch icon needs to be changed.
2008-11-29T19:35:00.000Z	poopsniffer		gnome logs in fine. just when i  go to apps > terminal, it always fires up in sh, and i want bash, and chsh confirms the change. and ctrl+shift_f1 confirms the login change. but terminal from gnome doesn't.
2008-11-29T19:35:00.000Z	poopsniffer		stumped
2008-11-29T19:36:00.000Z	poopsniffer		hmm, works on my other system.....
2008-11-29T19:36:00.000Z	poopsniffer		not this one.
2008-11-29T19:37:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	poopsniffer	you just want the shell to be bash everytime?  not dash?  have you tried setting the symlink for sh to bash?
2008-11-29T19:37:00.000Z	poopsniffer	musikgoat|main	wouldn't know how to do that
2008-11-29T19:38:00.000Z	poopsniffer		just weird a console login confirms the chsh change, but terminal from gnome doesn't. /etc/passwd confirms the change as well.
2008-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	poopsniffer	but thats what you want, is bash?
2008-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	musikgoat|main		in your gnome-terminal?
2008-11-29T19:42:00.000Z	poopsniffer	musikgoat|main	yes, but in order for it to work, even though i changed /etc/passwd to /bin/bash, and used chsh to change it to bash, everytime i click on applications>acc>terminal, i have to type /bin/bash in the terminal to change it. BUT ctrl_shift+f1 confirms the change...so dunno man
2008-11-29T19:42:00.000Z	poopsniffer		terminal always wants to start in /bin/sh, not /bin/bash
2008-11-29T19:42:00.000Z	poopsniffer		!, driving me crazy
2008-11-29T19:43:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	poopsniffer	try this:  sudo rm /bin/sh; sudo ln -s bash /bin/sh
2008-11-29T19:43:00.000Z	musikgoat|main		then try again
2008-11-29T19:44:00.000Z	musikgoat|main		gnome-terminal is calling sh
2008-11-29T19:44:00.000Z	poopsniffer	musikgoat|main	wtf? now the prompt is sh-3.2$
2008-11-29T19:45:00.000Z	poopsniffer	musikgoat|main	before it was just "$"
