2010-05-20T21:50:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	can't really be done unless your trash is a separate partition. Shredding files on a journaled filesystem doesn't work.
2010-05-20T21:50:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	if your underlying filesystem is encrypted then there's no need to shred.
2010-05-20T21:50:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 :S ext3 i cant shred??
2010-05-20T21:51:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	nope, only chance is to shred the whole partition.
2010-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	Anarhist  what about if i encrypt my disc?? with truecrypt
2010-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	I'd use the built-in ecryptfs. Create a new user, and in the user-create dialog check the box to encrypt data. Copy all your stuff to that new user and it's all encrypted.
2010-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	might want to do that after a reinstall and a shred of the disk.
2010-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 hmm sounds easy :: but im on a dual boot system
2010-05-20T21:54:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	even better. Copy all the stuff you want to keep into a TrueCrypt volume, and put that in the Windows system. Overwrite the Ubuntu partitions with zeros, then reinstall Ubuntu. You can set up the ecryptfs stuff in the installation.
2010-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 man! lol that means i will lose all my settings / configurations and ssytem preferences on ubuntu?
2010-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	no, you can put all that in the truecrypt file.
2010-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	even my eyecandy :(
2010-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	for the record, LUKS or TrueCrypt are full-disk encryption while ecryptfs just encrypts what you want.
2010-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	just shred the entire partition from a LiveCD.
2010-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	will encrypting the whole disc make it slower??
2010-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	something like dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdaN will do it.
2010-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	maybe
2010-05-20T21:59:00.000Z	cellofellow	VirusTB	there's also the shred command or just good old dd.
2010-05-20T22:01:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 i think me and phlak_user  are onto something here.. using explore2fs .. pull the files from ext3 partion (ubuntu) and shread them :D
2010-05-20T22:01:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 under windows ** shread them
2010-05-20T22:09:00.000Z	VirusTB	cellofellow	 thanks for your help guys! phlak_user  will install explor2fs n locate my ubuntu trashbin inwindows and shread files from, there
