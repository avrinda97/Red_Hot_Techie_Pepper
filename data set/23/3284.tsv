2008-06-03T16:54:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist		oops psted the wrong line i meant to say: is it better to install generic or linux-amd64-k8   on an AMD64 turion ?
2008-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	it doesn't really matter
2008-06-03T16:58:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	not ndiswrapper
2008-06-03T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	generic does not mean that it's not 64bit
2008-06-03T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	if you run 'uname -a' you'll see that your kernel is x86_64
2008-09-11T21:09:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	internal devices can be connected to the USB
2008-09-11T21:09:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	but why would it disapear when its still got to be physically connected ?
2008-09-11T21:11:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	this can happen if the laptop BIOS has the capability to power the internal device down.
2008-09-11T21:12:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	 so it cant be fixed using some special lsusb command? :(
2008-09-11T21:13:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	explain what the exact problem is please
2008-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	 i have a webcam (m5602 not supported) and it sometimes shows in lsusb, thats about all i know
2008-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	do you dualboot Windows?
2008-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	nope, vista doesnt work since i shrunk it.
2008-09-11T21:19:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	if you disable the webcam in the BIOS setup, it probably won't be seen by lsusb any more.
2008-09-11T21:22:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	i was trying to get the camera working, but i suppose if its a bios problem theres not much i can do
2008-09-11T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	so the real problem is that you can't get your webcam to work?
2008-09-11T21:24:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	 well i can get it to work when its in lsusb but it not when its not
2008-09-11T21:25:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	so when does it disappear?
2008-09-11T21:25:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	 sometimes its not there when i start the laptop othertimes it disapears if i swivel the camera around
2008-09-11T21:27:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	I think it has a wobbly internal connection
2008-09-11T21:29:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	so it pobably needs taking to a computer shop ? where theyll probably tell me ubuntu is unsupprted :(
2008-09-11T21:32:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	soundray	thx for the help
2008-09-11T21:33:00.000Z	soundray	Rioting_pacifist	if you find a shop with reasonably competent people, and you tell them that your camera disconnects when you swivel it, they will probably be willing to help you.
