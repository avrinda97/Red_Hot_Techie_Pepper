2010-05-21T00:52:00.000Z	Aazoris_1	guntbert	i still cant get it to update, This is what I done and the outcome of it... - " [root@Anthony sbin]# apt-get update
2010-05-21T00:52:00.000Z	Aazoris_1		-bash: apt-get: command not found "
2010-05-21T00:53:00.000Z	rocket16	Aazoris_1	Use sudo apt-get update in any normal user mode.
