2009-10-03T19:32:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	just tried an install with an s3 card, best I got was 640x480, s3 isn't very well supported
2009-10-03T19:32:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	is is now like 640 480 ...
2009-10-03T19:33:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	is this a desktop or a laptop?
2009-10-03T19:33:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	desktop
2009-10-03T19:34:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	you could try booting to single user mode and running xfix but my suggestion would be to get an nvidia card and install it, be alot less hassle and will be better supported
2009-10-03T19:35:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	i already runned xfix that way and after that it started to work, before that it freezed or something...
2009-10-03T19:36:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	and you still only have 640x480? get a better card
2009-10-03T19:37:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	i do not know, may be 320 240
2009-10-03T19:37:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	get a better card would be my suggestion
2009-10-03T19:37:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	i cannot now
2009-10-03T19:39:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	you could try installing 8.04 and see if it works better
2009-10-03T19:43:00.000Z	qdb	Halitech	do you know how can i change that in terminal? i will serch in internet
2009-10-03T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	qdb	you can try to manually edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf but I'm not sure what settings you would use
