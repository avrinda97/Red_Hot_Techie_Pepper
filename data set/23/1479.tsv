2010-03-10T22:59:00.000Z	flipflop_		I have two laptop and one external hd with ubuntu installed
2010-03-10T23:01:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	felicitations on your fortuitous superfluity of hardware.
2010-03-10T23:02:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	having one installation driving two laptops is generally not easy.
2010-03-10T23:03:00.000Z	flipflop_	slashme	how to "force that laptop-intel load intel-glx..."
2010-03-10T23:04:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	you could maybe have two xorg.conf files, one named xorg.conf.intel, and one named xorg.conf.nvidia,
2010-03-10T23:04:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	and then have xorg.conf be a symlink to one or the other.
2010-03-10T23:04:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	just change the symlink and bounce the xserver.
2010-03-10T23:06:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	no problem!
2010-03-10T23:07:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	you just make your own xorg.conf, will explain....
2010-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	sudo Xorg -configure will create an xorg.conf for you.
2010-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	flipflop_	slashme	yes but if I have installed nvidia-glx package then is load intel-graphic and nvidia-glx...
2010-03-10T23:10:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	sorry, didn't quite understand?
2010-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	and then what happens?
2010-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	that's surely not because it's trying to load two modules: the x server should detect which module to load based on your hardware.
2010-03-10T23:13:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	have you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see what error it gives?
2010-03-10T23:14:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	sorry, again I didn't quite understand what you said ;-[
2010-03-10T23:15:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	what is "nvidia-graphic"?
2010-03-10T23:15:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	nvidia-glx is the right driver for nvidia cards if I remember correctly.
2010-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	sure, and that's on the intel box, right?
2010-03-10T23:17:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	and then on the nvidia box?
2010-03-10T23:17:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	sounds right....
2010-03-10T23:21:00.000Z	slashme	flipflop_	nah.  What makes you think intel-graphic loads nvidia-glx?
