2009-10-03T09:03:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	which version of ubuntu? ubuntu 9.04 has optimized startup time
2009-10-03T09:03:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	how much ram do u have
2009-10-03T09:06:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	check out which process is using up the cpu, from system monitor
2009-10-03T09:07:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	there you go, recovery mode takes longer time than normal boot
2009-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	run xfix from recovery mode
2009-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	yes
2009-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	are u having this problem since fresh installation?
2009-10-03T09:10:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	ubuntu isn't well supported by your hardware
2009-10-03T09:10:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	whats your file system?
2009-10-03T09:13:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	if fsck doesn't fix that, then your file system is corrupt enough to do another fresh install :P
2009-10-03T09:14:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	no the ubuntu 9.04 default filesystem is ext3
2009-10-03T09:15:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	now be familiar with ext3, ext4, jfs :)
2009-10-03T09:20:00.000Z	alokito	khunter619	what problem are you having? ubuntu should automatically detect your wireless
