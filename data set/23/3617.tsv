2009-09-15T08:22:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	it's under integrated
2009-09-15T08:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	why didn't you point that out before? :)
2009-09-15T08:36:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	yes, but Firefox isn't even 64bit, so there is a breakdown there.
2009-09-15T08:37:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	how do i have firefox without 32 bit lib depends if it's not 64 bit? how come I can compile it? the answer is it is 64 bit ;p
2009-09-15T08:38:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	well, I could be wrong, but I don't think mozilla has released 64bit version
2009-09-15T08:38:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	if you have the link to their 64bit firefox, I would love to see it.
2009-09-15T08:42:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	right, but I don't think it exists for Linux, you can compile 32bit software on 64bit box without a problem
2009-09-15T08:42:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	wine is the same way, it maybe compiled for 64bit, but it still only processes 32bits at a time
2009-09-15T08:43:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	fedora i know has both 32 bit and 64 bit firefoxes easily available
2009-09-15T08:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	I'm working on 64bit Jaunty and too installed firefox, however it is only 32bit, because 64bit java didn't work with it
2009-09-15T08:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	after googling, I found out there wasn't a 64bit Linux firefox
2009-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	and after googling i found several instances of 64 bit linux firefox
2009-09-15T08:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	you have to separate the name form the actual product, it may say Firefox-3.5-amd64, because it is built to be installed on 64bit box, but doesn't mean it is truely 64bit
2009-10-03T06:04:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	is htop in the terminal like top is?  Isn't it colored?
2009-10-03T06:07:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	see my last two messages
2009-10-03T06:07:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	;D
2009-10-03T06:08:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	is it just the color that makes htop better?  or is it more indepth?  I guess I should just install it and see. ;)
2009-10-03T06:09:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	I will just install it, shouldn't take  but a second.
2009-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	you do know about tab complete right?  for IRC and nicks.
2009-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	haven't i been using that?
2009-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	I'm not sure, you have been using my nick, just didn't want you to have to type it every time. :)
2009-10-03T06:15:00.000Z	shane2peru	DigitalKiwi	htop is nice.
2009-10-03T06:16:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	shane2peru	yup
