2005-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	folta		i'm trying to install ndiswrapper, and i have an amd-64 kernel, but that kernel doesn't have a linux-source-(version) package in the repository, do i need to switch to a different kernel and then do the patch?
2005-04-07T12:26:00.000Z	mjr	folta	you can't, to the best of my knowledge, run 32-bit ndis drivers with ndiswrapper on amd64
2005-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	mjr	folta	ok then
2005-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	mjr	folta	you shouldn't have to
2005-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	folta	mjr	what do you mean?
2005-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	mjr	folta	I mean that the base ubuntu kernel contains the usual dvb modules
2005-04-08T13:07:00.000Z	folta	mjr	look here: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NovaTHowTo/
2005-04-08T13:08:00.000Z	mjr	folta	interesting; Nova-T USB works fine with my default Ubuntu kernel
2005-04-08T13:09:00.000Z	mjr	folta	in Warty, though, I have to manually load tda1004x (doesn't autoload) and create the device nodes, but neither really requires kernel patching
2005-04-08T13:10:00.000Z	folta	mjr	where do you get that file?
2005-04-08T13:11:00.000Z	mjr	folta	for kernels >=2.6.10 there's a script in Documentation/dvb
2005-04-08T13:11:00.000Z	mjr	folta	for earlier kernels you need an earlier version of the firmware; I can send it if you need it
2005-04-08T13:12:00.000Z	mjr	folta	hmm, except it would seem that the USB model might use a different frontend driver than your thing
2005-04-08T13:12:00.000Z	mjr	folta	mine uses a tda10046, while the instructions there in the howto imply that CX22700 is used for the PCI card
2005-04-08T13:12:00.000Z	folta	mjr	that's right, i checked
2005-04-08T13:13:00.000Z	mjr	folta	so, it might be that the card doesn't work out of the box (or it might not)... :/
2005-04-08T13:13:00.000Z	folta	mjr	, assuming it does, do i just need to install mplayer and go?
2005-04-08T13:14:00.000Z	mjr	folta	I'd try upgrading to Hoary before starting manual patching, but your call
2005-04-08T13:14:00.000Z	folta	mjr	, i have hoary, but i'm a total n00b
2005-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	mjr	folta	ok; well, then it (basically) should work like that (except I use xine), _if_ your card doesn't need a firmware file. If it does, you'll need to get that. Get the kernel sources and see Documentation/dvb
2005-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	mjr	folta	linux-source-2.6.10 or something
2005-04-08T13:16:00.000Z	folta	mjr	thanks, i'm onto it
2005-04-08T13:17:00.000Z	mjr	folta	(and then there's the possible autodetection problems, but on Hoary my devices at least autodetects just fine)
