2005-12-08T15:04:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: did you try to get your program via synaptic?
2005-12-08T15:05:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: it is an antispam for your mail client?
2005-12-08T15:05:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	exactly
2005-12-08T15:05:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: what is your mail client?
2005-12-08T15:06:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	evolution is my mail client actually, but i'm new in linux and i can change it without problem
2005-12-08T15:06:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: because Thunderbird has already an antispam
2005-12-08T15:07:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	i looked into evolution and it has some buttons for spam-no spam but i thing those are no very useful
2005-12-08T15:07:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: then you should use Thunderbird. You'll have to configure a bit the antispam so that it can learn what is spam and what is not
2005-12-08T15:07:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	do you recommend me Thunderbird over Evolution?
2005-12-08T15:07:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: after you an choose if Thunderbird put the spam into a specific folder or directly delete it
2005-12-08T15:08:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: Well, I prefer thunderird but I am sure that there are people on this channel that prefer evolution
2005-12-08T15:10:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: maybe you should go for Thunderbird
2005-12-08T15:14:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: usually if I followed what you said you have to extract the tar.gz
2005-12-08T15:15:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	yes, i have extracted the tar.gz but i cannot use the  $make command properly
2005-12-08T15:15:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: but before downloading from internet you should see if the packet is available for Ubuntu via Synaptic
2005-12-08T15:15:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: did you use .configure before?
2005-12-08T15:16:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	i have already seen it
2005-12-08T15:16:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	yes, i have used it vefore
2005-12-08T15:16:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: then I don't know. I am not very familiar with make install
2005-12-08T15:16:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	can i tell you the error i get?
2005-12-08T15:16:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: I usually use Synaptic or get a .deb or a .rpm file
2005-12-08T15:17:00.000Z	tristan	dukebody	: there was no .deb or .rpm on the website?
2005-12-08T15:17:00.000Z	dukebody	tristan	give me a second to see that
