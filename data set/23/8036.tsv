2005-02-21T13:41:00.000Z	steve_		has anyone use the codeweavers software
2005-02-21T13:41:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 yes.
2005-02-21T13:41:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 yup.  I run itunes and photoshop 7 through it.
2005-02-21T13:42:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 itunes can be tricky on less-than-great laptop soundcards.
2005-02-21T13:42:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 I also play half-life 2 and World of Warcraft through linux as well.
2005-02-21T13:43:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 I don't believe itunes will work through crossover if your ipod is connected via usb2
2005-02-21T13:44:00.000Z	steve_	ewhitten	you say it wont work through usb
2005-02-21T13:44:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 I use rhythmbox to connect my ipod.
2005-02-21T13:45:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 http://www.codeweavers.com/site/compatibility/browse/name?app_id=134  <-- all the info on using itunes with linux and its limitations.
2005-02-21T13:45:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 yup.
2005-02-21T13:46:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 yup.
2005-02-21T13:48:00.000Z	steve_	ewhitten	got a question, will it work if my songs are mp4s
2005-02-21T13:49:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 will what work, specifically?  which app are you talking about?
2005-02-21T13:50:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 it will support playback of anything that gstreamer can play
2005-02-21T13:50:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 You would just need to make sure that your gstreamer had the faad2/mp4 plugins
2005-02-21T13:51:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 yup, just look for them in synaptic.  do you have universe enabled?
2005-02-21T14:01:00.000Z	steve_	ewhitten	I have faad2 installed but it doesnt look like rythmbox is seeing all my mp4s
2005-02-21T14:02:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	hmm.. I'm not entirely sure, I usually just play mp3's.  you could try to convert?
2005-02-21T14:04:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 looks like you can grab the windows xp version of dbpoweramp and run it through cxoffice/wine?
2005-02-21T14:04:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 You should google around for it.
2005-02-21T14:09:00.000Z	steve_	ewhitten	itunes seems a little buggy
2005-02-21T14:09:00.000Z	ewhitten	steve_	 this is the first version of cxoffice that's really supported it, which is why it has a bronze rating.  cxoffice 5.x (which comes out in the near future) will probably be much better.
2005-02-21T14:13:00.000Z	steve_	ewhitten	I really like this crossover
