2005-03-20T11:27:00.000Z	queuetue		Can I set my login program to be screen in /etc/passwd?
2005-03-20T11:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 what would ^A^C invike?
2005-03-20T11:29:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	How would I achieve what I want to do, then? (when I ssh in, "screen -d -R" starts automatically)
2005-03-20T11:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 .bash_profile?
2005-03-20T11:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 .bash_profile vs .basrc, and utilize whether the default "login shell" status is on or off in .screenrc
2005-04-08T06:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 i've been active for hours in here and not seen mention of it
2005-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 no, they just get marked as "local"
2005-04-08T06:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 comment out the unofficial, upgrade, then uncomment if you want
2005-04-08T06:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 the problem there is that the ubuntu-desktop package is basically a small fake package
2005-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 all that the package is is a list of dependencies.  IF you don't have them, it forces them to be installed
2005-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	but removing it does not remove those dependencies...  what is the easiest way to 'remove gnome" and reinstall it?
2005-04-08T06:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 you already ave them, so asking the fake package to come agin just says "install this list if needed" and ... they're there already, so it does nothing
2005-04-08T06:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 this isn't completely simple, noty a one-liner, but this is the easiest i can think of, here goes
2005-04-08T06:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 you find ou the list of dependencies in that fake package, say it's foo bar baz, and then you issue 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install foo bar baz'
2005-04-08T06:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 and here is how to find out the list of dependencies in there ... look at the Depends: line in the output of the command 'apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop'
2005-04-08T06:57:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	like what?   (since its running now.)
2005-04-08T06:58:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	You're just assuming there are some then, you don't know about any specific issues...
2005-04-08T06:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 i have no clue what apps you have installed on your machine, just cautioning you not to lose things by accident
2005-04-08T07:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 how many hours did you spend getting things the way you wanted them?
2005-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	I'm constantly updating it.
2005-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 if you lose all or most of it, would it be a tragedy?
2005-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	queuetue	eyequeue	No.
2005-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	queuetue	 heh, why not reinstall fresh? :)  semi-kidding
