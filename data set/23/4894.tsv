2007-04-22T11:39:00.000Z	igge		i want usb sticks to be mounted read-only when they are inserted, is that possible?
2007-04-22T11:39:00.000Z	surviver	igge	mount -o ro,remount /media/(path)
2007-04-22T11:40:00.000Z	igge	surviver	how can I make that happen automatically?
2007-04-22T11:41:00.000Z	surviver	igge	dont know u can try to make a script for it ... :s
2007-04-22T11:41:00.000Z	igge	surviver	yeah... but how to make the script execute?
2007-04-22T11:41:00.000Z	surviver	igge	chmod +x
2007-04-22T11:42:00.000Z	igge	surviver	heh... but I mean automatically when usb sticks are inserted
2007-04-22T11:43:00.000Z	surviver	igge	well bind it to a key and press it :) or try to find a way to set it to a user so only specciefd users can access the rw
2007-04-22T11:44:00.000Z	igge	surviver	hm won't do.. :) But it should be possible to configure HAL or something...
2007-04-22T11:45:00.000Z	surviver	igge	i know it is possible maybe somewhere in fstab?
2007-04-22T11:45:00.000Z	surviver	igge	yes thats possible
2007-04-22T11:46:00.000Z	igge	surviver	but it doesn't get mounted through fstab... it gets mounted by some newer mechanism which I'm not sure how it works
2007-04-22T11:46:00.000Z	surviver	igge	u can open fstab with root edit the usb drive set it to ro and done
2007-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	surviver	igge	mzz quiet odd cause i've got here my usb drive and i set it in fstab to read only save it and it works ...
2007-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	igge	surviver	i mean if I insert a usb stick (or camera or whatever) it gets mounted, but not using fstab
2007-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	surviver	igge	mzz oke
2007-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	surviver	igge	u know what he uses?
2007-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	igge	surviver	well dunno... but isn't it automount or HAL or something that does that
2007-04-22T11:49:00.000Z	surviver	igge	another way is to press right button on ur usb tool and then properties then go to permissions and there configure it?
2007-04-22T11:49:00.000Z	igge	surviver	I know... that's not what I want... I want it to happen automatically as it is inserted...
2007-04-22T11:49:00.000Z	surviver	igge	mzz i know what u mean but i find it odd it isnt in fstab
2007-04-22T11:50:00.000Z	surviver	igge	sry dont know what u can try more ....
2007-04-22T11:51:00.000Z	igge	surviver	ok thanks anyway...
