2009-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	porkee		washburnello: when i installed ubuntu, i di a clean wipe of windows, later i began looking thru all the fiels and folders in ubuntu to learn it, it was then i noticed that i supposedly have 3 computere in my network. i did not set up a network and we only have 2 computers and i never connected them notr so i even no how to do that?
2009-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	what kind of computer are you using? is it a laptop?
2009-10-05T08:16:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	do the names of the computers look familure?
2009-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	the reason I'm asking these kinds of questions is because networks can be very complex
2009-10-05T08:18:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	does your home network have wifi?
2009-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	it's probably just residual information in the router
2009-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	when did you install ubuntu?
2009-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	yeah, it's probably just residual
2009-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	I wouldn't worry about it
2009-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	wouldn't hurt anything to check
2009-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	networks can be very complex. without an extensive knowledge of your setup it's hard to be certain.
2009-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	do you have a router and more than 1 computer connecting to the internet at home?
2009-10-05T08:31:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	than you have a network. Thats what a network is. what your referring to not setting up is file sharing or something like it.
2009-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	when you went to "network" in ubuntu, it's just showing you that it detected the presence of other computers on your network.

2009-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	it's all part of how networking works
2009-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	hit up wikipedia about networking sometime. there's loads of stuff there. :)
2009-10-05T08:33:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	that was the old days ;)
2009-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	I'd also do some research on tightening up your wireless just as a preemptive measure.
2009-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	I don't think it's your problem but it's always a good idea
2009-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	:D
2009-10-05T08:37:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	what your laptop is sensing is other networks. your router doesn't connect to routers wirelessly unless you have a special scenerio
2009-10-05T08:38:00.000Z	washburnello1	porkee	later
