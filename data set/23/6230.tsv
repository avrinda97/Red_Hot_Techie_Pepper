2006-08-04T14:24:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	won't try that then
2006-08-04T14:25:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	well i guess it was my fault. you just should not format your card if your are trying to use it as mass storage
2006-08-04T14:25:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	oops
2006-08-04T14:26:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	what ya wanna do with your phone?
2006-08-04T14:26:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	transfer music from my computer to it primarily
2006-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	ok. via usb?
2006-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	thing is, device manager can see it
2006-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	yes
2006-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	ok. look for a usb mode option on your phone then
2006-08-04T14:28:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	for me there are 3 options. i can choose wether my celly uses the usb as pictbridge, modem or just mass storage...
2006-08-04T14:28:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	ooh
2006-08-04T14:30:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	found something?
2006-08-04T14:30:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	don't seem to have any options here
2006-08-04T14:30:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	take a look at your manual
2006-08-04T14:31:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	if it is a real mass storage, ubuntu will find it!
2006-08-04T14:31:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	fiddling.......
2006-08-04T14:32:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	hmm, option here asking me for a host address - wonder if I should find the addy of the usb port it's plugged into
2006-08-04T14:33:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	you sure this is related to the usb functionallity?
2006-08-04T14:35:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	ucordes	no idea, but it's the only option I've got short of going the gnokii route and last time that was as useful as a chocolate hammer
2006-08-04T14:37:00.000Z	ucordes	FurryNemesis	well i don't know anything about this gnokii. but i tried to google for your problem and couldn't find anything. only cheap cable offers -_- ^^
