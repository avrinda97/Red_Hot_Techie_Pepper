2005-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	waxhead		so how does one manage the modules.conf these days?
2005-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	one does modprobe, then one puts the name of the module in /etc/modules
2005-04-01T14:20:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	thanks..
2005-04-17T16:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-04-17T16:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	gcc is the GNU cc compiler
2005-04-17T16:53:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	thanks.. couldn't find the right package...
2005-04-17T16:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	it isn't intuitively obvious, is it ? *g*
2005-04-17T16:54:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	acutally that's going to install an older version of gcc over the one that's already installed, which is 3.4
2005-04-17T16:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	hmmm - did you install that separately? Ubuntu doesn't install gcc by default
2005-04-17T16:57:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	no.. it was like that when I got here...
2005-04-17T16:58:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	nope.. must me
2005-04-17T16:59:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	I'm going to install it anyway
2005-04-17T05:00:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	wonder if it installed the gcc stuff when I installed the kernel sources?
2005-04-17T05:05:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	well, at least now I have cc... pity the module won't compile
2005-04-17T05:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	pkill short circuits that requirement
2005-04-17T05:15:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	yeah?
2005-04-17T05:15:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	only do it from the terminal typically
2005-04-17T05:16:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	right.. prolly just wrappers around grep and kill anyway
2005-04-17T05:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	yep - pkill an dpgrep are the same man pge, for instance
2005-04-17T05:19:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	ok.. what's the right package to install for the kernel source?
2005-04-17T05:20:00.000Z	waxhead	thoreauputic	hmm been a while.. if I'm compiling modules, I really only need the kernel headers don't it?
2005-04-17T05:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	kernel-source or linux-source ( can't recall which)
2005-04-17T05:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	waxhead	for headers, linux-headers-$(uname -r)
