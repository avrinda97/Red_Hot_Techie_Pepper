2007-08-30T16:44:00.000Z	Bulazeem		how do i disable desktop drawing in ubuntu?
2007-08-30T16:45:00.000Z	Adlai	Bulazeem	like, the background?
2007-08-30T16:45:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	exactly
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	i did it before and cant remember how
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Adlai		you can either set it to no background, or kill that instance of nautilus
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	i remember setting something to draw desktop false or something like that
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Adlai		oh, you mean in GDM?
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	i think so.
2007-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Adlai		that would be no background for the login screen, is that what you want?
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Adlai		it's in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	what my ultimate goal is for the compiz-fusion to display my four desktop images.   i had it set up before so it wouldnt draw a desktop or icons but i cant remember what i did =/
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Adlai		add the line "BackgroundType=0"
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Adlai		hmm?
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Adlai		oh
2007-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Adlai		this is something entirely different
2007-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	Adlai		well for that, you just kill nautilus
2007-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	Adlai		and tell the session manager not to start nautilus on login
2007-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	ty :)
2007-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	Adlai	Bulazeem	explain to me what it is you're doing, because I want to try it
2007-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	with compiz-fusion you can go to the desktop cube section and then you can set it up under the appearance tab so that each face of your "cube" or w/e shape you have will have its own wallpaper
2007-08-30T16:51:00.000Z	Adlai		oh that
2007-08-30T16:51:00.000Z	Adlai		alright, yeah
2007-08-30T16:58:00.000Z	Bulazeem	Adlai	i found an easier way to do it if you are interested.  in configuration editor go to apps, nautilus, preferences, and uncheck the show_desktop box
