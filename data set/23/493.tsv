2011-12-29T02:47:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam		Is there a possibility to block ip spoofing udp packages on ubuntu servers?
2011-12-29T02:48:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Probably using iptables, or maybe even UFW (firewall config tool)
2011-12-29T02:49:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	i tried iptables but all i know to block is ip adresses and the attacker uses each time another ip :( but i am looking for UFW and try that! thank you
2011-12-29T02:50:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	you mean spoofed public adresses
2011-12-29T02:50:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	There not much you can do about  it , just make sure all un nessasery deamons are shut down, and ports closed with iptables
2011-12-29T02:50:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	i host call of duty server and this servers have a bug to reply on spoofed ip packages to another ip adress. i want to stop that but i cant stop them all :(
2011-12-29T02:52:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	hmmm, all to the COD ip port?
2011-12-29T02:53:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	the attacker send a status command to the cod server with ip spoofing and the server reply to another server/ip with a complete status report ... :(
2011-12-29T02:54:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Thats crap, you cannot prevent that i am afraid if you run a public server, this is a COD problem, not fixable.
2011-12-29T02:55:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	The problem is that there is no way to determine if a ip packet is spoofed
2011-12-29T02:55:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	there is a inofficial fix for linux but i dont think its working 100%
2011-12-29T02:55:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Is it the same destination server?
2011-12-29T02:56:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Then you could block outgoing traffic to that server
2011-12-29T02:57:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	i hate your answer that i cannot determinate if a packet is spoofed, and the attack destination is another after about an hour
2011-12-29T02:57:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	so UFW is not a solution for my problem?
2011-12-29T02:58:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Sorry m8, thats one of the drawbacks of IP4
2011-12-29T02:58:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	did you install the fix already ?
2011-12-29T02:58:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	so i have no chance to block spoofed packets, i just can block too much connections ...
2011-12-29T02:59:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	yes i have, and it tells me every status message and if it is allowed or not
2011-12-29T03:00:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	if you are interested the fix for cod4 server can be found here: http://www.fpsadmin.com/forum/showthread.php?p=107462
2011-12-29T03:00:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Ill take a quick peek
2011-12-29T03:01:00.000Z	Ynodde	Uncle|Sam	Did you try the iptables commands they give in the forum?
2011-12-29T03:01:00.000Z	Uncle|Sam	Ynodde	yes and much more :P
