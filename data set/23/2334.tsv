2009-04-22T23:11:00.000Z	ShinyHat		could someone please explain to me how to search a folder on an xp machine over a network by filetype?
2009-04-22T23:13:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	how do you search?
2009-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	ShinyHat		i have been using the search button :|
2009-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	ShinyHat		perhaps that is not the right way to search?
2009-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	if you "mounted" it using the "Places > Connect to a server" it should be in ~/.gvfs
2009-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	you could also just type 'mount' in the terminal and see where it is mounted
2009-04-22T23:16:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	i mounted them to a folder in /home
2009-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: that would probably be my issue, then
2009-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	if it IS mounted, it should appear when you run mount with no params
2009-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	it appears, but as rolie just mentioned the search feature doesn't seem to support wildcards
2009-04-22T23:18:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: so how do i search for all files of a type?
2009-04-22T23:19:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: that seems a bit cumbersome to, for example, display all mp4s in a folder
2009-04-22T23:21:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	in nautilus you could add a filter to the results. click on the plus and you'll have a file type selection. just select "Videos"
2009-04-22T23:22:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: i guess i've been locked into windows too long- failing to see the obvious, simple solution. searching mp3 gave exactly what i was after
2009-04-22T23:22:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: i kinda feel silly now:-/
2009-04-22T23:23:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	no need to feel silly :) in the file type selection you have other as well with a list of specific types.
2009-04-22T23:23:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	thanks for that also. maybe after enough linux experience i will get it through my head that it doesnt have to be as difficult as i was used to
2009-04-22T23:24:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	you'll find it much more efficient after you'll tweak gnome to your needs :)
2009-04-22T23:25:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	and congrats for moving away from windows :D
2009-04-22T23:25:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	rolie: thank you both for the help!
2009-04-22T23:25:00.000Z	ShinyHat		lightpriest_:there are only 2 things left that keep me a bit bound to windows
2009-04-22T23:26:00.000Z	lightpriest_	ShinyHat	I bet I could find a replacement for them :P
2009-04-22T23:26:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	if you can help, i would be forever grateful- i use logmein for remote IT purposes, which seems to hate everything but activex
