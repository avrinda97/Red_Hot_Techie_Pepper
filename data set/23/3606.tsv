2009-03-17T02:39:00.000Z	ghindo		Is there any good program for Ubuntu that I can create animated gifs with?
2009-03-17T02:41:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	yes.. what is the source?
2009-03-17T02:41:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	Still pictures, like jpegs or png.
2009-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	lots of lots of them or a few?
2009-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	Let's say five or six
2009-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	ah... ok
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	I'm mostly just asking out of curiousity, I don't have a specific project I'm looking to tackle
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	you can try http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	actually there are lots of ways
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	Oh cool, I didn't know that GIMP could create gifs
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	mplayer will even do it from the command line
2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	that's normally when you have hundreds or thousands of them
2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	Huh, I'll have to read the tutorial and look into mplayer more.
2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	Thanks so much for the help!
2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	or you can just upload them to http://www.gickr.com/upload_files

2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	ghindo	just to cap off your irc experience.. can you guess how I found those answers ? :)
2009-03-17T02:45:00.000Z	ghindo	lesshaste	I suppose Google would be the obvious answer?
