2006-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	SoftIce		hello, please can somebody tell me if im on edgy how do I downgrade php
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	SoftIce		or do I have to install from source?
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	downgrade to what?
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	earlier version of php5
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	then you'll need to compile from source, yeah.  5.1 was in Dapper too, you know
2007-03-02T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	Edgy gets 18 month, Dapper gets 3 years, Edgy is four months after Dapper, so Dapper will be around for about a year longer
2007-03-02T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	Year.Month
2007-03-02T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	five years is "quite a bit"?
2007-03-02T13:29:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	assuming you're using only official repositories, fairly.
2007-03-02T13:31:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	You've got 16 months to schedule downtime
2007-06-20T14:32:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	they're now compiz.
2007-06-20T14:32:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	ahh, i see, and does Ubuntu have these packages in their source?
2007-06-20T14:34:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	I know it have Beryl, but wonder about screenlets, etc from compiz?
2007-06-20T14:34:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	or would that be a gutsy implementation wit the new gnome, etc?
2007-06-20T14:34:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	Ubuntu has compiz in main and beryl in universe.  The merge was announced after Feisty was released, so no changes have happened yet.  Not sure about gutsy.  Gutsy too seems to have them separate.  I'm not sure if compiz/beryl have completed (or even started the majority of) the merge
2007-06-20T14:35:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	I see, so screenlets in feisty is actually called compiz?
2007-06-20T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	eh?  What?
2007-06-20T14:36:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	i'll do a apt-cache show and have a look see
2007-06-20T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	as far as Ubuntu is concerned (for feisty, and whoknows hwo gutsy will turn out), theyre still completely separate projects
2007-06-20T14:37:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	thanks
2007-06-20T14:37:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	wonder how that will work with the upgrade, going to be alot of package removal/reinstallation i guess
2007-06-20T14:38:00.000Z	Flannel	SoftIce	no.  When it eventually happens, there'll just be transitional packages.  It'll all work out more orless.  Well, except the config files, since I imagine they're quite different.
2007-06-20T14:38:00.000Z	SoftIce	Flannel	true...
