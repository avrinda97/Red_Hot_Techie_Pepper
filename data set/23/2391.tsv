2009-09-16T15:22:00.000Z	zopiac		i set cron to shut down my computer at midnight (* 23 * * * shutdown) but it didn't shut down. Does anybody know perhaps why?
2009-09-16T15:22:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	Are you putting this into your or root's crontab?
2009-09-16T15:22:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	Also, 23 isn't midnight, it's one hour before (I think)
2009-09-16T15:24:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	right, i was thinking that since it uses 0-23 for its hour system it would be that 0=1, 23=24 (midnight) but that isnt right
2009-09-16T15:25:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	midnight is always 0:00
2009-09-16T15:26:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	how so?
2009-09-16T15:26:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	It uses a 24-hour clock. 11:20 is just before mid-day.
2009-09-16T15:26:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	or let me revise >_<
2009-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	Second, you forgot the time argument to shutdown.
2009-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	'shutdown now', like Chousuke already said.
2009-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	And third, this must be root's crontab - not your own.
2009-09-16T15:28:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	Try this command, 'type shutdown'
2009-09-16T15:28:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	It might be an alias or something.
2009-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	oh, well i guess its just for Arch linux then
2009-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	what's just for Arch linux?
2009-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	just having to type shutdown
2009-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	/sbin/shutdown always requires the time. (And I'm running Arch too.)
2009-09-16T15:31:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	well I know for a fact that here it doesn't. I asked you to check for aliases :|
2009-09-16T15:31:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	how?
2009-09-16T15:31:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	"type shutdown"
2009-09-16T15:31:00.000Z	zopiac	grawity	that would be on arch, right?
2009-09-16T15:32:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	yes.
2009-09-16T15:32:00.000Z	grawity	zopiac	are you running crontab -e as root?
