2011-12-03T00:37:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	I have it installed but I cant get to where I can add it
2011-12-03T00:39:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	try holding Super-key (Win Key) + Alt and right click
2011-12-03T00:41:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	doing win+alt right click gives me the same menu as right click
2011-12-03T00:41:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	Okay, it worked for me, there are lots of sites explaining how to replace unity with gnome3

2011-12-03T00:43:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	I have the ubuntu classic environment option
2011-12-03T00:43:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	I just cant add the top panel
2011-12-03T00:44:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	When I changed to classic, it had a top and bottom panel, I removed the bottom panel and put the windows at the top, is that what you desire?
2011-12-03T00:46:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	When you right click the existing panel with SuperKey (WinKey) + Alt, you should get a "New Panel" option
2011-12-03T00:47:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	on the bottom one, did you try to right click with the WinKey + Alt?
2011-12-03T00:48:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	I get move and remove from panel
2011-12-03T00:49:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	try clicking on the bottom panel where there are no open programs (empty space), the options should change then
2011-12-03T00:50:00.000Z	Weems	wimaxubuntu	thats where I clicked (on the left before the applications) and got move and remove from panel, the rest I get the same thing as right click
2011-12-03T00:50:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	try where you see the open windows but in the empty space there (near middle of bar)
2011-12-03T00:51:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	can you close some programs to make space?
2011-12-03T00:52:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	if you can get down to one program or two, scaling should stop
2011-12-03T00:53:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	i have to go now, do you have any further questions?
2011-12-03T00:54:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	Sorry, I meant "New Panel" its in the right click drop down
2011-12-03T00:54:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	then on the new panel, special right click with properties, and change orientation
2011-12-03T00:55:00.000Z	wimaxubuntu	Weems	Did I lose you somewhere?
