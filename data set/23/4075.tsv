2007-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	can you not boot into windows and to a file system check?
2007-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	when i try booting into windows, it hangs and restarts
2007-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	it also runs disk checks
2007-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	ntfs or fat32?
2007-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	ntfs
2007-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	is your linux partition on the same physical drive?
2007-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	no i put it on a separate physical drive
2007-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	did you run a SMART check?
2007-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	i am unfamiliar with SMART checks, how would i run one?
2007-11-19T15:46:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	okay do this. sudo apt-get install smartmontools
2007-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	ok i got that
2007-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	sudo smartctl -Hc [yourwindowsdiskhere]
2007-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	yeah is that the name of it?
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	i tried it and it outputted alot of data
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	oh it says it passed
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	okay so then the drive is not physically damaged
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	that is good. So there's an error in the partition
2007-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	im not sure if theres an error but i just cant figure out how to mount it, and all the fixes i have tried have not worked
2007-11-19T15:53:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	but your windows partition does not boot yes?
2007-11-19T15:53:00.000Z	wally_	eckesicle	yes something is wrong with it
2007-11-19T15:55:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	i dont know how to check a ntfs disk from linux, probably fsck won't work
2007-11-19T15:59:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	what error do you get when trying to mount?
2007-11-19T16:02:00.000Z	eckesicle	wally_	you can always try a force mount
