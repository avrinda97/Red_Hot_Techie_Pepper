2005-11-21T15:21:00.000Z	fdr		hello! I don't like rythmbox much... Could you please suggest me some other music library mgmt application to try out? It needs to run under gnome... thank you!
2005-11-21T15:23:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	install amaroK
2005-11-21T15:24:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	: I'd like to, but I don't feel like installing tons of kde libs...
2005-11-21T15:24:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	it's worth it
2005-11-21T15:25:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	besides, then you can use K3B too :)
2005-11-21T15:25:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	why not switch to kubuntu, then? :-)
2005-11-21T15:26:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	those two apps alone are worth putting the kde libs, so you can still run gnome but have the two best "other" apps
2005-11-21T15:26:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	because KDE sucks
2005-11-21T15:36:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	could you please give me a hint about how do I get amarok to play mp3 files? It seems to be a codec problem, or something like that
2005-11-21T15:37:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	hmmm, you already have all the codecs?
2005-11-21T15:37:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	well, rythmbox and xmms and beep-media-player work fine, so I guess so
2005-11-21T15:38:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	then you shouldn't need anything else, let me look at mine...
2005-11-21T15:39:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	I don't see anything in particular to configure in amaroK for mp3, and IIRC there was nothing to do but install it and fire it up.
2005-11-21T15:39:00.000Z	misfit_toy		anybody else here have a pointer for amarok and mp3's?
2005-11-21T15:39:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	did you install amarok or amarok-gstreamer ?
2005-11-21T15:39:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	just amarok
2005-11-21T15:40:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	hmm let me try, then, I went for amarok-gstreamer
2005-11-21T15:41:00.000Z	misfit_toy		necrophilia?
2005-11-21T15:42:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	lemme know what happens
2005-11-21T15:43:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	sure I will
2005-11-21T15:49:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	very strange. apt-getting amarok leads to the install of the very same packages as did amarok-gstreamer, yet this time it works out of the box
2005-11-21T16:05:00.000Z	fdr	misfit_toy	btw, did you also manage to have amarok retrieve an mp3 details by using musicbrainz? For every file I try, it says it can't find it in the musicbrainz database... Thanks!
2005-11-21T16:07:00.000Z	misfit_toy	fdr	amarok has it's own database IIRC
