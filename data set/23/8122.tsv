2005-02-03T15:45:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	spiral	sip is the generic protocol for doing things like internet telephony.  you can use any server you like, even your own, to host your sip address.

2005-02-03T15:45:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		you can buy an sip phone if you like, that looks like a regular phone.
