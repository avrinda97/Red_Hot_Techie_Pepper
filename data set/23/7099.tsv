2006-12-02T16:53:00.000Z	gleesond		so I'm trying to install edgy from CD and when I go into the run/install it goes though the ubuntu loadinng screen but the it dissapears, and the screen goes black never to return
2006-12-02T16:53:00.000Z	gleesond		I've tried to go into graphics safe mode to no avail
2006-12-02T16:54:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	huh, now that is interesting. I'd search for your video card or your system model in the Ubuntu forums.
2006-12-02T16:58:00.000Z	gleesond	javaJake	I'm not seeing anthing in the forums about my issue, can you offer anyother suggestions?
2006-12-02T17:00:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	besides Google, and making your own thread at the Ubuntu forums, no.
2006-12-02T17:00:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	where there are no answers to be found, none can be given.
2006-12-02T17:00:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	IOW, if searching doesn't work, then I can't help beyond that. Others may know, I don't.
2006-12-03T17:39:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	yes, when you see the "3, 2, 1" countdown on startup, hit ESC, and choose recovery mode.
2006-12-03T17:40:00.000Z	gleesond	javaJake	I never see a "1 2 3" count down with this live disk
2006-12-03T17:40:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	right right
2006-12-03T17:41:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	when you get in the live cd, you should see something like "F6 Other Options".
2006-12-03T17:41:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	when you get that, erase the "--" and "quiet" and "splash" and type in "single".
2006-12-03T17:42:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	then punch enter. Basically, you manually told the livecd to run recovery mode.
2006-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	alright, try apt-getting the fglrx driver
2006-12-03T17:49:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	oh, ok
2006-12-03T17:53:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	yes!
2006-12-03T17:54:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	don't get too happy! edgy'll dash your hopes in a moment.
2006-12-03T17:55:00.000Z	gleesond	javaJake	where is the install script on the live cd?
2006-12-03T17:55:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	lol, why?
2006-12-03T17:55:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	you should be able to install straight from gnome
2006-12-03T17:56:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	I recommend typing Ctrl+Alt+F1, killing gnome, and typing exit.
2006-12-03T17:58:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	alright!
2006-12-03T17:58:00.000Z	javaJake	gleesond	I TOLD you X would complain. :D
