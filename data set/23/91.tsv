2012-07-27T03:55:00.000Z	usr13	aeiaya	Sounds like you have another application running that uses apt.  Look and see.

2012-07-27T03:55:00.000Z	usr13	aeiaya	Do you have the Update Manager open?

2012-07-27T03:57:00.000Z	usr13	aeiaya	If it is update-manager, you could try: sudo pkill update-manager
2012-07-27T03:57:00.000Z	usr13	aeiaya	But it may leave the lock file if you do.
