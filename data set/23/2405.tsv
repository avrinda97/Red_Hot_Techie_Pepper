2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	vMCubun		why doesn't firestarter even install? gufw seems a little too crude and too dependent on knowing rules
2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	vMCubun		why is it in gufw thre is NO rules?
2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	vMCubun		not even tings like "block all incoming"?
2009-11-10T23:21:00.000Z	vMCubun		i dont ened to worry about people on my computer doing anything dodgy, ill be the only oen using it
2009-11-10T23:21:00.000Z	vMCubun		but stopping people accessing form outside is paramount

2009-11-10T23:26:00.000Z	iceroot	vMCubun	use a normal ubuntu-installation and keep it up to date. that is safe enough
2009-11-10T23:28:00.000Z	iceroot	vMCubun	use apticron
2009-11-10T23:28:00.000Z	iceroot	vMCubun	its checking for updates and send a mail if found some
2009-11-10T23:28:00.000Z	iceroot	vMCubun	also get in the security mailings-lists
2009-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	iceroot	vMCubun	write a script for ifup thats doing the check
