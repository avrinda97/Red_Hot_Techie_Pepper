2011-03-10T04:31:00.000Z	Cody3290		Does ubuntu get viruses? And by get, I mean often?
2011-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Sure. You can get it -- but it can't hurt you.
2011-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Viruses are crafted for Windows.
2011-03-10T04:33:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	I'm saying... Welcome to linux. :)
2011-03-10T04:38:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	You're behind your neighbor's router. You're "safe"
2011-03-10T05:08:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	You probably will be confined to stay back for 10 more years.
2011-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Reject -- Reject all incoming packets
2011-03-10T06:43:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Deny -- Allow all incoming packet -- but report as reject all incoming packets.
2011-03-10T06:43:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Something like that. :o
2011-03-10T06:43:00.000Z	Cody3290	red2kic	Repot as reject? To me, or to the person/server sending the packets?
2011-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	From what I'm reading. It looks like "Deny" is ignoring the packets where "Reject" will reject the packets -- The sender would know the packets got rejected as opposed to no responsive.
2011-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	You ask a girl out for a date. She rejected you. You acknowledge it.
2011-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	You ask a girl out for a date. She deny "ignore" you. You aren't sure.
2011-03-10T22:14:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	gedit (default) is nice. geany. there are few handfuls. You should try it until you find something you like it.
2011-03-10T22:15:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	vim is probably the champion -- but you'll have to learn so much before you're able to use it. :P
2011-03-10T22:16:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Bluefish, I think.
2011-03-10T22:23:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Try them both. Decide which one you like better.
2011-03-10T22:24:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Understood. I never had tried them both. I stick it with gedit/geany. ;)
2011-03-10T22:37:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	We're talking about Bluefish?
2011-03-10T22:38:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Go ahead. Obtain it from the repository. Less headache this way -- Instead of compiling.
2011-03-10T22:41:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	You're new. A slightly out-of-dated-but-stable-nevertheless KomPozer should be okay.
2011-03-11T22:04:00.000Z	red2kic	Cody3290	Yes.
