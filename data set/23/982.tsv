2010-11-07T03:42:00.000Z	dcyber09		anyone could help me to re-install apache2 ? by mistake ive deleted /var/www dir, wanna re-install but after apt-get install apche2, it said newly installed
2010-11-07T03:42:00.000Z	dcyber09		any idea
2010-11-07T03:43:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	mkdir /var/www/htdocs?
2010-11-07T03:43:00.000Z	dcyber09	MagusOTB	: no, ive uninstalled it,
2010-11-07T03:43:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	uninstalled apache2 or deleted /var/www, because apache doesn't actually pyt anything in /var/www
2010-11-07T03:44:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	how did you uninstall it?
2010-11-07T03:47:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	it might, but an apache install doesn't put anything there except the default "it works!" page. you can easily remake it with mkdir
2010-11-07T03:49:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	what says that. Firefox?

2010-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	you mean .asp as in the .net scripting language?
2010-11-07T08:04:00.000Z	MagusOTB	dcyber09	I think mono can do ASP, but I have no idea what package and configs would make your HTTPD use it.
