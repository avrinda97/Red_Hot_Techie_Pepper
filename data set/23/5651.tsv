2007-02-18T09:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		hey guys what does "fsck died" with exit status fail mean
2007-02-18T09:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	sounds like it was doing a check during boot, and encountered problems.  did you just get this?  might have to boot from cd and manually fsck your drive
2007-02-18T09:12:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	well when I was In win my comp locked up while playing a game and I had to reset
2007-02-18T09:13:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	sounds like it hit an error during the reboot.  got your livecd handy?
2007-02-18T09:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	then when I booted ubuntu I got that error
2007-02-18T09:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	yep, I'll be back In a mo
2007-02-18T09:13:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	ok
2007-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	ok Im on the LiveCD
2007-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	wb :)
2007-02-18T09:24:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	ok, which drive did it fail on?
2007-02-18T09:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	i only have 1 now, ahh hd0 ithink
2007-02-18T09:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	hda1
2007-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	ok.  from a prompt, use this command:  sudo fsck -f -C /dev/hda1
2007-02-18T09:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	i know ur busy but out of interest what do the -f -c switches do
2007-02-18T09:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	-f forces a check.  -C gives  you that nice little progress bar :)
2007-02-18T09:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	everything appears to have passed
2007-02-18T09:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	there's no other partitions on the machine?
2007-02-18T09:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	the windowsxp one
2007-02-18T09:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	ok, if it didn't error out, your next boot should be just fine.  any problems it found were corrected without user intervention :)
2007-02-18T09:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	is there anyway to check the win partition using the ubuntu livecd
2007-02-18T09:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	is it an NTFS drive?
2007-02-18T09:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	SilentDis	i have ntfs write
2007-02-18T09:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	Paddy_EIRE	the live CD doesn't ;)  you can check it next you're in your main system (without the live cd) by unmounting the drive and doing the same command
