2004-11-02T17:50:00.000Z	bronson		If nobody else has done it by the time I get back, I might do it.  ;)
2004-11-02T17:51:00.000Z	bronson		thanks!
2004-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	bronson		(I mean, I don't mind you applying changes to the pages)
2004-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	bronson		You might get rid of the make-kpkg page -- I just don't see how that technique is useful when we've got dpkg-buildpackage and byhand.
2004-11-02T06:18:00.000Z	bronson		Or move it to a dusty corner of the wiki...
2004-11-02T06:19:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	umm, only to distribute over your domain I guess  :/   they are usually simular hardware  :/
2004-11-02T06:20:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	??
2004-11-02T06:20:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	thats the purpose... compile once for all your clients...
2004-11-02T06:21:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	well, sure.  It's just that dpkg-buildpackage is a lot easier, and by hand is a lot more flexible.
2004-11-02T06:21:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	make-kpkg is just as flexable as byhand...
2004-11-02T06:22:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	it just does the make commands for you  :/
2004-11-02T06:23:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	make-kpkg = one command... byhand *can be*
2004-11-02T06:24:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	by hand: "make modules_install install"
2004-11-02T06:25:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	don't forget to add "--revision=blah"
2004-11-02T06:25:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	make-kpkg requires configure too.
2004-11-02T06:25:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	I didn't [name]  = --revision
2004-11-02T06:26:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	thats the point... its the "Debian Way"  :/
2004-11-02T06:26:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	I'd argue that dpkg-buildpackage is the Debian way.  Or it ought to be.
2004-11-02T06:27:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	/j #debian-bots, /msg dpkg kp
2004-11-02T06:27:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	those are the instructions I wrote the make-kpkg wiki page from.
2004-11-02T06:28:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	you should host a bot from there  :)
2004-12-13T16:19:00.000Z	|trey|	bronson	being sarcastic?
2004-12-13T16:20:00.000Z	bronson	|trey|	not at all -- automounting the CF card rules.
