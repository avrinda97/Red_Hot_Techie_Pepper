2004-11-06T06:34:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	just follow the howtos, you should be fine
2004-11-06T06:39:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	do you know how to use synaptic?
2004-11-06T06:40:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	do you have universe?
2004-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	i think all the files are on universe. which ones you dont find?
2004-11-06T06:44:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	i have bison, bison++ and bison-1.35
2004-11-06T06:44:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	just in case, install all of them :)
2004-11-06T06:45:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	check the repositories
2004-11-06T06:45:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	in the section you should have "main restricted universe multiverse"

2004-11-06T06:53:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	look for xlibmesa
2004-11-06T06:55:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	im not sure, so its better if you try to build it and see if there are any errors
2004-11-06T07:32:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	you should restart x after installing the drivers :)
2004-11-06T07:33:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	im not sure if cs source runs in linux...

2004-11-06T07:34:00.000Z	cardador	dayson	im afraid it wont run :(
2004-11-06T07:34:00.000Z	dayson	cardador	what about third party games like natural selection?
