2007-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	rodney_		anyone know much about setting up agere lucent modems
2007-01-26T08:47:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	hmm winmodems think there might be a wiki page on it let me check
2007-01-26T08:47:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	check here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
2007-01-26T08:53:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	ive done everything it says but the file etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules doesnt have the blue sqare box on it like the rest of the rules in the rule.d file has
2007-01-26T08:54:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	hmm what blue box for what editor?
2007-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	umm those files shouldn't have a blue box in them since they are just text files probably the blue box is used to show you what is needed to be editted
2007-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	like the file in rules.d cd-aliases.rules has a blue box top right corner with a white arrow
2007-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	what editor are you using? gedit?
2007-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	let me look at what i did on that
2007-01-26T08:57:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	do i need to use gedit to make that file
2007-01-26T08:58:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	if the file isn't made you can use gedit to make it since I know the udev rules are just text files I m looking at my ubuntu system and I don't see any blue boxes which is why I am confused
2007-01-26T09:01:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	all my files except the one i created 10-local.rules for my modem in /etc/udev/rules.d all the rest has a blue box unknown to this newb to ubuntu what they are either fresh setup
2007-01-26T09:02:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	but just follow the howto that you have and it should still work
2007-01-26T09:03:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	i did
2007-01-26T09:04:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	i think it has something to do with symlink
2007-01-26T09:04:00.000Z	kitche	rodney_	maybe but I have never seen what your talking about so I can't really understand what you see if you know what I mean
2007-01-26T09:07:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	thanx for the help
2007-01-26T09:08:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	now i remember it is not associted

2007-01-26T09:09:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	all those other files are but not the one i created
2007-01-26T09:10:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	i should have said link target
2007-01-26T09:11:00.000Z	rodney_	kitche	there is no link target on the file i created
