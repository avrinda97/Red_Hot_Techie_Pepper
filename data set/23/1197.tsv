2010-08-05T01:00:00.000Z	haresh		hello please help No package 'gstreamer-0.10' found
2010-08-05T01:00:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	have you tried installing that package?
2010-08-05T01:01:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	are you compiling something?
2010-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	yes, you're missing a dependancy, so you need to install that first
2010-08-05T01:03:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	i'm actually not sure what the exact name of that package is, but try: libgstreamermm-0.10-dev
2010-08-05T01:04:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	i think 'pidgin' is the best
2010-08-05T01:05:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	if you're just looking for a msn client, then just install: pidgin
2010-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	yes, there are more out there, just give them a try if you like
2010-08-05T01:07:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	the repositories often have older (but stable) versions of the software
2010-08-05T01:07:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	if you really want the newer versions, you'll have to either compile, or better, add another repo for that particular software
2010-08-05T01:09:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	how are you installing it? with synaptic?
2010-08-05T01:11:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	it should resolve the dependencies, does it not do that?
2010-08-05T01:12:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	well it should, which .deb did you download? link?
2010-08-05T01:13:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	hmm, that's the right .deb
2010-08-05T01:14:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	lemme see
2010-08-05T01:15:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	i found the PPA with the newest version of Emesene: http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/10.04#how_to_install
2010-08-05T01:16:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	just add that PPA, and you'll be able to download Emesene with Synaptic
2010-08-05T01:17:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	you won't need the deb if you use the PPA instead
2010-08-05T01:17:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	if you use the PPA, Emesene will also automatically update itself
2010-08-05T01:20:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	what package? getdeb?
2010-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	then follow from step 2
2010-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	the manual way
2010-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	figure002	haresh	or what pradeep said
