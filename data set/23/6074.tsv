2009-02-18T00:32:00.000Z	danub		ok, i read the grub docs but i cant figure this out
2009-02-18T00:32:00.000Z	danub		i set it to the right drive, but it wont load. it just says "starting" and hangs there indefinately
2009-02-18T00:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	How many hard drives
2009-02-18T00:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	are you mixing ide and sata?
2009-02-18T00:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	mixing them can really mess with boot sequences
2009-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	how may os's
2009-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	if you plan on doing multiple to play with a few, setup a /boot partition
2009-02-18T00:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	one sec, we can fix that
2009-02-18T00:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && pastebinit /boot/grub/menu.lst       (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2009-02-18T00:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	or paste it manually into the pastebin website
2009-02-18T00:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	ty
2009-02-18T00:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	http://pastebin.com/d670db794         see the edit at the end
2009-02-18T00:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	If it isnt booting with it looking at the one drive, easy test to point it to the other drive.. assuming that is correct
2009-02-18T00:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	understood, but mixing drives can cause issues.. one sec,.. another edit

2009-02-18T00:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	grub hd1,0     gives you ubuntu correct
2009-02-18T00:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	try my menu list and see where it finds windows
2009-02-18T00:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	I am aware of how hard drives are numbered
2009-02-18T00:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	I understand, but mixing ide and sata can mess with those numbers and orders.  You have a way that will let you find out
2009-02-18T00:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	add a fifth drive to your windows list
2009-02-18T00:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	yes, which is why I made entries in   your menu for all the possibilities
2009-02-18T00:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	good luck
2009-02-18T01:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	danub	sorry, cant help you further .. I need to run soon
