2004-10-02T07:43:00.000Z	stratus		perl and python? both coded in C
2004-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	yojimbo-san	stratus	Indeed - but as a *user* I don't have to use GNU project tools ...
2004-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		And if it was compiled on an Intel box should that be Intel/GNU/Linux?
2004-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		:-)
2004-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	stratus	yojimbo-san	right
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		are you using kde?
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		nope
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		gnome?
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		http://www.gnome.org/about/
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		I've just loaded Ubunto in the last 30 mins for the forst time ...
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		wow
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		Oh, yep, I see what you mean ...
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		deja vu
2004-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	stratus		I've loaded that url on my browser and come back here and wow deja vu.
2004-10-02T07:46:00.000Z	stratus	yojimbo-san	back on the subject np but you're using GNU tools in a way or another.
2004-10-02T07:47:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		Well, yes I am (I also choose to use some GNU project tools)
2004-10-02T07:47:00.000Z	stratus		:)
2004-10-02T07:48:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		but I also use a huge set of non-GNU stuff.
2004-10-02T07:48:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		I believe that I use more non-GNU stuff, but allow that the GNU tools are *essential*
2004-10-02T07:48:00.000Z	stratus	yojimbo-san	i see.
2004-10-02T07:50:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		I still haven't figured out how to make a program "A GNU project" - it's not the name (gnuplot, anyone) or the license (there are non-GPL gnu project programs, according to their webpage). And I certainly don't know how to make RMS happy :-)
2004-10-02T07:51:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		"then we'll be free, hackers, we'll be free" ...
2004-10-02T07:51:00.000Z	stratus	yojimbo-san	it isn't so easy but if you want you can start with a project at savannah.
