2009-05-27T22:55:00.000Z	resno		how do i copy a file off a server? do i use scp?
2009-05-27T22:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	depends if the server is running ssh (for scp) or if they have ftp, etc...
2009-05-27T22:56:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	yes it runs scp
2009-05-27T22:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	then that's probably the best tool for copying files off it :)  good luck.  man scp
2009-05-27T22:57:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	k, ill work with that
2009-05-27T22:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	a very cool terminal command to learn about it something called screen - there are even terminal bittorrent clients that together with screen take close to 0 CPU cycles.  the terminal is very powerful.
2009-05-27T23:00:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	screen? ill look into that
2009-05-27T23:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	screen lets you keep a terminal running even when your not logged in... have fun.
2010-02-09T07:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	"ls -l /home/bryan/.nano_history"
2010-02-09T07:06:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	root root
2010-02-09T07:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	is your username bryan?  "sudo chown bryan:bray /home/bryan/.nano_history"
2010-02-09T07:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	that second bray is a typo obviously
2010-08-13T09:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	pwd = present work directory, did you mean passwd?
2010-08-13T09:03:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	heh, yes i did thanks :)
2010-08-13T09:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	wubi makes ubuntu rely on windows - does that sound like a good idea to you?
2011-01-08T01:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	"date 'now'" doesn't appear to be a valid command for date
2011-01-08T01:36:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	echo $(date -d now) >  $ShortTerm thats what im donig
2011-01-08T01:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	"date -d now" is the same as "date"
2011-01-08T01:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	you certainly don't need the "echo" as milamber points out
2011-01-08T01:39:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	heh, i tried without echo and it failed, so i thought that would make it speak
2011-01-08T01:40:00.000Z	resno	ZykoticK9	milamber let me get my script on dpaste
2011-01-08T01:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	for one thing - using > multiple times means only the last thing will be in the output file -- use >> to append.  Taking out your rsync lines leaves the date in the files.
2011-01-08T01:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	resno	i was too slow - thank trism ;)
