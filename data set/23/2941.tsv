2009-11-13T07:18:00.000Z	gbear14275	Billiard	I'm sorry but I didn't realized I lied... what did I lie about?
2009-11-13T07:18:00.000Z	Billiard	gbear14275	its a exe not a sda
2009-11-13T07:19:00.000Z	gbear14275	Billiard	ah... ok sorry...  any way to open it without wine?  Hate to be picky...
2009-11-13T07:21:00.000Z	Billiard	gbear14275	there may be a way to locate the compressed file within the exe, but only bother with that if wine doesnt work
2009-11-13T07:23:00.000Z	gbear14275	Billiard	oh yeah... one more question sorry... whats the difference between the wine meta package and the wine 1.2 package?
2009-11-13T07:23:00.000Z	Billiard	gbear14275	probably nothing
