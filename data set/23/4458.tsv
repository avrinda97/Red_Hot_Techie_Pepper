2007-08-09T06:11:00.000Z	Xoris	WindsofTime	what he meant is that you can just remove the directories. indeed, you can, though (as in real Windows) that may leave registry entries, files in /Windows, and such. use the uninstaller if you don't want that
2007-08-09T06:11:00.000Z	Xoris	WindsofTime	just type "installer", or "uninstaller", or whatever it's called... there is a WINE-specific command, i just don't remember the exact name
