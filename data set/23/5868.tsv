2008-01-21T14:33:00.000Z	pau1		anyone know how to get an iPod working in Ubuntu?
2008-01-21T14:33:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	look for Banshee
2008-01-21T14:34:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	will it work?
2008-01-21T14:34:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	doesn't do playlists yet, but otherwise works fine
2008-01-21T14:34:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	 there is a page describing how to do it, but yes, it does work
2008-01-21T14:36:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	banshee does work
2008-01-21T14:38:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	I cannot see the iPod in Banshee
2008-01-21T14:38:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	did you follow the instructions on that page?
2008-01-21T14:39:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	ok I unplugged it and plugged it back in and its there.... now I will try to add music to it
2008-01-21T14:39:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	can I make playlists in banshee?
2008-01-21T14:40:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	not yet, as I already said
2008-01-21T14:44:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	banshee lets me copy music but its not there when I eject the device
2008-01-21T14:45:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	are you synchronizing the Ipod and using the "sync with library option"? (vs the save manual changes)
2008-01-21T14:45:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	no... I did with the manual settings
2008-01-21T14:46:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	not sure what that does ... maybe syncs the ipod with the pc using the ipod as the source
2008-01-21T14:46:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	should I sync the library?
2008-01-21T14:47:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	I am doing the syncing with the library and now its saying Waiting for transcoder
2008-01-21T14:48:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	maybe your files are not in MP3?
2008-01-21T14:48:00.000Z	grigora	pau1	so it has to convert them to mp3 before it can put them on the iPod
2008-01-21T14:49:00.000Z	pau1	grigora	argh.... it seems there are files on the iPod
