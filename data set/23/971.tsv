2010-11-19T13:10:00.000Z	karthick87		I am getting this error while installing packages "Waiting for other software manager to quit"..Can anyone help?
2010-11-19T13:11:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	do you have synaptic ot the ubuntu software center open?
2010-11-19T13:11:00.000Z	karthick87		roccirt_: Nope
2010-11-19T13:11:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	Nope
2010-11-19T13:12:00.000Z	roccity_		then it maybe a lock. check in system-->Administration-->system monitor
2010-11-19T13:12:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	look under processes
2010-11-19T13:13:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	anything that says apt-get or synaptic?
2010-11-19T13:14:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	I have checked but no such process
2010-11-19T13:17:00.000Z	roccity_		well you can open a terminal and type as root rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2010-11-19T13:17:00.000Z	roccity_		br carefulo using root though
2010-11-19T13:18:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	this should remove the lock that you are talking about
2010-11-19T13:26:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	Thank you :)
2010-11-19T13:26:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	did it work?
2010-11-19T13:27:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	was it a lock
2010-11-19T13:27:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	Yes that did the trick
2010-11-19T13:28:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	cool no prob
2010-11-19T13:28:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	Actually what the above command will do?
2010-11-19T13:30:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	huh what the rm .... command?
2010-11-19T13:30:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	yes
2010-11-19T13:30:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	it removes any lock on dpkg that you might have
2010-11-19T13:31:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	because you can only run one instance of apt-get
2010-11-19T13:31:00.000Z	roccity_	karthick87	so if this crashes or whatever it might leave the lock on and just shut down the gui or whatever
2010-11-19T13:32:00.000Z	karthick87	roccity_	fine :)
