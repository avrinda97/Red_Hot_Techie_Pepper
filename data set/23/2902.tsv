2010-07-07T13:31:00.000Z	kokozedman		hey guys,
2010-07-07T13:31:00.000Z	kokozedman		is there a way to synchronize the time between 2 ubuntu computers?
2010-07-07T13:32:00.000Z	kokozedman		like make them the same time… it does not matter if it following a correct NTP server or not
2010-07-07T13:32:00.000Z	kokozedman		i need them to be on the very same exact time, at least for few minutes
2010-07-07T13:33:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	How precise do you need them to be?
2010-07-07T13:33:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	just as precisely the same as posible
2010-07-07T13:33:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	If you need that level of accuracy, perhaps you should have them both peer with a stratum 2 time source.
2010-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	i have no idea what you're talking about… could you give a hint or a link?
2010-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	install ntp on both machines and set them to peer with a few external time sources.
2010-07-07T13:35:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	ok… i'll try that
2010-07-07T13:36:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	what package should i install to get the ntp server?
2010-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	It's pretty easy.  Use apt-get and install ntp.  Open the config file and use the examples within, to peer with a few (at least 3) external time sources.  I think the package name is just, "ntp."
2010-07-07T13:38:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	You may even be able to get away with using ntpdate to dicipline your clock but since ntpdate is sort of a, "one-shot" deal, you would have to call it on a regular basis (like maybe every 30 minutes, depending on the accuracy of your hwclock).
2010-07-07T13:39:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	isn't it possible to have only 1 server being an NTP server, and the second one syncing from it? the reason is that i'm about 600 ms away from the world (slow satellite) with random delay of packets and the clock never gets right atomically because of that
2010-07-07T13:41:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	The problem you will run into is this.  The time source (one of your boxes) will not have accurate time because it isn't peering with a reasonably low stratum source.  NTP is smart enough to know this and because of it, it will refuse to allow other sources to sync with it.
2010-07-07T13:42:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	You could set one box to peer with external sources and then have your other box just peer with your first.  That should work fine too.
2010-07-07T13:44:00.000Z	kokozedman	rob_p	i have installed NTP on the first server; by "peering" do you mean this command: ntpdate 192.168.139.128 (address of the first server)
2010-07-07T13:45:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	You configure it in ntp.conf, I believe.  ntpdate is just a command line utility for doing a, "one-shot" time sync with some source.
2010-07-07T13:46:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	But like I said, ntpdate may work for you depending on how often you call it, and how accurate your hardware clock is.
2010-07-07T13:46:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	If you need better than 10ms accuracy, I'd go strictly ntp.
2010-07-07T13:48:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	So, in a nutshell, install ntp on the, "server" box and then configure it to peer with several external sources.  On the second box, either systematically call ntpdate <IP.OF.SERVER.BOX>, or just install ntp on it as well and configure it to peer with the server.
2010-07-07T13:50:00.000Z	rob_p	kokozedman	I feel your pain on the latency associated with satellite connectivity.  I've had to live for months at a time on those! :-|
