2005-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	yes. You shouldn't upgrade without it.
2005-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	see /topic
2005-10-19T08:42:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	i read the note before the page get update "what the install ubuntu-desktop last one" and i read it now after the change and it on the first step what should i do ?
2005-10-19T08:43:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	am upgrade from 5.04 to breezy-rc
2005-10-19T08:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	I think you mean breezy official; not rc :P
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	is there a diff ?
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	butween the RC and the Official one ?
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	you can't upgrade to RC anyway unless you have the RC cd
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	bugfixes, final tweaks etc etc
2005-10-19T08:45:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	i mean diff on install ubuntu-desktop on first or on last step on do the upgrade
2005-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	have you not read the link? :) Dist-upgrade needs ubuntu-desktop to appropriately determine the packages to keep/install
2005-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	thank you
2005-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	erm, no; it's not really heading to that simplicity
2005-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	the stress is on usability and accessibility moreso; not sacrificing features for simplicity =)
2005-11-08T17:43:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	i read something on kde developer about the lesson from mac i see it will like what on gnome today!
2005-11-08T17:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	it's using Mac as an inspiration, but it's hardly copying it (and this has been an oft-stressed point). But I didn't see how you got to gnome; gnome is nothing like Mac
2005-11-08T17:46:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	yes that what i mean insiration some idea from mac "realy i like it"
2006-06-06T12:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	foxiness	encounter a lot of problems ;-)
2006-06-06T12:49:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	plz do not say that
2006-06-06T12:50:00.000Z	foxiness	apokryphos	:(
