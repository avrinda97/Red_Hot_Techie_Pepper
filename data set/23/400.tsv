2011-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	ntaiyl		hi guys, wanted some help, tried a lot of things, can't seem to use my printer :(
2011-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	ntaiyl		I have a canon lbp2900B printer. I installed the drivers mentioned on the site (cndrvcups-capt and cndrvcups-common_2.30).
2011-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	ntaiyl		Now the printer is connected, I installed it via the GUI, and using lpstat the printer does show.
2011-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	ntaiyl		Now whenever I give a printing job it doesn't print. What do I do

2011-10-09T11:27:00.000Z	ntaiyl	fullmetal	I've done that. The drivers are installed and the printer does show up. It is connected. The printing also takes in job queues, just keeps them in a processing state and does not print
2011-10-09T11:28:00.000Z	fullmetal		reboot after the install?
2011-10-09T11:28:00.000Z	fullmetal		@ntaiyl
