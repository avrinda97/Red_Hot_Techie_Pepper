2011-02-07T06:00:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	you do know that you can use the LiveCD to try ubuntu without installing, right?
2011-02-07T06:08:00.000Z	Vustom	thorbj0rn	- Yeah, I've got the CD, but.. I know if I use Ubuntu I will never go back to windows :D
2011-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	you can also _install_ applications that aren't already included in the CD, and they will disappear once you reboot to windows :D
2011-02-07T06:10:00.000Z	Vustom	thorbj0rn	o
2011-02-07T06:10:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	it installs to memory... no writing to CD
2011-02-07T06:13:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	Gimp and Inkscape
2011-02-07T06:14:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	http://www.winehq.com/appdb/ will probably tell you
2011-02-07T06:14:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	derrr... http://appdb.winehq.com
2011-02-07T06:18:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	notepad++ does not show up in a Software Center search... there are no shortages of text editors, rich text formatters, and programming language aware editors for linux.
2011-02-07T08:09:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	that downloads alsa-info.sh from their site, and runs it with the bash shell
2011-02-07T08:09:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	... just boot to the liveCD and test..
2011-02-07T08:10:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	i would say you have a 90% chance of your realtek card running out of the box
2011-02-07T08:10:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	you don't need nearly as many drivers as you think you do.
2011-02-07T08:13:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	did you miss my previous several mentions of LIVECD?
2011-02-07T08:13:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	you don't have to install it to see if it works.
2011-02-07T08:15:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	before you spend any more time gathering useless drivers, boot to the cd in live mode; i implore you.
2011-02-07T08:15:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	once you see the beauty of it, you will start collecting liveCDs like they are going out of style.
2011-02-07T08:35:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	if you are going to reformat/install both OS, do windows first, then ubuntu; windows has a nasty habit of brutalizing grub/bootloader
2011-02-07T08:40:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	not really necessary.
2011-02-07T08:41:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	you should only be worried about av software when you are sharing with winblows machines
2011-02-07T08:43:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	check the software center before going out to individual websites.. the packages offered in the software center have been vetted for use in ubuntu, and (generally) work fine after installation
2011-02-07T08:44:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	even nvidia proprietary drivers should be available automatically
2011-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	Vustom	those drivers/etc will install even in LiveCD mode. so you will see immediate results
