2008-09-19T16:37:00.000Z	orgthingy		but yea, downloading from ubuntu may be good
2008-09-19T16:37:00.000Z	orgthingy		but, what if ubuntu repo doesnt have it :P
2008-09-19T16:37:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	what app are we talking about?
2008-09-19T16:37:00.000Z	orgthingy	jim_p	 : flash
2008-09-19T16:38:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	if it is not on the ubuntu repo, then it will be on some other guy's repo
2008-09-19T16:38:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	you want to install flashplayer 10?
2008-09-19T16:38:00.000Z	orgthingy	jim_p	: or, it'll be on nobody's repo.. instead, download from site :P ?
2008-09-19T16:39:00.000Z	orgthingy	jim_p	: no no, scroll up and you'd understand
2008-09-19T16:39:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	i cant, i just entered the channel!
2008-09-19T16:39:00.000Z	orgthingy	jim_p	: I was arguing with Pici that discouraging downloading stuff from official site is BAD.. i mean, sooner or later Ubuntu repo cant just simply put all apps in repo
2008-09-19T16:40:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	true
2008-10-14T21:15:00.000Z	jim_p	orgthingy	ubuntu 8.10 had newer kernel from 8.04 since it was... born?
