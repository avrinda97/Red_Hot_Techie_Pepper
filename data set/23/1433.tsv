2010-04-02T00:35:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	9.10 Karmic?
2010-04-02T00:36:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	not sure it it's karmic named. how do I cehck it?
2010-04-02T00:36:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	System>Admin>System Monitor, it should say under the 'System' tab
2010-04-02T00:37:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	yes. it's called karmic.
2010-04-02T00:38:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	excellent. Now go to System>Admin>Synaptic, and search for: gnome-volume-manager
2010-04-02T00:38:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	it should show a green box next to the name if it's installed
2010-04-02T00:42:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	did you find it?
2010-04-02T00:44:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	well, I think I had to install it. But hasn't mounted my pen drive yet.
2010-04-02T00:44:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	you're going to have to reboot. Also make sure it shows up in System>Prefs>Startup Apps.
2010-04-02T00:44:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	otherwise it won't auto-load during startup
2010-04-02T00:46:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	where is it installed?
2010-04-02T00:47:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	it's just a daemon that runs in the background, but it should be shown in System>Prefs>Startup Apps. so it starts automatically
2010-04-02T00:50:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	I think I need to Add Program Tto Session Startup , no?
2010-04-02T00:51:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	yes, if it's not shown after installing it, you'll need to add it
2010-04-02T00:51:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	have you tried rebooting since you installed it?
2010-04-02T00:51:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	this way I need to locate it on HDD. Where does it install the apps?
2010-04-02T00:52:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	no, haven't rebooted yet.
2010-04-02T00:52:00.000Z	swoody	firmW__	try rebooting really quick, and see if it adds itself to that list :)
2010-04-02T00:52:00.000Z	firmW__	swoody	ok. brb
