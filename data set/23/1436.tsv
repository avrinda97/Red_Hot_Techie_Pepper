2010-08-18T22:51:00.000Z	ninjai		is there any way/program to capture the exact keycodes a terminal sends to a remote server?
2010-08-18T22:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	an sniffer captures all traffic that goes through an interface
2010-08-18T22:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	what are you trying to do ?
2010-08-18T22:53:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	I'm trying to figure out what keycodes putty sends with ESC[n~, in hopes to use that keycode in Konsole
2010-09-27T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	you want to encrypt it with a simple password?
2010-09-27T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	you need « gpg -c file »
2010-09-27T22:57:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	gpg: WARNING: recipients (-r) given without using public key encryption
2010-09-27T22:57:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	I made an RSA key
2010-09-27T22:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	what are you trying to do? is asimple just password protect this file r are you signing/encrypting something to send it later? or what?
2010-09-27T22:58:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	encrypting a folder with my private key
2010-09-27T22:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	you want to have an encripted folder? one you can access normaly given the password? gpg is not the tool for that. use encfs or similar
2010-09-27T23:00:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	No this is a one time deal.  I'm encrypting something I want to be locked away so I can decrypt it later... not an encrypted accessible folder.
2010-09-27T23:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	then tar it up and do « gpg -c file.tar.gz » you enter a passphrase/password twice and that's it
2010-09-27T23:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	no need for a public/priv kaypair
2010-09-27T23:02:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	Do I have to tar it?
2010-09-27T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	if it is a folder yes.
2010-09-27T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	gpg only can handle files
2010-09-27T23:03:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	Okay thanks
2010-09-27T23:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	see my previous comment about encfs
2010-09-27T23:03:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	im not looking to encrypt a filesystem
2010-09-27T23:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	encfs encrypts folders
2010-09-27T23:04:00.000Z	ninjai	erUSUL	Okay I'll take a look then :)
2010-09-27T23:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	ninjai	folders that you can mount clear to access them
