2010-05-08T08:32:00.000Z	histo	primetime	hit ctrl+alt+f1
2010-05-08T08:32:00.000Z	histo	primetime	see if you can atleast get a terminal login
2010-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	histo	primetime	ctrl+alt+f1-f6 should be text terminals f7 is X
2010-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	histo	primetime	do you have ssh installed on the machine?
2010-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	primetime	histo	 no
2010-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	histo	primetime	hrm.. power cycle it is
2010-05-08T08:35:00.000Z	histo	primetime	could be if data isn't saved etc... but what else can you do at this point? try hittign ctrl+alt+del and see if it will initiate a reboot on its on.
2010-05-08T08:42:00.000Z	histo	primetime	what is the problem? random lockups?
2010-05-08T08:43:00.000Z	histo	primetime	did 9.10 or previous versions have lockups?
2010-05-08T08:44:00.000Z	histo	primetime	ahh how old is your computer?
2010-05-08T08:46:00.000Z	histo	primetime	usaually random lockups are power related. I've disabled acpi on some boxes that had random freezing and problems went away
2010-05-08T08:47:00.000Z	histo	primetime	edit the /etc/default/grub file and look for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" chagne it to "quiet splash acpi=off
2010-05-08T08:47:00.000Z	histo	primetime	I would also runa  memtest on the box
2010-05-08T08:53:00.000Z	primetime	histo	I edited that file, now do I need to recompile grub file?
2010-05-08T08:53:00.000Z	histo	primetime	sudo update-grub2
2010-05-08T08:54:00.000Z	primetime	histo	then do I restart?
2010-05-08T08:54:00.000Z	histo	primetime	sudo reboot
2010-05-08T08:55:00.000Z	histo	primetime	or sudo shutdown -r now
2010-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	primetime	histo	 just want to make sure that my comp should be able to run 10.04 right?
2010-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	histo	primetime	possible kind of have to figure otu what the issue is first to make that assumption
2010-05-08T09:00:00.000Z	primetime	histo	 well i've made the changes and rebooted so now I'll just have to play with it for a while and see if it has any problems
2010-05-08T09:01:00.000Z	histo	primetime	yeap
