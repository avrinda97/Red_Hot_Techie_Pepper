2006-11-15T07:35:00.000Z	earthian	slavik	i built them with --buildpkg command and then installed all debs with dpkg -i
2006-11-15T07:36:00.000Z	slavik	earthian	did you build the module using module-assistant?

2006-11-15T07:37:00.000Z	slavik	earthian	the complaint is that the module was built for Xorg 6.8 but you are using 7.1

2006-11-15T07:38:00.000Z	slavik		if it had been 6.9, it might've been fine ...
