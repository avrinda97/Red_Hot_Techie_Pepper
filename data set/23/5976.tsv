2006-07-16T07:37:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	yes
2006-07-16T07:38:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	then i would suggest having a look at /var/log/messages to see what kind of errors you were getting trying to log on with X
2006-07-16T07:39:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	ok i will look, but i have to reboot, as the whole system locks up when i try to login with X
2006-07-16T07:39:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	That is a great nick BTW
2006-07-16T07:40:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	hehe   thanks
2006-07-16T07:44:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	OK I have access to /var/log/messages but I'm not sure what I"m lookign for, there's a lot of stuff there
2006-07-16T07:46:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	try starting wtih Xorg.0.log
2006-07-16T07:46:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	that's just the stuff from X
2006-07-16T07:47:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	or the ".old" file is from the last login
2006-07-16T07:48:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	OK I found it, but there are no errors given in Xorg.0.log
2006-07-16T07:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	what about in Xorg.0.log.old?
2006-07-16T07:50:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	No, no errors there either
2006-07-16T07:50:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	That is, there are no lines that begin with (EE)
2006-07-16T07:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	if you want to pastebin it, i can have a quick look but i'm off for dinner soon. probably won't be able to help you. just a general purpose tip to always check your logs first when hunting problems :)
2006-07-16T07:52:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	How do I pastebin something?
2006-07-16T08:12:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	did you receive the file?
2006-07-16T08:13:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	no. just post the link to the file on pastebin
2006-07-16T08:14:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	here is the link: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18127
2006-07-16T08:14:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	I had to use lynx to send it, I'm sorry if the format is a little messed up
2006-07-16T08:19:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	i'm sorry. i read through it and it looks ok to me. i have no clue
2006-07-16T08:20:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	you might try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to reconfigure your X
2006-07-16T08:20:00.000Z	mister_roboto	chemjeff	but i don't know what the problem is with your current config
2006-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	chemjeff	mister_roboto	Okay, I have an NVIDIA GeForce graphics card, what would be the correct driver to use?  Is it nv?
