2007-09-06T06:48:00.000Z	skoenman		does anbody know what the max space is that a NAS can handle?????
2007-09-06T06:49:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	more than you can put on a system ;)
2007-09-06T06:49:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	so you say more than 10TB
2007-09-06T06:50:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	probably. a NAS is little more than a special purpose system
2007-09-06T06:50:00.000Z	skoenman		yeah well
2007-09-06T06:50:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	we do cctv systems and we have worked out for 44 cameras to record 30 days we nee about 10TB
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	faileas		if your file systems can handle it, and you have enough network IO, you shouldn't have an issue
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	what filesystem do you suggest???
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	it will be a hardware bottleneck, not a software bottlenext
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	faileas		*neck
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	faileas		erm
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	i use ext3
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	skoenman		k
2007-09-06T06:51:00.000Z	faileas		ext3 would work
2007-09-06T06:52:00.000Z	skoenman		cool thanks
2007-09-06T06:52:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	you will probably need to worry about network bottlenecks, and hard drive bottlenecks though
2007-09-06T06:53:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	were most probably gonna put in gigabit switches so that should sort it
2007-09-06T06:53:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	and hard drives on raid, i suspect
2007-09-06T06:53:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	yes raid 0
2007-09-06T06:54:00.000Z	faileas		yeah, should not be an issue then ;)
2007-09-06T06:54:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	why???
2007-09-06T06:55:00.000Z	faileas	skoenman	why not? if hardware can handle it the san should handle it ;p
2007-09-06T06:55:00.000Z	skoenman	faileas	ok cool
