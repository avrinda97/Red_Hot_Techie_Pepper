2006-01-24T10:50:00.000Z	slew		hi, whats a good gnome iso burning tool?
2006-01-24T10:50:00.000Z	thundr	slew	the built-in one works fine for me
2006-01-24T10:51:00.000Z	slew	thundr	you mean the one that pops up when you put in a blank cd?
2006-01-24T10:51:00.000Z	thundr	slew	just right click the .iso and go to burn or something similar.
2006-01-24T10:52:00.000Z	slew	thundr	i have an option for write to disc, will it burn the iso or just copy the file?
2006-01-24T10:52:00.000Z	thundr	slew	it should burn the iso, IIRC.
2006-01-24T10:53:00.000Z	slew	thundr	cool here's to hopin! =] 
2006-01-24T10:54:00.000Z	thundr	slew	hope it works, if it doesn't, basically most any program will burn isos. I like K3b even though it's for KDE (it still runs fine in gnome as sudo)
2006-01-24T10:55:00.000Z	thundr	slew	you've rebooted after installing the kernel?
2006-01-24T10:55:00.000Z	slew	thundr	yeah
2006-01-24T10:56:00.000Z	thundr	slew	if you've got 686 and it's running fine, you shouldn't need to have 386 on your system I don't believe.
2006-01-24T10:56:00.000Z	thundr	slew	it shouldn't give updates for packages you don't have.
2006-01-24T10:56:00.000Z	slew	thundr	i agree. the updater is still there telling me i need this. how do i get rid of it?
2006-01-24T10:58:00.000Z	thundr	slew	forcing the version (you can do this in Synaptic) would be what I would try.
2006-01-24T10:59:00.000Z	slew	thundr	ok i'll give it a shot.
2006-01-24T10:59:00.000Z	thundr	slew	you know how to do that?
2006-01-24T10:59:00.000Z	slew	thundr	no, i was about to go look in synaptic to see how
2006-01-24T11:00:00.000Z	thundr	slew	select the package and go to Package>Lock Version.
2006-01-24T11:01:00.000Z	slew	thundr	you mean lock 686, right? btw the 'write to cd' option worked. =] 
2006-01-24T11:02:00.000Z	thundr	slew	no - lock 386.  The lock version makes it so you don't get updates for the package.   -- Cool, glad it worked :)
2006-01-24T11:02:00.000Z	thundr	slew	the kernel you boot with should still be 686.
2006-01-24T11:03:00.000Z	slew	thundr	hey thanks! i learned something today! and its midnight! so i dont have to learn anything else for 24 hours!!
2006-01-24T11:04:00.000Z	thundr	slew	glad I could help!  Have fun!
