2008-05-18T00:57:00.000Z	javialquim		Man.... I hate to loose all the programs and customization I did... I mean I use this for everything
2008-05-18T00:58:00.000Z	javialquim		Good to know Darlok.... So I do I get back to my original setup (I don't see any frames on my applications
2008-05-18T00:59:00.000Z	javialquim		psych... That happen to me once, I had to reinstall gnome but I was missing some packages from gnome-session
2008-05-18T00:59:00.000Z	javialquim		I reinstalled all gnome packages.... that won't solve the kde problem though...
2008-05-18T01:00:00.000Z	javialquim		oh.... I thought I read something about kde....
2008-05-18T01:00:00.000Z	javialquim		yeah... that's what happened to me and I solved it with apt-get reinstalling ALL gnome packages
2008-05-18T01:01:00.000Z	javialquim		make sure you reinstall gnome-session
2008-05-18T01:01:00.000Z	javialquim		good luck psych
2008-05-18T01:02:00.000Z	javialquim		I spent hours last time when I realized I was still missing individual packages (like gnome-session)
2008-05-18T01:02:00.000Z	javialquim		shen2peru.... look on the printer setup menu or run NMAP
2008-05-18T01:03:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	what is dnmap?  the printer setup doesn't allow me.
2008-05-18T01:05:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	ok, installing it now
2008-05-18T01:07:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	will that give me the hostname of the device too??  When I set it up in Windows (long time ago) it uses a hostname, and not an IP address, but it was a long string of stuff I don't remember
2008-05-18T01:08:00.000Z	javialquim	shane2peru	 I thought you just wanted the IP address for other purposes (I assumed you were hacking - sorry)
2008-05-18T01:08:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	ha ha, I'm looking at this trying to figure out what it is supposed to do. lol
2008-05-18T01:09:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	will it give me the ip of my printer?
2008-05-18T01:09:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	I enjoy learning hacking too, lol, what do I put under target?
2008-05-18T01:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	cool, that is pretty neat trick!  Thanks.
2008-05-18T01:14:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	yeah, I always have to put the ip address in that is why I'm thinking, I'm missing something here
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	if you just type the first few letters and hit tab, it will finish the persons name you are typing too.
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	javialquim	shane2peru	.... cool!
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	yeah, I don't type your whole name out. lol
2008-05-18T01:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	javialquim	I wasn't able to do it through System -> Administration -> Printer ...  ..  I selected HPJet/Direct, and it needs the ip address, however this nmapfe is really cool. :)
