2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika	purefusion	if the file is empty, open it in gedit and type:
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika		include menu.cfg
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika		default vesamenu.c32
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika		prompt 0
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika		timeout 300
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	krithika		gfxboot bootlogo

2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	purefusion		include menu.cfg
2009-08-29T16:22:00.000Z	purefusion		default vesamenu.c32

2009-08-29T16:23:00.000Z	purefusion		sorry, didn't think it was enough to bother with a PB
2009-08-29T16:24:00.000Z	krithika	purefusion	the contents of syslinux folder should be present in the root directory of the usb, as well as inside the syslinux folder. keep both the folder, as well as copy its files to the root directory.
2009-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	krithika	purefusion	same with the install folder, and initrd.gz and vmlinuz inside casper, besides the syslinux folder.
2009-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	purefusion	krithika	you mean they all need to be at root?
