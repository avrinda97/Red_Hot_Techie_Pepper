2006-11-20T13:36:00.000Z	`axion	sharperguy	sharperguy try running tcprobe -i file.avi on the original
2006-11-20T13:39:00.000Z	`axion	sharperguy	yeah looks to be corrupted
2006-11-20T13:42:00.000Z	`axion	sharperguy	did you get it from a p2p service? looks to be fake...or the codec was mislabeled and not in an avi container
2006-11-20T13:47:00.000Z	`axion	sharperguy	i suggest you ask others to generate an md5 checksum and compare it
2006-11-20T13:52:00.000Z	`axion	sharperguy	use md5sum file.avi
