2011-06-03T22:31:00.000Z	Magentium		Has anyone else had a problem with the battery monitor only showing "Battery Time Estimating"
2011-06-03T22:31:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	yes
2011-06-03T22:31:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	on 11.04?
2011-06-03T22:32:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	on anything, 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04 all do the same thing, i found a link to how to fix it but i cannot find it anymore
2011-06-03T22:33:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	do you have acpi installed?
2011-06-03T22:34:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	i installed an acpi module before but im not sure, do you have any recommendations on installing it ?
2011-06-03T22:34:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	sleep and everything works, brightness does as well, its only the battery monitor. Widgets will show remaining time but i cannot set it up via the gnome one
2011-06-03T22:35:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	run acpi -V in terminal and tell me what you get
2011-06-03T22:37:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	sudo apt-get install acpi acpid
2011-06-03T22:37:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	i have just installed acpi, can i still installed acpid seperately or must they be installed together?
2011-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	yes
2011-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	if it is recommended
2011-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	if not just log out then log back in
2011-06-03T22:40:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	i will restart now and let you know what happens
2011-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	hmmm
2011-06-03T22:45:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	it is not a major problem as my Docky applet works fine, it is just annoying
2011-06-03T22:45:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	I had that problem. I'm going through my system logs to see what I did to fix it
2011-06-03T22:46:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	thank you, if you cannot then it is okay, i value your support already :)
2011-06-03T22:55:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	is upower installed?
2011-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	i believe it is, i wil check
2011-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	Upower is at the latest version
2011-06-03T22:59:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Magentium	burg runs on top of grub
2011-06-03T22:59:00.000Z	Magentium	rcmaehl	ahh i wasnt sure, never used it :p
