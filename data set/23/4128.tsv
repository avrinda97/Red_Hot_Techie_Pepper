2008-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	Greevous		I have an s-video output on my desktop pc, but how can I switch the outputs so that it goes to the extra video device? (No fn keys)
2008-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	what is the model of your video card for starters?
2008-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	it's an ATI All-In-Wonder 9000
2008-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	look up ATI's xorg.conf optsions.
2008-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	http://www.google.com/search?q=ati+ubuntu+S-Video+out
2008-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	check that link out.
2008-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	okay, thank you. I was under the impression that I had all necessary drivers, since compiz-fusion works flawlessly
2008-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	you do have all the drivers, its just an option in the xorg.conf configuration file.
2008-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	for the s-video out, do you know what I might be looking for in my xorg.conf file?
2008-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	you're going to have to learn to use the forum & google. I'll TELL you the answer this time.
2008-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	give me  second.
2008-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	I can narrow it down to either "monitor" or "screen", but since things can get really screwed up when you mess with xorg.conf...
2008-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	do a "cp -arfvp /etc /etc.bak
2008-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	alright, thank you very much
2008-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_TV-Out#X_configuration
2008-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	yep; so they want me to install a different driver now for ati?
2008-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	no...
2008-01-01T09:43:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	I tried editing my xorg.conf to match the wiki, but I still only get video output when the xserver isn't running; as soon as it starts up, my tv goes blank
2008-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	let me get my fstab line for you.
2008-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Greevous	/etc/fstab is here http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/3173/
2008-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	fstab for video outputs?
2008-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	I thought so... but you told me to check out your fstab at pastebin
2008-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Greevous	tcpdumpgod	it seemed like you got me confused with someone else
