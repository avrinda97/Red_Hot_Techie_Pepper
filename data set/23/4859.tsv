2007-10-14T13:26:00.000Z	underwatercow	pommer	I have the 8800gts, and I still find it very useful ;-D I'll take your gtx though...
2007-10-14T13:27:00.000Z	underwatercow	pommer	lol... I thought you were feeling charitable. I find it useful from anything ranging from desktop effects to playing graphically intensive games both in Linux and Windows
2007-10-14T13:28:00.000Z	underwatercow	pommer	You can run many windows games in linux first of all, did you look at the link I sent you?
2007-10-14T13:29:00.000Z	underwatercow	pommer	You can run many first person shooters, and a FPS in linux is Sauerbraten... or warzone 2100 is decent graphically... not sure about gameplay yet...
