2007-01-03T16:18:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr		Does anyone know why most Linux apps off of the web, i.e. Teamspeak won't install (open)?
2007-01-03T16:18:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	define "linxu app off the web"
2007-01-03T16:19:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	I was downloading Teamspeak from www.goteamspeak.com, and it says it cant read it or something. The package manager has a bunch of languages to choose from like Unicode-UTF8
2007-01-03T16:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	those are tarballs, you have to extract and compile
2007-01-03T16:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	right, that is a tarball
2007-01-03T16:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	open up a terminal, and then cd to wherever it is
2007-01-03T16:21:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	could you bring me up to speed on how to handle them?
2007-01-03T16:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	right, "cd whatever" then do tar xf ts2_client_rc2_2032.tar.bz2
2007-01-03T16:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	then do cd ts2_client_rc2_2032/
2007-01-03T16:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	then do ./setup.sh
2007-01-03T16:26:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	how do i get to the desktop in terminal?
2007-01-03T16:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	teamspeak can apparently be installed with a gui. So says the readme
2007-01-03T16:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	which one did you get, the client or the server?
2007-01-03T16:27:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	client
2007-01-03T16:28:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	ok right click on the tar.bz2, then click extract here. Then open up the folder, and double click on setup.sh
2007-01-03T16:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	no
2007-01-03T16:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	the readme, says that you should be able to do it by gui
2007-01-03T16:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	double click it, that should work
2007-01-03T16:30:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	it gives me options
2007-01-03T16:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	execute
2007-01-03T16:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	when I double click it I get a little install shield wizard looking thing
2007-01-03T16:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Admiral_Buttercr	archive manager archives and unarchives that is it
2007-01-03T16:32:00.000Z	Admiral_Buttercr	bruenig	thanks for your help. it makes sense now
