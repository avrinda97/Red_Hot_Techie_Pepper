2009-08-15T13:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 it will be 9.10 - thats the 10th month of 2009 :)
2009-08-15T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 give details... local lan? or over internet? what OS's ?
2009-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 You need to install samba to get machines seeing others and having 'shares' normally
2009-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 vnc is for one thing.. samba is for sotmhing totally diffrent.
2009-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 shareing 'directories/files' = samba
2009-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 remote desktop access = vnc or freenx
2009-08-15T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 err... they dont have the same 'ip' that dosetn make sence.
2009-08-15T15:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 they are going thriough a router?  that site would show the routers ip.
2009-08-15T15:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 all 8 of my machines here show the same ip at those kind of sites. I think. :)
2009-08-15T15:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 so.. what does this have to do  with samba or vnc?
2009-08-15T15:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 vnc is normally NOT used over the 'internet' with out ssh tunnling.
2009-08-15T15:38:00.000Z	dragonrigs	Dr_Willis	is that true
2009-08-15T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 is what true? whate are you even trying to do?
2009-08-15T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 i did?  why?  it shows you got wireless working with an ip# - so...... whats the problem?
2009-08-15T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	  that dozent make sence.. how are you going to 'ping' it then? or ssh to it.. or anything to it.
2009-08-15T15:41:00.000Z	dragonrigs	Dr_Willis	can u vnc me
2009-08-15T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dragonrigs	 gee.. you say both machines have the same ip.. Your ip shown is 192.168.0.88    Im pretty sure thats a 'local lan' ip. and not reacheable from   here.
