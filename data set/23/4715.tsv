2007-05-26T14:59:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	there is gnash which runs flash on firefox64 but it does not support the newest versions of flash yet and also can't play streaming videos (youtube...) yet. but they say the cvs version can.
2007-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	what exactly does not work?

2007-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	HeFFy	predaeus	giving me an error :wrong architecture
2007-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	ah, gimme a minute
2007-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	HeFFy	predaeus	thank you
2007-05-26T15:11:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	I think the cleanest way to install it would be to tick "Download this package in TAR.GZ format" on the opera download page. this will give you a tar.gz compressed package instead of the .deb file. You then just unpack the package to a folder like /home/yourname/programs/opera  and you can run it from there. But to do so you will need to get some 32bit libraries from the ubuntu package page and install them to /usr/lib3
2007-05-26T15:12:00.000Z	HeFFy	predaeus	thank you very much i will try
2007-05-26T15:13:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	you can find libraries on http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/  . Just download the 368 32bit .debs and unpack them with the package manager, then copy the files from the usr/lib directory in those packages to your systems /usr/lib32 directory.
2007-05-26T15:15:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	watch out that you do not copy 32bit libs to your "/usr/lib" directory (this will overwrite the regular 64bit libs). 32bit libs are in the lib32 folders like /usr/lib32. Be careful!
2007-05-26T15:16:00.000Z	HeFFy	predaeus	sorry i can not seem to find it could you give me deatailed link please?
2007-05-26T15:16:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	what is it that you can not find?
2007-05-26T15:16:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	the opera link or the libs?
2007-05-26T15:17:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	are you on Feisty?
2007-05-26T15:18:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	see http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/libs/   the libs (xxxx.so files) opera will yell about when you run it and it won't start are most likely   lib...  files in the repository so search for them there.
2007-05-26T15:18:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	just try to run opera from a console/terminal to see the error messages
2007-05-26T15:19:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	it will say what libs are missing, also if you run   "ldd opera"  it will list all libaries needed and those that are missing (if opera is a binary and not just some script)
2007-05-26T15:20:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	where did you unpack it?
2007-05-26T15:20:00.000Z	predaeus	HeFFy	you need to change directory into the directory where you put opera and run it from there
