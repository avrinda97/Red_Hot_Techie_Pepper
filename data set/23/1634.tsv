2010-02-16T08:14:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en		i installed ubuntu 9.10 onto my dell dimension 2400, and the screen resolution is 800 x 648, but when i had ubuntu 9.04 i had 1024 x 768 resolution, how can i fix it?
2010-02-16T08:15:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	have a look in System->preferences->display
2010-02-16T08:20:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en	knoppies	it only has 800 x 648, none other
2010-02-16T08:21:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	you have a problem I had a while ago, give me a sec while I find the fix.
2010-02-16T08:22:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	run the following command, then restart your PC. Hope it helps: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-02-16T08:39:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en	knoppies	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg did not work
2010-02-16T08:39:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	hmm, then Im not sure. Im going to assume this is the same monitor?
2010-02-16T08:39:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	and that you have installed video drivers.
2010-02-16T08:40:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	that may be your problem
2010-02-16T08:44:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	ubottu is only a bot. Im the one who called his factoid.
2010-02-16T08:44:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	Im not sure what the issue is, but I would assume its a driver thing.
2010-02-16T08:45:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	thats alright. I would make sure 'restricted' sources are enabled, and then System -> Administration -> hardware drivers
2010-02-16T08:52:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en	knoppies	i checked 'restricted' in software sources, then went to system-->adminastration-->hardware drivers and it came up with none
2010-02-16T08:52:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	you have to "reload" using the Synaptic Package Manager (if you havnt already)
2010-02-16T08:53:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	then I don't know. Sorry i couldnt help.
2010-02-16T08:55:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	then maybe you have to create a xorg.conf file. Give me a sec I might know how to do that.
2010-02-16T08:56:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	(im just guessing from here on out, but it might be worth a shot). Someone told me to run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" to create a xorg.conf file.
2010-02-16T08:56:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	assuming your card is an nvidia one.
2010-02-16T08:56:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	that also might need the nvidia drivers.
2010-02-16T08:57:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en	knoppies	it said commmand not found
2010-02-16T08:58:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	hmm, ok. then Im not sure.
2010-02-16T09:15:00.000Z	Elive_user58_en	knoppies	dragon_, i tried to create a xorg.conf file by following ubuntu's instructions, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/910 (bottom of page) and it didnt work, then i tried this page, http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/create-a-xorgconf-file.html and this page http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_xorg.conf and none of them worked
2010-02-16T09:16:00.000Z	knoppies	Elive_user58_en	I wouldn't know. If it is that important to you, you could consider doing a fresh install again.
