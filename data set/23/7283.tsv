2006-06-04T16:06:00.000Z	samu2		Is it possible to make the tab-behaviour work like it does in XP's dos prompt?
2006-06-04T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	how's that?
2006-06-04T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	I'm sure it is.  I just don't know how at the moment.
2006-06-04T16:08:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	where would I find out how?
2006-06-04T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	Well, google might be of some help, some others here might know, but it won't be ubuntu specific specicially, so any linux related place of discussion (like #linux) might be of assistance.
2006-06-04T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	just ask for tab completion to cycle through the options, don't mention windows XP ;)
2006-06-04T16:10:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	wouldnt that get me an answer immediately? "Hey why is the linux "dos prompt" so crap? Can't even do this..."
2006-06-04T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	heh.  it might infuse them with vigor to prove you wrong, or it might blow up in your face.  walking a fine line, depends on time of day, methinks.
2006-06-04T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	apparently zsh has that type of tab completion.  I'm sure someone's enabled bash to do the same.  just a matter of finding the config/whatever.
2006-06-04T16:13:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	so how do I know which shell is running in my konsole?
2006-06-04T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	you can choose your shell in user config stuffs.  or, at least, on ubuntu, as for where you change it in kubuntu... I haven't the foggiest.
2006-06-04T16:15:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	ok thanks.
2006-08-08T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	because youve got apache2 installed
2006-08-08T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	and, ubuntu has changed some stuff around, made it easier for apt to deal with confuration and stuff. (er, actually, I think it was debian who started it, I really dont know)
2006-08-08T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	alright, see my second thing ;)  in ubuntu, config files are spread out a bit more.
2006-08-08T16:11:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	ok but it is a bit annoying when you are reading the manual and you dont know what parts have been modified
2006-08-08T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	What are you trying to do?
2006-08-08T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	heh, alright.  For most things ubuntu has ubuntu-specific documentation laying around the wiki.  And, things aren't that different.  BAsically apache2.conf includes the other stuff, so only in the source is it different
2006-08-08T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	includes /sites-enabled/ and /mods-enabled/ in sites, are just virtual hosts, theres a deault one.  in mods- are .load and .conf files, load files load in different things, then their corresponding conf files add in the relevant configuration directives
2006-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	yep I kind of figured out how it's set up with those conf files already. I was just wondering why it was different from the manual.
2006-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	because it makes it easier for apt- that way, just adding removing files in /mods-available/
2006-12-21T06:15:00.000Z	Flannel	samu2	update-manager.
2006-12-21T06:15:00.000Z	samu2	Flannel	thanks
