2008-10-02T00:48:00.000Z	Gin		what is the folder Lost+found for? when formatting a partition I always get that folder created automatically.
2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	"lost" files that fsck may find are placed there
2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	but that folder is 7.5Gb
2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	what does it contain?
2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	nothing
2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	then how can it be 7.5Gb if it's a folder that contains nothing?
2008-10-02T00:50:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	it's perhaps possible, although i'm not really sure, that it's mapped to bad sectors. what makes you say it's 7.5Gb anyway?
2008-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	gparted under used it says 7.5GB and I just formated my 1TB drive
2008-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	Gin		:\
2008-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	when mounted the partition, I only see 1 folder, the lost+found folder
2008-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	that's the filesystem overhead, it's not that folder.
2008-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	any way to gain back that 7.5GB?
2008-10-02T00:52:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	i suppose specify a number of inodes when doing "mkfs". that's stupid though.
2008-10-02T00:53:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	you've never lost that space to begin with. that space is needed for the filesystem to store metadata.
2008-10-02T00:53:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	7.5GB to store metadata? :S
2008-10-02T00:53:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	on a 1TB drive, sounds about right.
2008-10-02T00:53:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	that way too much space for metadata
2008-10-02T00:56:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	is it okay to delete the folder lost+found?
2008-10-02T00:57:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	delete it, and you'll see you aren't gaining any space back.
2008-10-02T00:58:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	you are right. I can only use 877GB of the 1TB drive :(
2008-10-02T00:58:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	and 877+7.5 doesn't even make 1000.
2008-10-02T00:58:00.000Z	Gin	LjL	then where is the rest ? :\
2008-10-02T00:59:00.000Z	LjL	Gin	in units. hard drives are sold with sizes given in decimal multiples of a byte, while computers most often give things in binary multiples of a byte.
