2006-08-20T13:42:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		Anyone know of an app or anything that would allow messaging to an IP outside a LAN
2006-08-20T13:42:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	what are you trying to do?
2006-08-20T13:43:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	I have someone trying to access me in ftp, I have the IP, but no way to contact them. Also, I've needed somthing like this for a while.
2006-08-20T13:44:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	do you want to setup an ftp server?
2006-08-20T13:45:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	No, I have an FTP. But need a way to contact people via IP
2006-08-20T13:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	just use the IP in place of a hostname
2006-08-20T13:47:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	ip instead of hostname for what?
2006-08-20T13:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	where you would normally put a hostname, just put in the IP of the remote system
2006-08-20T13:48:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	I don't think you understand what I'm doing. Say all I have is an IP address, how do I contact them?
2006-08-20T13:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	ftp 1.2.3.4
2006-08-20T13:49:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	without FTP
2006-08-20T13:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	what protocol do you intend to use?
2006-08-20T13:50:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	That's what I'm asking. Is there applications that allow direct IP input?
2006-08-20T13:50:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	that's pretty advanced stuff. Look into tap devices, I think they allow bidirectional communication. Also raw sockets
2006-08-20T13:52:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	Basically, I'm looking for something that people that are common to the net would use to contact each other via IP addresses. AIM, Yahoo, etc, all use SN. I'd like direct contact.
2006-08-20T13:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	for simple chat there's old fashioned 'talk'
2006-08-20T13:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	2 party IRC kinda
2006-08-20T13:54:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	you'd probably be better off setting up an irc server
2006-08-20T13:55:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	I'm suprised there isn't anything out there for this.
2006-08-20T13:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	I'm not sure you've thought this all the way through
2006-08-20T13:56:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	Sure I have. Why does everyone have to connect to 3rd party servers to chat?
2006-08-20T13:57:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	bbrazil	there should be a way to punch in an IP address and chat with someone.
2006-08-20T13:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	Corporal_Dirge	that'd be talk. Or possibly jabber
