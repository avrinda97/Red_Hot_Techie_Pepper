2008-09-13T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	make sure cd is first, then hard drive
2008-09-13T03:53:00.000Z	kR5_Chris	ActionParsnip	I did it too and it is like that
2008-09-13T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	then you havent install grub if the drive isnt bootable
2008-09-13T03:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	have you ran all the way through the install process
2008-09-13T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	you should power off and make sure everything is connected properly

2008-09-13T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	unplug and plug everytnhing in
2008-09-13T03:58:00.000Z	kR5_Chris	ActionParsnip	What cable could caused it?
2008-09-13T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	hard drive power or controller
2008-09-13T03:59:00.000Z	kR5_Chris	ActionParsnip	I changed the hard disk sata cable and I changed a hard drive with Windows Xp intalled and the same problem appeared
2008-09-13T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	maybe the drive is faulty
2008-09-13T04:01:00.000Z	kR5_Chris	ActionParsnip	I try to boot two different hard disks one with Linux Ubuntu 7.10 and one with Windows Xp and there was the same problem with both

2008-09-13T04:03:00.000Z	kR5_Chris	ActionParsnip	I dont think that it will help
2008-09-13T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kR5_Chris	thats all i can suggest, try a different power cable from the psu, or a new hdd cable
