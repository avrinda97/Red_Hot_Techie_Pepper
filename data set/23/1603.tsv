2010-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst		Can somebody walk me through some package problems? Neither apt or aptitude want to update the kernel image and modules to the newest version. I'm using an older Ubuntu, but I don't remember which one
2010-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	start with lsb_release -a
2010-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	okay. I'll tell you in just a sec
2010-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	It's Hardy, 8.04
2010-01-09T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	and now uname -r please
2010-01-09T01:21:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	2.6.24-26-generic. That's the one it's stuck on installing
2010-01-09T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	thats the latest for hardy see http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy-updates/base/
2010-01-09T01:23:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	That's the one it's trying to update to. It's sticking on the configuration.
2010-01-09T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	no - you are actually running that one - believe me
2010-01-09T01:25:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	Okay. apt is complaining at me, anyway. Am I doing something wrong?
2010-01-09T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	I don't know - what is it complaining about?
2010-01-09T01:26:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	Errors were encountered while processing:
2010-01-09T01:26:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	use !pastebin
2010-01-09T01:27:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	Those are the only three packages it's complaining about.
2010-01-09T01:28:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	but it tells you a bit more I think... - if you like you can ignore the errors ...
2010-01-09T01:29:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	i'll give you the whole output. It's on my dad's notebook. I think it's been bothering him for a while
2010-01-09T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	ok, be sure to use pastebin please
2010-01-09T01:29:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	I'll be good
2010-01-09T01:30:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	oh, I'm dumb. Gzip is complaining that the disk is full
2010-01-09T01:31:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	I'll send you the rest of it if you're interested, but I'm gonna try clearing out some files and seeing if that fixes is
2010-01-09T01:32:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	I guess that will be the issue - no need for the file if you found it yourself - Good luck :-)
2010-01-09T01:33:00.000Z	KennyDewhirst	guntbert	Thanks. Have a good day.
2010-01-09T01:33:00.000Z	guntbert	KennyDewhirst	same to you
