2005-11-19T14:37:00.000Z	Drelives		i dun need an external packet
2005-11-19T14:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	try the gnome search program - it's in the menu
2005-11-19T14:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	no space between * and .swf
2005-11-19T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	first run  sudo updatedb
2005-11-19T14:44:00.000Z	Drelives	thoreauputic	ok, i try
2005-11-19T14:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	locate needs an up to date database
2005-11-19T14:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	takes a while for that comand to run
2005-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	do you have any idea where what you want is located?
2005-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	Drelives	thoreauputic	no i don't have any idea, it's a temporary file, called di.swf, but it seems to be hiden
2005-11-19T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	if it's temporary it might be in /tmp  :)
2005-11-19T14:50:00.000Z	Drelives	thoreauputic	i already tried to search inside there, but i couldn't see anything....maybe it's like the content.ie5 folder in win32 os, you can't see it if you don't know how to spell it
2005-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	possible - /tmp sometimes has cryptic stuff in it
2005-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	Drelives	thoreauputic	and....how to see it? :D
2005-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Drelives	well, if /tmp isn't too full of files, trial and error I guess
2005-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	Drelives	thoreauputic	ok....let's put to work....i'll come back to annoy you guys later....ghghgh
