2009-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	salvatore_		any idea?

2009-05-08T16:16:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	any idea ?
2009-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	goto System | Administration | Update Manager and check the 'settings' from there
2009-05-08T16:21:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	there are not settings options in the update manager windows, only check button available
2009-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	you have the main and universe repos enabled correct?
2009-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	dunno  -- weird
2009-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	I m not sure it's us
2009-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	and you said you're set for Normal Releases, right?
2009-05-08T16:26:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	yes, normale release is set
2009-05-08T16:27:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	could be the fact that the server I m downloading from is not sync with the others ?
2009-05-08T16:28:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	hrmm...are you set to the "Main" Server?
2009-05-08T16:29:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	how often do they sync ?
2009-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	did it work?
2009-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	damn no!
2009-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	dunno what it could be
2009-05-08T16:44:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	try this from a terminal: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-05-08T16:51:00.000Z	salvatore_	mrwes	I tried them all :)
2009-05-08T16:52:00.000Z	mrwes	salvatore_	you can d/l the alternate CD iso and upgrade from that
