2006-10-16T14:04:00.000Z	ClayG		if Linux Torvalds and Richard Stallman got into a fight who would win?
2006-10-16T14:04:00.000Z	lekvar	ClayG	A fight over what? :)
2006-10-16T14:04:00.000Z	ClayG		LT punked RTS on the movie
2006-10-16T14:05:00.000Z	ClayG		brought his kid out on stage while RTS is trying to talk to everyone, of coarse all the cheerleaders ran over to the kid and took pictures and RTS was foiled again!
2006-10-16T14:05:00.000Z	ClayG	lekvar	a fight over calling th OS linux and possible RTS physically forcing Linux to add GNU to the source code, and announce it to everyone
2006-10-16T14:06:00.000Z	lekvar		Say, I'm building a linux system and hoping to watch DVD's on my 1680x1050 display, and I'm wondering how well the available players scale the image.  I notice the display itself does so poorly, but I've seen it look good coming out of a powerbook or a Windows box w/ a decent nvidia card...
2006-10-16T14:06:00.000Z	ClayG		on a different note, doe3s anyone here own a HP DV2000/5000/6000?
2006-10-16T14:07:00.000Z	ClayG		I want one (BAD) but want to make sure it wokrs, as in all the bells and whistles, i heard one of the models the bluetooth doewsn't work with ubuntu
2006-10-16T14:07:00.000Z	lekvar	ClayG	I think just having the conflict on the subject exposes the relationship between the two quite adequately...
2006-10-16T14:08:00.000Z	ClayG	lekvar	you could see RTS getting mad and half talking out of his nose on the movie
2006-10-16T14:08:00.000Z	ClayG	lekvar	IOW agreed.
2006-10-16T14:08:00.000Z	lekvar		yea, speaking of movies!
2006-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	ClayG	lekvar	you are right it was a good movie, and im not sure if the hacker in the beginning that ends up getting killed is supposed to be Linus.  I do know that Halley Bary(sp) looked very good in it, and Travolta was awsome
2006-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	lekvar	ClayG	didn't see it.  missed which movie.  i'm just coincidentally trying to evaluate hardware and system options around the matter :)
2006-10-16T14:11:00.000Z	lekvar		*gets the feeling nvidia's a much safer choice in linux than ati*
2006-10-16T14:11:00.000Z	ClayG	lekvar	it was a pain in the bottom(censors) to get it working for me, there seemed to always "be something missing"....for instance on some sites (89.com) when you wanted to watch a movie, it looked like it was loading it but then just stopped and didnt play
2006-10-16T14:12:00.000Z	ClayG		I dont know why it is so difficult, probally something to do with MS being the devil or whatever but it is a task just to get standard media to play at all
2006-10-16T14:13:00.000Z	lekvar	ClayG	I never had a linux box that could handle it... tried to make it work on an ancient thinkpad for a while and gave up.  too little video ram!
2006-10-16T14:13:00.000Z	ClayG		 lekvar but you said you had windows also on another boot, that should be a godsend for certain tasks
2006-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	ClayG		I used to keep one just for my dvd stuff, converting and ripping or whatever
2006-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	ClayG		i had not seen anything thatr could rival tmpgenc
2006-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	ClayG		but i thknk (of coarse reformatted and lost it) there was something almost as good
2006-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	lekvar	ClayG	well, no, i bought a spiffy display and took it to a friend's place where were tried out games and movies on it on his XP machine...
