2010-02-07T16:04:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	if your apps are loading slow I do not see how that is a gpu issue but itg glxinfo |grep rendering
2010-02-07T16:05:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	guide me for what i should do please
2010-02-07T16:05:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	open up a terminal
2010-02-07T16:06:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	ok - i did
2010-02-07T16:06:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	type "glxinfo |grep rendering" no quotes
2010-02-07T16:07:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	it says - direct rendering :yes
2010-02-07T16:07:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	your gpu is working fine then, what processor are you using?
2010-02-07T16:08:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	iam using laptop - dell inspiron 1525 ... core 2 duo
2010-02-07T16:09:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	if apps are running slow maybe reinstall them.  I use a very minimal linux distro on my laptop to keep speed and do not install much.  However I had 512mb of ram.
2010-02-07T16:11:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	, its my system in all slow ..not just firefox .. i just said it as example
2010-02-07T16:11:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	it wouldnt be a gpu issue though, thats just processing slow.  Maybe look at something slimmer like xfce vs gnome.
2010-02-07T16:12:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	how to look at it ?
2010-02-07T16:12:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	pardon?
2010-02-07T16:13:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	you said - maybe i need to look at something like  xfce vs gnome.    then how to look at it
2010-02-07T16:13:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	gnome is a desktop environment so is xfce
2010-02-07T16:14:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	, yes but how to reach it - iam so new in linux
2010-02-07T16:16:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	go to the links it provides
2010-02-07T16:17:00.000Z	cmp	mrpink57	, where is the link which is provide ?
2010-02-07T16:29:00.000Z	mrpink57	cmp	not unless you mess around in root a lot
