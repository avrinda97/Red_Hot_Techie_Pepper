2007-11-29T17:00:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	what chipset does it have?  try lspcmcia or lspci to see if you can get any more info.
2007-11-29T17:02:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	well what chipset is it?
2007-11-29T17:03:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	prism chipset yeah.  hrm...
2007-11-29T17:04:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	hold on let me check something.
2007-11-29T17:04:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	thx, will do :)
2007-11-29T17:05:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	if its anything but v1 you are going to have problems with it.
2007-11-29T17:05:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	does it say "made in china"  or a version on the pcmcia card?
2007-11-29T17:06:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	yeah its a problem with that version but you can still get it working here's a howto http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=76804
2007-11-29T17:07:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	what did you do since then?
2007-11-29T17:07:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	upgrade your kernel or something?
2007-11-29T17:08:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	formatted and installed ubuntu-server
2007-11-29T17:08:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	well is it possible that you installed ndiswrapper before to get it working?
2007-11-29T17:10:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	probably, but its hard to install it without an internet connection :(
2007-11-29T17:10:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	is it possible to install it from the ubuntu cd (server or normal)?
2007-11-29T17:10:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	depends on what you consider hard.  I'm sure there are howto's ont he forums.  You probably could use the install cd to install it.  ndiswrapper should be on there.  You would just have to get a way to get the windows driver over.
2007-11-29T17:11:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	i have the windows driver cd.. that might help :P
2007-11-29T17:11:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	if its the corerct windows driver yes.
2007-11-29T17:18:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	eject
2007-11-29T17:18:00.000Z	h1st0	joycetick	err.  sudo eject
2007-11-29T17:20:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	would i want the win xp driver for my pcmcia card?
2007-11-29T17:23:00.000Z	joycetick	h1st0	thanks for you help, dont let the bed bugs bite :)
