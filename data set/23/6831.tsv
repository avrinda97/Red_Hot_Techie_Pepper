2005-12-19T17:06:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		so, how tough is it to get kde to work in ubuntu? isn't there some kebuntu version?
2005-12-19T17:08:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	nvidia twinview is great :)
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	I know it's great, how well does ubuntu support it?  is it easy to configure?
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	I stuck a quick&dirty guide to setting it up in the wiki... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaMultipleMonitors
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	cool, going there now..
2005-12-19T17:12:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	 cool, looks pretty much as I'd expect... couple of other tweaks I've seen that might help.... now do the gui display manager tools allow you to set up A) different wallpapers, and B) adjust the alignment of the monitors to one another?
2005-12-19T17:12:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	no
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	you have to tell twinview in the xorg.conf where the monitors are, check the nvidia readme, it has an appendix that covers such things :)
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	okay.. it's been a dream of mine ;)... but here's the link to some tweaks you might find helpful .. http://pwp.netcabo.pt/0150048402/linux/Multiple_Nvidia_Multiple_Head.html
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	my main monitor died, so I'm back down to one now ;(
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	the alignments can be adjusted, it's just a manual process...
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	but thanks anyway
2005-12-19T17:14:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	no worries...
2005-12-21T17:53:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	"splash" on the end of the line starting "kernel"
2005-12-21T17:53:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	but where does it get the image file from?
2005-12-21T17:54:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	basically, "splash" is there, but having no effect
2005-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	the usplash package
2005-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	it's installed
2005-12-21T17:56:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	and I've run dpkg-reconfigure on it a number of times
2005-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	isn't there some usplash= option?
2005-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ng	is there something in the initramfs?
2005-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	Ng	M_Cheevy	I'm not sure, sorry
