2011-09-15T06:42:00.000Z	hoverbear		Hi all, are there any ubuntu derivatives that don't include a full-fledged DE in the deafult install? Also, are there any rolling release versions?
2011-09-15T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	use ubuntu minimal and you can build up
2011-09-15T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	ubuntu isn't a rolling release
2011-09-15T06:43:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	I figured. There was talk of it moving to something of a rolling release though iirc.
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	Unity isn't a DE
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	I'm well aware. It's a WM. :-P
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	its not that either
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	its a shell, a plugin for compix
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	you cannot compare Unity to Gnome3, it makes zero sense
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	you can compare Gnome classic session to unity session as they are the same type of thing
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	Ah, wasn't aware it's a compiz plugin.
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	run:  ccsm   see what you see ;)
2011-09-15T06:59:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	ActionParsnip I dislike unity regardless *shrugs* Would rather use xfce/kde/*box/aweosme/wmii/tty
2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	you can, thats the beauty of linux
2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	I know right. :)
2011-09-15T07:02:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	I'm just trying to figure out whats going on since Currently I get more battery life running windows with virtualbox emulating a default ubuntu install, then I do just running a default ubuntu install with powertop, cpufreq, and latopmode-tolls running.
2011-09-16T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	install the minimal OS and you can build up from there.
2011-09-16T03:06:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	No wireless drivers on the installer, was using alternative since it is minimal with repos and it failed several times to install properly
2011-09-16T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	could try Lubuntu
2011-09-16T03:08:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	Also considering that yeah. But if server install won't give me issues later on doing power management I don't mine doing xorg and such myself
2011-10-03T06:08:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	i have one of those, they suck imo
2011-10-03T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hoverbear	never heard a success story with them
2011-10-03T06:09:00.000Z	hoverbear	ActionParsnip	I've got it working in linux actually, just terrible performance
