2011-05-16T13:12:00.000Z	zetheroo		how can I report a bug on something if I don't even know what is at fault!!!?
2011-05-16T13:13:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	just document it the best way you can and report it as a general bug or something?
2011-05-16T13:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	I am trying to follow this ... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
2011-05-16T13:15:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	well, what's happening wrong?
2011-05-16T13:16:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	some notification icons will not respond to being clicked on directly ... like the volume icon for instance
2011-05-16T13:16:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	I have to click on the icon to the right of it and slide the cursor over to the left to get the volume, network, BT icons to respond
2011-05-16T13:19:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	I believe notification-ar is the executable for the notification-area. maybe try "top | grep notification", which is what I did. what do you think?
2011-05-16T13:20:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	what will that command do ?
2011-05-16T13:22:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	wait I found it. ps aux | grep notification
2011-05-16T13:23:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	/usr/lib/gnome-panel/notification-area-applet
2011-05-16T13:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	which one?
2011-05-16T13:24:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	this is strange. I killed them and got a gnome bug saying it quit unexpectedly and needed to reload. volume and all that responded normally though
2011-05-16T13:25:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	what exactly did you kill?
2011-05-16T13:26:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	notification-area-applet and gdu-notification-daemon
2011-05-16T13:27:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	what do you have?
2011-05-16T13:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	gdu-notification-daemon
2011-05-16T13:28:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	and another one with an ID of 3195 .... but I cannot locate it in System Monitor
2011-05-16T13:31:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	well I don't know if it would help but you could try restarting it. I am looking in Add to panel for what controls sound volume and can't find anything at all. Hmm
2011-05-16T13:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	restarting helps 1 time out of 10 ... tried that a lot ;)
2011-05-16T13:33:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	Darn. So your volume control doesn't work at all?
2011-05-16T13:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	it's not really that ... here is my description https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/783354
2011-05-16T13:40:00.000Z	beta0x64	zetheroo	what do you think is wrong?
2011-05-16T15:19:00.000Z	zetheroo	beta0x64	I think I found out what the issue was ... sorta
