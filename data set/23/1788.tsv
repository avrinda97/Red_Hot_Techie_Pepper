2009-11-20T05:55:00.000Z	pixie_pie		can anyone tell me the fastest way to install ubuntu lts on my vmware?
2009-11-20T05:56:00.000Z	pixie_pie		and what is the latest lts ?
2009-11-20T05:56:00.000Z	pixie_pie		thanks
2009-11-20T05:57:00.000Z	pixie_pie		sorry, arand, but can you clarify what is the vm image and how can i know it is a safe website to download this from?
2009-11-20T05:58:00.000Z	pixie_pie		and if you know of a safe site, can you recommend one to me?
2009-11-20T05:58:00.000Z	yacc_	pixie_pie	the vmware website should have some images.
2009-11-20T05:58:00.000Z	pixie_pie		thanks
2009-11-20T05:59:00.000Z	yacc_	pixie_pie	http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/cat/508
2009-11-20T05:59:00.000Z	pixie_pie		thanks yacc_
2009-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	pixie_pie	yacc_	sorry... just a few more questions.  On this site, there is LTS Server and Desktop and also there apear to be different "brands", Linhost, WMPlanet, etc
2009-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	pixie_pie		How do I know which one to get?
2009-11-20T06:02:00.000Z	yacc_		brands == people who have made it.
2009-11-20T06:02:00.000Z	yacc_	pixie_pie	browse and see which one you like, kind of.
2009-11-20T06:02:00.000Z	pixie_pie	yacc_	so that could be.... a security issue, no?  isn't it safer to burn the iso image?
2009-11-20T06:02:00.000Z	yacc_		LTS == LongTermSupport
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	yacc_	pixie_pie	it's safer, but you have to install it yourself.
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie	yacc_	ok i think i'll do the lts then
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie		from iso
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie		thanks
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie		hm wait
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie		if you were me, yacc_ would you choose vmPlanet or LinHost... and LTS or server =)
2009-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	pixie_pie		thanks
2009-11-20T06:04:00.000Z	yacc_	pixie_pie	as I happen to have a collection of CD images lying around on my disc, I'd just install it normally ;)
