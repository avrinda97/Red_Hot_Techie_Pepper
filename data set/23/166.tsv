2012-09-12T21:08:00.000Z	tarwich		Does wheezy use xorg.conf? I'm trying to prevent my monitor from going black every ten minutes and it doesn't seem to read /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-09-12T21:09:00.000Z	tarwich		Hmm… I'm on ubu. Don't know how to get version
2012-09-12T21:10:00.000Z	tarwich		Does precise use xorg.conf? I'm trying to prevent my monitor from going black every ten minutes and it doesn't seem to read /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-09-12T21:12:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	if you create it, it should.  But see wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config
2012-09-12T21:13:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	Thanks. On it....
2012-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	also, those settings should be accessible through the display/monitor/power saving gui
2012-09-12T21:16:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	Everything in that GUI is turned completely off. I'm running the desktop on tty7 and a terminal on tty3. However, I'm controlling tty3 through ssh, so the system isn't getting any mouse/keypresses, so the monitor keeps going off.
2012-09-12T21:17:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	(And I've rebooted after turning the settings off)
2012-09-12T21:17:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	tty3 has X?
2012-09-12T21:18:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	Check out the various options to setterm (though I don't know how one saves these).  I would see if it does what you want first though, and then worry about saving
2012-09-12T21:18:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	tty3 is just a plain text console. But when I google "monitor blanking every 10 minutes" people suggest setterm -powersave off, which gives me an error that google says is related to the tty7 having X on it.
2012-09-12T21:18:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	what error?
2012-09-12T21:21:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	hmm, I can usually run "setterm -powersave off -blank 0" ok with X on tty7.  But I guess I would also play with xset /in/ X since those are the settings you'll be manipulating with xorg.conf I believe.  This way you can see if it works without having to restart X
2012-09-12T21:22:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	 Ok… I think I can actually run that command in a terminal inside tty7. Any obvious way to query the result to see if it's taking effect in tty3? ('course I could always wait 10 minutes)
2012-09-12T21:23:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	well the setterm you ran in tty3, right?
2012-09-12T21:24:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	The one that failed, yes. I'm trying it in tty7 now.
2012-09-12T21:24:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	xset q   will give you the current status (there are a bunch of options about blanking and powersave in the man page)
2012-09-12T21:29:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	Ok. from tty7 I ran qset -dpms, then sqet -q and it shows dpms off. However, from tty3, qset sais invalid display. I'll wait 10 minutes and see what happens.
2012-09-12T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	you mean xset?
2012-09-12T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	xset will only work inside X, yes
2012-09-12T21:31:00.000Z	jrib	tarwich	check for plain screen blanking too
2012-09-12T21:32:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	Yes. I meant xset. And… Blanking was in there (set to off). Then when I disabled DPMS it went away, so I'm pretty sure that killed it. Just waiting now.
2012-09-12T21:44:00.000Z	tarwich	jrib	fail. :-( Going to give the url that watukka sent a shot.
