2005-04-21T10:27:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	just give them time
2005-04-21T10:27:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I've been using Debian since Bo.. and this last round has just made me bitter
2005-04-21T10:28:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I almost switched my box to RHEL (CentOS)
2005-04-21T10:29:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	lol, i would be comfy my self using sarge on a server
2005-04-21T10:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I'm on a sarge box right now
2005-04-21T10:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	it turns out, I was getting weekly crashes because of the Debian 2.6.8.1 kernel, I switched to Ubuntu 2.6.10-5 and everything is better now
2005-04-21T10:30:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	really? what were you running?
2005-04-21T10:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I installed my new dual opteron last May, with sarge/2.6.7
2005-04-21T10:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I was fine for a while, I upgraded to 2.6.8 for production, and it was crashing weekly
2005-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I took it out of production, and put in a replacement dual athlon
2005-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	that crashed ever 2 weeks, I replaced the kernel with horay's about 2 months ago.. no more issues
2005-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	weird, well i guess i haveto admit it can happen even on debian :)
2005-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	it's been crazy trying to debug the problem
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	just curious what tasks was the server performing?
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	the system doesn't produce any error logs, it simply stops sawning new procs
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	web/mail/irc
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	about 30 active shell accounts, and 80 virtual domains
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	I could be loged in with ssh, and running irssi.. and I could chat
2005-04-21T10:32:00.000Z	holy_cow	SuperQ	oh so pretty damned busy eh?
2005-04-21T10:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	but if I tried to open a new screen, bash would never load
2005-04-21T10:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	it was WAY wierd
2005-04-21T10:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	and frustrating, because the only thing I could do was drive down to the colo rack and sys-req the box down
2005-04-21T10:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	holy_cow	and reboot it
