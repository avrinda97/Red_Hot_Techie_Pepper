2010-01-28T20:31:00.000Z	grubnoob		I'm having trouble in Grub after I restored the files on my computer
2010-01-28T20:32:00.000Z	grubnoob		How do I fix Grub in 8.10 without wiping affecting the other files I restored?
2010-01-28T20:33:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	"Fix" in what way?
2010-01-28T20:35:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	Which version of the liveCD?
2010-01-28T20:37:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	ok this is the standard way to restore grub: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/360722/
2010-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	you were using grub as the primary bootloader right?
2010-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	and 8.10 is still installed somewhere (although unable to boot at the moment)?
2010-01-28T20:40:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	Will this overwrite everything I just restored?
2010-01-28T20:41:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	it may be that the secondary stages of the bootloader has changed position on the disk, hence the mbr points to the wrong direction. These command will only overwrite the 466bytes of the mbr.
2010-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	response is (hd0,0)
2010-01-28T20:43:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	then use that in the "root.."  command
2010-01-28T20:44:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	Thank you.  I will now reboot to see if that works.
2010-01-28T20:44:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	good luck!
2010-01-28T21:12:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	stage1 is in fact the data which is placed in the mbr (note that stage1 is only 512bytes = the size of the mbr)
2010-01-28T21:02:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	It didn't work.
2010-01-28T21:03:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	still the same error?
2010-01-28T21:05:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	hmm, then I'm unsure, sorry.
2010-01-28T21:06:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	What is the name of the file it's supposed to look for?
2010-01-28T21:08:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	I think the grub mbr looks for the /boot/grub/stage2 file for further loading of grub..
2010-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	What does stage1 do?
2010-01-28T21:15:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	I don't know, but to restore them the best way would probably be reinstalling grub.
2010-01-28T21:16:00.000Z	grubnoob	arand	How do I do that?
2010-01-28T21:21:00.000Z	arand	grubnoob	first mount sda1 as /media/something , and then run the grub-install with --root-directory=/media/something and /dev/sda as the "mbr location"
