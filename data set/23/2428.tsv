2009-03-18T01:45:00.000Z	ZenMasta		can someone help me mount an NTFS drive? sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 doesn't work for me
2009-03-18T01:46:00.000Z	ZenMasta		I mean... sudo mount -t ntfs /media/sata /dev/sda1 (it says Error opening '/media/sata': Is a directory
2009-03-18T01:46:00.000Z	ZenMasta		Failed to mount '/media/sata': Is a directory
2009-03-18T01:48:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	you are doing it the wrong way, exchange /media/sata and /dev...
2009-03-18T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	pastebin the output of mount, please
2009-07-04T01:58:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	but I'm using an old version that wont support ebox and until I can upgrade I'm stuck
2009-07-04T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	its up to you, just wanted to tell you - anyway the standard port is 10000 and webmin will tell you its port right after installation
2009-07-04T02:00:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	yep, I appreciate it, I'm sure as soon as I can upgrade to a NON EOL dist I'll switch, but 10000 isnt' working for me and I can't find a config that might tell me
2009-07-04T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	gimme a minute
2009-07-04T02:01:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	I found the config and it shows 10000 as the listen so its gotta be a firewall issue
2009-07-04T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	ok, but there is a configuration option too, to tell from what IP-address you are allowed to connect
2009-07-04T02:03:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	I don't see that in the config I'm pretty sure I wouldn' t have specified an ip because I'm not static
2009-07-04T02:05:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	as workaround: you have ssh access, and your local machine is linux?
2009-07-04T02:06:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	yeah ssh or vnc
2009-07-04T02:07:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	so you can start a browser on the remote machine and try to access webmin from there
2009-07-04T02:07:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	yeah just tried it, http://localhost:10000 didn't work
2009-07-04T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	did you sudo /etc/init.d/webmin start?
2009-07-04T02:08:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	yes I did
2009-07-04T02:09:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	doin again for redundancy
2009-07-04T02:11:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	have a look at the output of lsof -i
2009-07-04T02:13:00.000Z	ZenMasta	guntbert	thanks for that, I see the port now. it wasn't default :P but also I forgot I had to use https
2009-07-04T02:14:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	glad it worked out
2010-06-02T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	ZenMasta	where/when do you get it?
