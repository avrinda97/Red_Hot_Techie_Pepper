2008-10-28T02:07:00.000Z	seij0		but yeah, is DWL-520+ supported? Also, how do I get the wireless network manager to show? I only see the dial-up option and I installed the windows XP driver AIRPLUS.INF just now..
2008-10-28T02:08:00.000Z	seij0		is my card supported? is there another way I should go about installing it? also, how can I get the manager for the wireless up?
2008-10-28T02:08:00.000Z	seij0		also I heard that it would work on Ubuntu 5.10 that the drivers were supported, is that true?

2008-10-28T02:11:00.000Z	seij0		No, I meant 5.10
2008-10-28T02:11:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	That ubuntu was release in ocotober 2005 and has not been supported for years now...
2008-10-28T02:13:00.000Z	seij0	toomai	yes but I'm not sure how to get my D-LINK dwl-520+ working in 8.10
2008-10-28T02:13:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	are you able to download a live cd of 8.04.1 or 8.10? So you might try that first
2008-10-28T02:14:00.000Z	seij0	toomai	i did that, ubuntu is up. there's no wireless options
2008-10-28T02:14:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	what does lspci say?
2008-10-28T02:15:00.000Z	seij0	toomai	lo: no wirless detected.. something like that
2008-10-28T02:15:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	you know how to use the terminal?
2008-10-28T02:15:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	okay, try to paste the output of lscpi at nopaste
2008-10-28T02:17:00.000Z	seij0	toomai	the lspci command is: lspci | grep -i network; correct?
2008-10-28T02:17:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	I would just use lspci to make sure you have everything
2008-10-28T02:21:00.000Z	seij0	toomai	http://paste.ubuntu.com/63430/
2008-10-28T02:22:00.000Z	toomai	seij0	your wireless adapter...is it usb?
