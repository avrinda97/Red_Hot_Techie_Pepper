2004-11-15T11:25:00.000Z	billytwowilly		so is 2.9 the gnome devel release or is it an actual new release?
2004-11-15T11:26:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	odd minor numbers indicate development releases
2004-11-15T11:35:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	debian runlevels do not work the same way as red hat runlevels.
2004-11-15T11:35:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	the error you're getting with the wmv files is a bug that needs to be fixed.
2004-11-15T11:35:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	can I turn off that prompt? that's just irritating. I know if I'm opening something that will mess up my system too bad or not;)
2004-11-15T11:36:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	no, it's a bug that needs to be fixed.
2004-11-15T11:37:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	yah, it seems like they put it in on purpose, but then forgot that wmv has asf video. I'd like to just turn it off.
2004-12-04T12:54:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	yes
2004-12-04T12:57:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	no
2004-12-04T12:58:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	neither is reiser3 :)
2004-12-13T07:06:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	difference in objectives between the projects
2004-12-13T07:07:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	what differences?
2004-12-19T10:15:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	read the email...
2004-12-19T10:13:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	those are the standard gnome menus - we've reverted to those for the time being due to the new gnome menu system
2004-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	they will not stay that way
2004-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	ok, cool.
2004-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	ubuntu-devel has the new structure proposal, which will be cool and new
2004-12-19T10:15:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	I look forward to our new ubuntu-devel structure overlords;)
2004-12-19T10:15:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	There will still be directory links though right?
2004-12-19T10:15:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	got a link?
2004-12-19T10:16:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	lists.ubuntu.com, follow the links
2004-12-19T10:21:00.000Z	jdub	billytwowilly	'pile of crap' is not particularly polite
2004-12-19T10:22:00.000Z	billytwowilly	jdub	sorry, I didn't have time to write that it seems slow, doesn't update in a uniform way, doesn't have a good icon setup (all icons are the same)
