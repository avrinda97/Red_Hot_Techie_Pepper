2007-02-04T15:49:00.000Z	dda		hi everyone, I'm on 6.06 on amd64, how do I install firefox2?
2007-02-04T15:49:00.000Z	soundray	dda	you don't. Stick with 1.5, or upgrade to edgy
2007-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	dda	soundray	thanks. but it sounds too restrictive. pardon me, but in windows I can install both easily!
2007-02-04T15:52:00.000Z	soundray	dda	the advantages that ubuntu has over that proprietary OS you are mentioning are partly due to the fact that ubuntu keeps to a timetable
2007-02-04T15:53:00.000Z	soundray	dda	ff2 just doesn't fit in well with dapper. Yes, you can install it, but it will be a hack and will make it difficult to keep up with security fixes.
2007-02-04T15:54:00.000Z	dda	soundray	i see.. actualy I upgraded from 5.10 to 6.06, it was a lot of downloads (I received 5.10 CDs by post), and now I downloaded 6.10 and it's installer wont start X on my laptop! So, I decided to stay for a while on 6.06 (it's LTS, right?), but I'd like to have FF2, as it is really nicer than 1.5.
2007-02-04T15:56:00.000Z	soundray	dda	did you get the desktop or alternate of 6.10?
2007-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	dda	soundray	I downloaded CD ISO image, yes, correct, desktop
2007-02-04T16:00:00.000Z	dda	soundray	it did not detect my laptop monitor properly, I tried to edit xorg.conf, but without success
2007-02-04T16:00:00.000Z	soundray	dda	have you tried the 'vga=771' boot option?
2007-02-04T16:03:00.000Z	dda	soundray	yes, first time I was unable to switch to any text console (they were unreadable), then I specified correct VGA mode, and text consoles become accesible, and I tried to tweak xorg.conf, analyze X logfile, but then gave up.
2007-02-04T16:04:00.000Z	soundray	dda	sorry to hear that. What type of laptop is it?
2007-02-04T16:06:00.000Z	dda	soundray	MSI 635. And 5.10 installed our of the box! Moreover, I installed 5.10 64 bit, then upgraded to 6.06 64 bit, and no I decided to install fresh 6.10 32 bit, because I found that too many things are not available for 64 bit... E.g. some audio codecs, flash player, opera, etc...
2007-02-04T16:07:00.000Z	dda	soundray	s/no/now
2007-02-04T16:08:00.000Z	soundray	dda	it's probably worth searching on tuxmobil.de for reports on edgy installations on your particular model
2007-02-04T16:09:00.000Z	soundray	dda	for me, breezy, dapper and edgy worked on a Megabook 270
2007-02-04T16:09:00.000Z	dda	soundray	okay, I will, thanks. but anyway, somehow I can install FF2 in /usr/local and run it from there? :)
2007-02-04T16:10:00.000Z	dda	soundray	I unedrstood that FF2 will not be included in 6.06 repos...
2007-02-04T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	dda	yes, you can use the installer from mozilla.org -- it'll put it in /opt I think
2007-02-04T16:11:00.000Z	dda	soundray	thanks again for your help!
2007-02-04T16:11:00.000Z	soundray	dda	yw
2007-02-04T16:19:00.000Z	dda	soundray	btw, http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html says: "Firefox 1.5: This version of Firefox will be supported until April 24, 2007 with security and stability updates. We strongly encourage all users to upgrade to Firefox 2." So, should FF2 be added to 6.06 repositories (theoretically)?
2007-02-04T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	dda	that's a developer decision
