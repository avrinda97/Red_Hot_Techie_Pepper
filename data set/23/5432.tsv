2007-12-22T18:42:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	do you have a router on your network?
2007-12-22T18:45:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	true, don't need port forwarding between the two local pcs, however most routers will not let you use the public IP, unless it supports "nat reflection"
2008-01-12T21:44:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	first of all, you can leave the port 22 for both, and add a separate higher port, which is a good idea not to expose 22 or 23 publically
2008-01-12T21:45:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	but how about showing us the command you are using to connect?
2008-01-12T21:45:00.000Z	kr0n1x	astro76	it doesn't work with 22 in both pc too, anyway how can i try higher port?
2008-01-12T21:46:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	what command are you using to connect?
2008-01-12T21:46:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	if it's not 22, you have to do ssh -p <portnumber> user@address
2008-01-12T21:46:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	also to check if the name resolves, try nslookup <name>
2008-01-12T21:47:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	can you ping that address?
2008-01-12T21:48:00.000Z	kr0n1x	astro76	it shows this line and stay as is: PING 192.168.1.174 (192.168.1.174) 56(84) bytes of data.
2008-01-12T21:49:00.000Z	kr0n1x	astro76	i stopped the ping and it says: 98 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 97193ms
2008-01-12T21:50:00.000Z	astro76	kr0n1x	so the problem isn't ssh at all
2008-01-12T21:50:00.000Z	kr0n1x	astro76	maybe is some firewall rules? i installed Ubuntu Server today... no rules edited. fresh installation!
