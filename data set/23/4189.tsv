2007-11-01T03:00:00.000Z	dissection		Can anyone help me get my cd/dvd drive to work in Ubuntu?
2007-11-01T03:01:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	what's the problem?
2007-11-01T03:01:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	It doesn't mount, says the device does not exist
2007-11-01T03:03:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	does your bios recognizes the dvd?
2007-11-01T03:03:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	Yes, the drive is working. Works in Windows, and the Ubuntu Live CD works
2007-11-01T03:06:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	what does your fstab say about your cdrom?
2007-11-01T03:08:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	/dev/hda        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec     0       0
2007-11-01T03:09:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	try fdisk -l /dev/hda to see what it says
2007-11-01T03:10:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	make sure a cd is in the drive
2007-11-01T03:11:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	also try "mount | grep /dev/hda" maybe it's mounted
2007-11-01T03:12:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	It doesn't say anything
2007-11-01T03:13:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	try making an iso by reading the drive directly, this way we know if linux is accesing the drive at all, "dd if=/dev/hda of=test.iso"
2007-11-01T03:15:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	You mean create an ISO using a different OS?
2007-11-01T03:15:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	no in the Ubuntu terminal, put any cd and type the command in the terminal, if you see the light blnking the it's accessing the drive
2007-11-01T03:16:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	It says /dev/hda no such file or directory
2007-11-01T03:17:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	Still the same, /dev/cdrom no such file or directory
2007-11-01T03:22:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	Are you still here?
2007-11-01T03:23:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	yes
2007-11-01T03:23:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	try lshw as root
2007-11-01T03:23:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	"sudo lshw > output.txt"
2007-11-01T03:27:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	did you run the lshw?
2007-11-01T03:29:00.000Z	dissection	Jupp2	my lshw output: http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=5912
2007-11-01T03:32:00.000Z	Jupp2	dissection	sorry don't know what to tell you looks like ubuntu is now seeing you dvd at all. keep asking in the chanel, sorry
