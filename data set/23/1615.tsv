2010-01-04T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	laptop wiki says it all works well on a Dell 1011. Let me keep digging
2010-01-04T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	speed
2010-01-04T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	well its downloading from multiple people so will be notably faster, it also allows users to download off you which eases strain on the servers
2010-01-04T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	do you have the latest bios in your Dell?
2010-01-04T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	lshw shows if the system tells it
2010-01-04T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	try: sudo lshw | head -n 20
2010-01-04T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	it will tell you
2010-01-04T03:06:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	Bios physical ID: 1
2010-01-04T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	lshw    says you have version A06 of your BIOS, you should see if there is a newer one
2010-01-04T03:08:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	I think its the latest. I just got it on christmas.
2010-01-04T03:10:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	i think i ran an exe on ubuntu once
2010-01-04T03:10:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	chmod +x
2010-01-04T03:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	can be ran with wine too ;)
2010-01-04T03:12:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	What if i just copy my sd contents into my home dir and then formaat it to FAT again?
2010-01-04T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sn[a]ke	worth a try, maybe its a bug with the current kernel. have you tried an older one
2010-01-04T03:13:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	ActionParsnip	no
