2008-12-12T05:20:00.000Z	redshadowhero		does anyone know how to install previous versions of flash?
2008-12-12T05:20:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	why are you trying to do that
2008-12-12T05:20:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	just yet more bugs
2008-12-12T05:21:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	well, flash stops loading on many youtube sites, and I've seen the suggestion of doing back to flash 8 (or 9, can't remember)
2008-12-12T05:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	What are you currently using?
2008-12-12T05:22:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	actually, its for a friend. My 'buntu laptop is currently in a few pieces. He's running 8.04, though.
2008-12-12T05:23:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	"adobe-flashplugin" is what you should be looking for
2008-12-12T05:23:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	lets check that; hold on a sec.
2008-12-12T05:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	I dont know about 8.04 but I have it in the "partners" repository.. its the best version your likely to get yet
2008-12-12T05:26:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	could you give me the exact repository line to add to the list? I'm talking to him through MSN, and I don't exactly have a 'buntu machine around to test with.
2008-12-12T05:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	It will not work for 8.04 I am on intrepid.. let me see if there is a ppa
2008-12-12T05:28:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	ah. Thanks for being patient with me, though.
2008-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	well we may have to use the adobe package itself :(
2008-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	from the site, or the repositories?
2008-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	seems there is no repo for flash 10 on hardy.. none that I can find anyway
2008-12-12T05:31:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	alright.
2008-12-12T05:32:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	I'm telling him to get it from the site right now. Looks like they have a .deb installer.
2008-12-12T05:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	good news.. there is a .deb on the adobe website http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
2008-12-12T05:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	ah you got it :)
2008-12-12T05:32:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	only one step ahead of ya this time :P
2008-12-12T05:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	redshadowhero	always good to hear :)
2008-12-12T05:33:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	I'm not that *bad* with *nix, but its hard when I don't have a 'buntu machine lying around, and I can't physically/remotely touch the machine in question, that's all.
2008-12-12T05:44:00.000Z	redshadowhero	Paddy_EIRE	it looks like they already had that installed, and their videos are still freezing on youtube.
