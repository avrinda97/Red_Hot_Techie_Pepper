2009-06-30T14:29:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	well i met the guy from amarok on LinuxDay in Berlin and they told me to sync music should be work for ipod touch
2009-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	so why not give a try to the iphone
2009-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	wers	AbyssGer	i'm on an ipod touch, actually. it's just that, os 3.0 broke that hack, afaik
2009-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	i couldnt verify that theorie but you can give it a try
2009-06-30T14:31:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	if not i jailbreaked my touch to get ssh and sftp access to upload my music
2009-06-30T14:32:00.000Z	wers	AbyssGer	ooh. i'll try that. mine is jailbroken but i dont know ssh yet
2009-06-30T14:32:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	if you jailbreaked it already then you can get that openssh package from cydia
2009-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	wers	AbyssGer	thanks! i already have cydia :D
2009-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	AbyssGer	wers	and for a "howto connect" read the package description
2009-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	wers	AbyssGer	so you're familiar with it. are you on os 3.0?
2009-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	wers		i guess, i can transfer files but they wont appear on ipod.app
