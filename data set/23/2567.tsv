2009-01-23T22:13:00.000Z	InvaderZim		I'm running Xubuntu on an old pentium2.  works great, but today i logged on and resolution is outta whack
2009-01-23T22:14:00.000Z	InvaderZim		reccommended resolution used to be an option in settings manager, but now it's gone.  how do i get back to my reccommended resolution?
2009-01-23T22:14:00.000Z	booksbuggy	InvaderZim	hmm did you try to edit the resolution?
2009-01-23T22:16:00.000Z	booksbuggy	InvaderZim	hmmm i haven't tried to use xfce for a while

2009-01-23T22:18:00.000Z	InvaderZim	booksbuggy	was there some set of commands to fix it through the CLI?
2009-01-23T22:18:00.000Z	booksbuggy	InvaderZim	well last time i went into the resolution txt in the place to edit the things
2009-01-23T22:18:00.000Z	booksbuggy	InvaderZim	which kind of worked for sometime
2009-01-23T22:19:00.000Z	InvaderZim	booksbuggy	?
2009-01-23T22:19:00.000Z	booksbuggy	InvaderZim	well lets just said it didn't last long before the thing jumped back to that distorted resolution
2009-01-23T22:21:00.000Z	InvaderZim	booksbuggy	 thing is, it was at the right resolution for quite some time.  and now that option is gone.  how do i get it back?
