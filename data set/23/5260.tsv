2007-01-27T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	you have to ask a question first
2007-02-11T11:42:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	the instructions are rubbish
2007-02-11T11:32:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	have you configured it
2007-02-11T11:33:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	I suggest thats wrong or you have to do a make -F makefile
2007-02-11T11:35:00.000Z	jussi01	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5273/
2007-02-11T11:35:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	show me the dir your are typing make from
2007-02-11T11:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	can you please do an "ls Makefile" in that dir please
2007-02-11T11:37:00.000Z	jussi01	ikonia	jussi@jussi-laptop:~/gsopcast-0.2.10$ ls Makefile
2007-02-11T11:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	there is no make file
2007-02-11T11:38:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	well you need the make file, but this isn't an ubuntu problem
2007-02-11T11:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	the application owner
2007-02-11T11:41:00.000Z	jussi01	ikonia	there is a Makefile.am and Makefile.in in the directory though...
2007-02-11T11:41:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	is there a ocnfiugre script
2007-02-11T11:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	you need to contact the developers and ask them to update their instructions
2008-07-12T19:30:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	speak in english only please.
2008-07-12T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	please speak in english only
2009-08-03T16:43:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	the selected area - not the unslectd area ?
2009-08-03T16:44:00.000Z	jussi01	ikonia	hrm, I used the wand to get the selection. its a little weird
2009-08-03T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	I can do it back to front - but not how you're asking
2009-08-03T16:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jussi01	cut the object and paste it onto a new background, but mark the background as "transparant"
