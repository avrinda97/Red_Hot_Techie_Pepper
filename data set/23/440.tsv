2011-08-21T20:19:00.000Z	valthyx		hello, i have a problem with my wireless connection in thinkpad T420
2011-08-21T20:19:00.000Z	valthyx		i just installed ubuntu and could not use see any wireless card/interface
2011-08-21T20:20:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	what's wrong with it, mine worked out of the box on my T420
2011-08-21T20:20:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	i was using windows, and just installed ubuntu today
2011-08-21T20:21:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	what wifi card do you have? make sure to have the hardware killswitch enabled (right side, just behind the optical drive). you may also try pressing Fn+F5 until the wifi led turns on
2011-08-21T20:22:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	and I've heard that if you disabled the wifi card in windows it may for some laptops not be visible from Linux after a reboot
2011-08-21T20:22:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	well, does lspci say something about a "Intel Corporation Centrino Ultimate-N 6300" controller or something?
2011-08-21T20:22:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	i have enabled in windows. i was using it. everything is on.
2011-08-21T20:27:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	"network controller: intel corporation 6000 series gen2" and "communication controller: intel corporation cougar point heci controller #1"
2011-08-21T20:28:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	actually, only the first one ;-)
2011-08-21T20:29:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	well, I have the 6300 and it worked right out of the box with the iwlwifi kernel driver
2011-08-21T20:29:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	you can try to load that manually (sudo modprobe iwlwifi) and see if there are any errors in dmesg output
2011-08-21T20:29:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	alright, will try now
2011-08-21T20:30:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	module iwlwifi not found
2011-08-21T20:31:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	err, sorry, it's called iwlagn
2011-08-21T20:31:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	same, not found "iwlagn"
2011-08-21T20:33:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	that's strange, according to dpkg, my module is from linux-image-3.0.0-8-generic (I use the kernel from oneiric because of UEFI), so it should come with linux-image-generic
2011-08-21T20:34:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	is there any way to find the module and install/
2011-08-21T20:34:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=iwlagn.ko&mode=exactfilename&suite=natty&arch=any
2011-08-21T20:36:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	um, if you have a linux kernel (and you should have one when you can boot the system ;-)), you should also have this module. Unless something went terribly wrong... you could try "sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic"
2011-08-21T20:37:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	it is actually backbuntu
2011-08-21T20:38:00.000Z	tommie-lie	valthyx	um, which means?
2011-08-21T20:39:00.000Z	valthyx	tommie-lie	it is not the full ubuntu, it is a "relative" of ubuntu
