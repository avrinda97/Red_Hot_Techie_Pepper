2006-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	rabidphage		Anybody here who has done some kernel compiling???
2006-06-12T10:56:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	sure
2006-06-12T10:56:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	how long does it take to configure the kernel
2006-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	Any ideas??
2006-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	depends on how many options you decide to modify
2006-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	anywhere from a few minutes to several hours
2006-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	So is the defaults selected already?? i havent started configuring .. just done the source patching
2006-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	it is fun to go through the entire kernel config at least once, reading the descriptions as you go, so you can be aware of what the Linux kernel is actually capable of these days ... course that's the method that will take you half a day =p
2006-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	if all you want to do is change one or two options, use the distros kernel as your base
2006-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	grab the kernel config out of /boot to start with in that case
2006-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	copy it to your /usr/src/linux/.config
2006-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	yup i'm using the distro base kernel. coz i'm a noob and i don't know much about acpi and stuff. the vanilla seems to be in the dark regarding such finer points ;)
2006-06-12T11:07:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	so does that mean in order to get the defaults, it is mandatory to copy the old .config from /boot to /usr/src/linux/.config???
2006-06-12T11:09:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	unless Ubuntu placed it there for you already, yes
2006-06-12T11:09:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	I am new to Ubuntu, so I am not sure of the specific method of custom compile here
2006-06-12T11:10:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	the best method would be to build a kernel package, though.  that way synaptic (or whatever package manager you use) would show your custom kernel as installed
2006-06-12T11:10:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	Thanks a lot mate..
2006-06-12T11:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	there will surely be a page on the Wiki explaining the proper way to configure and compile a custom kernel
2006-06-12T11:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	I strongly recommend doing a search there
2006-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	i've been looking around. no luck so far..
2006-06-12T11:15:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelBuildpackageDetailedHowto
2006-06-12T11:15:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	rabidphage	there you go: "How-to create a custom Ubuntu Linux kernel package"
2006-06-12T11:20:00.000Z	rabidphage	Samus_Aran	update xconfig running and man its amazing...... wow.........
