2005-12-24T13:54:00.000Z	uscfan		ok i got the deb file and ran the command 'sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb' but it gives an error
2005-12-24T13:54:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	want to tell us the error?
2005-12-24T13:55:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	if it's a line or two it's ok
2005-12-24T13:57:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	was about to suggest that to you
2005-12-24T13:59:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	they aren't legal in every country
2005-12-24T14:00:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	where are you downloading from?
2005-12-24T14:02:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	do: md5sum w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb, and paste the result here
2005-12-24T14:05:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	are you sure the file had finished downloading when you were runnning the command?
2005-12-24T14:05:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	because I get a different md5sum
2005-12-24T14:06:00.000Z	uscfan	_jason	shadox: the one i downloaded is working just fine now, it installed i would presume no errors
2005-12-24T14:07:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	can you md5sum again and tell me if it's different, just to quench my curiousity please
2005-12-24T14:07:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	use totem-xine or mplayer
2005-12-24T14:07:00.000Z	uscfan	_jason	i will run the md5thing on all of em
2005-12-24T14:08:00.000Z	_jason	uscfan	yeah that one is right
