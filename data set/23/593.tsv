2011-10-12T01:34:00.000Z	dageriv		I know my computer is Acer Aspire, but how can I find out which model is it?
2011-10-12T01:34:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	laptop?
2011-11-01T06:46:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	http://www.google.com/search?q=tar%20extract%20specific%20file welcome to the internet
2011-11-01T06:47:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	i want to extract everything, but i dont want all those folders when i extract, i only want the "files" folder
2011-11-01T06:47:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	ah
2011-11-01T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	and it's too much trouble to cd there first?
2011-11-01T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	heh, okay
2011-11-01T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	that'd be -C
2011-11-01T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	no you are
2011-11-01T06:51:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	when i run tar -czf files.tar.gz ~/Documents/files, the tar contains all those folders /home/user/Documents/files, but i simply want the tarbaøø to contain the folder "files"
2011-11-01T06:51:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	yes I understood you eventually, you want -C
2011-11-01T06:53:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	tar -czf files.tar.gz files -C ~/Documents
2011-11-01T06:54:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	see last
2011-11-01T07:03:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	-C is not what im looking for. i want tar -czf lal.tar.gz files to NOT include the whole folder hierarchy
2011-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	well then you need a shell script and an alias, have fun
2011-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	perhaps you could use 7z instead, it supports the same formats, AIUI
2011-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	but i have seen other tarballs which does not contain the home folder neither the user folder. they simply contain the folder which was tarballed. how can i do this? each time i tar something, my /home and my user folder, and all other directories leading to the folder i want to tar
2011-11-01T07:17:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	I already told you
2011-11-01T07:20:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	are you sure you understand what i am trying to do? it seems to me, that you think, that i want to extract parts of a tarball. i only want to create a tarball containg onlt the folder which i tarballed, not a tarball containg home/user/folder_to_be_tarballed
2011-11-01T07:20:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	that was somsip not me
2011-11-01T07:21:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	I already told you how to get what you want, in various ways
2011-11-01T07:25:00.000Z	dageriv	reisio	after rereading your chat, i finally understood how it worked. thank you
2011-11-01T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	dageriv	:D
