2008-06-03T09:13:00.000Z	n838901		i have a problem with compiz...
2008-06-03T09:13:00.000Z	n838901		hmm
2008-06-03T09:14:00.000Z	n838901		well, for some reason, i have to manually start compiz after i login
2008-06-03T09:15:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 have you tried adding it to your startup programs?
2008-06-03T09:15:00.000Z	n838901	Bllz	i've never had to before.  did something change with some updates?
2008-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 i don't believe so, but when I was running 7.10, something similar happened and i just worked around the issue that way
2008-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	n838901		ahh
2008-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	n838901	Bllz	is a firewall blocking smb for you?
2008-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 well if so not until today.  it was working fine yesterday
2008-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	Bllz		or was that two days ago?
2008-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	n838901	Bllz	what happened exactly?
2008-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 the only think that may have changed since then (i can't remember if htis was before or after my smb shares were created) was switch my actiontec router to bridge mode sot hat i could use a WRT54GL with Tomato
2008-06-03T09:18:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 i have the shares set up, but Vista says that the server does not exist or that it is misspelled.  It's not misspelled and I have the shares set up so I'm trying to figure out which OS (or router) is at fault
2008-06-03T09:19:00.000Z	n838901	Bllz	hmm.. not familiar with Tomato. i run DD-WRT on mine.  did you run 'testparm' to check your smb.conf for errors?
2008-06-03T09:19:00.000Z	Bllz	n838901	 no.  do i just type sudo testparm?
2008-06-03T09:19:00.000Z	n838901		yes
2008-06-03T09:20:00.000Z	Bllz		Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
