2006-12-03T16:56:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Many thanks....
2006-12-03T16:57:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Ohhh, very nice indeed, thank you so much.....  bbiab.
2006-12-03T16:57:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	:)
2006-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	use a css editor i suppose, or you can google for it. opera's help database has a lot of useful stuff
2006-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	the opera help forum is pretty nice as well
2006-12-03T14:03:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	just use somebody else's css file or modify one to suit your wishes
2006-12-03T14:04:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	Preferences/Web Pages might work
2006-12-03T14:05:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Well....
2006-12-03T14:06:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	When I do it there, fine. As the new page starts it goes to the color of choice, but then defaults to the bright white background....... Ugggh.......   But I'd also like a different shade here in the IRC as well.....    I will do more research, thanks.....
2006-12-03T14:09:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	go back to the pages I gave you earlier, or if you think its too complicated there are tons of irc programs you can use
2006-12-03T14:10:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	I use opera but I don't use it for IRC unless i'm in a pinch
2006-12-03T14:10:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Thanks. I really prefer this Opera
2006-12-03T14:11:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	I just need to read & learn more I guess. . .  This white background is overwhelming and boring to say the least...... I prefer something softer. . .  But thanks for the help as well..... ..
2006-12-03T14:13:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStyles/ ... just use one of their styles or modify it, like i said
2006-12-03T14:14:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Yep thanks. I tried that also, but as usual, I'm a dumb dumb.....    I will keep working on this issue, thanks. . . . .
2006-12-03T14:14:00.000Z	nothlit	Spee_Der	http://webtoman.com/opera/custom/custom_chat.php some more here too
2006-12-03T14:14:00.000Z	Spee_Der	nothlit	Thanks.....
