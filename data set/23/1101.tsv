2010-08-31T10:40:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Apparently it's v1.98, but it's still linux; but at least I've gotten past the error
2010-11-08T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	You probably want to use a distributed revision controll system like git or bzr.
2010-11-08T04:47:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Can I keep my code private?
2010-11-08T04:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	Yes.
2010-11-08T04:48:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Thanks a bunch, I'll look into the rest myself
2010-11-08T04:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	You're welcome.
2010-11-08T05:06:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Not working out as planned. It appears that I require a server, and I don't think I can get into the trouble of setting one up
2010-11-08T05:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	You don't need a server, that's part of the advantage of using a distributed RCS.
2010-11-08T05:08:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Then how would I share the code between computers?
2010-11-08T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	Create a repository on the desktop, do some work and make some commits. Pull that repository to the laptop, either over the network or with a flash drive, do some work on the laptop and make some commits, pull back to the desktop via network or flash drive.
2010-11-08T05:13:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Networking doesn't work for some reason, and I'm not exactly concerned with version management, simply code transfer from one place to another, though git seems like a good idea in the future. Anyway I can get networking to work or UbuntuOne? I'm having problems with those, and thinking of them as my best solution
2010-11-08T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	How are you trying to transfer the file over the network? What problem are you having with that specifically?
2010-11-08T05:17:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	I can't see my computer hooked up to the network and vice versa
2010-11-08T05:17:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Though my laptop seems to recognize my router
2010-11-08T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	"I can't see my computer hooked up to the network" means nothing to me. How are you trying to "see" it?
2010-11-08T05:19:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Sorry about that. I opened up a window from the main menus under Places > Network
2010-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	And all it says is Windows Network, from me trying to set up Samba, I assume
2010-11-08T05:23:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Sorry about that, upon second inspection, it doesn't seem that it works on my laptop either. How would I go about setting up networking?
2010-11-08T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	You won't see your computer there untill you turn on file sharing with samba by right clicking a directory you want to share, then selecting "sharing options".
2010-11-08T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	If you want help with the Ubuntu one side of things try #ubuntuone.
2010-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Thanks again. Wish I could spend less time trying to figure out how to use Ubuntu and more time using it
2010-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	latagore	You're welcome.
2010-11-08T05:28:00.000Z	latagore	Jordan_U	Sorry for the trouble, still no luck. Any tutorials out there on networking?
