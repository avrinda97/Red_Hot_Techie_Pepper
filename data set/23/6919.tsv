2005-11-28T12:01:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	right.  that is  gunzip foo.tar.gz | tar xf -
2005-12-13T10:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	If you truely can't lose the data you'd be crazy to resize any partition but 99% of the time nothing happens.
2005-12-13T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	well, I certainly would never resize any partition that isn't backed up
2005-12-13T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	but then again, I would _never_ even have a partition of any size that isn't backed up.
2005-12-13T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	but my data is all business, nothing that I can tolerate losing
2006-01-14T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	I don't think there is any situation where sha is better than md5
2006-01-14T06:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	The attacker has to be able to choose the original input text too.
2006-01-14T06:26:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	that's another reason, then,
2006-01-14T06:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	dooglus: It's still impossible for an attacker to make a file with the same size and md5sum as a random file that actually _does_ something.
2006-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	I agree, that's why I said there is no real problem.

2006-10-07T16:18:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	I don't believe anyone can sue you for reverse engineering as long as you never saw any copyrighted MS code.
2006-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	ntfs-3g can write to files and such
2006-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	and rather then trash your ntfs partition it just fails to do anything if it thinks something is wrong
2006-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	it can, yes, but it's new and I like to be conservative
2006-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	you've been able to set NTFS write on for four years.  the question isn't whether it can do it, the question is whether it can do it safely
2006-11-04T14:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	What's up?
2006-11-04T14:20:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	he's gone, never mind  :)
2006-11-04T14:21:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	just a troll, but he bailed
2006-11-04T14:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	Alright
2006-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	sethk	But it's closer to useful
2006-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	sethk	Amaranth	I'm not objecting, just noting options.
