2011-06-04T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	I'm still not clear what problem you are having? Does it only boot Windows?
2011-06-04T10:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Did you pay attention to the comments about the keystatus check?
2011-06-04T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Do you have a LiveCD available?
2011-06-04T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Please boot from it and run boot info script (and pastebin the output).
2011-06-04T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Do you have an actual liveCD?
2011-06-04T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	By the way, booting directly into an installer has nothing to do with being 64 bit, you must have downloaded the Server or Alternate image.
2011-06-04T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	As long as the knoppix CD is new enough to support ext4 it's fine.
2011-06-04T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Please boot from it and run boot info script as explained.
2011-06-04T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	As expected, there is no keystatus check in that grub.cfg. That is why shift doesn't unhide the menu.
2011-06-04T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/ && sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/ && sudo mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/proc && sudo mount --bind /sys/ /mnt/sys/; sudo chroot /mnt/
2011-06-04T11:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	It will allow you to run commands as if you were booted into your Ubuntu system.
2011-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Actually, since you're using a new enough version of grub that that isn't needed.
2011-06-04T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Create a new file /mnt/boot/grub/custom.cfg with this as the contents: http://paste.ubuntu.com/618128/
2011-06-04T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	That will add the keystatus check needed to allow you to see the grub menu by holding shift.
2011-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	If you don't want to have to type that out of copy it to a flash drive (since you don't have internet) you can temporarily cause the menu to always show by creating a file /mnt/boot/grub/custom.cfg with just "timeout=-1" (without the quotes) as the contents.
2011-06-04T11:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Correct.
2011-06-04T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	You're welcome.
2011-06-04T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	There is no need to run the chroot command (it's failing because you have a 32 bit liveCD).
2011-06-04T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	adil8055	Just create a new file, /mnt/boot/grub/custom.cfg with either "timeout=-1" for a temporary fix to get you back into Ubuntu or http://paste.ubuntu.com/618128/ for a permanent fix that will only show the menu when you hold shift.
