2008-05-24T05:36:00.000Z	Acorn		having the resolution so low makes my computer unusable :(
2008-05-24T05:37:00.000Z	Acorn		i installed nvidia xserver settings but it only has auto for resolution options
2008-05-24T05:38:00.000Z	Acorn		maybe restart my computer? or disable the driver and then re-enable?
2008-05-24T05:40:00.000Z	Acorn		couldn't i just download the linux driver for my graphics card from the nvidia website?
2008-05-24T05:40:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	I'm pretty sure it's in the repos. (Try Restricted Driver manager?)
2008-05-24T05:47:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	Run sudo nvidia-xconfig
2008-05-24T05:49:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	what should happen?
2008-05-24T05:49:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	It should give you some output about xorg.conf, then either reboot or do CTRL+ALT+BKSPACE
2008-05-24T05:51:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	like that? http://paste.ubuntu.com/14232/
2008-05-24T05:51:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	The output does not matter. Just reboot or do CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE.
2008-05-24T05:54:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	what after that?
2008-05-24T05:54:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	Yes, as byron said try changing your resolution.
2008-05-24T05:54:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	What nVidia card do you have?
2008-05-24T05:55:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	geforce4 Ti 4200
2008-05-24T05:56:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	Try using the one in System => Preferences => Screen Resolution
2008-05-24T05:56:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	same
2008-05-24T06:06:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	where were the settings again? i messed it up and can't find it anymore
2008-05-24T06:06:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-24T06:07:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	no, what you said earlier, about screen and settings or something, it was in user
2008-05-24T06:07:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	I didn't say that, Byron1 did.
2008-05-24T06:10:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	I'd say replace "nvidia" with "mesa" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	Acorn	Ahadiel	i need to work out how to undo everything i've done
2008-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	Ahadiel	Acorn	Well, as far as I know nvidia-xsettings *should* give you a working config.
