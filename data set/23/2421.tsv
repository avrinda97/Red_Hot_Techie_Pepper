2009-03-20T17:38:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	I'm sure I've seen a few CAD packages in add/remove
2009-03-20T17:39:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	I'm a chick, I like to get the human angle, not a nameless package :)
2009-03-20T17:39:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Hehe, my apologies. Hold on then.
2009-03-20T17:41:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Yeah QCaD seems to be the best one.
2009-03-20T17:43:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Hehe, blender's only complicated because of the default layout it sets
2009-03-20T17:44:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	When you say you like make gaming maps, what do you currently use (on windows for example, or other O/S)
2009-03-20T17:45:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	campaign cartographer
2009-03-20T17:46:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	LAME! oh.. ahem.. I mean "That would still mean sullying my good linux box with windows filth"
2009-03-20T17:47:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	I agree, but until developers can pull their fingers out of their ... *cough* i mean when developers suddenly realise the potential of Linux, they'll code more stuff for it.
2009-03-20T17:48:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Hmm, just googled "campaign cartographer", does that actually do 3D or 2D stuff?
2009-03-20T17:48:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	I use an older version for 2D
2009-03-20T17:49:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Hmmz... what do you do with the end product? Or just enjoy making them?
2009-03-20T17:50:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	tabletop gaming
2009-03-20T17:51:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	DnD Style :P?
2009-03-20T17:52:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	One last question, since i dont really know  campaign cartographer, does it have all the pictures and stuff to auto-magically drop them in, or do you make them yourself?
2009-03-20T17:53:00.000Z	Lasivian	hazrpg	it has all the stuff already premade, but I tend to just make them myself and keep a copy/paste set on the side of my project
2009-03-20T17:54:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Right, i'll see if I can find something for ya.
2009-03-20T17:59:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	campaign cartographer seems rather cool tbh ^_^, might have to recommend it to my friend who's addicted to DnD at the moment lol
2009-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	you still there?
2009-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	hazrpg	Lasivian	Think I might of found something that'll work for you
