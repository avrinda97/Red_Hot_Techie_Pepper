2012-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	How would I do that?
2012-05-26T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	what GPU do you use. It's also 12.04, not 12
2012-05-26T13:43:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	I'm using the GT 440
2012-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	add the boot  option:  nouvea.blacklist=1
2012-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	How would I do that?
2012-05-26T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	hold shift at boot, press E to (e)dit the boot and add it on the same line as:  quiet splash
2012-05-26T13:49:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	umm...
2012-05-26T13:49:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	Holding shift at the boot menu for the live cd doesn't do anything, nor does shift+e.
2012-05-26T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	you do know there are lots of websites explaining boot options on the internet....
2012-05-26T14:09:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	the boot screen is compleatly different on 12.04
2012-05-27T00:27:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	Hello.

2012-05-27T00:27:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	I've now tried with a different GPU, but still no luck. I'm really not at all sure what to do.
2012-05-27T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	ask the channel like everyone else. i have NO idea what you are on about
2012-05-27T00:28:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	Don't worry, I was talking to you earlier.
2012-05-27T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	I've drank and slept since then. I don't go about remembering everyone I talk to and every issue I discuss
2012-05-27T00:29:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	Okay
2012-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2012-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	did you burn the CD as slowly as possible?
2012-05-27T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jragon	have you tested your RAM
2012-05-27T00:41:00.000Z	Jragon	ActionParsnip	I have. It works in my old desktop.
