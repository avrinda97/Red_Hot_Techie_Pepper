2004-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	siretart		thats right
2004-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	siretart		its only for newly started applications
2004-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	siretart		start an xterm in ssh and you'll understand
2004-12-15T07:15:00.000Z	theine	siretart	good question :)
2004-12-15T07:09:00.000Z	siretart	theine	i'm also quite unsure what he could mean with that. I guess he means a vnc server
2004-12-15T07:10:00.000Z	theine	siretart	you should check out vnc, it's a *lot* faster than ssh x tunneling
2004-12-15T07:11:00.000Z	siretart	theine	but password and data going unencrypted over wire/wifi is unacceptable for me.
2004-12-15T07:12:00.000Z	theine	siretart	I can see that
2004-12-15T07:14:00.000Z	theine	siretart	appearently you can tunnel vnc through ssh
2004-12-15T07:15:00.000Z	siretart	theine	yes, but would that be faster than plain x11 forwarding?
2004-12-15T07:16:00.000Z	theine	siretart	but I would guess it will
2004-12-15T07:19:00.000Z	theine	siretart	It is faster, I just checked
2004-12-15T07:19:00.000Z	theine	siretart	works really nice
2004-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	siretart	theine	i still fighting with it..
2004-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	theine	siretart	have a look at http://www.uk.research.att.com/archive/vnc/sshvnc.html
2004-12-15T07:22:00.000Z	siretart	theine	yes, I found that link
2004-12-15T07:28:00.000Z	siretart	theine	yes, vnc via ssh is quite usable. thank you for the hint!
2004-12-15T07:28:00.000Z	theine	siretart	you're very welcome
2004-12-15T07:30:00.000Z	siretart	theine	can I tell vncserver to bind to a specific interface? I want it to listen only to localhost
2004-12-15T07:31:00.000Z	theine	siretart	I guess you can block the ports VNC uses
2004-12-15T07:31:00.000Z	siretart	theine	sorry, I'm not the systemadministrator of that network
2004-12-15T07:32:00.000Z	theine	siretart	In that case I don't know
2004-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	theine	siretart	when I think about, I think I'm going to suggest to my sysadmin to close the VNC ports...
