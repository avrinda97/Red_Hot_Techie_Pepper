2006-06-22T05:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	aptitude will install everything that apt-get will (no more) just that using aptitude will will install suggested packages automaticly where as apt-get wont
2006-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	aptitude adn apt are the same package manager (sptitude is more advanced)
2006-06-22T05:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	aptitude and apt-get will install the same sofatware (the package managers read the repos) thats all they do
2006-06-22T06:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	aptitude will remove things that apt wont if installed with aptitude
2006-06-22T06:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	its your repos that decide what packages you can have nothing more nothing less
2006-06-22T06:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	the package managers read the repos when you type the command that is all they do read and grab
2006-06-22T06:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	what package did atitude grab that apt-get wont?
2006-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	nope im using edgy
2006-06-22T06:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	apt = aptitude same package manager
2006-06-22T06:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	they will install the same packages
2006-06-22T06:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	apt-get will install those same packages
2006-06-22T06:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	johnZay	only difference is aptitude installs all suggesed and recommended packages where apt-get will tell you what they are not install them for you
