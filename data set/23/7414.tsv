2005-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		not true
2005-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		toshiba makes some laptops with sb audigy chipsets
2005-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		not really
2005-08-13T09:59:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		i like arts
2005-08-13T09:59:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		my sound works fine, even though its a full duplex card and sure as hell doesnt do full duplex
2005-08-13T10:00:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		attitudes like that annoy me
2005-08-13T10:01:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		i'll give it a shot for a day, but the first time something doesnt work, im gonna go back to windows.. know what i think? i think you should STAY there.
2005-08-13T10:02:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		YMMV, im just in a bad mood, dont mind me people
2005-08-13T10:03:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	keep it too your self or make a weblog, this room is for helping
2005-08-13T10:03:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 of which i do more than my fair share :) dont mind me, man, bad day
2005-08-13T10:04:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	no worries dude, I just dont like to see new users put down
2005-08-13T10:06:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 not saying this is true of the person in question, but far too often i see people try linux just so they can find reasons to feel justified in using windows...
2005-08-13T10:06:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	I agree with you on that, you dont join a distro channel and talk about how much better another distro is
2005-08-13T10:08:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 i couldnt care less about distro wars, everybody who's worth a damn knows rpm sucks, apt rules :-P It's the people who try linux and just look for something to go wrong and then they say "see thats why i use windows and windows is better" I just like to smash their fscking heads through a wall
2005-08-13T10:08:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	breath brother, breath
2005-08-13T10:12:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	run it at lowest possible textures, but keep your resolution resonable
2005-08-13T10:12:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 you really think ill need to set the textures low?
2005-08-13T10:13:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	yes, AA has crazy textures.  Not nessisarily good, just high process
2005-08-13T10:14:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	it isnt the card, its the drivers
2005-08-13T10:14:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	ati drivers bottle neck the card
2005-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 well, the fglrx package maintained by ubuntu failed me, so i used the latest fglrx drivers from ati.com, and yeah i can see where the drivers are bottlenecking the card, but actually i'd prefer that to the problems people have with the accelerated nvidia drivers
2005-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	Xyc0	PurpleMotion	heh, no just stick with the ones ubuntu has
2005-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Xyc0	 absolutely not. they failed me
