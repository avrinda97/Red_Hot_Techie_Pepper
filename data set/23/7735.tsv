2005-07-12T11:52:00.000Z	gnat_x		i just installed an ubuntu system, but during the install the root passwords didn't match, but the installer would not return to the first prompt, it was always "reenter" so i just finished it up. now i need to change it. just want to check what the way to change it in single user mode?
2005-07-12T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	afaik alsaconf is not in ubuntu (not the default install, anyway)
2005-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	no, root is disabled. use sudo
2005-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	you can enable root with sudo if you so desire
2005-07-12T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	the only user should be in the admin group, and the admin group should be in the sudoers file
2005-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	yah, should be but isn't
2005-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	are you in recovery mode on your ubuntu box?
2005-07-12T12:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	you need to boot in recovery mode and fix /etc/sudoers
2005-07-12T12:19:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	k. fix == ?
2005-07-12T12:19:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	will i just be able to edit it?
2005-07-12T12:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	in recovery mode, yes
2005-07-12T12:20:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	thanks will try that.
2005-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	you shouldn't be prompted for a password in recovery mode
2005-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	how have you installed ubuntu? clean install?
2005-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	clean install used the "expert no-hlt" at boot prompt
2005-07-12T12:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	oh
2005-07-12T12:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	i think non-default installs might do things differently re the root account
2005-07-12T12:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	were you asked for a root password during install? (would kind've destroy the 'no-halt' thing, i guess...)
2005-07-12T12:31:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	yes, but they didn't match, and the installer was only going to the second prompt, meaning my first typo was being compared to whatever i retyped. so i just finished the install assuming that i could change it in single user mode.
2005-07-12T12:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	doh
2005-07-12T12:33:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	is this something where the debian base makes a difference. (ie ability to change root in single)
2005-07-12T12:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	gnat_x	my system doesn't ask for a password in single-user mode. You seem to have activated ultra-paranoid mode ;)
2005-07-12T12:34:00.000Z	gnat_x	HappyFool	*nod*  well i'll give that a shot, cause short of reinstall, i can't think of any other way to do this.
