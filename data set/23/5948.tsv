2009-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	yeah I know
2009-04-08T03:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	you don't need sudo when you're already root.
2009-05-03T09:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	an op now,  well there was a major troll earlier
2009-05-03T09:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	so my awaylog of ops hilights made me notice....  Sorry nobody was around.
2009-05-03T09:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	yeah that looks a bit bad also on a publically logged server, but that log will disapear into oblivion anyway

2010-02-02T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	not sure about shorcuts,  I just click the icon to change keyboard layout
2010-02-02T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	whoops
2010-05-03T07:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	I got some serious issues here after upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04, maybe you can help
2010-05-03T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	my Plymouth is rather messed up indeed, sometimes it work's ok though.  what's even odder though is how.  if I try to remove plymouth main it wants to remove loads of other stuff as well,  such as banshee and f-spot which has nothing to do with it
2010-05-03T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	any ideas?
2010-05-03T07:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	maybe a video driver issue?
2010-05-03T07:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	no don't think so, since I did check that after upgrade, and my Nivida driver seems to be installed
2010-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	any idea why plymouth main wants to take a load of suff that has nothing to do with it as well, if I tell it to be removed in synaptic?   also any idea how to stop that?
2010-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	I remember seeing some sort of note about plymouth during the RC stage, but I have no idea where or what it said...
2010-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	I would love to remove plymouth main, but I don't want to remove loads of stuff at the same time, that should be installed
2010-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	you'd have to check the dependencies and figure out what's going on - not sure
2010-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	right, but how does plymouth depend on Banshee or F-Spot for example?  well yeah it doesn't?
2010-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebsebseb	dunno
2010-05-03T07:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	maybe I should try removing the package with aptitude since it seems to be better at dealing with dependancies than apt-get
2010-05-03T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tonyyarusso	i'll try that
