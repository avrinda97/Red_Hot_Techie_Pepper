2005-05-23T11:01:00.000Z	refuze2looze		oh shit.. i can't start any programs.. i'm getting "relocation error: /lib/tls/libc.so.6: symbol_dl_starting_up, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference" any program that i try to run.. i fear if i restart my computer it will never boot what should i do
2005-05-23T11:03:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	how did u ended up downgrading your system?
2005-05-23T11:04:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	i installed a newer version of glibc, it led to serious ass problems with synaptic telling me i have broken packages and wanting to uninstall a bunch of stuff. so i downgraded back to the ubuntu version of libc (2.3.2 i think)
2005-05-23T11:04:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	u upgraded glibsc? why? and where? breezy? source???
2005-05-23T11:06:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	at this point, I'd suggest u pin hoary to 1001 and downgrading the complete system, u got nothing to lose at this point
2005-05-23T11:06:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	because a program (gimpshop) said it required the newer version and would not start so i was stupid enough to install the debian package from it (after compiling it from source did not work)
2005-05-23T11:06:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	OMG u install a newer glibc from Sid??? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
2005-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	i didn't know this would happen!! well i sure learned my lesson
2005-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	u've been served. Now try pinning hoary to 1001 and see if the system can downgrade back to hoary successfully
2005-05-23T11:32:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	I was trying to help u
2005-05-23T11:33:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	it did not complete the reinstall, it stops in the middle with some error message relating to glibc
2005-05-23T11:33:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	i had other options??
2005-05-23T11:34:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	i dont think it did anytihng, it just said "verifying packages"
2005-05-23T11:34:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	how do i do that??
2005-05-23T11:34:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	i can't even boot up
2005-05-23T11:34:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	oh right u broken glibc
2005-05-23T11:35:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	that's a tought one.. maybe u can try to bott from live CD and chroot to the HDD?
2005-05-23T11:36:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	glibc will be loaded and bound to the version on CD at bootime, so chroot shouldn';t use the new broken glibc on HDD
2005-05-23T11:37:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	yeah i'll try to boot up from the live cd and see what i can do.. i'll probably just back up my stuff and then clean install
2005-05-23T11:42:00.000Z	refuze2looze	goofrider	what do you mean by pin hoary to 1001?
2005-05-23T11:42:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	anyways, reinstall is probably the simplest, but if u have too much data/cofig to back up we can try to paly with the downgrade option (i can't guarentee itll work though, A broken glibc is gonna be a hard one to fix)
2005-05-23T11:48:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	it's probably the simplest and flooproof method, to reinstall
2005-05-23T11:50:00.000Z	goofrider	refuze2looze	good luck
