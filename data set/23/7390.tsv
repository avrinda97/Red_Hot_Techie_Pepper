2006-10-31T10:10:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	maybe you still need to install the restricted kernel modules?
2006-10-31T10:11:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	Maybe? How do I do that?
2006-10-31T10:12:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	sudo aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2006-10-31T10:12:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	that should do it.
2006-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	Thanks, hope it works :)
2006-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	np
2006-10-31T10:16:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	It didn't work :/
2006-10-31T10:23:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	can you help?
2006-10-31T10:24:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	I don't use that driver. I just took a guess :(
2006-10-31T10:25:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	ok... I got this problem for 3-4 months ago, and i can't make the driver work :S.. hate it :P
2006-10-31T10:31:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	maybe your chipset isn't supported?
2006-10-31T10:32:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	how do i check that?
2006-10-31T10:32:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	well, what chipset is it?
2006-10-31T10:33:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	did you check in the forums?
2006-10-31T10:36:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	I assume you did this? --> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide
2006-10-31T10:41:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	Yes.
2006-10-31T10:50:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	can you find something useful? :P
2006-10-31T10:50:00.000Z	dcraven	kristian	not any easier than you could :). I don't know anything about that driver.
2006-10-31T10:51:00.000Z	kristian	dcraven	ok, thx:P I hoped that maybe you could find something.. but homework now :P
