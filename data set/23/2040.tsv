2012-05-10T11:46:00.000Z	stevedtrrrrm		"This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU :- pae"
2012-05-10T11:46:00.000Z	stevedtrrrrm		"This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU :- pae" << is the error msg when booting to the image thru virtualbox
2012-05-10T11:46:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	this is in virtualbox?
2012-05-10T11:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	close the guest, select it and hit "settings -> system -> processor" and make sure "Enable PAE" is checked
2012-05-10T11:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	check the virtualbox setting. if "Enable PAE" is grayed out, your processor does not support it
2012-05-10T11:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	did you check the virtual box setting for PAE?
2012-05-10T11:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	do you have PAE enabled in virtualbox?

2012-05-10T11:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	can you please look at the screenshot I posted and tell me if you have the same PAE/NX option in your virtualbox?
2012-05-10T12:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	it could also be that his windows OS simply doesn't have the PAE driver installed.
2012-05-10T12:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	booting off the live-cd/usb will tell you if your *processor* supports it. if not, you'll have to use lubuntu or something. If it DOES support it, you will need to try the #windows channel and ask them how to install it in windows
2012-05-10T12:25:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	I have a feeling extended memory initialization is just a more thorough ram scan at boot time
2012-05-10T12:25:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	if that doesn't work, try lubuntu instead, I believe it has PAE disabled by default so it should work OK
2012-05-10T12:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	then you'll either have to talk to the #windows guys to find out if it's a hardware or windows problem. or you will need to use lubuntu which has no pae by default
2012-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	stevedtrrrrm	with 256MB of ram, you're going to have a hard time running a vm anyways, especially the full-blown unity desktop
