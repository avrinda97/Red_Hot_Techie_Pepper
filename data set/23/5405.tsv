2009-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	rkvirani		Is there a meta package for the KDE 4.3.1 desktop for ubuntu 9.04?
2009-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	rkvirani		I dont want to switch to kubuntu
2009-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	there's a ppa
2009-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	kubuntu-desktop will install 4.2, but you can install a ppa
2009-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	for 4.3
2009-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	it will be on launchpad probably, but you can Google for it
2009-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	rkvirani	sebsebseb	ok where can I get the urls for the ppa, ok I will google, do I have to install kubuntu?
2009-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	hmm that's a point are all the ppa's on launchpad
2009-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	well  I thought that's what you wanted to do, install Kubuntu?
2009-09-02T07:45:00.000Z	rkvirani	sebsebseb	I want to try out KDE
2009-09-02T07:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	well  4.2 or 4.3  it doesn't matter that much which one you try
2009-09-02T07:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	KDE  3 is nice to try even,   there's a repo that can be added for it, and there's a remix CD,  sadly KDE 3 is on the verge of dieing
2009-09-02T07:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	I would rather use KDE 3   as my GUI than KDE 4,  but    apps  have got better in KDE 4, and well most KDE apps can run in Gnome anyway so :)
2009-09-02T07:46:00.000Z	rkvirani	sebsebseb	yeah I want to see how much better
2009-09-02T07:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	hmm where's the bot
2009-09-02T07:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	when you install kubuntu  or  the ppa for 4.3,   you will be able to log in to it from the log in screen
2009-09-02T07:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	trying KDE in a virtual machine could be nice,  because then you can run   it inside Gnome
2009-09-02T07:49:00.000Z	rkvirani	sebsebseb	err vm ... hrm. :(
2009-09-02T07:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	changing   the session to  on the log in screen to another one, is  a bit like dual booting   Ubuntu with Windows in a way,  buth  suck really
2009-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	and the bot  gave the command to get rid of all the KDE packages,  if you don't want it installed anymore
2009-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	have you tried xubuntu?   if not,  you may want to try that as well
2009-09-02T07:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	trying in the current install, will do the trick
2010-03-08T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rkvirani	You have to use open source java I think,  since something about Sun Java being removed, also #ubuntu+1 is currrently the 10.04 channel
