2011-11-04T21:17:00.000Z	gp5st1		i'm trying to compile stud (https://github.com/bumptech/stud). i have libev4, libev-dev, and libssl-dev installed, but it's acting like it can't find either of these things. http://pastebin.com/drmg81Tv i was wondering if anyone would be able to help. I'm @ ubuntu 11.10
2011-11-04T21:19:00.000Z	elgaton	gp5st1	have you tried (if possible) passing appropriate ./configure switches?
2011-11-04T21:19:00.000Z	gp5st1	elgaton	there aren't any. it's just a make file.  it doesn't look like it points the compiler anywhere specific
2011-11-04T21:20:00.000Z	elgaton	gp5st1	Edit the include and library path in the makefile then
2011-11-04T21:20:00.000Z	gp5st1	elgaton	there isn't one
2011-11-04T21:20:00.000Z	elgaton	gp5st1	Could you paste the Makefile in a pastebin, please?
2011-11-04T21:21:00.000Z	gp5st1	elgaton	it's in the repo i linked to (https://github.com/bumptech/stud/blob/master/Makefile)
2011-11-04T21:22:00.000Z	gp5st1	elgaton	mine's unmodified from the repo

2011-11-04T21:45:00.000Z	gp5st1	elgaton	sorry for the delay. minor problem here, resolved now. LDFLAGS = -lssl -lcrypto -lev -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ is my line, same probelm
2011-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	elgaton	gp5st1	Sorry too, I was called. Could you please move the -L switch so it is before the -l ones?
