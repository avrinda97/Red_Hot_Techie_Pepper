2010-01-22T02:54:00.000Z	DasEi		loops grub 1 ?
2010-01-22T02:55:00.000Z	DasEi		loops , did you do an dist-upgrade ?
2010-01-22T02:55:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	no, not explicitly at least.
2010-01-22T02:55:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	either shift or esc, can check grub by grub --version
2010-01-22T02:56:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	also can alter the timeout to do so
2010-01-22T02:57:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	tried "grub --version"   says  grub is not currently installed ;o/
2010-01-22T02:57:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	another bootloader ? multiboot ? other disk ?
2010-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	no idea.  I just did a plain old install from the live CD, didn't ask, didn't tell
2010-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	synaptic said  grub-common is installed but not "grub" or "grub 2
2010-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	I had read that karmic used grub 2 so i just assumed that's what was employed here.. guess not
2010-01-22T02:59:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	karmic default is grub2, grub might have benn there before already
2010-01-22T02:59:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	menu.lst  there ?
2010-01-22T03:00:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	i do not have a menu.1st    all i have is /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2010-01-22T03:00:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	so grub2 then
2010-01-22T03:00:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	yeah.. that's what synaptics made me think..   is it using lilo maybe?
2010-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	not if you havent specified it
2010-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	i didn't specify anything.  Just popped CD in and answered a few basic questions
2010-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	got an /etc/default/grub ?
2010-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	yes
2010-01-22T03:02:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	as root you can alter timeout there, afterwards load new config by sudo update grub
2010-01-22T03:02:00.000Z	DasEi	loops	it might be too short
2010-01-22T03:03:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	thanks, will give it a go
2010-01-22T03:09:00.000Z	loops	DasEi	okay it is Grub 2 (1.97~beta4) installed.   SHIFT doesn't work but ESC did.  thanks for your help
