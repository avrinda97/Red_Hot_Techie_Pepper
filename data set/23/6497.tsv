2006-12-23T11:36:00.000Z	TheSilentWarrior		does anyone here use a USB wireless connection adapter on ubuntu ?
2006-12-23T11:37:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	yes, a d-link dwl-g122 (rev. b1)
2006-12-23T11:37:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	just loaded the rt2570 module
2006-12-23T11:38:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	no, rt2570 is part of the kernel modules
2006-12-23T11:39:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	why did you compile anyway? the rt2570 module should be there
2006-12-23T11:40:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	it should be somewhere under /lib/modules/<your_kernel_version>
2006-12-23T11:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	try modinfo rt2570 to see if it is installed
2006-12-23T11:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	you didnt say you were using encryption
2006-12-23T11:42:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	also you didnt say which wireless usb adapter you have
2006-12-23T11:44:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	first you have to check which chipset you have in the conceptronic usb adapter
2006-12-23T11:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	the modinfo output has nothing to do with the chipset on your adapter
2006-12-23T11:46:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	it just tells you that the rt2570 module is there
2006-12-23T11:47:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	try lsusb when the adapter is plugged in
2006-12-23T11:48:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	can you put them on pastebin?
2006-12-23T11:52:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	yes, but there is not a linux driver for each and every piece of hardware (thanks to the ignorance of the h/w manufacturers)
2006-12-23T11:52:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	i googled a bit for that usb id. it seems the adapter has the ralink rt73 chipset
2006-12-23T11:53:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	so why didnt you tell me it is rt73 and not rt2570?
2006-12-23T11:55:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	no, rt73 is a separate driver, directly from ralink. fortunately, ralink is a manufacturer who cares about linux.
2006-12-23T11:56:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	rt73 is not included in ubuntu, that one has to be built from source. you need packages build-essential and kernel source for that.
2006-12-23T11:57:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	certainly not 2.6.17, as you are running 2.6.15
2006-12-23T11:59:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	why not install the appropriate kernel-source package with apt-get?
2006-12-23T12:00:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	i dont know the exact package name, and i have no ubuntu system right now to look at
2006-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	POVaddct	TheSilentWarrior	yeah, just make sure you get the matching version. compare to "uname -a" output.
