2008-01-07T02:48:00.000Z	gitfiddler		I also cannot post to the forum for help, so hopint someone here can do it
2008-01-07T02:49:00.000Z	gitfiddler		Thanks gyaresu
2008-01-07T02:50:00.000Z	gitfiddler		The 'Make link' funtion returns an error when I try to use it on any folder/file on a fat32 partition
2008-01-07T02:51:00.000Z	gitfiddler		the error is "operation not permitted" while making link
2008-01-07T02:52:00.000Z	gitfiddler		thanks
2008-01-07T02:52:00.000Z	gitfiddler		is there some other way to make them?

2008-01-07T02:54:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	welcome wish there was a way but copying is about the only option (to a Linux patition)
2008-01-07T02:56:00.000Z	gitfiddler	jebblue	that seems unfortunate
2008-01-07T02:58:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	twang hehe yup, fat32 was just a tiny notch above fat - any chance you can change that drive to NTFS ? you would have more options then
2008-01-07T02:58:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	nm ntfs won't do what you want in this context either I think

2008-01-07T02:59:00.000Z	gitfiddler	jebblue	yah, I could make it NTFS, but thought linux couldn't write to that
2008-01-07T03:00:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	well it can but I think the symlink issue would still remain unresolved
2008-01-07T03:00:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	check out that last link I sent it has a good discussion
2008-01-07T03:01:00.000Z	gitfiddler	jebblue	got it
2008-01-07T03:06:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	consider using rsync to sync your fat32 files with the ones on the ext3 drive - it is a very good utility, smart, after it does its initial sync is is generally very fast, it only copies ones that change and can (if you want it to) remove the files that are no long on the source drive using the --delete option
2008-01-07T03:09:00.000Z	gitfiddler	jebblue	hmm, yes, tried the suggestion at of forum post and either I'm doing something wrong or no luck there
2008-01-07T03:18:00.000Z	gitfiddler	jebblue	thanks for help. This problem's more involved than I expected, so i'll have to wrap it up some other time. cheers!
2008-01-07T03:19:00.000Z	jebblue	gitfiddler	ok good luck!
