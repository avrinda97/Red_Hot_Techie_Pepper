2006-07-28T12:54:00.000Z	Wapol		can anyone help me in a private window?
2006-07-28T12:55:00.000Z	Wapol		i just downloaded linux yesterday and im totally lost on how to use it
2006-07-28T12:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	start by asking your questions here, while it's not busy
2006-07-28T12:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	lots of programs are terminal-only, I don't know if aircrack is one of them
2006-07-28T12:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	try typing 'aircrack' in a terminal - with no quotes
2006-07-28T13:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	Applications->Accessories->Terminal
2006-07-28T13:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	open the terminal, then type aircrack, yes
2006-07-28T13:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	try just typing 'aircrack' first
2006-07-28T13:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	just typing 'aircrack' should run the program; the whereis command shows where it is, which doesn't usually matter
2006-07-28T13:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	you're getting into fairly complex stuff right away. Why do you need to run aircrack?
2006-07-28T13:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	the router probably has a reset button on it somewhere... check the manual
2006-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	in terminal, the password isn't echoed,but it should be working
2006-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
2006-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	there are several pages linked to from that SynapticHowto page, check them out too
2006-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	Synaptic is how you install stuff, read that tutorial...
2006-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	I just gave you a webpage link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
2006-07-28T13:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	that depends on the program.
2006-07-28T13:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	try using Add/Remove Applications instead, everything it installs is available thru the menus - Synaptic can install more stuff, though
2006-07-28T13:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	just typing 'sudo aircrack' doesn't start it?
2006-07-28T13:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	what did the 'bunch of words' say?
2006-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	I don't do wireless stuff myself, but I get the impression that aircrack is a fairly complex app.
2006-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	seriously, most routers have reset buttons hidden somewhere, look for that to reset your password to the factory default...
2006-07-28T13:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Wapol	then you're far better off talking to someone who *does* know the password - or who has permission to reset it - rather than trying aircrack...
