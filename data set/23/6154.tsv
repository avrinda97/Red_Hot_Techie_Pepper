2007-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	zeeeee		is there any index of packages from several of the popular repositories? ubuntuguide says p7zip-full exists for dapper, but i can't tell which repository i need to add
2007-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	universe
2007-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	are you sure that applies to dapper? i don't see it..
2007-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	yep
2007-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	not p7zip
2007-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	the difference is that that's the dependency acetoneiso requires
2007-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	no
2007-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	it can extract daa's
2007-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	i know how to mount iso's
2007-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	read the whole thing
2007-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	daa's not listed there
2007-06-09T07:11:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	so anyway... do you know how to find out what repo to add?
2007-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	I would just open the acetone deb and change the dependency from p7zip-full to p7zip
2007-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	hmmmm
2007-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	why are you still using dapper, is this a server?
2007-06-09T07:14:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	no, it's company-issued distro
2007-06-09T07:14:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	rules against upgrading?
2007-06-09T07:16:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	no, it would just be a pain
2007-06-09T07:16:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	no, that's not what i mean
2007-06-09T07:17:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	there's a ton of extra shit in the company issued distro
2007-06-09T07:17:00.000Z	bruenig	zeeeee	but I would assume that it is all contained in a deb?
2007-06-09T07:18:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	no, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goobuntu
2007-06-09T08:14:00.000Z	zeeeee	bruenig	just fyi, i've been reading through acetone. it's totally shady!! it actually downloads and runs a poweriso binary from the acetone-team.org website, and uses that to do all the conversions.
