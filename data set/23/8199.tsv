2008-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 comming from windows.. i find the comand line concise, and very helpfull...
2008-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 Linux is Case SeneSetive
2008-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 its X11 not x11
2008-10-26T11:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 you are running the nvidia-setttings tool or what exactly?
2008-10-26T11:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 nvidia-config needs to be ran as root. inorder to write to  system directories,.
2008-10-26T12:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 i normally set up the users with a samba password 'sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME'    then the users should be able to share a folder..
2008-10-26T12:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 be very concise as to what you mean..  are you refering to linux seeing windows shares? or windows seeing linux shares?
2008-10-26T12:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	  i hacve often had to type in the full path to the windows share with the grub file manager.. it for some reason did not see/scan and get/show the share names.
2008-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 ie: in the gnome file manger i enter  the whole name/path    smb://cow/public/
2008-10-26T12:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 thats sorr of what i said. :)
2008-10-26T12:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 theres a slight glitz in gnome file manager in that area it seems.
2008-11-09T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 Gnome/kde look the same... they run under BSD also.. :)
2008-11-09T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	army12bc	 Looks mean very little.
