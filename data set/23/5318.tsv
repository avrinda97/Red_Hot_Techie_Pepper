2006-12-29T07:57:00.000Z	SubMOA		hello, I was on here yesterday and was told to edit my xorg.conf file.  Well, I edited it and got the go-ahead from two people but it still crashed my X :O( any help
2006-12-29T07:57:00.000Z	SubMOA		BTW, that wasn't supposed to sound accusatory!! *blush*
2006-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	Is x up and running now?
2006-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	yes
2006-12-29T08:00:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	what is the you want to achieve
2006-12-29T08:01:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	I made the post above, so i dont want to spam the channel, please scroll a little bit up and find a long post from ken :)
2006-12-29T08:02:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	I got Beryl up and running, but, at one point in time it made my CPU run at 100% indefinitely, so I came here.  Anyway, I figured out the problem (I think) and although it didn't have anything to do with my xorg.conf file, someone said it wasn't complete so I added what I found on the ubuntu beryl article.  I had some people check it and they said it looked good.  Then restarted my comp and it wouldn't load
2006-12-29T08:03:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	have you tried Ctrl+T
2006-12-29T08:03:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	Thats what i use by defualt
2006-12-29T08:03:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	hmm
2006-12-29T08:04:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	is it updated, etc.
2006-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	not sure what i'm talking about here... maybe emacs would work for you?
2006-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	I too am not sure what to answer to you :0
2006-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	I just read something about it wiping all shortcuts for firefox (and gnome, fyi) so yuo can create youur own
2006-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	I'm thinking a reinstall
2006-12-29T08:08:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	I dont use beryl/AIGLX/Compiz for the simple reason that their site itself proclaims that it is beta and unstable software that is going to crash your system, moreover i dont think it worthwile to devout my precious CPU cycles to stupid Eye-candy. And moreover using unstable software as a interface for other software to run, is not a good idea by any standards :)
2006-12-29T08:09:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	i think all those things are pluses! (No, I don't, I just want to sound contradictory.  Hey, I'm 20, I have to make my OS appealing!)
2006-12-29T08:09:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	I am little /not-interested in EMACS/VI, they simply scare me away :)
2006-12-29T08:10:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	ehhhhh
2006-12-29T08:10:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	You are talking about re-install of your entire OS?
2006-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	SubMOA	ken	no, I mean reinstall firefox for you
2006-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	ok :) though i wouldn;t like to entertain such a idea :)
2006-12-29T08:12:00.000Z	ken	SubMOA	ok
