2009-10-28T22:47:00.000Z	mikunos		it's not a internet speed connection
2009-10-28T22:48:00.000Z	nightshade	mikunos	if you're getting bad pages, then wireshark will tell you why.
2009-10-28T22:48:00.000Z	mikunos		wireshark ?
2009-10-28T22:48:00.000Z	nightshade		it's a packet analyzer
2009-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	nightshade		it marks bad packets in red
2009-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	nightshade	mikunos	it marks bad packets in red.
2009-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	nightshade	mikunos	and, if you look at it, it will tell you what went wrong, so you could fix it.
2009-10-28T22:50:00.000Z	mikunos		what is wireshark?
2009-10-28T22:50:00.000Z	nightshade	mikunos	and it's in the ubuntu sepositories

2009-10-28T22:51:00.000Z	nightshade		or something like that.  If your pages are coming in badly, *W I R E S H A R K* will tell you why

2009-10-28T22:54:00.000Z	nightshade	mikunos	I think so.  What are you asking this time?
