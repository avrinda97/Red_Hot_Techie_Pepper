2008-03-12T14:00:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	from the readme file it says you can just copy the Ubuntoon dir to the ~/.icons directory
2008-03-12T14:01:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 ya but it also says OR i can go to system-->appearance  and click install .. i want to do it that way .. right now i cant seem to find the icon folder it talks about
2008-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	the icon foldre is hidden; all folder starting with a '.' are hidden.  i think "control h" will show you the hidden folders
2008-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 yes, but please .. rather than moving stuff without understanding, i am trying to figure out the basic gui methods in linux .. so i really want to try it the second way
2008-03-12T14:06:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	sorry, I don't use gnome; but from what i read i thin you need to unzip the file(and not untar it) then specify the the .tar file for the gui program?
2008-03-12T14:06:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 okies, now thats a good info , so basically unzip and untar are different things in linux ?  i thought it was just decompressing ..
2008-03-12T14:08:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	they are seperate things; tar take a group of folders and files and puts them all together as one file(but does NOT compress them); the .bz2 mean the the 'tar-ed' file was then compressed
2008-03-12T14:09:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	  ooooh .. ok ..
2008-03-12T14:09:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	I was thinking you might need to just unzip, but not untar the file; the README file says to use the tar file
2008-03-12T14:10:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	its just a guess, I am not sure
2008-03-12T14:11:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 ok when i double click on the tar.bz3 archive, it opens up like winzip .. so how to extract the content as a tar file and not as a full folder with subfolders in it ?
2008-03-12T14:12:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 right clicking on the folder in the archive doesnt have untar option,  only extract option
2008-03-12T14:14:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	I don't know how to do that in a gui; I don't use gnome, so you might want to ask some one else "how to unzip, but not untar" a file in gnome
2008-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	  umm .. wait .. u mean  "how to untar but not unzip"  right ?
2008-03-12T14:17:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	no; I think you want to just unzip it.... its common in linux to see a group of files the were "tared" then "ziped(compressed)".  if you just unzip the file you get the "file.tar" part back...
2008-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	most gui programs will do both for you to make it easyer on you; they will fisrt unzip then untar the fle
2008-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 i think i am understanding it now , but can i send u the archive file please so that u can have a look at it ?  its very small
2008-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 and trust me please, its not a virus or worm or anything .. i think
2008-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 or i can give u a weblink for it
2008-03-12T14:19:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	i think you could do what bod_ said...
2008-03-12T14:20:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	now can you install the .tar file in the gui?
2008-03-12T14:21:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	mmmiiikkkeee	 i tried to forcefully give it the .tar file by clicking "all files" and choosing it .. now it says invalid format
2008-03-12T14:42:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	Linux_Fresher	did you try "alt-f4"; and that sounds weird why woudl it not close
