2012-05-16T03:46:00.000Z	shawnboy		anyone else have more hopeful answers for recovering my wife's deleted photo folder?
2012-05-16T03:47:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	there is a photorec program which might be able to find some hidden photos (probably will also find all the images in your firefox cache so its going to be a high chaff to wheat ration)
2012-07-15T04:54:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	if its not showing up on the bus at all that would seem to indicate a problem with the usb hub. what usb modules are loaded (lsmod)

2012-07-15T04:58:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	is that before or after you unplugged/replugged
2012-07-15T04:59:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	after replugged.
2012-07-15T04:59:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	want to see it from before
2012-07-15T05:00:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	okay, will reboot now, run lsmod, jump back to irc.
2012-07-15T05:14:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	wd passport not showing up. lsmod results are at http://pastebin.com/2D0jwXej
2012-07-15T05:16:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	try sudo modprobe usb_storage (doubt it will do anything but worth a shot
2012-07-15T05:18:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	no results
2012-07-15T05:18:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	it doesnt show up now?
2012-07-15T05:20:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	nope, it doesn't show up. Incidentally, when usb drive is plugged in at boot time, boot time doubles or triples.
2012-07-15T05:20:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	boot time after the kernel is started?
2012-07-15T05:22:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	have black screen for a long time before purple background shows up. also using usb lenovo remote keyboard/trackball. Wonder if that creates conflict.
2012-07-15T05:24:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	i would suspect that the bios is trying to boot the usb and is really slow to scan the bus. perhaps the bios is also buggy and is failing to release it so that it doesn't reinitialize when the kernel comes up. remove usb from our boot order
2012-07-15T05:25:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	good idea. will try. thanks for help so far. if you're still here, i'll let you know what happens.
2012-07-15T05:43:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	You must be some sort of genius. It worked. I disabled usb storage in the boot options of BIOS.
2012-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	speculation pure speculation
2012-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	So, if I have two usb drives and want to boot from one, not the other, I basically am out of luck thanks to buggy BIOS?
2012-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	sounds like it
2012-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	escott	shawnboy	if you have multiple controllers try to put it on a different bus/controller. maybe it keeps the one bus up so that it can pass it to grub, and will take down the other
2012-07-15T05:48:00.000Z	shawnboy	escott	Thanks a ton for your help. Couldn't have done it without you.
