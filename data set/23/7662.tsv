2005-05-26T07:23:00.000Z	bigfoot		general question: How can I narrow the spacing of the stuff in the toolbars? For example, those using Terminal, "File" has 6 dropdown options (Open Terminal; Open Tab; New Profile; Close Tab; Close Window) . Between each option is much space. I'd like to "squish"  or have tighter line spacing. How can one do this?
2005-05-26T07:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 much space? hmm - i have vrey little space. perhaps its your font setting set to a large font? or real small one?
2005-05-26T07:27:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	you touched on another point: font size. I'd like to decrease both. Both spacing between the choices in the dropdown menus in all programs, and text size. How can this be done?
2005-05-26T07:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 try the font preferance tool.  I tend to set mine very LARGE. :P
2005-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 not that  i noticed. :P i tend to use 'grip' to rip cd's
2005-06-13T09:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	you can unpack them from the terminal yes.
2005-06-13T09:23:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	what command should i use to unpack more than one rar file at the same time?
2005-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 unrar e whatevber.rar or the name of the first rar file of a multi rar archive
2005-06-13T09:25:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	how do i know which is the first rar file? And if i put in the name of the first file, will the program automatically do the whole folder?
2005-06-13T09:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 noirmally a multi-rar archive is named lilke foo.r01 foo.r02 foo.r03
2005-06-13T09:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 or some variation of that.
2005-06-13T09:27:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	yes. true.
2005-06-13T09:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 so take a guess which is the first one. :P
2005-06-13T09:28:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	actually, metzen said that the first one is the one with the ".rar" extension.
2005-06-13T09:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 not from what ive seen.. but it can vary.   all the .rar ones ive seen are single rar archives.. but heck.. try them all :P
2005-06-13T09:31:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	lok, metzen, how come the unrar command works in terminal. but the GUI program (Archive Manager) can't deal with it? Is there a way to do things with in the GUI?
2005-06-13T09:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 the gui is just a front end - thats calling the terminal programs.. on mymachine the front end does work  at least in some cases.. it may be just missconfigured.
2005-06-13T09:34:00.000Z	bigfoot	dr_willis	how do i configure the gui to work as well as the terminal?
2005-06-13T09:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 no idea. i use the shell for such tasks.. it may be the gui cant handle multi-parts. never really worried about it.  im a shell kinda guy
2005-06-13T09:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 i dont even have any rars to test with it right now
2005-06-13T09:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	bigfoot	 may want to check the ubuntu wikis
