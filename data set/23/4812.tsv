2008-11-07T00:34:00.000Z	MungoPark		did i mention that my dapper->hardy upgrade left me without a working gui/window environment?
2008-11-07T00:34:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	did you skip gutsy?
2008-11-07T00:35:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	the computer told me that this would be alright
2008-11-07T00:37:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	actually it might have sth to do with this libcairo2 since i get errors that say "undefined symbol: cairo_create_x.._surface"
2008-11-07T00:38:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	i'm not sure...
2008-11-07T00:38:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	sth. similar to this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcairo/+bug/176318
2008-11-07T00:39:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	geez, that bug's a year old
2008-11-07T00:40:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	yeah, but that matches the symptoms i have except that libgdk complains about sth else
2008-11-07T00:42:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	that's bizarre... someone else might know about it, or you could try searching/posting to ubuntuforums.org
2008-11-07T00:43:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	yes, maybe ill do that
2008-11-07T00:43:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	ldd
2008-11-07T00:43:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	it will show what it's linked to, anyway
2008-11-07T00:46:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	that shows me libs that libcairo.so.2 references i guess
2008-11-07T00:49:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	objdump -T libcairo.so.2 shows that the "undefined symbol" is in there, so why does the computer complain ?
2008-11-07T00:50:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	i suggest http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/l-shlibs.html  and  http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html
2008-11-07T00:50:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	oh, nice
2008-11-07T00:51:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	what version of libcairo do you have installed?
2008-11-07T00:51:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep libcairo
2008-11-07T00:52:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	yes, its 1.6.0-0ubuntu2
2008-11-07T00:53:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	i tried older versions but that didnt really help
2008-11-07T00:54:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	that is truely strange, i am not sure where to look next
2008-11-07T00:55:00.000Z	MungoPark	Gnea	thank you. maybe Ill get back to you later. thanks
2008-11-07T00:55:00.000Z	Gnea	MungoPark	good luck
