2009-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	give it a try
2009-02-20T07:54:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	sounds good
2009-02-20T08:13:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	sorry was afk
2009-02-20T08:15:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	can you see if there is anything strange in your xorg.log
2009-02-20T08:17:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	most logs are in /var/log
2009-02-20T08:20:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	start with xorg.0.log
2009-02-20T08:27:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	I am not sure how to fix it - i think the best way to configure it would to be through hal
2009-02-20T08:28:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	I am not sure but I am looking at stuff about it
2009-02-20T08:40:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	sorry I can't seem to find a solution =[
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	it might say something on the bottom of it
2009-02-20T08:44:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	hmm =-[ I don't think that really gives to any real versioning
2009-02-20T08:44:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	I do know the g5 uses the edev mouse protocole
2009-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	ok, well I think it might work if you tell hal to explicitly to make the mouse use that one protocle
2009-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	hmm my knowledge isn't that good so bear with me i'll give it a try =]
2009-02-20T08:50:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	I am not sure if this will help but I can pastebin my hal config for my trackball mouse
2009-02-20T08:52:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	I forgot how to figure out the mouse's id
2009-02-20T08:54:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	/etc/hal/fdi/policy/*.fdi are where you put hal polcies
2009-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	yeah you put in a new .fdi file for another device
2009-02-20T09:05:00.000Z	Dracie	night-wm	anything works
