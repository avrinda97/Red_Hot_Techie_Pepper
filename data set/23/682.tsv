2011-04-10T08:52:00.000Z	urgodfather		hey i have an easy question for someone, i have a 15GB partition id like to install ubuntu on with wubi. how many GB should i make the installation size?
2011-04-10T08:52:00.000Z	urgodfather		xust, u sure of that?
2011-04-10T08:53:00.000Z	urgodfather		google nvidia 270
2011-04-10T08:53:00.000Z	urgodfather		thats a beta
2011-04-10T08:53:00.000Z	urgodfather		i use 260.x the release
2011-04-10T08:53:00.000Z	urgodfather		really?
2011-04-10T08:54:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	the minimum is 3 GB, and recommended might be 5 GB and up as your use, I think you cant resize it once you specified the size
2011-04-10T08:56:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	i just did a 3GB and got an error that there wasnt enough space to do the update. im currently installing @ 7 GB. but then i decided to check to make sure since im in windows right now
2011-04-10T09:01:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	did you see the last comment i made to you
2011-04-10T09:02:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	the error if 3GB selected?
2011-04-10T09:03:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	are you upgrading from your current ubuntu to any later?
2011-04-10T09:08:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	so do you think that 7 GB installation will be fine? i dont plan on adding a lot of apps or anyting, if anything ill be removing stuff as soon as i get done with install
2011-04-10T09:09:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	I think if using wubi, fresh "install inside windows " good, updating might cuase errors, any way 7 GB might do
2011-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	thanks. just wanted a 2nd opinion before i let the 7GB installation stay or uninstall and make bigger. after all, it is a 15gb partition
2011-04-10T09:12:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	I usually do a 5 GB installation for my friends, which works quiet fine
2011-04-10T09:13:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	ok awesome so yeah, 7 should be plenty
2011-04-10T09:13:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	do hope so
2011-04-10T10:24:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	7gb appears to be fine
2011-04-10T10:35:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	did you get the last message i sent? sorry i had to reboot so i didnt see your response if so
2011-04-10T10:36:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	which?
2011-04-10T10:36:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	about the 7gb appearing to be fine
2011-04-10T10:37:00.000Z	pksadiq	urgodfather	k, so any problem installing?
2011-04-10T10:38:00.000Z	urgodfather	pksadiq	nope, all went smooth... putting the finishing touches right now
