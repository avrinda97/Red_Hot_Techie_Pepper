2011-05-01T16:42:00.000Z	Herbs		maxgaz you want to tunnel over 998?
2011-05-01T16:42:00.000Z	Herbs		have you opened the port in your firewall
2011-05-01T16:43:00.000Z	maxagaz	Herbs	no, I didn't, how to do it ?
2011-05-01T16:46:00.000Z	Herbs		on ubuntu hmm I dont know the proper ubuntu way so might get shouted at but I modify /etc/sysconfig/firewall with the rules and then execute the script
2011-05-01T16:48:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 can you cd above the home dir via ssh?
2011-05-01T16:55:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 not really but what change did you make?
2011-05-01T16:56:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 if you cant do it via ssh then you cant do it via sftp wether you have setup ftp access is another thing
2011-05-01T16:56:00.000Z	Herbs		ftp localhost
2011-05-01T16:58:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 you should be cool then
2011-05-01T16:59:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 are you using ftp ? if so what ftp sertver?
2011-05-01T17:01:00.000Z	Herbs		sftp gives the same rights as ssh so your users have the wrong permissions
2011-05-01T17:02:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 if your giving users ssh/sftp access you need to understand linux permissions
2011-05-01T17:03:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 its not something someone can walk you through Im afraid
2011-05-01T17:03:00.000Z	Herbs		brandon503 yes

2011-05-01T17:09:00.000Z	Herbs	Dr_Willis	do you happen to know of a guide for redhat users to using ubuntu iptables,,,,?
2011-05-01T17:10:00.000Z	Herbs		I always modify the /etc/sysconfig/firewall and then execute /etc/sysconfig/firewall but I dont think thats the proper way?
