2008-06-19T01:52:00.000Z	quinten		hi, i'm trying to install ubuntu from a livecd, but the livecd has errors so i'm trying to use a mounted good iso on a connected usb drive
2008-06-19T01:53:00.000Z	quinten		anyone able to help me figure out how to tell the ubuntu installer to use the mounted filesystem, rather than the cd?
2008-06-19T01:53:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	can you boot from the drive?
2008-06-19T01:54:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	it's a drive that has all of my backups, so i'd rather not reformat it
2008-06-19T01:54:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	also haven't tried booting from usb on my computer, so not sure if that would work
2008-06-19T01:54:00.000Z	slayton		If you mobo is less then 3 or 4 years old it should support usb booting

2008-06-19T01:56:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	probably true, but if it's possible to tell the installer to use the filesystem i mounted, i'd prefer that
2008-06-19T01:57:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	I'm pretty sure you can do it... I was reading about how to restore grub via the live cd and I came across some instructions like that.. but I'm not quite sure

2008-06-19T01:57:00.000Z	slayton		the first 2 sets of commands mount the fs and get it running
2008-06-19T01:58:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	i got as far as figuring out how to mount the squashfs filesystem from w/in the iso, and then chrooting
2008-06-19T01:58:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	its' not exactly what you've been looking for but its all I know
2008-06-19T01:58:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	at which point it obviously couldn't communicate with the x-server
2008-06-19T01:58:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	I've never done that so I really don't know what to tell you
2008-06-19T01:58:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	you could try the alternate install
2008-06-19T01:59:00.000Z	slayton		gui free
2008-06-19T02:00:00.000Z	quinten	slayton	is that on the live cd? or do i need to download a new disk image? i would have just burned this one but i can't burn a cd w/o taking out the live cd, and i already blew away the existing filesystem so i can't boot to get a cd burner ...
2008-06-19T02:02:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	I think the alternate install is a seperate disc
2008-06-19T02:02:00.000Z	slayton		sorry
2008-06-19T02:03:00.000Z	slayton		how much free space do you have on your external hdd? You might consider partitining the drive with the liveCD. coping the liveCD image to the new partition and try booting from the drive. then you can reburn a valid install cd
2008-06-19T02:03:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	see post above
2008-06-19T02:03:00.000Z	slayton	quinten	I forgot to post your name...
