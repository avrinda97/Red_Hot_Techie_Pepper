2005-09-18T07:35:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem		I have two hard drives, hda and hdb. hda is not partitioned, hdb is partitioned into two fat32 partitions, an ext3, and a swap partition. Windows is installed on hda, and Ubuntu is installed on hdb. After I installed Ubuntu on a partition on hdb, Windows sees hdb as one giant raw disk, and Ubuntu sees the partitions fine.
2005-09-18T07:35:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem		Why is this happening - what can I do to fix it?
2005-09-18T07:37:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem		Anyone?

2005-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	not sure what you mean since you said you installed windows on an unpartitioned device
2005-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	I mean, hda contains a single partition.
2005-09-18T07:41:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	my guess is your partitioner did not actually create the FAT partitions, OR, windows isn't displaying them unless you tell it to, which I've seen it do iirc
2005-09-18T07:54:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	which steps exactly did you take to creating the FAT partitions?
2005-09-18T07:55:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	what else do you need to know?
2005-09-18T07:55:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	not familiar with GTParted, sorry
2005-09-18T07:55:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	what else can I try?
2005-09-18T07:56:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	Had a typo, it's GParted.
2005-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	making FAT is usually a two-step process for me.  I have to partition the drive for FAT, set the type of partition to FAT, and also run another tool to initialize as FAT
2005-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	er, three steps
2005-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	So - how do I do that with the tools you use?
2005-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	I can't remember the name of the tool offhand
2005-09-18T08:02:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	I normally use fdisk and then mkfs.vfat iirc
2005-09-18T08:06:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	how do I use fdisk to partition?
2005-09-18T08:07:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	I thought you said it was already partitioned, I think what you need is mkfs.vfat to initialize it as fat
2005-09-18T08:08:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	cevizoglu	I deleted the partition. :-P
2005-09-18T08:08:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	if you're not sure how to use fdisk, I would read the man pages and maybe a wiki on it
2005-10-05T07:55:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Carpe_Libertatem	not sure, but you can launch it from terminal
