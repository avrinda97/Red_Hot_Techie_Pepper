2009-09-13T15:14:00.000Z	opensourceAJ		did not happen before the update
2009-09-13T15:16:00.000Z	opensourceAJ		i'll post in forums if necessary, i just want to know if anyone else cannot mount fat32 after kernel update for jauny
2009-09-13T15:16:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	I've accessed fat32 volumes with 2.6.28.15
2009-09-13T15:17:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	any idea why this is happening to me
2009-09-13T15:17:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	do you get any error messages? anything in /var/log/syslog? /var/log/kern.log?
2009-09-13T15:19:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	what am i looking for?
2009-09-13T15:21:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	anything that looks like "ERROR bla bla bla" or "Failed to bla bla bla" .. you can basically run "tail -f /var/log/syslog" and you've got a live display of the end of that log.. now try to mount a fat32 volume and see if anything new pops up in the log window..
2009-09-13T15:21:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	use Ctrl+C in that tail window to stop the live display thingy
2009-09-13T15:22:00.000Z	Slart		!rpm | break
2009-09-13T15:22:00.000Z	opensourceAJ		 FATAL: Error inserting vfat (/lib/modules/2.6.28-15-generic/kernel/fs/fat/vfat.ko): Cannot allocate memory
2009-09-13T15:23:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	got above error and this vmap allocation failed: use vmalloc=<size> to increase size.
2009-09-13T15:27:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	hmm.. never seen that error yes
2009-09-13T15:27:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	better go post on forum then DX
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	that might work .. give it a try
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	thx for your time
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	you're welcome
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	what is launchpad, and should I use it for this?
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	opensourceAJ		I know its bugtracking, should I bother learnsing
2009-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	Slart		!launchpad | opensourceAJ
2009-09-13T15:29:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	well.. there isn't really that much to learn.. you can browse around without registering.. who knows.. perhaps your bug is already reported
2009-09-13T15:29:00.000Z	Slart	opensourceAJ	but I would start with the forums..
2009-09-13T15:30:00.000Z	opensourceAJ	Slart	ty again
