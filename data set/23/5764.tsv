2006-09-13T11:42:00.000Z	_X-ray_		ow indeed
2006-09-13T11:42:00.000Z	_X-ray_		you should have to chown it then
2006-09-13T11:43:00.000Z	_X-ray_		ow now that I'm here
2006-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	_X-ray_		let me try....
2006-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	_X-ray_		erm...
2006-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	_X-ray_		sudo chmod 7777 username /var/www?
2006-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	_X-ray_		lol no
2006-09-13T11:45:00.000Z	_X-ray_		sudo chmod 7777 /var/www?
2006-09-13T11:45:00.000Z	_X-ray_		and sudo chown username /var/www
2006-09-13T11:45:00.000Z	_X-ray_		but I should add another option for making it apply to the folders and files created within?
2006-09-13T11:46:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	use -R for both of those to recurse through and do it for every file and subdirectory recursively
2006-09-13T11:52:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	UT2004 ftw
2006-09-13T11:53:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	Well, UT doesn't need a CD to run, and I have a Keygen that I can wine if you don't mind no being able to play online ;)
2006-09-13T11:59:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	kate ftw
2006-09-13T12:00:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	I use KDE, so combined with Kate, I can edit syntax-highlighted PHP directly over an FTP server
2006-09-13T12:17:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	Tell me about it. they audio in Youtube gets way behind the video, more and more as you get further into it
2006-09-13T12:33:00.000Z	_X-ray_	total_meltdown	what are you serving on it?
2006-09-13T12:33:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	It's a personal development server for my friend and I. We make games (OMG CLICHE!!!), and its just a place for collaboration and backups
2006-09-13T12:34:00.000Z	_X-ray_	total_meltdown	like a CVS?
2006-09-13T12:34:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	well, a little less organized, but yeah kinda like that
2006-09-13T12:34:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	it's really just an FTP server with some folders :/
2006-09-13T12:35:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	Kubuntu disks, yes. Not Ubuntu disks
2006-09-13T12:38:00.000Z	total_meltdown	_X-ray_	They're exactly the same AFAIK, but Kubuntu comes with KDE, Ubuntu comes with Gnome
