2007-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	ironcladlou		i'm having some conceptual difficulty making the distinction between gnome the desktop environment and metacity the WM. is it possible to use "gnome" with another window manager (like, fluxbox, icewm, etc)? how do you do such a thing?
2007-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	ironcladlou		for instance, i've installed fluxbox, and noticed that in gdm i can choose between "Gnome" and "Fluxbox" as a "session". But how does that make any sense? I thought Gnome was a desktop environment, while fluxbox is a WM.
2007-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	it wouldn't really be gnome then... it would be gnome running another window manager inside it.
2007-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	what about compiz/beryl then? when you use those, gnome still appears to be "gnome"
2007-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	its the same thing. its beryl running on top of gnome.
2007-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	so why is it not possible to use another WM within gnome and still maintain the overall gnome experience (whatever that is, i guess)
2007-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	or is it possible and i am just ignorant about how to accomplish it
2007-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	because it's the new WM which change the gnome look.
2007-05-06T08:55:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	i guess i am just unclear as to what it is gnome actually does and how much of the WM is responsible for defining my desktop environment
2007-05-06T08:56:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	is gnome really a "thing", or just a set of libraries and possibly some daemons to let apps interact (dbus etc)
2007-05-06T09:02:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	why are we comparing to windows... windows that was released 6 years ago vs ubuntu released last month on your old hardware isn't a fair comparison.
2007-05-06T09:04:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	well, i'm not sure it's as apples-to-oranges as you make it out to be. even kwin performs closer to windows on my "old hardware" that gnome/metacity. and i've been trying these things on and off for years with the same results
2007-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	i'm very surprised you find kwin performs better than GTK.
2007-05-06T09:06:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	I don't think KDE overall performs better than Gnome, but kwin is absolutely a more responsive UI experience than metacity in my experience on various machines. i have no idea if this is a factor of using metacity with gnome or what. i never tried to use kwin without kde, for instance (is that even possible?)
2007-05-06T09:07:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	thats definitely just your perception then, because i think the majority would agree that gnome runs faster than KDE.
2007-05-06T09:08:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	well, i am certainly not going to speak as to what the majority believes or doesn't believe. i just want to know how the heck i can try another WM but retain the gnome feel
2007-05-06T09:11:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	beryl/compiz just don't go over gnome's head by running extra panels and stuff.
2007-05-06T09:11:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	because bery/compiz aren't full blown desktop environments as Gnome KDE or XFCE are.
2007-05-06T09:12:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	so how can i simply replace metacity with fluxbox or whatever WM i want the same way compiz/beryl can
2007-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	you could start gnome and then run fluxbox.
2007-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	Nubbie	ironcladlou	it may have a --replace function to keep metacity from starting again.
2007-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	ah ha!
2007-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	ironcladlou	Nubbie	let me give this a shot...
