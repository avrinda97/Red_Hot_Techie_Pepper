2008-02-12T15:19:00.000Z	fdafda		Could someone help me to mount a secondary hdd, both contain linux but only the primary comes up in filemanagement
2008-02-12T15:20:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	use mount and your device name under /dev/ for the drive you want to mount
2008-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	if I do mount, or mount -a, it comes up as 1 sda, but it should be hda, and the second one doesn't show at all
2008-02-12T15:22:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	where is your boot manager located, and do you use your bios menu to select a drive to boot from?
2008-02-12T15:23:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	both drives have been primary discs, so both have grubs installed on them, in bios the primary is selected as primary, and that's the one that comes up.
2008-02-12T15:24:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	I have a feeling my fstab is messed up, but dont know how to fix it: http://pastebin.com/m4bbb6370
2008-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	line 10 and 11 seem awkward to me. i think they are junk indeed.
2008-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	how can you adres your second harddisk? is it known as /dev/sdb?
2008-02-12T15:27:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	This is with "df -h": http://pastebin.com/d8b1ae1d
2008-02-12T15:28:00.000Z	gwork		try /media/disk
2008-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	try /media/disk, it may well be that /dev/sdc1 is the primary partition you are looking for
2008-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	That is a usb stick, sorry for confusion..
2008-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	okay. then you still have sdb left to try.. try fdisk on /dev/sdb to see if there is any partition on there. Be sure not to remove things!
2008-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	it comes up like this on sdb: http://pastebin.com/d5ebc804f
2008-02-12T15:34:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	press m to see the commands. there should be something about printing a list of partitions (i *think* it's P).
2008-02-12T15:34:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	you are right, it was 'p': http://pastebin.com/d2cc1443c
2008-02-12T15:38:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	so it somehow needs a new mount-point or how to make it accessible from the current (sda) drive I'm on?
2008-02-12T15:39:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	do you get the result you expected?
2008-02-12T15:40:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	if you have a partition on, let's say, /dev/sdb1 you want to mount. You can try sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/other_harddisk  (after having created that directory of course)
2008-02-12T15:42:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	it was spinning up, but then terminal crashed
2008-02-12T15:42:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	it worked, I ran it from tty2 instead
2008-02-12T15:43:00.000Z	fdafda	gwork	awesome job mate, thanks a million for the help, you saved my day..
2008-02-12T15:43:00.000Z	gwork	fdafda	your welcome, have fun!
