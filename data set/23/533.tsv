2011-07-02T13:27:00.000Z	EO		what
2011-07-02T13:27:00.000Z	EO		what's the fedora equivalent?  freshrpms or something.
2011-07-02T13:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 then theres unoffical repositories (often avail as a ppa) from sites like webupd8 or omgubuntu. (use at your own risk)
2011-07-02T13:30:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	what's the most official codec/multimedia repo out there for ubuntubes?
2011-07-02T13:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 proberly medibuntu. but i find i rarely even need the medibuntu stuff these days.
2011-07-02T13:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 compuiz has a vsync option.  otehr video players like vlc and mplayer also have filter options that can reduce tearing.
2011-07-02T13:42:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	hrm ok vlc it is :)
2011-07-02T13:45:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	I don't think VLC has any vsync option.  It seems to be a video driver thing.
2011-07-02T13:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 vlc has more options thatn you can imagine.. most are hidden under the advanced features.. it has some filter features..
2011-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	yea but vlc forums seems to explicitly say it's not in there.  and a look through the advanced video output module section didn't show me any vsync stuff either.
2011-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 i just normally enable sync in compiz then play with filters in vlc.
2011-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	smplayer looks like a nice wrapper around mplayer.
2011-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 thats correct..
2011-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	yea it's still tearing in mplayer :(
2011-07-02T13:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 all i recall doing on my box was enable vsync in compiz, and set vlc to use some 'bob' filter.
2011-07-02T13:53:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	bob is for deinterlacing, not tearing.
2011-07-02T13:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 whatever then.. i dont have any tearing issue. I just play with the settings..
2011-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 theres also that special nvidia 'feature' built into vlc. i forget what its even called...
2011-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	vdpau, don't put it in quotes, it's really cool. :)
2011-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	I look to be running noveau.  maybe it doesn't support vsync at all
2011-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 i can never rember its name..   I cant evenget a decent desktopp with noveau.. i have to use the nvidia drivers.
2011-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	EO	dr_willis	sadly I'm running off the CD.  I think if I try to restart X it'll probably reboot on me.
2011-07-02T13:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	EO	 i can barely get the live cd's working with my nvidia system.  I basically have to use nomodeset , install then install the nvidia drivers from the console befor i can get a working desktop
