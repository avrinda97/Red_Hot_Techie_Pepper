2012-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	you're trying to install some non-official packages , so you need the older version ?
2012-05-14T12:43:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	no i am trying to compile qt with ssl. and version 4.2.2 seems to fail with the current ssl version. I worked two weeks ago so i am pretty sure its the last two upgrades that caused it
2012-05-14T12:44:00.000Z	GuySoft		and its a problem finding that spesific version because ubuntu repos dont store versions on that resolution.
2012-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	ok , so compile your customized openssl , and specify link flags
2012-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	i need it to be static.
2012-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	of course
2012-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	statically compile openssl , and link the ".a" files
2012-05-14T12:46:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	ah, well I am trying to avoid that
2012-05-14T12:46:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	i'm confused
2012-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	ah wait, you might be right.
2012-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	i've done this before , there's some option in qt's configure script IIRC
2012-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	I am just using openssl for other stuff here. so it got me confused
2012-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	wait what? an option to do what?
2012-05-14T12:49:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	perhaps you might recognize the compile error? its reported around the net but no one seems to answer how to solve it (apart from disabline ssl)
2012-05-14T12:49:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	./configure -help | less
2012-05-14T12:49:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	maybe , not guaranteed
2012-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	yeah , if you still have it , you can hold it for updates
2012-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	http://nopaste.dk/p5088
2012-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	an option to do what?
2012-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	choose the openssl version to use
2012-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	we can do that? hang on
2012-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	Hoyt	GuySoft	i'm not sure , check it by ./configure -help | less
2012-05-14T12:53:00.000Z	GuySoft	Hoyt	i did. only yes no or linked
