2005-07-23T09:15:00.000Z	knowledge_		anyone?
2005-07-23T09:17:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	you are using the wrong instructions.
2005-07-23T09:18:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	sorry. no you're not. their instructions are a little wacky.
2005-07-23T09:19:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	i presume it doesn't just make a folder in the directory you rmpbuil in then?
2005-07-23T09:21:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	why don't you just apt-get install wxpython2.5.3 ?
2005-07-23T09:21:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	ah. sorry. reading that now.
2005-07-23T09:22:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	looks to me like rpmbuild should build you a folder in the same dir
2005-07-23T09:23:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	i'm guessing it doesn't or you wouldn't be asking
2005-07-23T09:24:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	rpmbuild log?
2005-07-23T09:24:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	specify it to log on the command line/
2005-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	good. :) any clues in it?
2005-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	updatedb ; locate py2.3
2005-07-23T09:28:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	why lol?
2005-07-23T09:31:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	yeah and nothing in the /usr/src/RPMS/i386 ?
2005-07-23T09:32:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	hmmm.
2005-07-23T09:33:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	locate rpm
2005-07-23T09:34:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	what's the name of the py file  in the /usr/src/blah
2005-07-23T09:37:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	yeah.
2005-07-23T09:38:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	i think the 3 packages are rebuilt to show as  'version 2.3' . you could try alien'ing all three of them but i'm not sure.
2005-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	you should be able to make copies and then try alien'ing them without harming anything else.
2005-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	gyaresu_	knowledge_	should work.
