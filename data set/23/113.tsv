2012-07-02T00:53:00.000Z	sarsaeol		anyone heard of USB3 issues with 3.2.0-25-generic ?
2012-07-02T00:54:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	i have had no issues with usb3, have you checked 'mount' to see how your drives were mounted?
2012-07-02T00:56:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	is there somethi8ng liek a verbose flag i should be looking for?
2012-07-02T00:57:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	mount -l or just mount
2012-07-02T00:59:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	does it show a mode?
2012-07-02T01:02:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	i thnik dmesg even says it shoudl write: [sdc] Write Protect is off
2012-07-02T01:03:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	what options are active on the one that is working?
2012-07-02T01:03:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	uno moment\
2012-07-02T01:07:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	 the output of mount for each disk is identical
2012-07-02T01:08:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	are you getting an error when attempting to write to the device?
2012-07-02T01:11:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	can you view the permissions for the drive?
2012-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	has this drive ever worked with linux before?
2012-07-02T01:13:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	no i have not seen it work with any linux yet... let me try on my 10.04 box
2012-07-02T01:14:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	ok it may have some windows specific permissions set on it that would prevent you from writeing to it
2012-07-02T01:14:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	i formetted it with gparted tho
2012-07-02T01:15:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	 but let me still check my 10.04 box... its pretty reliable
2012-07-02T01:16:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	oh i did not realize you had used gparted. and i have never owned a mac :)
2012-07-02T01:20:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	well okay but that will be like the 3rd time
2012-07-02T01:20:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	gonna reboot to get these updates in
2012-07-02T02:21:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	for some reason this disk and hfs+ will not play nice... tried new enclosure and can write when it is ntfs but not when it is hfs+
2012-07-02T02:28:00.000Z	sarsaeol	fe80	def weird... i think ill just hack ntfs support onto my mac... oh well thanks for the help!
2012-07-02T02:28:00.000Z	fe80	sarsaeol	hey no problem sorry i could not be more help
