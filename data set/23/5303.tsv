2008-07-11T14:17:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	thanks.
2008-07-11T14:02:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	do you know what command I need to resize my root partition off of some allready previsioned NTFS space?
2008-07-11T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	gparted is the best tool, but even thats not without risk
2008-07-11T14:04:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	is what I want to do simple?  I don't want to kill my M$ partition, I just need some more space on this linux root
2008-07-11T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	(you can call it MS - you don't have to slate microsoft to be cool)
2008-07-11T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	gparted will resize it, very simple, but again, there is a risk
2008-07-11T14:06:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	I'm just too lazy to type ou microsoft, and I think that M$ shows their true intent
2008-07-11T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	M$ is not cool, and a bit childish to be honest
2008-07-11T14:07:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	ok, once gparted is launched, how do I go about resizing it?
2008-07-11T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	the risk is small, so don't fret too much, but it's unfair to not say "there is a risk"
2008-07-11T14:14:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	I have my windows partition @ the start of the disk, followed by my swap, then my root.  How can I move the chunk of space that I just sliced off of the window parition?  The swap is in the way?  Can I just expand the swap over the new 2Gb partition I made, then resize the swap to move the 2Gb to the end, and then reabsorbe the 2Gb into my root?
2008-07-23T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	ask the question
2008-07-23T13:33:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	I'm trying to create the tree, and I'm getting
2008-07-23T13:33:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	The Perl module Net::LDAP needed to connect to the LDAP server is not installed.
2008-07-23T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	how are you trying to create a tree - what tools
2008-07-23T13:34:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	through the webmin interface
2008-07-23T13:40:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	ok, now I'm getting an error of cn=Manager,dc=your-domain,dc=com from webmin
2008-07-23T13:40:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	webmin is not supported, and it's not in the ubuntu repo's so it looks like when you've set it up yourself you've not linked the correct perl modules into your ldap root server
2008-07-23T13:40:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	ok, thanks
2008-07-23T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	I exaplined to you earlier webmin is not supported or packaged through ubuntu
2008-07-23T13:53:00.000Z	jeeves__	ikonia	you're right, you've told me that allready, now that you have, I'm not asking oyu
2008-07-23T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	jeeves__	so please don't ask ubuntu support resources.
