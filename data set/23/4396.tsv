2008-01-18T15:53:00.000Z	goodhabit		Hello. How can I ckeck my harddrive? Because some last days ubuntu waiting before executing applications, cpu empty, etc. and working takes many time. I think it is possible trouble with harddrive.
2008-01-18T15:54:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	well, unlikely to be
2008-01-18T15:55:00.000Z	goodhabit	kbrooks	sorry?
2008-01-18T15:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	ubuntu may be running slow. the chance that this is a HD problem is almost nil
2008-01-18T15:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	well, for some reassurance to you, i guess you can check for ata errors. pastebin the file that is created by this command:
2008-01-18T15:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	dmesg | grep -i driveready
2008-01-18T15:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	er ... hold on
2008-01-18T15:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	dmesg | grep -i driveready > output
2008-01-18T15:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	open a terminal, and type that command
2008-01-18T15:58:00.000Z	goodhabit	kbrooks	$ sudo dmesg | grep -i driveready > output    shows nothing.
2008-01-18T15:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	it outputs nothing, its supposed to
2008-01-18T15:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	then open up the file named "output" with a text editor
2008-01-18T15:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	go to
2008-01-18T15:59:00.000Z	goodhabit	kbrooks	waitwait :)
2008-01-18T16:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	wc -l output - does it say 0?
2008-01-18T16:00:00.000Z	goodhabit	kbrooks	yes.
2008-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	all right, no HD problems then
2008-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	goodhabit	kbrooks	are you shure about grep -i driveready ?
2008-01-18T16:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	linux logs a error message with one of the lines having "driveready" (cased properly, obviously)
2008-01-18T16:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	when it cant access the hard drive
2008-01-18T16:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	due to sector problems
2008-01-18T16:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	also, you can use
2008-01-18T16:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	goodhabit	to catch problems before they happen
