2007-04-14T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	use 'rename'.  Do you know regexp?
2007-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	tried rename and looked up the man, but guess I'm not doing it right...I'll show you the error is a sec
2007-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	k
2007-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	how should I type it
2007-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	use ' not 
2007-04-14T15:24:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	can you give me the full line?
2007-04-14T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	but, that is a pretty useless command.  You will replace the .mod at the end of any files that end in .mpg
2007-04-14T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	right you want s/\.mod$/.mpg/
2007-04-14T15:29:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	typing rename s/\.mod$/.mpg  doesn't do anything...even tried rename 's/\.mod$/' .mpg but get Substitution replacement not terminated at (eval 1) line 1.    What am I doing wrong?
2007-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	you forgot the / at the end
2007-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	did it too, to no avail...aaarrrrggggghhhhh
2007-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	paste the whole command you entered and the output on pastebin
2007-04-14T15:31:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	I'll do it multiple ways and paste it...give me a couple mins
2007-04-14T15:31:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	just do this one:  rename 's/\.mod$/.mpg/' *.mod
2007-04-14T15:32:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	thank you very much
2007-04-14T15:32:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	were you doing *.mpg at the end before?
2007-04-14T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	ah ok
2007-04-14T15:33:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	my video camera puts the .mod extension, but the files are really .mpg ... it was aggravating, so i appreciate your help
2007-04-14T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	duelboot	np
2007-04-14T15:42:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	I'm out of here, but wanted to say thanks again
2007-04-21T11:41:00.000Z	duelboot	jrib	need your assistance again...just upgraded (from scratch) to Fiesty and lost my history...you helped me the other day with the rename...do you remember the syntax?
