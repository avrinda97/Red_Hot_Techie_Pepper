2010-06-21T07:24:00.000Z	starwatcher		hi all, i have a question, I lost the ability to see in the task bar things that have been minimized, any idea how to get that back?
2010-06-21T07:24:00.000Z	the_e	starwatcher	you need to edit your panel
2010-06-21T07:24:00.000Z	the_e		it is, but pidgin runs like a poorly made AJAX script
2010-06-21T07:24:00.000Z	the_e		I want something with more Windows integration (which I love about Ubuntu and whatever it uses)
2010-06-21T07:25:00.000Z	starwatcher	the_e	what do i need to turn on?
2010-06-21T07:25:00.000Z	the_e		hold on one sec
2010-06-21T07:27:00.000Z	the_e	starwatcher	I can't find it right now, but I think its in admin > preferences > panels and you drag it in
2010-06-21T07:27:00.000Z	the_e		it should have minimizes windows to panel for the description, I did the same thing you did
2010-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	the_e		I've gotten rid of the normal menus and replaced them with carprio(sp?) and it doesn't have teh same menu options and searching "panels" only brings up Java 6 panel, natch
2010-06-21T07:30:00.000Z	starwatcher	the_e	where is admin>preferences. panels aaat?
2010-06-21T07:30:00.000Z	the_e		I didnt like the netbook version
2010-06-21T07:30:00.000Z	the_e		it had problems with bottom margin setting for me
2010-06-21T07:31:00.000Z	the_e		like 1/6 of the application launcher menu would go past my monitor resolution and i couldnt scroll to it
2010-06-21T07:31:00.000Z	the_e		they are, but in my experience it didn't make much difference except be more of a pain in the ass
2010-06-21T07:31:00.000Z	the_e		what's your specs?
2010-06-21T07:32:00.000Z	the_e		I mean, I wouldn't even recommend Ubuntu if the specs were too low
2010-06-21T07:32:00.000Z	the_e		especially teh netbook version, lol
2010-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	the_e		im sorry starwatcher i really can't find what im looking for
2010-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	the_e		can you right click on the panel and is there an "add" option?
2010-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	starwatcher		ok thanks any way
2010-06-21T07:35:00.000Z	the_e	starwatcher	http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Customizing_the_Ubuntu_GNOME_Desktop_Panels
2010-06-21T07:36:00.000Z	the_e		for some reason I can't access it, but I think this will help
2010-06-21T07:52:00.000Z	starwatcher	the_e	you still there?
