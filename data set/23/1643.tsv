2011-06-25T06:43:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	you don't need a virus scanner unless you are transfering the files to a windows machine
2011-06-25T06:47:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	you don't need it
2011-06-25T06:47:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	check your ports with nmap
2011-06-25T06:48:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	sudo apt-get install nmap
2011-06-25T06:49:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	all should be closed
2011-06-25T06:49:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	close it
2011-06-25T06:51:00.000Z	hiexpo	ubuntuaaagh	nmap will tell you   like sudo nmap -A  {iprange
