2010-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	ArchMage		anyone else have this problem w/ glxinfo/blender?
2010-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	if it worked on the first start, perhaps something in your configuration went wrong. try to remove/rename the .blender folder and see what happens on the next start
2010-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	ArchMage	nh2	that was my thought too, but i tried that already. :(
2010-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	ArchMage	nh2	also tried completely removing it in synaptic then reinstalling blender
2010-01-24T01:50:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	which Ubuntu version /kernel?
2010-01-24T01:54:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	perhaps. do you have an ATI card?
2010-01-24T01:56:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	not sure, but its definately graphics related with glxinfo. Are you running the opensource drivers?
2010-01-24T01:57:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	ok, could you check system->system settings point-> hardware (propiretary) drivers?
2010-01-24T02:03:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	try installing the ati proprietary drivers, reboot and check if the error persists
2010-01-24T02:04:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	there are binary drivers if its a radeono
2010-01-24T02:06:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	seems as if 9100 series were thrown out of fglrx in some release, but you could try an older one
2010-01-24T02:09:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	yes, it is indeed strange that it worked for the first time, I have no idea why. But if the prop. driver does not help anything, you can still search for another solutioin, so it might be worth a try. http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/xorg-driver-fglrx seems to support 9100
2010-01-24T02:12:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	yeah you should try it, it will deny if it thinks it won't work
2010-01-24T02:16:00.000Z	ArchMage	nh2	is there anything i have to do to enable this driver once it's installed?
2010-01-24T02:40:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	can you run other opengl 2d or 3d apps?
2010-01-24T02:40:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	I think glxgears is not a so great example to try out (though i forgot the reason why), try something else
2010-01-24T02:43:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	not sure, perhaps try supertuxkart
2010-01-24T02:44:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	hmm then opengl should work fine
2010-01-24T02:44:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	could you try a rather old version of blender?
2010-01-24T02:48:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	perhaps there is indeed something wrong with your card. you could try letting it cool a down a bit. You could also try starting blender from a ubuntu live cd which will make sure it isnt't your system that has changed
2010-01-24T02:51:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	sudo Xorg -configure  will create an xorg.conf
2010-01-24T02:53:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	I don't think so, it might work with a HAL fdi file but it seems way harder than editing xorg.conf
2010-01-24T02:54:00.000Z	nh2	ArchMage	you can still fiddle with HAL in case disabling dri helps
