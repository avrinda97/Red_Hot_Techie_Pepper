2009-09-20T14:54:00.000Z	benn		hello everybody
2009-09-20T14:55:00.000Z	benn		hmm..where is the list off all the users?
2009-09-20T14:55:00.000Z	benn		i have a problem when i compie the kernel
2009-09-20T14:55:00.000Z	Walex	benn	depends which users.
2009-09-20T14:56:00.000Z	Walex	benn	that's not an error, but a warning.
2009-09-20T15:12:00.000Z	Walex	benn	that is a moderately advanced sort of work. You probably don't need it either; it just makes things a bit faster.
2009-09-20T17:27:00.000Z	Walex	benn	there are many, many, many GRUB tutorials.
2009-09-20T17:28:00.000Z	benn	Walex	can i PM you?
2009-09-20T17:28:00.000Z	Walex	benn	yes, but what's the point? Are you going to ask a question that is private?
2009-09-20T17:28:00.000Z	benn	Walex	no..just not to flood here
2009-09-20T17:29:00.000Z	Walex	benn	that's fine, send by PM.
2009-09-20T17:30:00.000Z	Walex	benn	that syntax looks good. prhaps remove "quiet splash" so you can see what is happening during the boot.
2009-09-20T17:30:00.000Z	benn	Walex	and "ro" also to delete?
2009-09-20T17:31:00.000Z	Walex	benn	no, "ro" is good.
2009-09-20T17:31:00.000Z	benn	Walex	 and now?reboot and see what it says?
2009-09-20T17:32:00.000Z	Walex	benn	yes, and it is likely to work, if the UUIDs are right, and the 'initrd' has the right modules.
2009-09-20T17:32:00.000Z	benn	Walex	i-ve coppied the UUIDs from the kernel that loads now,the last version
2009-09-20T17:36:00.000Z	Walex	benn	that should be good.
2009-09-20T17:48:00.000Z	benn	Walex	should i write everything that appears on load?:)
2009-09-20T17:55:00.000Z	benn	Walex	i should write that command there,when loading the kernel???
2009-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	Walex	benn	'man mkinitrd' and it is not trivial
2009-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	Walex	benn	it is a command you run before rebooting.
2009-09-20T17:57:00.000Z	benn	Walex	how to run the command before booting?
