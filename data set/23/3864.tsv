2009-06-04T05:16:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		hey my xchat cannot accept files (I think, problem could be on the senders end) -- I click accept and then it is stuck in connnect state forever
2009-06-04T05:18:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		any ideas why i can't accept files via xchat?
2009-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hvgotcodes	is there an option to block them?
2009-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	i don't understand
2009-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	the other guy tries to send, i get a popup, click accept, nothing happens
2009-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hvgotcodes	is there a setting in xchat someplace to block all file transfers (for security)
2009-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	ill check
2009-06-04T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hvgotcodes	in the changelog it satates "Added "Auto accept file offers" to the File Transfer settings"
2009-06-04T05:22:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	tried that still not working
2009-06-04T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hvgotcodes	maybe it needs restarting to apply
2010-03-25T19:28:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	thanx lemme try that
2010-03-25T19:29:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	im not understanding the output; but i dont see any ports
2010-03-25T19:29:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	when i do netstat -anp | grep 8443 i see that a process is listening on that port
2010-03-25T19:32:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	i dont understand
2010-03-25T19:34:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	right, i did not see that after -a
2010-03-25T19:36:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	ok, im new at this so you can explain it like you would to an idiot? ;)
2010-03-25T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hvgotcodes	true but the rfc standard says port 22. If you change it in /etc/ssh/sshd_config it will show a port number
2010-03-25T19:42:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	ActionParsnip	how would i determine the difference between port 22 is available, but a process is not using it?
