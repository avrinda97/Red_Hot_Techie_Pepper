2007-09-04T09:56:00.000Z	zurn		well its a common problem, I have a usb headset that works fine in quake3 and teamspeak, but I cant use both at once
2007-09-04T09:57:00.000Z	zurn		i've tried a bunch a different howto's and nothing work
2007-09-04T09:57:00.000Z	zurn		works*

2007-09-04T09:58:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	you mean, you can't get sound working in quake3 and TS simultaneously?
2007-09-04T09:58:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	exactly
2007-09-04T09:59:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	both work perfectly seperatly
2007-09-04T09:59:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	hm, IIRC, neither quake3 nor teamspeak can use ALSA
2007-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	yeah, kinda sux
2007-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	it's not specifically a headset thing, right? like if you try something else, it still won't work?
2007-09-04T10:01:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	I can use my headset to do two things at once, like XMMS and youtube etc
2007-09-04T10:01:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	i mean, if you try a different headset or different sound out
2007-09-04T10:02:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	I havent tried with my onboard sound card
2007-09-04T10:02:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	that's what i was thinking
2007-09-04T10:03:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	hm, did you have to add some lines to some alsa-oss config file or something to get quake3 working? (vague memory)
2007-09-04T10:04:00.000Z	zurn	Daverocks	all I had to do to make quake3 work is add /dev/dsp1 in the quake 3 config file
2007-09-04T10:04:00.000Z	Daverocks	zurn	hm
