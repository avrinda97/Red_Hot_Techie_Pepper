2008-01-30T00:47:00.000Z	dame		can i upgrade from ubuntu 5.10 to some newer version?
2008-01-30T00:47:00.000Z	dame		how?
2008-01-30T00:49:00.000Z	ejer	dame	try System -> Administration -> Update manager
2008-01-30T00:50:00.000Z	dame	ejer	it says my system is up to date :D. I reloaded the package informations and still no upgrade for me
2008-01-30T00:51:00.000Z	ejer	dame	in a terminal try 'gksudo update-manager -c -d'
2008-01-30T00:53:00.000Z	dame	ejer	gksudo: invalid option -- c
2008-01-30T00:53:00.000Z	ejer	dame	gksudo '
2008-01-30T00:53:00.000Z	ejer	dame	gksudo 'update-manager -c -d'
2008-01-30T00:55:00.000Z	dame	ejer	it seems that i cannot upgrade. it says that i cannot upgrade some packeges and i need to run dist-upgrade. dist-upgrade says no update available
2008-01-30T00:55:00.000Z	ejer	dame	this is a very old version of ubuntu
2008-01-30T00:56:00.000Z	ejer	dame	you may need to do a fresh install, and I would think it would be preferable anyways
2008-01-30T00:56:00.000Z	dame	ejer	i know but the newer versions could not install grub properly.
2008-01-30T00:56:00.000Z	dame	ejer	in my case ofcourse
2008-01-30T00:59:00.000Z	ejer	dame	yes, but you will need to edit the grub bootup manually which is not fun necessarily
2008-01-30T00:59:00.000Z	dame	ejer	i know its not a big deal, is there a option to leave the grub alone in the installation wizard?
2008-01-30T01:00:00.000Z	ejer	dame	yes, but your system will not boot
2008-01-30T01:00:00.000Z	dame	ejer	why? i will edit the manu.lst manually
2008-01-30T01:00:00.000Z	ejer	dame	unless you know how to manually tell grub what to do
2008-01-30T01:01:00.000Z	dame	ejer	i need to change the kernel line and the initrd line. am i right?
2008-01-30T01:02:00.000Z	ejer	dame	yes, and if you can boot into new system, you can then reinstall gub
2008-01-30T01:04:00.000Z	dame	ejer	i dont think newer version of grub will work coz i tried 3 different new distributions and grub was making me probnlems
2008-01-30T01:04:00.000Z	ejer	dame	grub will work, you may need to hack with it though
2008-01-30T01:05:00.000Z	dame	ejer	it was giving me errors like it cant find /boot/grub/stage1 and simillar
