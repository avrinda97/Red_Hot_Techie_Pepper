2008-06-21T12:25:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH		Why does my firefox crash every now and then when I play a youtube video?
2008-06-21T12:26:00.000Z	theron	Mo0oSaH	it probably has something to do with what flash player you're using
2008-06-21T12:26:00.000Z	theron		what flash are you using right now?
2008-06-21T12:26:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH		the latest version
2008-06-21T12:26:00.000Z	theron	Mo0oSaH	 are you using gnash or the official flash player?
2008-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH		I downloaded it yesterday because I couldn't play youtube and amarok at same time, now I can do that but occasionaly firefox crashes when I click a flash link
2008-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	I'm using the nonfree one
2008-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	theron		i uninstalled the rest and installed macromedia flashplayer
2008-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	theron		haven't had one problem since getting rid of the rest of the swf players and using macromedia flash
2008-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	it's in the repos?
2008-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	that's the one I'm using
2008-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	theron		easier than that, can get it from add/remove :-p
2008-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	theron		it is huh....are the rest of your swf players uninstalled?
2008-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	theron		you should check to see in firefox 3's plugins if there's others there
2008-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	theron		sometimes even if the right one is there it uses another on firefox 3 Mo0oSaH
2008-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	I can't quite remember the command to check the installed flash players
2008-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	mind helping me out?
2008-06-21T12:30:00.000Z	theron		i don't know the command, honestly, but if you go to system tools and synaptic and search swf it will show them all
2008-06-21T12:31:00.000Z	theron	Mo0oSaH	did you find synaptic and the swf players?
2008-06-21T12:31:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	looking for them now
2008-06-21T12:32:00.000Z	theron		alright, might take a few minutes Mo0oSaH  there's a lot and if you've been trying for a while might have several installed
2008-06-21T12:32:00.000Z	Mo0oSaH	theron	that's the only one I have installed
2008-06-21T12:33:00.000Z	theron	Mo0oSaH	 are you using 32 or 64 bit? i'm using 64 and haven't used 32 bit ubuntu
