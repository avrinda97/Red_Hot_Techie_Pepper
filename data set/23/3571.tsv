2008-06-01T19:26:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Both incomplete and not necessarily the best idea.
2008-06-01T19:26:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	why is that?
2008-06-01T19:28:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	i get that it's incomplete, but why is making a backup of fstab not a good idea?
2008-06-01T19:28:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Making a backup of fstab is a good idea. Making one in /etc/ is not. And you need Knoppix to restore it.
2008-06-01T19:28:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	ah good call
2008-06-01T19:29:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Or the Ubuntu LiveCD but that's, uh, just awful.
2008-06-01T19:29:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	cp /etc/fstab ~/.fstab
2008-06-01T20:41:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	i would imagine so... dd works on raw data, so it should work
2008-06-01T20:41:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	What about partition size?
2008-06-01T20:42:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Lemme guess, the partitions should be exactly the same size if restoring. Or will dd write safely on a larger partition?
2008-06-01T20:42:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	error on the side of caution... same partition size
2008-06-01T20:43:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	i don't have much xp with dd tho.... google the hell out of that before you write it
2008-06-01T20:43:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Yeah, I was thinking that too. That however means I need to do the partitioning with the windows installer if I do...
2008-06-01T20:43:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	you should be able to partition it with fdisk... just make sure the type of the partition is correct
2008-06-01T20:43:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	I'm thinking of just dd'ing the windows xp partition to the linux partition and then restoring WHEN windows gets chockfull of malware again
2008-06-01T20:44:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	or just don't use windows for web surfing....
2008-06-01T20:44:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	or anything for that matter :D
2008-06-01T20:44:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	Not an option. Bro.
2008-06-01T20:44:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	He's strictly against booting to a different OS for gaming.
2008-06-01T20:46:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	psh that's his problem :D
2008-06-01T20:48:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	that idea could mess up the games.... registry values and all
2008-06-01T20:49:00.000Z	Taza	mDemocritus	It's still easier than reinstalling everything every time he gets a virus
2008-06-01T20:50:00.000Z	mDemocritus	Taza	i suppose....
