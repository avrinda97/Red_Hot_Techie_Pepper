2004-11-21T06:00:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	and, you can use gconf-editor for that I think

2004-11-22T16:24:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	that's normal
2004-11-22T16:24:00.000Z	seek187	Treenaks	is there any way to make it quit saying that?
2004-11-22T16:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	yes, reading the manual
2004-11-23T14:17:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	alsamixer
2004-11-23T14:19:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	lineakd? why not just use the gnome shortcut key thingy?
2004-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	what kind of keyboard do you have?
2004-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	what kind of keyboard do you have?
2004-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	is it like the 2505 ?
2004-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	seek187	Treenaks	not sure
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	change "pc104" or "pc105" in your xorg.conf or XF86Config-4 to "hp5105"
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	seek187	Treenaks	what for?
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	that way X will recognise your "special" keys by name (the "WWW" button will be XF86WWW, etc.)
2004-11-23T14:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	so if you assign them in the gnome shortcut manager, you'll see the name of the key instead of some code
2004-11-23T14:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	/etc/X11/skb/symbols/inet
2004-11-23T14:24:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	oh wait
2004-11-23T14:37:00.000Z	seek187	Treenaks	is there a list somewhere for keyboards for xorg.conf?
2004-11-23T14:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	uh yes, but I usually look around in /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/inet (if it's an internet keyboard, otherwise just stick with pc104 or pc105)
2004-11-29T15:14:00.000Z	Treenaks	seek187	the package also plays nice with the debian "alternatives" system and the other java-packages available
