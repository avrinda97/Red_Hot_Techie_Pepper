2009-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	Jimi_Neutral	I would recommend asking in ##c, but you do need to be identified with nickserv to speak there
2009-06-16T14:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Jimi_Neutral	you will need to remember to check your email for a verification code
2009-06-16T14:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Jimi_Neutral	/msg nickserv identify <password>
2009-06-16T14:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	Jimi_Neutral	/msg nickserv identify <password>

2009-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	Jimi_Neutral	you could try configuring your client to handle identification automatically
