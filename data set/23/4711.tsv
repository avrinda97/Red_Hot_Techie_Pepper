2010-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	what type of problem are you having
2010-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	yes I know you are legit! , my WIFI driver is having hickups
2010-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	what are the symptoms?
2010-06-30T09:19:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	dont tell me you cant fix a simple driver issue?
2010-06-30T09:21:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	it depends if there is a driver available or one needs to be made from scratch
2010-06-30T09:22:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	ahh but my 'driver's' are actually compatable but do not install on this OS
2010-06-30T09:23:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	when you look at the top right of you screen is the wireless connection going away or are you just experiencing long waits?
2010-06-30T09:23:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	what os are they for?
2010-06-30T09:24:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	they worked on windows linux install (i believe its called wabi)
2010-06-30T09:24:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	they dont work anymore. thats all I know
2010-06-30T09:25:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	I think you mean wubi.  Does the connection work in windows?
2010-06-30T09:26:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	no windows is out of the question, actually if you could direct me to a USB bootable ISO for windows on USB boot maybe it could solve all my issues
2010-06-30T09:26:00.000Z	bricky	steven_	thats the most simple solutions
2010-06-30T09:27:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	unfortunately that would be illegal and could get me in trouble, but if you search isotorrent I am sure you could find one
2010-06-30T09:27:00.000Z	steven_	bricky	what manufacturer is your wifi chipset
