2007-04-11T10:33:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	doubtful
2007-04-11T10:34:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	I wanted to find it on Google videos, but athey all seem to be Youtube.
2007-04-11T10:34:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	you're trying to take a video and paste it into openoffice?
2007-04-11T10:35:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	into the presentation

2007-04-11T10:35:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	i won't say it's impossible, because we are talking computers, but...
2007-04-11T10:35:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	google video and youtube stream the content directly off the server
2007-04-11T10:36:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	meaning...?
2007-04-11T10:36:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	so, you would need to capture the streaming packets and assemble them into the video
2007-04-11T10:36:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	sniffing?  Like on Wireshark?
2007-04-11T10:36:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	and, i don't know of a way to embed a video into the presentation
2007-04-11T10:37:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	something like that
2007-04-11T10:37:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	: insert --> MOvie and sound
2007-04-11T10:38:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	then, rather than trying to save the video off of youtube, see if you can embed it, so it's still coming from the youtube servers
2007-04-11T10:39:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	that is a thought, but I don't know if I'll have access to the internet during the presentation.
2007-04-11T10:39:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	i can tell you that you can't save the videos easily. it will take a great deal of effort
2007-04-11T10:40:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	through istanbul or something?
2007-04-11T10:40:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	i don't know
2007-04-11T10:41:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	but, capturing the video and reassemling it is your only method of execution, i think. and i would have the slightest in how to accomplish that
2007-04-11T10:42:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	atoponce	perhaps our new friend bef can assist me?
2007-04-11T10:42:00.000Z	atoponce	PoofDaddy	sounds good
