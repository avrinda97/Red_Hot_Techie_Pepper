2006-10-07T13:14:00.000Z	RetLaw2		How can I install (and get) latest libstdc++5?, Anyone knows ?
2006-10-07T13:15:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	"sudo apt-get install libstdc++5"
2006-10-07T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	"sudo apt-get build-essential" will install all of the most important packages that you need if you want to compile something
2006-10-07T13:21:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	libdc++5 depends upon gcc-3.3-base, also sudo apt-get ?
2006-10-07T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	uh, dependencies should be resolved automatically...
2006-10-07T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	i.e. when you apt-get libstdc++5, it should *automatically* also download whatever else it needs. doesn't it do that?
2006-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	no it didn't
2006-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	can you pastebin the output from apt-get please?
2006-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	also -- are you running edgy? have you run a "sudo apt-get update" recently?
2006-10-07T13:25:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	pasted
2006-10-07T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	you need to give me the URL
2006-10-07T13:26:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	ok, that means there are problems with the package repository. are you running Edgy?
2006-10-07T13:27:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	no clue, just installed Ubuntu-server 6.06 without anything else
2006-10-07T13:27:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	ok. 6.06 is Dapper. Edgy is 6.10. they're the codenames for ubuntu versions
2006-10-07T13:28:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	wasn't aware there is already 6.10
2006-10-07T13:28:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	try running "sudo apt-get update", and then try again installing libstdc++5
2006-10-07T13:28:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	indeed, there isn't. it's still beta and unstable. but still some people do run it
2006-10-07T13:30:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	if it still doesnt' install, do "sudo apt-get -f install" and see
2006-10-07T13:30:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	update seems being ok, but libstdc++5 gives same error
2006-10-07T13:31:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	hadn't seem your last message
2006-10-07T13:33:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	The sudo apt-get -f install did it
2006-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	RetLaw2	LjL	: evrything ok now ! thank you for your help !!
2006-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	LjL	RetLaw2	you're welcome
