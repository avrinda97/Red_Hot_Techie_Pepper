2009-06-08T07:51:00.000Z	cowgarden	cabrey	i just want to check how much it boosts programs startup times :)
2009-06-08T07:51:00.000Z	cabrey	cowgarden	it will degrade them
2009-06-08T07:52:00.000Z	cowgarden	cabrey	does ubuntu check which programms I use frequently and cache them on startup? (like firefox)
