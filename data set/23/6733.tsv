2006-01-15T08:46:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	you might need to add the modules you dont like to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2006-01-15T08:47:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	if you have hardware in your PC, id reccomend you leave it on
2006-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	??....under ubuntu...is hotplug responsible for loading everything?
2006-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	pretty sure its a part of the backbone
2006-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	it loads a lot of nonsense...like vesafb
2006-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	vesafb is loaded from the usplash. have you disabled that?
2006-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	under other distros...hotplug is used for things like USB devices, etc.
2006-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	nope...where is that -- i apologize, I've been a FreeBSD user for years
2006-01-15T08:50:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	im pretty sure that hotplug, along with hal, load everything you need
2006-01-15T08:50:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	thats sucks...cause I don't need everything :)
2006-01-15T08:51:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	are you trying to make an uber-minimal system?
2006-01-15T08:52:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	nope, I just don't want useless kernel modules...I don't use the sound on this machine...and I don't care for pretty boot splashes (who reboots?)
2006-01-15T08:53:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	well get rid of "usplash" or "splash" in the grub menu (/boot/grub/menu.1st) and disable sound with your bios?
2006-01-15T08:54:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	thats a start..what about ipv6?
2006-01-15T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	ahhhhh i did that on my machine... hang on, ill brb.
2006-01-15T08:59:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	ok, open up /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
2006-01-15T08:59:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	just comment it out?
2006-01-15T08:59:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	ok, comment out alias net-pf-10 ipv6
2006-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	thanks, i'll try to follow the same pattern with the others
2006-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	ok. but be very careful.
2006-01-15T09:01:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	the blacklist if the better way
2006-01-15T09:02:00.000Z	gnaik	Toma-	I think im gonna try the blacklist first :)...thanks for all yer help
2006-01-15T09:02:00.000Z	Toma-	gnaik	no problem!
