2009-07-12T16:38:00.000Z	lat_		When I try to delete an unused printer driver I get "403 Forbidden". Why
2009-07-12T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	are you deleting it with sudo?
2009-07-12T16:40:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	no. How/
2009-07-12T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	just add sudo to the front of the command you are issuing and it will be removed.make sure the printer has no waiting jobs
2009-07-12T16:43:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	I've been using the cups web page utility.  How do I determine what command to use from the command line/
2009-07-12T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	gksudo firefox http://localhost:631
2009-07-12T16:46:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	I still get 403 Forbidden
2009-07-12T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	weird
2009-07-12T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	is it not removable from the printer section i gnome settings
2009-07-12T16:55:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	sudo system-config-printer does not give me a delete choice. Same with gnome settings. That is true for this one driver only. The others I can delete.
2009-07-12T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	try a reboot with the printer not attached
2009-07-12T16:59:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	I did. It didn't help. The driver is not for my printer. I don't know how it got installed.
2009-07-12T17:01:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	it just appeared one day, and has been causing problem ever since.
2009-07-12T17:02:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	it is not set as default printer, but is always the driver pre-selected.
2009-07-12T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	can you remove the driver with apt-get ?
2009-07-12T17:10:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	sorry. I don't what to type to do that.
2009-07-12T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	have a searc in synaptic, see what relates to your printer
2009-07-12T17:11:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	the driver is for the Epson 285.
2009-07-12T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	ok then search for epson, if not then I am unsure
2009-07-12T17:12:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	I did. I see nothing there.
2009-07-12T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	how did you install the driver?
2009-07-12T17:14:00.000Z	lat_	ActionParsnip	I didn't install it. It just appeared one day---very irritating.
2009-07-12T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lat_	I'd log a bug. If random printers are popping up then it sound like a bug to me
