2011-10-25T00:28:00.000Z	Kris		Ok thanks. I installed Ubuntu through Wubu. And whenever it started up after restart, It frox=ze to all these diffrent colours
2011-10-25T00:28:00.000Z	Kris		Occured every time
2011-10-25T00:28:00.000Z	Kris		After restart
2011-10-25T00:28:00.000Z	DasEi	Kris	 I personally don't like wubi, remove it and do a dualboot ?
2011-10-25T00:29:00.000Z	Kris		I also tried the CD. The same thing happened
2011-10-25T00:29:00.000Z	Kris		Its not starting up properly
2011-10-25T00:29:00.000Z	DasEi	Kris	if you just need a glance on ubuntu, install it in a :
2011-10-25T00:29:00.000Z	DasEi		!vm
2011-10-25T00:29:00.000Z	DasEi		same  for win, like virtualbox , kris
2011-10-25T00:30:00.000Z	Kris		How would I go about installing it in a : .Did not see the option
2011-10-25T00:30:00.000Z	DasEi		kris: cd is giving failures ? checked its md5 both, before and after burning (re-extract iso from cd) ?
2011-10-25T00:31:00.000Z	DasEi		!who , kris :)
2011-10-25T00:31:00.000Z	DasEi		!who | kris :)
2011-10-25T00:31:00.000Z	Kris		No i dont think so
2011-10-25T00:31:00.000Z	Kris		k. Younder how would I install it from scratch to simply have it look like ubuntu and have the features. With the least confusion
2011-10-25T00:32:00.000Z	Kris	Younder	yes
2011-10-25T00:32:00.000Z	DasEi	Kris	there are checksums for the d/l cd iso, first make sure you have a sufficient installer-cd
2011-10-25T00:32:00.000Z	DasEi	Kris	#windows or google tells you how  to md5sum a file on win
