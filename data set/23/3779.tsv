2008-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	Yonie		On the post https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetAndNetworking/DualHomedGatewayDHCP it tells me At shell prompt, issue ifdown eth2 command, i dont understand what they are asking
2008-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	do you have a terminal open?
2008-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	 yes
2008-01-23T16:50:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	type that ifdown eth2 in the terminal
2008-01-23T16:51:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	ok, thank you, if you look at the post im trying to setup 2 internet connections, the only problem is that the other connecting is via usb(its my phone) can i just replace eth2 with the usb location?
2008-01-23T16:51:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	what does the output of ifconfig give you?
2008-01-23T16:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	to answer your question though, no, a network interface name is required
2008-01-23T16:53:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	can i paste here? so do you know how i can do this with a connection via usb and via eth0?
2008-01-23T16:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	if you put the ifconfig information in the pastebin, I'll take a look at it and try and help you
2008-01-23T16:56:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	ok but when i try paste is says im spamming and i must enable javascript :s
2008-01-23T16:57:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	that's weird - can you turn java script on?
2008-01-23T16:58:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	I guess they're assuming that bots don't have javascript, and people do? I don't know
2008-01-23T16:59:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	please can i just paste it to you in private chat
2008-01-23T16:59:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	sure, go right ahead
2008-01-23T17:01:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	thanks :)
2008-01-24T16:48:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	you have any luck w/ your cell phone problem?
2008-01-24T16:51:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	im having other problems now, sometimes when i boot up my hdds dont seem to auto mount... is this a normal?
2008-01-24T16:51:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	if your hdds have filesystem errors, they won't mount (check with fsck)
2008-01-24T16:52:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	fsck?
2008-01-24T16:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	fsck when run from a terminal will check disks for filesystem errors, ie fsck /dev/sda1
2008-01-24T16:54:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	i get: fsck: fsck.ntfs: not found, that cant be good :s
2008-01-24T16:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	Yonie	you probably want to use windows to check ntfs disks
2008-01-24T16:54:00.000Z	Yonie	compwiz18	yeah ok, ill be back later then, thanks :)
