2010-10-27T08:27:00.000Z	geoff918		openSUSE isn't bad (just don't try to get support, the forums are nasty)
2010-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	geoff918		hmm, I tried compiling a much earlier stable release (I was compiling stable release) and still same error. Frustrating.
2010-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	shado`_	geoff918	thanx
2010-10-27T08:39:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Do you have any questions about which 'version' you ought to be downloading or installing? (I'm not sure what your experience level is with this stuff)
2010-10-27T08:39:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	BTW--Default for SUSE is KDE (not Gnome like Ubuntu)
2010-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	I do love yum
2010-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	you don't pay for openSUSE (at least you don't have to, you can always donate)
2010-10-27T08:44:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	you'll find that opensuse has tons of software in its repositories (amazingly much), and I do really enjoy yum as a package manager. But, it just seemed to break on me after awhile (standard updates would sometimes throw the system for a very bad curve)
2010-10-27T08:45:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	I love the appearance of KDE. I don't really enjoy anything else about it.
2010-10-27T08:45:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Do you have a shortcut key enabled or 'screen hot spots'?
2010-10-27T08:46:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Well, do you need multiple desktops. A quick and dirty fix may be to simply reduce your number of desktops to 1.
2010-10-27T08:47:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Ah, well that's pretty much out. (Except you may be able to do better with just two.)
2010-10-27T08:48:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	I wonder if you could open more than one graphical session? e.g. use the one on F7, but also create a separate gdm session on another like F6?
2010-10-27T08:58:00.000Z	shado`_	geoff918	how come u disconnected ?
2010-10-27T08:59:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	I went ahead and corrupted my display when I was playing around. Hah.
2010-10-27T09:00:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	I had no screen, so I used a ctl-alt-f1 and went through the log-in without any visual feedback. Then I followed it with the sudo shutdown -r now, password
2010-10-27T09:01:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Well, I do know a few things around the CLI. That for one helps to ensure I don't go corrupting data because it forces the clean shutdown
2010-10-27T09:01:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Yes, well TBH my favorite OS is still DOS. Which is probably why I'm at home at the *nix CLI.
2010-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	If you try to stay away from the CLI, you may not be *that* interested in openSUSE.
2010-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Ubuntu is probably the distro that most wants to get entirely away from terminal commands. It's the easiest to switch over to, and has the best n00b support
2010-10-27T09:05:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Doesn't rely upon, no. You'll merely find yourself there more than you expect. Ubuntu--I have friends that NEVER go to terminal.
2010-10-27T09:07:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	No, no. I'm not a programmer at all.
2010-10-27T09:09:00.000Z	geoff918	shado`_	Honestly, I find a sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade -y to be much faster and more effective than the whole GUI update manager thing
