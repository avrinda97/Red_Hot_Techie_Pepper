2009-06-05T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	is that whole bar vanishing and are you using an nvidia gfx card?
2009-06-05T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	then you need some lines in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-06-05T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	add these to your screen section: http://pastebin.com/d15d96f56
2009-06-05T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	to get write access you will need: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-06-05T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	you missed the first slash
2009-06-05T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-06-05T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	add those options to the screen section
2009-06-05T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	yes, i thought that was pretty concise
2009-06-05T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	i gave you the lines, find the screen section and paste them under anything in there but above the ednsection line
2009-06-05T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gee9043	can you pastein the new file so I can checkit
