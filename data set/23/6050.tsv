2006-09-03T13:01:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	Do you have any idea what it could be called?
2006-09-03T13:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bastu	what are you on now?

2006-09-03T13:02:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	no they are raided (clone) and empty
2006-09-03T13:02:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	I can see grub though
2006-09-03T13:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bastu	You cant mix xp raid setup and ubuntu
2006-09-03T13:03:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	its not XP... i formated everything before going into linux
2006-09-03T13:04:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	the raid was done through ALI raid while booting
2006-09-03T13:06:00.000Z	bastu	Jack_Sparrow	are you saying it will work without hardware raid?
2006-09-03T13:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bastu	You need to read that, you are not going to get both running under raid
