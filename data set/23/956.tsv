2010-11-06T09:57:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		are live tv and recording library two media players on your system?
2010-11-06T09:57:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		are you using lucid, ugliefrog? i know pulseaudio is the devil and is included by default now
2010-11-06T09:57:00.000Z	ugliefrog	nibblerofdoomz	im using 10.10
2010-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		so you've got crappy pulseaudio installed
2010-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	ugliefrog	nibblerofdoomz	dangitness
2010-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		it's not your fault it's installed by default
2010-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		it's probably the problem. pulseaudio is v buggy
2010-11-06T09:59:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		in settings for live tv etc see if there is an option to output to ALSA ugliefrog
2010-11-06T09:59:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		under sound

2010-11-06T09:59:00.000Z	ugliefrog	nibblerofdoomz	yes it s set to alsa:default
2010-11-06T10:01:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz	ugliefrog	the sound in ubuntu has been rubbish since they introduced a new system in 10.04. to fix my sound i switched to dream OS which is a custom ubuntu distro
2010-11-06T10:03:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		the guys in ubuntu studio who made the changes will not fix the problems their ideas have caused as they are too busy working on mini ego projects. so uglief
2010-11-06T10:03:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		so ugliefrog you're best waiting for an update
2010-11-06T10:04:00.000Z	ugliefrog	nibblerofdoomz	okie doke ill do that..im patient
