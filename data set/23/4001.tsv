2007-12-12T20:15:00.000Z	swisgard		i install virtualbox-ose, the mod vbox is running, and i added myself to the vboxusers group, but it still says i need to add myself to the vboxusers group when i try to "start" the vm.
2007-12-12T20:15:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	logout and login again after adding yourself to the group
2007-12-12T20:15:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	i did
2007-12-12T20:15:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	the id command shows me as 120(vboxusers)
2007-12-12T20:19:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	no idea why it would do that? do i need to boost my permissions inside the group or something?
2007-12-12T20:20:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	it works fine for me. does "groups" list vboxusers?
2007-12-12T20:20:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	is it the virtualbox-ose package that you have installed?
2007-12-12T20:21:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	yes, its virtualbox-ose
2007-12-12T20:21:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	and yes, groups lists vboxusers
2007-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	what does « ls -l /dev/ | grep vbox » say?
2007-12-12T20:23:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	well that is wrong, the group should be vboxusers. however, i doubt just changing the group there will work (well, it'll work but only until the next reboot), since /dev/ files are created dynamically. have you tried rebooting?
2007-12-12T20:23:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	no, just logging in and out
2007-12-12T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	although it's not common advice on Linux, i suggest you try rebooting and see if the permissions are set correctly afterwards
2007-12-12T20:38:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	that worked
2007-12-12T20:38:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	but i have a problem with the install program inside the VM, it won't let me resize the windows and they go past the bottom of the screen
2007-12-12T20:42:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	the install program would be ubuntu's install program? i suppose you need to install the "guest additions", which would include the video driver. not sure if those are available for ubuntu
2007-12-12T20:43:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	how would i go about checking?
2007-12-12T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	start the live cd, and try clicking "install guest addition".
2007-12-12T20:46:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	it'll let me resize mozilla and stuff, just not the install program windows. but i have "start or install ubuntu" and "start ubuntu in safe graphics mode" for options of starting it
2007-12-12T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	both will unfortunately start at best in 1024x768, which is probably not enough to fit the installer... although 1024x768 should...
2007-12-12T20:47:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	how come no one else has all these problems? :P
2007-12-12T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	swisgard	how can you say?
2007-12-12T21:31:00.000Z	swisgard	LjL	are you here?
