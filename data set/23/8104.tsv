2005-02-05T10:52:00.000Z	QT		damn
2005-02-05T10:52:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	did you check the md5sums on the iso?
2005-02-05T10:52:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	ahh
2005-02-05T10:53:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	try the other 9 =)
2005-02-05T10:53:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	ok, next week then, when i have been home again to get another one
2005-02-05T10:54:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	do a google, cause some cd drives can be weird i remember something about booting with nocddma or soethin
2005-02-05T10:54:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	try booting with nofb
2005-02-05T10:54:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	nofb for the flicker thing
2005-02-05T10:55:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	i think the wiki should have info on install cheat codes some where
2005-02-05T10:55:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	could be
2005-02-05T11:00:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	iwlist [iface]  scan
2005-02-05T11:01:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	"Failed to read scan data : Operation not supported" i guess thats not supported in the driver then?
2005-02-05T11:01:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	what card?
2005-02-05T11:01:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	intersil prism2
2005-02-05T11:02:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	dell 1200 or something
2005-02-05T11:02:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	hmm, never dealt with these
2005-02-05T11:03:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	i know some cards need to be UP before scanning. so try "ifconfig <iface> up" and then scan again
2005-02-05T11:03:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	its up and connected at the moment
2005-02-05T11:04:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	sorry, no idea and gotta go now calling it a day :-)
2005-02-05T11:04:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	i just wanted to test the overlaps of some of my access points with something like xps show available networks thing
2005-02-05T11:04:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	QT	tks
2005-02-05T11:04:00.000Z	QT	pybe-lappy	and thanks again for suggestions! will try them!
