2008-10-30T16:30:00.000Z	zamba		how do i create a dvd video in ubuntu?
2008-10-30T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 i use the DeVeDe program for that normally
2008-12-03T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 rpm files are 'cpio' archives.. the file manager 'mc' can also view the contents of them
2008-12-03T17:49:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	ok, thanks :)
2008-12-03T17:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 mc is an easy way to do that. :)  if you jsut want some of the files. it can access the file as if it was a 'directory'  of course mc can do that for other archive formats as well. :)
2008-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	does it rely on rpm to do that?
2008-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 no idea.. since they are just cpio archives.. i woukldent think so
2008-12-03T17:52:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	what command should i use for mc to open it, then?
2008-12-03T17:52:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	pressing <enter> just gives me a raw dump of the file
2008-12-03T17:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 mc is a file manager.. select the file and hit enter works for me
2008-12-03T17:52:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	and that gives me the raw output :)
2008-12-03T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 I dont even have a rpm file to test.   Its worked befor for me.. could be you need some extra tools
2008-12-03T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 extfs  = 'external filesystem' - its how mc accesses archives and other 'virtual' filesystem  i think..
2008-12-03T17:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 could also be the .rpm file is bad.
2009-03-18T03:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 use $(stuff) instead of backticks
2009-03-18T03:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 is the easier to read way
2009-03-18T03:20:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	$(date --date="yesterday" +"%Y-%m-%d")?
2009-03-18T03:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 yes. :)
2009-03-18T03:21:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	thanks :)
2009-03-18T03:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 down with backticks. :) they just are hard to see/and cause other issues on some things.
2009-03-18T03:21:00.000Z	zamba	dr_willis	agreed
2011-07-26T16:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 ogg, webm, dozens of video codecs out there that can stream but they may need a server.. or you just let the people down,oad the video.
2011-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	zamba	 i would think so
