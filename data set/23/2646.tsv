2009-01-09T22:05:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	dance around you computer with you hands in the air, might fix it :P , or you could give a few more clues
2009-01-09T22:06:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	well, it doesn't work. Cheese does not show any images. What information can i give you, like with term commands or such
2009-01-09T22:06:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	os version, computer model , program you tring to use
2009-01-09T22:07:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	and cheese
2009-01-09T22:10:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	read this  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=694487 , might give you some ideas
2009-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	ok
2009-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	no output..
2009-01-09T22:35:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	see if the cam works
2009-01-09T22:35:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	it does not, not with cheese.
2009-01-09T22:35:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	should I add it to the modules and restart?
2009-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	restart should not br required
2009-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	and adding to the modules?
2009-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	does the camera work with other programs?
2009-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	like which?
2009-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	i have just tested with cheese.
2009-01-09T22:37:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	ekiga says "Your video driver doesn't support the requested video format."
2009-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	try install some codex , gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly , and try the test again
2009-01-09T22:42:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	plugins ugly is already installed. now,, there are other versions, that sufix m, or dc to that package.
2009-01-09T22:47:00.000Z	wolter	recon69	so should i add the uvcvideo to the modules thing or not?
2009-01-09T22:47:00.000Z	recon69	wolter	would seem that the camera is loading the driver, but not working with the apps, but my knowledge limited. suggest you ask again for help and try a different program. add uvcvideo to modules after you happy so that it will load next boot
