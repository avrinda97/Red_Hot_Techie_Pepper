2004-10-27T14:28:00.000Z	jdub		here's a post from 2000

2004-10-27T14:29:00.000Z	jdub		hrm, actually that's the first thread
2004-10-27T14:29:00.000Z	jdub		there's another one about insane crack
2004-10-27T14:30:00.000Z	jdub		yeah, @boot is rad for fetchmail
2004-10-27T14:30:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	dircproxy, too
2004-11-01T10:07:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	where's that documented?  I don't see it in interfaces(5)...
2004-11-01T10:07:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	/usr/share/doc/wireless-tools/README.Debian
2004-11-01T10:08:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	wireless-tools adds a little helper to do it
2004-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	(the imporant bits are here: /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/wireless-tools)
2004-11-01T10:11:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	ah, so an entry in interfaces defines IF_$entry, then... good to know
2004-11-01T10:12:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	pretty rad
2004-11-01T10:12:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	bridge-utils does similar trickery
2004-11-01T10:12:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	*really* handy
2004-11-01T10:13:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	nifty-- you can use that to define all kinds of custom behaviours for an interface
2004-11-01T12:30:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	coulda sworn I said that :)
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	(sudo -s)
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	but does that not retain your environment from before you sudo, whereas sudo su - will start a new root login shell, with only root's environment defined?
2004-11-10T12:15:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	a program of your own devising, or something already extant?
2004-11-10T12:16:00.000Z	jdub	Skif	something nu :-)
2004-11-10T12:16:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	why then, I hereby volunteer myself to test it!
2004-11-10T12:23:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	Indeed, it is a wonderful way of completely screwing up any manual changes you've made to your system's configuration!
2004-11-15T11:41:00.000Z	Skif	jdub	for nautilus
