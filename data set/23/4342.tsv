2007-09-12T08:23:00.000Z	Xenown		Need help with the GRUB loader, tried #grub but the channel's dead =x, anyone can help me fix it?
2007-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	Xenown		I recently installed Windows, used this method I found on a guide online to try to reinstall GRUB as Windows wiped it out, but ever since then I've been getting Error 15: File Not Found
2007-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	Xenown		I used Super Grub Disk to load myself onto ubuntu, but how do I fix the GRUB Loader, so that both windows and ubuntu run at the same time
2007-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	Xenown		ok Pelo =o
2007-09-12T08:26:00.000Z	Xenown		When I reboot, it says it loads GRUB, but it doesn't and just displays that error
2007-09-12T08:26:00.000Z	Xenown		Yeah, burnt it this morning
2007-09-12T08:26:00.000Z	Xenown		I don't know if this is odd, but I used the "Boot windows from another partition" option and it booted me into Ubuntu
2007-09-12T08:27:00.000Z	Xenown		I think my menu.lst is heavily messed up or something
2007-09-12T08:28:00.000Z	Xenown		oh
2007-09-12T08:29:00.000Z	Xenown		I do get it, but I can't figure out which option'll do it, I tried using most of the options, ended up with the no changes
2007-09-12T08:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	if you'd put the output of mount , sudo fdisk -l and your current menu.lst on a pastebin
2007-09-12T08:32:00.000Z	Xenown	nickrud	one sec
2007-09-12T08:33:00.000Z	Xenown	nickrud	should I PM you the links?
2007-09-12T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	nah, put them here, someone else might offer a look
2007-09-12T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	hdb3 is your xp?
2007-09-12T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	well, hda1 is hd0,0 not hd1,0
2007-09-12T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	unless your linux is on hdb1
2007-09-12T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	did you run sudo grub-install ?
2007-09-12T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	cuz nothing leaps out at me
2007-09-12T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	yes, that's what I'd do. But, just for grins, do sudo aptitude reinstall grub first
2007-09-12T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	sudo grub-install /dev/hda (hda is your primary boot drive, right?)
2007-09-12T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	I'd reboot to check
2007-09-12T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Xenown	luck :)
