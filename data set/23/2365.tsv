2009-06-18T15:57:00.000Z	susbwoy		lol hey is someone able to show me their grub/menu.lst with the new kernel in it, i chose "keep current version(which was the default) after upgrading the packages
2009-06-18T15:58:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	new kernel?
2009-06-18T16:00:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	well i recently did an apt-get upgrade and it told me i could upgrade the kernel. so i said a dist-upgrade and went through installation using defaults, but i havent got a menu.lst with 2.6.28-13 in it. Still boots 2.6.28-11
2009-06-18T16:00:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	tried running "sudo update-grub" in a terminal?
2009-06-18T16:02:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	thanks for the command, rebooting now :)
2009-06-18T16:07:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	Still no new kernel, but update-grub sees it, and says it updates menu.lst, but it doesnt :\ http://pastebin.com/d5e1f5d63
2009-06-18T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	can you pastebin your menu.lst?
2009-06-18T16:08:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	http://pastebin.com/d27383e62 there is my menu.lst
2009-06-18T16:14:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	hmm.. your menu list only mentions the .11 kernel.. but grub-update found the new .13 kernel.. odd
2009-06-18T16:16:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	I know! very weird. What can i do from here? Is the edit of menu.lst most likely just a rewrite of what's there but different filenames for the kernel?
2009-06-18T16:16:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	If that's the case, it's not an issue. But im worried about that uuid stuff, no idea what it is. If i can just point to the .28-13 kernel, then change the title, thats fine and dandy
2009-06-18T16:17:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	I think it uses uuid
2009-06-18T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	I think it uses uuid's to find the right partitions and such.. not sure if you can just change the filename of the kernel to boot.. perhaps it works.. not sure if it will mess anything else up though
2009-06-18T16:21:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	Is there a way I can tell update-grub to spit out the new "edits" into another file
2009-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	not that I know f
2009-06-18T16:26:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	err i think I found something. my menu.lst says "Should update-grub adjust the value of the default booted system?" "updatedefaultentry=false" is the default
2009-06-18T16:27:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	maybe change that to true?
2009-06-18T16:27:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	that sounds promising.. but it should still create a menu choice for it
2009-06-18T16:27:00.000Z	Slart	susbwoy	but give it a try.. remember to run "sudo update-grub" after you change the menu.lst
2009-06-18T16:28:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	I think i know what happened. When i went through the kernel install, i chose keep current version. That action probably changed updatedefaultentry to false.
2009-06-18T16:28:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	but trying now :)
2009-06-18T16:32:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	ok still not adding the entry. argh...
2009-06-18T16:35:00.000Z	susbwoy	Slart	Problem solved. I ended up deleting menu.lst and let update-grub create a new one for me. That was bloody weird how it couldnt edit it. Thanks for your time
