2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	lackS		Does anyone know something about NTFS automounting
2009-01-26T00:30:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	It should work automatically :)
2009-01-26T00:31:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Yes, it does, but do I have write permissions by default?
2009-01-26T00:31:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	You should, because it's NTFS-3G
2009-01-26T00:32:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Ok, that's quite fine. I'm reinstalling a computer used by a lot of people which don't know much about Linux, so I'll finally give Ubuntu a try on this machine
2009-01-26T00:34:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	I've never heard of ~/.xprofile. What's that file for?
2009-01-26T00:34:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Local profile settings, it's a very basic file in Linux :-)
2009-01-26T00:35:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	But not with an x in the beginning...
2009-01-26T00:35:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	Does .xprofile get read on X startup or something?
2009-01-26T00:35:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	No, with a dot in the beginning. Files beginning with a dot are hidden
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	You have to enable "Show hidden files" somewhere in the menus of Nautilus
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	I know about hidden files
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Ok, sorry
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	If it's not there, just create it
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Usually your system should take care of this file
2009-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	I've seen ~/.profile, .bash_profile, ..bashrc, and several others, but I've never encountered .xprofile. That's why I've asked
2009-01-26T00:37:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	Yes, it's getting read when you're entering your user's X session
2009-01-26T00:37:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	OK, that's valuable to know
2009-01-26T00:37:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	You can take .profile also IIRC
2009-01-26T00:37:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	Thanks
2009-01-26T00:37:00.000Z	lackS	mssever	np :-)
2009-01-26T00:38:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	.bash_profile and .bashrc don't get read on X startup, and I don't use .profile for reasons even I don't understand :)
2009-01-26T00:39:00.000Z	mssever	lackS	seanos_s : .xprofile isn't there be default. But there's no problem creating such a file
