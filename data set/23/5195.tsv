2007-01-21T13:54:00.000Z	ET-Ben		?
2007-01-21T13:54:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	see if snd_intel8x0 is loaded for kernelk with lsmod|grep snd
2007-01-21T13:56:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	can you give that command again?
2007-01-21T13:56:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	lsmod|grep snd see if snd_intel8x0 is loaded
2007-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	I think so
2007-01-21T13:59:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	yes it is
2007-01-21T14:00:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	http://img253.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot7ss.png
2007-01-21T14:00:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	ok if it's there we know that you should have sound at least to start off with
2007-01-21T14:01:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	so where do we go now?
2007-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	to stop it you can ctrl-c
2007-01-21T14:03:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	Any ideas?
2007-01-21T14:04:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	not really well besides cat a file to /dev/dsp
2007-01-21T14:06:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	try cat <file> > /dev/dsp
2007-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	by cating a file you should get a lot of garbage coming out of your speakers if you do have sound
2007-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	I got nothing
2007-01-21T14:08:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	hmm then something might be using your sound like esd or artsd
2007-01-21T14:08:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	guessing there is a way to check that?
2007-01-21T14:09:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	yeah look at top or ps aux and see if esd is running if your on gnome
2007-01-21T14:10:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	I don't think they are
2007-01-21T14:12:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	Any more ideas? Thanks for the help btw
2007-01-21T14:13:00.000Z	kitche	ET-Ben	not really since I went though everything that I can really think of,
2007-01-21T14:14:00.000Z	ET-Ben	kitche	well my sound is turned up, and I think there is no usage by anything else and so its the only bad think on my install!
