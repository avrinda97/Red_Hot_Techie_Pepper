2007-10-03T11:48:00.000Z	Neo1607		i need some help please if anyone is around
2007-10-03T11:49:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	NO, no one is here, well maybe a few hundred of us or so, but go ahead, what is your question?  :)
2007-10-03T11:50:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	You mave have shrunk XP to much...?
2007-10-03T11:51:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	It's a good idea to do defrag before shrinking a MS partition.
2007-10-03T11:51:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	But the problem may be not so serious and easily fixed.  Don't give up just yet.
2007-10-03T11:52:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	Yes, you're right.
2007-10-03T11:53:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	You should post menu.lst on pastebin.org and give us link.  Myabe something amiss there.
2007-10-03T12:03:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	Any particular reason why you installed 6.10 instead of 7.04?
2007-10-03T12:07:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	menu.lst looks ok.  Since you've installed twice with same outcome, I tend to believe there is something wrong with MS Windows... not sure but, at any rate, it doesn't appear to be missconfigured menu.lst
2007-10-03T12:07:00.000Z	Neo1607	usr13	so do you have any suggestions on how i can fix this?
2007-10-03T12:08:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	You might see if you can use a MS DOS boot disk and see if you can boot into the XP OS that way.
2007-10-03T12:10:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	Well, first make a Linux boot disk, and then use the repair console from the XP disc and do fdisk /mbr
2007-10-03T12:10:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	see if that will get your beloved XP to boot. OR... try:
2007-10-03T12:11:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	... another route, some other boot disk options.
2007-10-03T12:12:00.000Z	Neo1607	usr13	what bootdisk did u tell me to get?    xp or linux
2007-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-19428.html
2007-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	no, not for what you want it to do.
2007-10-03T12:16:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	If you have coorrupted the NTFS partition, I think you will have to re-install MS Windows
2007-10-03T12:17:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	Since you have 6.10 instead of 7.04, I would suggest starting all over - period.
2007-10-03T12:18:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	Well, fish around with some boot disks, but It may be a lost cause.
2007-10-03T12:19:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	what streams?
2007-10-03T12:30:00.000Z	usr13	Neo1607	I don't think you should run fsck on ntfs.  But you might use a MS boot disk and run scandisk or something native to MS / NTFS.
