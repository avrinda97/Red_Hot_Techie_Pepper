2007-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	piedoggie	asdf	it's not just Ubuntu, but many things in the Linux world are "less than ideal".  One could say they're just as broken as Windows, just in a different direction.  Not me, but one could.
2007-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	asdf		install
2007-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	asdf		from live

2007-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	asdf		See that page right there says my network card is auto detected and works fine
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	asdf		I've yet to see ANYWHERE on my setup where it even SEES my card let alone detects and installs anything for it
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	piedoggie	asdf	that's probably with the latest release
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	asdf		nope
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	asdf		that was from a 6.06 guide
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	piedoggie		for example, I had a card that was listed as supported for the past three releases and it didn't work until the latest
2007-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	asdf	piedoggie	its worked before
