2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		hm, i have a solitary white pixel on my panel which acts like an applet (as in, it gets moved along when moving around applets), but cant be removed or moved by its own
2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		any ideas?
2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		its there in a standard UNR installation
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	Topy44		hm, i just realized:
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	Topy44		that white pixel is there for everybody it seems, as i can find it on screenshots on the net
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	what white pixel?
2010-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	if you right click there it is so that you can move the clock
2010-01-20T04:17:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	oh its NBrmx, I never liked netbook remix, too buggy for my liking
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	yeah i know what you mean, i suggest going to the usual ubuntu until the next ubuntu release, if it annoys you that much
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	im running an eeepc 1000H right now and the only problem i have is some things go off screen
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	never looked at them, didnt really see a reason since everything would be downloadable anyway, and since my eeepc worked straight out of the box, i didnt have to do anything
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	I'm sure you would be able to get the tabbed window manager with the normal ubuntu installation with a bit of hacking
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	i have a 10" :D
2010-01-20T04:23:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	ah ok
2010-01-20T04:24:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	I have to admit, the idea is good, execution, not so much
2010-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	hehe, maybe its something in the tray not starting properly
2010-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	Topy44	kyle6513	but its present on all screenshots of karmic UNR i can find, so its definately a bug
2010-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	well yeah just ignore it till the next release, unless theres a beta out for lucid nbr
2010-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	oh, whatcha know i was right :P
2010-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	oh, nevermind xD
2010-01-20T04:36:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	xchat-gnome is the same as xchat in the terms of using screen space is it not?
2010-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	Topy44	kyle6513	no, it has the hidden userlist which afaik is not in xchat regular
2010-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	kyle6513	Topy44	ah okay
