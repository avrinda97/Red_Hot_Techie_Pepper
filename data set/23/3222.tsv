2008-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	depends. what's the issue?
2008-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	I have a server, which has ts /var/cache shared to save bandwidth so that same repository should be downloaded for each client, but at a time only one can update/install due to archives/lock file... how to solve that? should I create partial dir on server or on clients?
2008-08-28T11:56:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	so?
2008-08-28T11:57:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	locking only applies to apt and other tools (on the local machine) .. not the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives .. so if you were to share this directory with other hosts on your network, you don't have to worry about locking
2008-08-28T11:57:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	but archives/lock prevents other machines from updates/install if one is doing so..
2008-08-28T11:58:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	how are you intending on sharing this directory?
2008-08-28T11:59:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	nfs share, everyone has mounted it
2008-08-28T12:00:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	there?
2008-08-28T12:01:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	why not setup a repository ?
2008-08-28T12:02:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	for some reason we haven't, haven't asked the senior sysadmin
2008-08-28T12:02:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/repository-howto/repository-howto.en.html
2008-08-28T12:03:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	I know of that, but problem is what to do with the current problem
2008-08-28T12:03:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	plus can you tell me what are those Hit, Get, and Ign when I do apt-get update
2008-08-28T12:04:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	the /var/cache/apt/archives directory was not meant to be shared via nfs .. it was solely meant as a cache for the local machine .. and it has limitations that just don't make it feasible in your setup
2008-08-28T12:05:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	those are probably because the server does not have the file that apt-get/aptitude wants
2008-08-28T12:07:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	it's quite easy setting up a local repository .. it's just two commands and a modification to the client's sources.list
2008-08-28T12:07:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	yup, I am considering it..
2008-09-09T21:09:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	errm, just svn and apache + mod_svn
2008-09-09T21:10:00.000Z	error404notfound	unop	I guess I just need apache other than what's mentioned on the guide :P
2008-09-09T21:11:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	well i suppose if the guide accomplishes it's goal and you are happy with that
2008-09-09T21:14:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	 u+rwx,g+rws
2008-09-09T21:15:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	meaning, the file has setgid set
2009-07-20T17:48:00.000Z	unop	error404notfound	try updating apt before running that command.  sudo aptitude update
