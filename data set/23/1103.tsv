2010-11-05T12:57:00.000Z	dvaske		hi i'm having problems with scp command, when running it in verbose mode I can see it issues the command: command scp -v -r -t -- , but those last to dashes confuses the receiving server, how can I configure those?
2010-11-05T12:57:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	what's with the last two dashes?
2010-11-05T12:59:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	I dont know where they are comming from, support guys just said that it was them that was confusing their server
2010-11-05T13:01:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	do you have them in your command?
2010-11-05T13:01:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	get rid of the -t
2010-11-05T13:03:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	that's odd. You could try it the other way and ssee what hapens
2010-11-05T13:03:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	ex: log in the remote machine and request the file from your machine.
2010-11-05T13:04:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	I'll try, but I'm not sure I can log in on remote machine
2010-11-05T13:05:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	you have to be able to push files to it
2010-11-05T13:06:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	ssh needs to be installed on asolssson@server <<< otherwise you can't copy files that way
2010-11-05T13:07:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	yeah, but I think they have closed the login
2010-11-05T13:08:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	and I'm able to scp the files i need from another internal server in our company, just not from my laptop, and the only difference seems to be those two dashes in the scp command
2010-11-05T13:08:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	So I just tried the channel to see if anybody perhaps had a quick answer ;-)
2010-11-05T13:09:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	but their saying the 2 dashes are there you're not putting them in right?
2010-11-05T13:09:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	and I don't know how'd they block ssh but allow scp
2010-11-05T13:09:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	nvm that can be done. Try sftp maybe for the time being
2010-11-05T13:10:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	right, I'm not putting the two dashes, but they appear in the output when running with -v.
2010-11-05T13:10:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	I don't know that's wierd I would try sftp see if you can get in that way
2010-11-05T13:11:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	I dont know how they've closen ssh access either, but I'll give sftp a try - thanks for your help!
2010-11-05T13:11:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	I can confirm that scp works so it's some sort of problem with their setup not ubuntu or scp
2010-11-05T13:13:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	yea' I can also push the files to some other server, with scp, and from that push them again to the correct location, but pretty cumbersome...
2010-11-05T13:14:00.000Z	histo	dvaske	yeah then I would suspect the problem is the with the config of the server you are having the issue with.
2010-11-05T13:14:00.000Z	dvaske	histo	yea' probably, thanks
