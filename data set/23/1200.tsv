2010-07-11T09:42:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	You were telling me the options for ICS were there as described in documentation.  I don't see them: http://imgur.com/LmuWJ.png
2010-07-11T09:43:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	what about eth1??
2010-07-11T09:44:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	the one you edit to share internet with is eth1
2010-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	Exactly the same pciture.
2010-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	hmm doesnt add up
2010-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	Shall I screenshot that?
2010-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	nah if it's not there I believe you
2010-07-11T09:48:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	So I've set up eth1 manually, entered an ip address, etc, and when I connect that using the network icon in the top right, it boots me off the internet on eth0, but definately put sme on the lan ( ican ping other machines).
2010-07-11T09:49:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	that's because you cant use both at the same time
2010-07-11T09:49:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	why not?
2010-07-11T09:50:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	ok you can, but default is you connect one the other disconnects and vice versa
2010-07-11T09:50:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	okay, so where to go from here?
2010-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	did you try adding it manually?
2010-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	adding what manually?
2010-07-11T09:54:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	I wouldn't know where to begin.
2010-07-11T09:55:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	yes and like this too  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing?action=show&redirect=InternetConnectionSharing
2010-07-11T09:57:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	I'l give it a try, though obviously I was disinspired to trust the sadvice there after it refered to things which wern't there ;->
2010-07-11T09:58:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	the reason I told you I setup a small box to share internet with xbox and it's there, I'm not at that pc at the moment and it was all point and click
2010-07-11T10:07:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	sudo gedit /etc/rc.local
2010-07-11T10:10:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	after following those instructions, shoudl I need to reboot, or anything like that?
2010-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	yes
2010-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	Slimp	MaRk-I	Never mind, it worked!  Thanks for all the help, you and everyone else.
2010-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Slimp	heh even better
