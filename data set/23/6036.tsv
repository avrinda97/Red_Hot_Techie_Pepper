2007-11-26T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi	I've just told you, use the user manager gunne that Sharpie also said or usermod
2007-12-14T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi	no dns entry ?
2007-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	abhi	ikonia	it is in my hosts list. i even tried pinging it using it's IP address. i am able to ping all other boxes except this one (linuxhost) but from the other boxes i am able to ping linuxhost.
2007-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi	firewall, wrong network ?
2007-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	abhi	ikonia	none of those problems. i was able to ssh to linuxhost yesterday from this box. but for some reason i'm not able to do so today
2007-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi	can the other boxes ping it now
2007-12-14T17:03:00.000Z	abhi	ikonia	yes other boxes are able to ping to it

2007-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi	has to be something on your network from current host to linux host, or linuxhost is blocking you
2007-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	abhi	ikonia	no linuxhost isn't blocking me
