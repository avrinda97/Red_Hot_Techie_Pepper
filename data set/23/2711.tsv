2009-02-08T23:30:00.000Z	wcdl		does anyone know how to edit window border in ubuntu
2009-02-08T23:30:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	What do you mean? Do you mean change the theme for application windows?
2009-02-08T23:31:00.000Z	wcdl		does anyone know how to edit window border in metacity
2009-02-08T23:31:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	You can change the theme for the Metacity window manager if that's what you mean
2009-02-08T23:31:00.000Z	wcdl		yeah i know but only the sides
2009-02-08T23:32:00.000Z	wcdl		i wanna change only the sides....example like mac os x
2009-02-08T23:32:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	Do you want to make it look like a Mac then?
2009-02-08T23:32:00.000Z	wcdl		yes
2009-02-08T23:32:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	If so try Mac4Lin
2009-02-08T23:33:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac4lin
2009-02-08T23:33:00.000Z	wcdl		i want to make it look like Mac but only the window
2009-02-08T23:33:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	There's full instructions inside the package
2009-02-08T23:33:00.000Z	wcdl		without the borders
2009-02-08T23:33:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	You can pick out just the parts you want to use
2009-02-08T23:34:00.000Z	wcdl		i'll give it a try
2009-02-08T23:34:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	Only other way to do it would be to find a theme that is already like that or make one
2009-02-08T23:34:00.000Z	wcdl		and about edit an existing one
2009-02-08T23:35:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	Yes you could do that, but it's easier to find an existing one on http://gnome-look.org
2009-02-08T23:36:00.000Z	wcdl	mattbd	the question is, i like the darkroom theme and i want to remove the window border of that theme
2009-02-08T23:36:00.000Z	wcdl		is there anyway to do that?
2009-02-08T23:36:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	You can change Metacity's theme
2009-02-08T23:37:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	Metacity is the window manager, so that controls the outsides of the application such as the minimise and exit widgets and the outside
2009-02-08T23:38:00.000Z	mattbd	wcdl	Or you could use Compiz and install the Emerald theme manager so you could use Emerald themes, which are a lot nicer than Metacity ones
