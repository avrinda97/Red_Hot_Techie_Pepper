2006-11-18T06:31:00.000Z	j2daosh	pip_	ok... heres what you do... its complicated... open the cd-rom... put the windows disk in :P
2006-11-18T06:31:00.000Z	pip_		ok and then?

2006-11-18T06:32:00.000Z	pip_		what does it do?
2006-11-18T06:33:00.000Z	pip_		ok, but i cant make a file system with my windows boot cd since it says i dont have the start files, and that happened after ive installer ubuntu on the hdd
2006-11-18T06:33:00.000Z	j2daosh	pip_	stop.. listen to what we are saying.... you are in LINUX...we deal with LINUX questions. windows can't make formatting any easier... its practically idiot proof.... put the disk in the drive... reboot computer... follow prompts...
