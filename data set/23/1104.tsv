2011-02-26T06:49:00.000Z	kyan		Hello! How can I make the gnome-panel transparent? It's nearly transparent, but not quite. None of the many threads I've found online have helped.
2011-02-26T06:49:00.000Z	kyan		I'll post a screenshot once it uploads.
2011-02-26T06:49:00.000Z	kyan		:-P
2011-02-26T06:50:00.000Z	kyan		I'm using a custom theme
2011-02-26T06:50:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 you can create a transparent image in gimp and use that as the background image
2011-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 you want this completely transparent?
2011-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	kyan		Um, well, sort of. http://bayimg.com/HAEpaaAda
2011-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	kyan		Same problem with the transparent background from gimp. I've already tried that
2011-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 well I would need to know how transparent you want this or which almost transparent colour you want
2011-02-26T06:52:00.000Z	kyan		If you look at the screenshot, the bottom panel is the one I've tried to make transparent.
2011-02-26T06:52:00.000Z	kyan		It's nearly transparent, but there is a horizontal line where the panel goes to the wallpaper.
2011-02-26T06:52:00.000Z	kyan		Very faint, but annoying ;-)
2011-02-26T06:54:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	  try this one    http://dl.dropbox.com/u/132551/trans.tar.gz
2011-02-26T06:54:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 I tried that one and it doesnt seem to have any indication it is there
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	kyan	coz_	same problem.
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 mm
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	kyan		Looks identical to the screenshot
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 then I am not sure where to go from there
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	kyan		(the screenshot I provided)
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	kyan		I have been fighting this problem for quite a while.
2011-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	kyan		:-P
2011-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	kyan		I suppose I will have to abandon the battle :-)
2011-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	coz_	kyan	 I am sure it is possible  I just never worked with it
