2005-12-11T11:37:00.000Z	a|so		am nt able to access any of my hard disks.. i went to system and disks it says inaccessable and i tried to enable but nothing happens
2005-12-11T11:39:00.000Z	a|so		no.. am running live ubuntu for the first time.. and i cant check on any of my hard disks..which are in ntfs format..  well one of the partition has windows on it.. but two other partitions has songs on it
2005-12-11T11:39:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	mount them, System>administration>disks
2005-12-11T11:42:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	you have to define the mount directory first,
2005-12-11T11:43:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	a mount point is simply an ordinary folder,
2005-12-11T11:44:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	I would reccomend in /media
2005-12-11T11:45:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	no, /media is a folder which already exists in your root directory,
2005-12-11T11:45:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	any cdroms that you might mount appear in this folder as well.  usb drives etc,
2005-12-11T11:46:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	give it a name that makes sense, 'windows' maybe.
2005-12-11T11:47:00.000Z	a|so	zoexii	when i went to the media folder and right clicked..it doesnt allow the create new folder option
2005-12-11T11:48:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	open a terminal and type "sudo mkdir /media/windows"
2005-12-11T11:48:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	you need superuser priveledges to create folders in /media
2005-12-11T11:48:00.000Z	a|so	zoexii	am sorry to ask this.. but how do i open a terminal.. and how do i get a superuser priviledge.. am the only user on this machine
2005-12-11T11:49:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	applications>accessories>terminal
2005-12-11T11:52:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	that's the command propt, don't worry about it,
2005-12-11T11:52:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	just type "sudo mkdir /media/windows" after the '$'
2005-12-11T11:56:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	set the acess path in disk manager to /media/windows, then click the button
2005-12-11T12:02:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	you should be able to browse the volume as super-user... I don't know if nautilus can be run as root,
2005-12-11T12:04:00.000Z	a|so	zoexii	how do i become super ?
2005-12-11T12:05:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	try this: applications>systemtools>run as different user   then run 'nautilus' as root,
2005-12-11T12:06:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	you should be able to browse the partition then,
2005-12-11T12:07:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	in any case, this is a pretty half-assed solution, you should read: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions if you want to have the partition mounted automatically
2005-12-11T12:17:00.000Z	zoexii	a|so	follow the above link, it will tell you how to get mp3 support
