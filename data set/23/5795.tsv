2009-10-24T18:36:00.000Z	skx		During installation (I was installing Ubuntu 9.04 from the Alternate CD) Ubuntu offered this nice partitioner that made creating lvms and encrypted containers easy and straightforward, can I access this tool on an installed system to partition additional hard drives? If so, how?
2009-10-24T18:36:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	yep.. but I don't know how..
2009-10-24T18:37:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	let me look.. hang on.
2009-10-24T18:39:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	check this out.. at least it's a starting point http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/142673
2009-10-24T18:39:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	no, no, the lvm is the next step
2009-10-24T18:40:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	I first need to partition the disk and create an encrypted container, actually, you can do all that from command line, but I liked that tool
2009-10-24T18:41:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	in the next release the live desktop will allow creation of lvm and encryption during install..
2009-10-24T18:42:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	found it! it's called partman :)
2009-10-24T18:42:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	that's the program to control lvm?
2009-10-24T18:43:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	no, to make one and I'm not so sure anymore
2009-10-24T18:43:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	you can only do lvm on unpartitions drives from what I understand
2009-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	I already have one lvm on one disk, made during installation with this tool, I want now to create another one
2009-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	ah.. ok..
2009-11-05T08:40:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	try loading it from terminal..
2009-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	surprisingly simple advice (nautilus:12127): Eel-CRITICAL **: eel_preferences_get_boolean: assertion `preferences_is_initialized ()' failed
2009-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	ok.. dont' know what that means.. but.. if you have system monitor on one of your bars then look there or in terminal using "top" and see if nautilus is listed.. if it is kill it.
2009-11-05T08:43:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	ps aux | grep nau returns nothing
2009-11-05T08:43:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	did you upgrade or fresh install?
2009-11-05T08:44:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	it's not an upgrade problem, karmic was working fine for days
2009-11-05T08:45:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	not sure if it's there.. I've never looked.. but there might be .nautilus in /home .. if it's there rename it and try loading again.
2009-11-05T08:45:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	there actually is one nautilus running and it ignores even kill -9
2009-11-05T08:46:00.000Z	scunizi	skx	time to log out it seems.. weird problem.
2009-11-05T08:46:00.000Z	skx	scunizi	ok, it died on it's own, nautilus is back up, thanks for support :)
