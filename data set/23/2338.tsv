2011-05-09T00:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	nmvictor	Please don't give lmgtfy links in here it is rude.
2011-05-09T00:11:00.000Z	nmvictor	IdleOne	are you insinuating that the website creator was rude to come up with that, doesnt it get someone started on a problem, Googling a problem is not common to everyone as you might think, that lmgtfy website reminds people of Google and the wonders it can do, and in my case, my recepient din't think it as rude
2011-05-09T00:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	nmvictor	it is channel policy not to give lmgtfy links because it has been decided by the channel ops that it is rude.
2011-05-09T00:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	nmvictor	feel free to use it if you like but when providing a link give a direct link please.
2011-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	nmvictor	IdleOne	Ok, bos. You win, but open source is bigger than #ubuntu and Ubuntu as a whole, telling someone to refer to another open source project isnt rude, its the true spirit in the open source world, infact not doing that is selfish and such policy might be more usefull in closed source world where Microsoft and all that comes with it reside. So for now, we'll bow to that policy but with our opinions made open.
