2008-02-26T11:09:00.000Z	Lexda		Any chance somebody can help a poor newb?
2008-02-26T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	maybe, ask away
2008-02-26T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	that's not exactly an easy problem to diagnose ;)
2008-02-26T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	put a the complete output of    sudo apt-get -f install   on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-26T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	ah, hit tab, that will let you say ok
2008-02-26T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	after you page thru, I think
2008-02-26T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	that's sun, not ubuntu. It comes from the multiverse (or, restrictive license) section that ubuntu hosts
2008-02-26T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	you chose options->session->xfce on the login screen?
2008-02-26T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	  in a terminal,   apt-cache policy xubuntu-desktop , does it say installed?
2008-02-26T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	then you don't have the xubuntu-desktop installed yet.   sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop , or find it in system->admin->synaptic
2008-02-26T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	do you have synaptic or the update-manager running?
2008-02-26T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	you can only run one package installer at a time
2008-02-26T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	yes
2008-02-26T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	 sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop , if it doesn't work put the output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-26T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	you mean the gui login is the same?
2008-02-26T11:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	that is very odd. A sec
2008-02-26T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	still here ... thinking (in circles at the moment)
2008-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	I'm really stumped why your session doesn't work.
2008-02-26T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	you could switch to a console  (ctl-alt-f2) and log in there.   sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop . then run   startxfce  (I think that's the command)
2008-02-26T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	thanks for the out there, bad sources ;)
2008-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	luck to you, I guess ;)
2008-02-27T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	did you do an update recently?
2008-02-27T09:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Lexda	glad to hear that
