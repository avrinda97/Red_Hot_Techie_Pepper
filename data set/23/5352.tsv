2007-01-19T14:30:00.000Z	humbolto		does edubuntu use the same repos as ubuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu use?
2007-01-19T14:31:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	yes
2007-01-19T14:31:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	so edubuntu is just another virtual package?
2007-01-19T14:32:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	virtual is not exactly the right word - much work was done making it work with thin client and optimized software choices
2007-01-19T14:33:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	virtual package, isn't that the exact dpkg term?
2007-01-19T14:34:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	I didn't think so - edubuntu is a set of packages like ubuntu or kubuntu.  maybe your right but it does not sound right to me.  It is not just a meta-package
2007-01-19T14:37:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	not just but it is available as such and it's installation is managed that way. It is a full distro like kubuntu, ... but it resides in the *buntu package repos.
2007-01-19T14:38:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	ok - you win :)
2007-01-19T14:38:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	was there something to win? what is the reward? :)
2007-01-19T14:40:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	actually, edubuntu (one word) is not a meta package.  edubuntu usually refers to the distribution variant, not a package.
2007-01-19T14:40:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	I am just wondering if it makes any sense to download the edubuntu installer cds if I already have the ubuntu ones.
2007-01-19T14:41:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	so, you win!
2007-01-19T14:42:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	that is a good question.  I doubt it BUT if you are really going to do classroom installs, the cd is probably a good idea, to assure the cleanliness of the excersize
2007-01-19T14:43:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	I am just interested in the ltsp stuff and wondering, if they manage the installation more convenient with their installer cd.
2007-01-19T14:44:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	dunno - i bet they do because of the intended audience.  why don't you try it and then tell me?
2007-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	I might. Will try to find out in #edubuntu first.
2007-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	bon voyage :)
2007-01-19T14:46:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	merci beaucoup.
2007-01-19T14:46:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	de nada
2007-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	I'll tell you what I found out next time I'll see you. "De nada" is not very french however.
2007-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	humbolto	mnoir	"de rien" would fit better
2007-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	do let me know - i am curious but lazy :)  and it wasn't meant to be french :)
2007-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	mnoir	humbolto	tak
