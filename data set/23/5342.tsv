2006-12-21T13:58:00.000Z	reverseblade	kcinna	other than that, try #linux, #kernel, and "wishie" from #alsa (he is sleeping now)
2006-12-21T14:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	kcinna	do you have any data with your installation ?
2006-12-21T14:09:00.000Z	kcinna	reverseblade	im sure theres data somewhere? the os takes up several gbs's
2006-12-21T14:09:00.000Z	reverseblade	kcinna	I mean do you have any personal data that you do not want to lose ?
2006-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	reverseblade	kcinna	can you afford formatting your drive?
2006-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	kcinna	reverseblade	i'd rather not.. i just did to install the OS
2006-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	reverseblade	kcinna	insalling OS is no biggie, if you can afford, I strongly recommend using 6.10 instead of 6.06
