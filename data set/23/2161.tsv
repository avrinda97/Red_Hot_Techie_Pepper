2009-06-12T21:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	not quite
2009-06-12T21:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	 some distros use DEB such as Ubuntu and Debian others use  RPM  such as Fedora and Redhat
2009-06-12T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	,but  most of the actsual software will be the same,  they are just done in different package formats
2009-06-12T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	not quite
2009-06-12T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	some DEB's are made for Debian, and others are made for Ubuntu
2009-06-12T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	exactly, but  for stuff that you compile from source such as tar.gz  well that's for everything
2009-06-12T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	tar.gz is usaully for all distros,  because you compile from source
2009-06-12T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	Linux distros are based on Unix

2009-06-12T22:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	also with a bigger swap say 512MB RAM, it may run even better
2009-06-14T21:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rameshwo	having a swap partition  that is say 512MB may help
2009-06-14T21:52:00.000Z	rameshwo	sebsebseb	ok..
