2006-05-21T13:24:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		you need a boot disk for sure, since win98 isn't bootable, but I made a bootable win98 disk
2006-05-21T13:25:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		so in short windows can't even stand other versions of itself
2006-05-21T13:25:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		the original win98 cds aren't bootable
2006-05-21T13:26:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		in any win98 cd in north america I would say
2006-05-21T13:26:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		zcat, only if fat32 is the main partition
2006-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		fat32 + ntfs dont get along
2006-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		actually, I had a hell of a time installing win98 on anything but the c drive, I think I gave up
2006-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		but try installing win xp with ntfs, then win98 on the 2nd partition, not happening easily
2006-05-21T13:30:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		winxp theme? yuk!
2006-05-21T13:30:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		I recommend you not mess with ntfs writing in linux
2006-05-21T13:31:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	apparently the tricky bit of NTFS is in creating and deleting files, or changing their sizes.  modifying existing files is apparently quite safe.
2006-05-21T13:33:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I mean to make a single large file in NTFS, and use it as a Linux filesystem.  As far as NTFS is concerned it's a single large file.
2006-05-21T13:50:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition	dooglus	here it gives a list of all names starting with wa if you do that
2006-05-21T13:59:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I use irssi inside a 'screen' session on a server in France.  so even when I switch my ubuntu machine off, I'm still on IRC.
2006-05-21T14:00:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I can re-attach to the remote 'screen' session from wherever I am.  It's a lot more convenient than xchat.
2006-05-21T14:02:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	you can register your nick with nickserv anyway, so that's not a big problem.
2006-05-21T14:34:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	it looks like that file has been damaged.  It should read "Description: module for manipulating POSIX.1e ACLs pylibacl is a python interface to the libacl library. It allows manipulation of the POSIX.1e-compliant filesystem ACLs present
2006-05-21T14:36:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I think "sudo dselect update" should fix it, according to the dpkg man page
2006-05-21T14:40:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	what filesystem to do you?
2006-05-21T14:41:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I've never tried ext3.  I use reiserfs and do a hard shutdown every time I try to shutdown
2006-05-21T14:41:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	I don't think it's ever damaged any files, but I can't be sure
2006-05-21T14:41:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	check out the link that ubotu is about to tell you:
2006-05-21T14:46:00.000Z	dooglus	WarOfAttrition	no, I was trying to talk to Pimpshizzled and got his name badly wrong, sorry.
