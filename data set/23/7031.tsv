2005-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	x86i	blank	install linux over the windows, then install windows later. When windows over writes the MBR, use the cd to install GRUB again.
2005-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	blank	x86i	:D, how can I install grub again with the CD
2005-11-16T09:42:00.000Z	x86i	blank	When you boot from the ubuntu cd, type 'expert'
2005-11-16T09:42:00.000Z	x86i	blank	it will give you more options
2005-11-16T09:42:00.000Z	blank	x86i	wouldn't that reinstall ubuntu?
2005-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	x86i	blank	No, you can install grub, then abort the installtion, and reboot. Grub will remain. Just dont install the base system.
2005-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	blank	x86i	is there any other ways to install grub?
2005-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	blank	x86i	any other ways to install grub?
2005-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	x86i	blank	None less complicated. Not unless you know how to make a bootable floppy.
