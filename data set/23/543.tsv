2011-06-22T16:40:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	didnt work.
2011-06-22T16:41:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	rfkill list again
2011-06-22T16:42:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	softblock for acer-wireless: wireless lan is in place.
2011-06-22T16:42:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	does it means all are now "no"?
2011-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	then it is still blocked
2011-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	softblock is yes for the acer-wireless wiressless lan. No for the rest.
2011-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	I tried to tell you that it didn't do anything last time when I entered that terminal code to unblock it.
2011-06-22T16:44:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	what was the terminal command again if you can recall
2011-06-22T16:45:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	no it sould be rfkill unblock wifi
2011-06-22T16:45:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	rfkill unblock wifi
2011-06-22T16:46:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	then after issuing those commands try to check if it is now "no"
2011-06-22T16:46:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	still the same. "Yes" "no" | "no" "no"
2011-06-22T16:47:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	to check "rfkill list" to unblock "rfkill unblock wifi"
2011-06-22T16:48:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	still the same as it was, Yes, no, no no. It just clears the terminal line as if you were to press enter, doesn't do anything.
2011-06-22T16:49:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	ok try this again
2011-06-22T16:50:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	wifi-issues	rfkill unblock all  ----  rfkill unblock wifi --- rfkill list and post the result.. be sure the wifi button was enabled

2011-06-22T17:12:00.000Z	wifi-issues	scriptwarlock	fixed it by black listing acer-wmi to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf with: sudo su            echo "blacklist acer-wmi" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf                       exit
