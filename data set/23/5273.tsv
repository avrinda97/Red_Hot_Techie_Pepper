2007-01-08T10:24:00.000Z	elyon225		Could someone help me get direct rending working?  I ran the reconfigure of the xserver, but that didn't work.

2007-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	Edgy?
2007-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	Yes.
2007-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	composit disabled ?
2007-01-08T10:27:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	You know, I remember doing that the first time, but didn't see that in the instructions I followed this time.
2007-01-08T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	It should have been if the instructions were for Edgy, what instructions did you follow?
2007-01-08T10:28:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/graphics-cards.html
2007-01-08T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	That guide is out of date, for future reference wiki.ubuntu.com always has good guides, you need to add these lines to the end of your xorg.conf:
2007-01-08T10:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	Oh wait, that is help.ubuntu.com, strange ?
2007-01-08T10:30:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	Yeah... those instructions were from the wiki ;)
2007-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	This just requires a restart of X, right?
2007-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	Yup
2007-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	Okay... I'll be back if this doesn't do it.  Thanks :)
2007-01-08T10:41:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	That worked beautifullly.  Thanks, bud.
2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	when / how does it crash?
2007-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	Every time I log out of a user.  White screen, mouse locked... keyboard locked.
2007-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	I need to restart every time.
2007-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	Can you get to a tty?
2007-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	elyon225	Jordan_U	What is TTY?
2007-01-10T09:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	It is a terminal you can use when X crashes
2007-01-10T09:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	ctrl+alt+F1 to get to it, ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to X
2007-01-10T09:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elyon225	Yes, it is very possible that it is only X that has crashed
