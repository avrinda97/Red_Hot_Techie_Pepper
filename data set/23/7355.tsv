2005-08-27T11:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	durt	see the bottom of the page ubotu just showed ^^^
2005-08-27T13:10:00.000Z	durt	Madpilot	you said earlier that j2re was in the ubuntu repositories - you mean the blackdown one right?
2005-08-27T13:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	durt	no, the real thing from Sun, it's in hoary-extras
2005-08-27T13:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	durt	see the bottom of that AddingRepositories page with ubotu ^^^

2005-09-02T12:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	durt	I might do the Windows thing and try to reboot - this started after the last time I rebooted, three or four days ago...
2005-09-02T13:34:00.000Z	durt	Madpilot	you fix opera yet?
2005-09-02T13:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	durt	it's still being odd. I'll reboot later and see what happens
