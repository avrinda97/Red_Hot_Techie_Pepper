2010-09-06T07:39:00.000Z	mobasher	DasEi	no sir...need to reinstall gdm i removed the package and now i don't have a connection to the internet..i have a live CD
2010-09-06T07:40:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	just because of gdm missing, won't drop your network, how do you connect (the internal), by dhcp via a router ?
2010-09-06T07:40:00.000Z	mobasher	DasEi	>> i'm using the ndiswrapper the card is not supported now no more interent

2010-09-06T07:41:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	ic, so we got to chroot in, but I'm no good at wireless, ok, your part then , so..
2010-09-06T07:42:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	one hardrive only ?
2010-09-06T07:42:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	pastebinit sudo fdisk -l
2010-09-06T07:43:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	please nick me, so message gets highlighted, we need correct partitions to mount on live
2010-09-06T07:44:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	you're currently not speaking fromm the live-cd ?
2010-09-06T07:46:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	and the broken on is another machine ?
2010-09-06T07:47:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	I don't understand still.. you are on another hd (ubuntu) with the gdm-missing drive on the same laptop ?
2010-09-06T07:49:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	ah ok, so need to chroot in from live cd then, so your main problem is getting internet working now
2010-09-06T07:50:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	no way for wired network ?
2010-09-06T07:52:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	as said, I'm no good at wireless, which chip is it ? or maybe a wire from lappi to desktop (patchcable is needed, unless gigabitnics or switch handy) ?
2010-09-06T07:53:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	can't help there really, basics :

2010-09-06T07:56:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	might be easier to boot desk by live cd, chroot in and try network conectivity, then install
2010-09-06T07:58:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	so ask again with exact chipset/model of the wireless nic (hwinfo will show) and for someone enabling it from cmd-line
2010-09-06T08:31:00.000Z	DasEi	mobasher	about 4 years, different shapes though, but's that's ot
