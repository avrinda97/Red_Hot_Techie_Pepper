2005-03-12T16:23:00.000Z	Marble2		yes, but I don't feel like reinstalling
2005-03-12T16:23:00.000Z	Marble2		yes it is hawke_
2005-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	hawke_	Marble2	You should be fine then, really
2005-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	Marble2		grub doesn't work for me btw
2005-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	Marble2		I just run LILO

2005-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	hawke_		oh, but not to linux?
2005-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	hawke_	Marble2	Does your system boot into Linux?
