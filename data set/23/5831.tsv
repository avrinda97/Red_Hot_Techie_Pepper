2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		Hi Ubuntu peopls!
2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		err peoples rofl
2006-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	Sembiance		I'm a developer, and I've been using Linux for years, but always as a server. I'm ready now to change my workstation to a Linux machine now and will be doing things like writing code, listening to music, watching videos, etc. I've tried Gentoo in the past but I hate how long it takes to compile things and how you have to work so hard to get your hardware to work.
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		So I'm looking at ubuntu to ease the 'make my hardware work' pain
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	try using the live cd see if it fits your needs
2006-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	yes you can always install from source
2006-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	like I say you can always try the live cd and see if you don't like it just try another live cd.
2006-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	however to be able to install from source you would need gcc etc...  I would recomend installing the build-essential package
2006-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	well you can install them one by one etc.. build-essential is a meta package that installs some common compilers
2006-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	no you can completely control holding packages back etc... for the updates
2006-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	well there are extra repositories are always an option.
2006-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	like I say your best bet would be just to boot to the livecd and check it out.
2006-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	Sembiance	chuckyp	Ok cool, I have ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso downloaded. Is that what I need to burn and try out?
2006-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	absolutely not
2006-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	yeah just burn it and make sure your computer is set to boot to cd... and you will be able to select live cd from the menu.
2006-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	well the nvidia part is a little tricky since their drivers aren't open source
2006-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	but the nvidia drivers are easy to install or you can install the nvidia-glx package to add the free ones
2006-09-19T07:08:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	or you can download the binary from the nvidia sight.  but the wiki addresses all of this
2006-09-19T07:09:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	np
2006-09-19T07:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	there are always people around here helping out
2006-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	well gnome has received a lot of speed improvements as of late.  KDE is still nice as well. I'd install both if I didn't want my menus all borked up.
2006-09-19T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	yes most kde apps run in gnome.
2006-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	Sembiance	your best bet if you like the live cd and you want to install.  After installing just follow along the wiki for most of your needs.  If you can't find it there check back here.
