2005-04-13T12:54:00.000Z	karafulix	kain	: do i need a reboot after reconfiguring the new locales?
2005-04-13T12:54:00.000Z	kain	karafulix	not mandatory but preferred

2005-04-13T12:55:00.000Z	karafulix	kain	let me try a reboot
2005-04-13T12:55:00.000Z	kain	karafulix	try opening up synaptic and search for locale
2005-04-13T12:55:00.000Z	karafulix	kain	it is there, i installed and reinstalled it
2005-04-13T12:56:00.000Z	kain	karafulix	dpkg-reconfigure locales rebuild locales on your system, do you haven't seen it listed during reconfigure?
2005-04-13T12:57:00.000Z	karafulix	kain	it is listed during the reconfigure. is "rebuild locales" another command?
2005-04-13T12:57:00.000Z	kain	karafulix	no
2005-04-13T12:58:00.000Z	kain	karafulix	that's the way, but it didn't solve your problem.. sorry if I cannot help more on this
2005-04-13T12:58:00.000Z	karafulix	kain	lets try a reboot. otherwise it is back to zero with this machine.
