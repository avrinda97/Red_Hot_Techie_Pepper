2008-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	raggi		really just need the ssh to pass through for a git commit then i'd be happy to dump the machine
2008-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	raggi		but at this rate it looks like i'm going to have to write a tunneler to do that :-S
2008-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	raggi		i'd kinda like to know what's wrong
2008-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	raggi		it's got to be in the socket api layer somewhere
2008-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	raggi		nope
2008-07-29T20:43:00.000Z	raggi		which is even more odd
2008-07-29T20:43:00.000Z	raggi		and ICMP is fine too
2008-07-29T20:43:00.000Z	raggi		just TCP to most apps, well, thus far everything but ruby and firefox :-S
2008-07-29T20:43:00.000Z	raggi		no, ICMP works
2008-07-29T20:44:00.000Z	raggi		and there's nothing abnormal here
2008-07-29T20:44:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	cable or adsl?
2008-07-29T20:44:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	wrong layer?
2008-07-29T20:44:00.000Z	raggi	eth01	that *cannot* be the issue
2008-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	HAVE you tried pinging the IP address of your modem?
2008-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	you cannot debug any adsl modems afaik
2008-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	raggi	eth01	i'm debugging my issue
2008-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	solving your issue.
2008-07-29T20:46:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	i don't understand the problem tbh. i've not read your original prob.
2008-07-29T20:46:00.000Z	raggi	eth01	firefox can talk to sites, as can ruby
2008-07-29T20:47:00.000Z	raggi	eth01	any ideas?
2008-07-29T20:48:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	let me read.
2008-07-29T20:48:00.000Z	eth01	raggi	create another interface?
2008-07-29T20:49:00.000Z	raggi	eth01	can do, what's your expectation?
