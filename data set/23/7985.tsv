2006-03-14T08:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	nm not important
2006-03-14T08:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	'other chan'
2006-03-14T08:53:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	ok...
2006-03-14T08:55:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	can you solve my questions ?
2006-03-14T08:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	it's to read mail with. man mail. it does what mutt does afaict, but not in as 'pretty' a fashion... which isn't saying much, mutt is functional not pretty.
2006-03-14T08:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer		man mail
2006-03-14T09:00:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	looks mail is not available on man pages
2006-03-14T09:01:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	then the program named mail is not installed i suppose
2006-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	just type mutt?
2006-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	mail is not available in apt-get
2006-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	javiolo		but mutt its on apt-get
2006-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	ok so what's the deal then
2006-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	afaict it's some ugly non-user friendly mail client
2006-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	jetscreamer		!info mail
2006-03-14T09:04:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	I want one to send me for example when an update of certain app is available
2006-03-14T09:04:00.000Z	javiolo		I think mutt could do that
2006-03-14T09:05:00.000Z	jetscreamer	javiolo	i think you want anacron and cron-apt... i get mail from anacron, and read it in mutt... the client is not the sender btw
2006-03-14T09:06:00.000Z	javiolo		oh
2006-03-14T09:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		try again
2006-03-14T09:08:00.000Z	javiolo	jetscreamer	thanks
