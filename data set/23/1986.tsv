2011-01-05T09:37:00.000Z	schambers		how can i re-run 10.10 server setup to get back into network setup. iwconfig isn't installed and i need it to connect to a wireless network
2011-01-05T09:39:00.000Z	schambers		hmm
2011-01-05T09:41:00.000Z	schambers		hmm
2011-01-05T09:41:00.000Z	schambers		how can i auto-detect wireless config?
2011-01-05T09:41:00.000Z	schambers		all i see is loopback in /etc/network/interfaces
2011-01-05T09:42:00.000Z	schambers		it seems as if it is in the server setup under manual package selection according to this forum post
2011-01-05T09:42:00.000Z	schambers		but how can i get back into the package selection after i have already installed ubuntu server
2011-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	schambers		iwconfig isnt installed on ubuntu server by default
2011-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	schambers		it looks like i need to select it
2011-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	schambers		how can i get back into the server setup?
2011-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	trench	schambers	you don't need to go into the server setup to install something
2011-01-05T09:46:00.000Z	schambers		off the cd?
2011-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	trench	schambers	just do sudo apt-get install packageyouwanttoinstall
2011-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	schambers	trench	will that install it locally?
2011-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	schambers		or go out to the net to install it?
2011-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	trench	schambers	yes
2011-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	trench	schambers	it depends on your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2011-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	schambers		yeah, right now i cant get to the net to install it
2011-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	schambers		how can i tell aptitude to search the cd
2011-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	schambers		i have the cd in the drive
2011-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	trench	schambers	find / -name wireless-tools
2011-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	trench		then it will find the package you need
2011-01-05T09:52:00.000Z	trench	schambers	then go to the folder and do sudo dpkg -i wireless-tools
