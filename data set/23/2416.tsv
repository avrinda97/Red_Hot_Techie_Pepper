2009-10-07T20:24:00.000Z	tehbaut		can anyone recommend a good clipboard manager?
2009-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 I'd like to know that, too. I am coming from OS X and all clipboard-managers I found so far for Ubuntu are pretty ... compared to those availabel for Mac
2009-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	I forget what I used on OSX but on XP I used 'ditto' which was okay
2009-10-07T20:27:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 I wouldn't use XP, even if it had the best clipboard manager on earth :)
2009-10-07T20:27:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	some people wont
2009-10-07T20:28:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 I think quite the contrary :)
2009-10-07T20:28:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	FTFF and it would probably be a different story
2009-10-07T20:29:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 That's true, the Finder is kind of crappy. But all in all I was quite pleased with OS X.
2009-10-07T20:30:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	yeah and since it's so ingrained in the os, it's not like I could use something like pathfinder ...effectively
2009-10-07T20:30:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 true
2009-10-07T20:33:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	heh. I think Apple has kind of forgetten meanwhile that form should follow function.
2009-10-07T20:34:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	well it does certainly have some great things about it.... spotlight is high on that list for me
2009-10-07T20:36:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 Sure, that's what I meant. There are some really great things in OS X. Lots of little tricks that make working with it very nice. Though it certainly isn't perfect.
2009-10-07T20:37:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	I do wish it were as customizable as win/lin ...but again, mostly with the finder
2009-10-07T20:37:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 That's the main point why I considered switching to Ubuntu. I got more and more annoyed by the impossibility to extend so many things. Lack of official plugin-APIs and such.
2009-10-07T20:38:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	right on
2009-10-07T20:40:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 That's the problem. As power user you want to have more control over configuration, wich Apple simply doesn't allow.
2009-10-07T20:41:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 It's Apples' philosophy. Do it our way or don't do it, so to say
2009-10-07T20:44:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 heh, that's another thing I don't get about OS X. It seems to eat a huge amount of ressources.
2009-10-07T20:45:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 Heh, I wouldn't count on it. I already re-installed Ubuntu once because of unsolveable problems.
2009-10-07T20:45:00.000Z	tehbaut	Mrokii	what's that?
2009-10-07T20:47:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 I used a lot of repositories to update to beta- and what-not-versions and Ubuntu became very unstable, so to say. So now I only used repos that give stable-versions and all went fine until one or two days ago.
2009-10-07T20:50:00.000Z	Mrokii	tehbaut	 The recent crashes are why I joined this room. But I hope to be able to solve them by reverting back to an earlier version (now that I know how to do that via Synaptic).
