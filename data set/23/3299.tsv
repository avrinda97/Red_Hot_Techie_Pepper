2008-08-21T01:40:00.000Z	onthefence928		i have a Two part question: 1)how do i get my Places menu to show the "File system" option again? 2)how do i get nautilus to give me an option to manipulate a file as root? like the sudo command, but without having to know the terminal commands for everything i want to do
2008-08-21T01:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	you can do alt-F2 and run  ' gksudo nautilus'
2008-08-21T01:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	did you see my answer?
2008-08-21T01:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	you can make a launcher with that command if you wish - butbe very careful - running the file manager as root is a great way to wreck your system :)
2008-08-21T01:43:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	yes i like it, i think i'll use it
2008-08-21T01:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	just heed the warning :)
2008-08-21T01:45:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	i plan to be careful, it's just annoying how some things block me out when all i want to do is make a copy of the file
2008-08-21T01:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	don't use nautilus as root on any files in your home directory - they will suddenly belong to root and be inaccessible to your user
2008-08-21T01:46:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	in case i do, how do i make them usable by me again?
2008-08-21T01:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	 change the ownership back to your user
2008-08-21T01:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	for instance make them owned by user:user (group as well)
2008-08-21T01:47:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	is it gonna change the WHOLE home directory? or just whetever files i mess with?
2008-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	the ones you mess with
2008-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	but *don't* use it in your home directory
2008-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	or /tmp for example
2008-08-21T01:49:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	i should need to but i'll keep it in mind, thanks for teh warning
2008-08-21T01:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	in general it's better not to use a graphical file manager as root. Learning some commands is better really
2008-08-21T01:49:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	just wondeirng: does gksudo allow me to run ANY GUI as root?
2008-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	yes it should
2008-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	but don't :)
2008-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	oh that's powerful
2008-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	onthefence928	running apps as root is a *bad* idea
2008-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	onthefence928	thoreauputic_	yeah i'm just using it for future reference
