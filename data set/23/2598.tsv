2009-02-10T10:29:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- I've seen the name bind9 a few times. Is there any way to get this working using dnsmasq?
2009-02-10T10:29:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- I'd rather not install new stuff if it's not needed.
2009-02-10T10:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	not sure, I do know that bind are the primary dns servers accross the internet
2009-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	what platform is your machine you want to have a nameserver?
2009-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	Xubuntu 8.10. It's using dnsmasq now -- I think that's what's issuing DHCP addresses under the hood.
2009-02-10T10:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	from what I just read, dns will serve and resolve names from your local hosts list
2009-02-10T10:32:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- It almost does what I want now... if I add lines to the /etc/hosts file, it will tell LAN clients the IP address in there. I just want this to work on a dynamic basis instead of static.
2009-02-10T10:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	dnsmasq I mean
2009-02-10T10:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	dynamic will usually mean a lot of network chatter....
2009-02-10T10:34:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- There aren't that many local LAN clients, so I don't think the chatter matters. dnsmasq is told not to forward anything for the local domain to the real nameservers.
2009-02-10T10:36:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	you should be able to configure it to forward to real nameserver only if your ns doesn't contain an entry
2009-02-10T10:36:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- Yes, I think it's doing that now. The clients aren't having any trouble reaching the outside world... just each other.
2009-02-10T10:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	so, it be a small network, why not just map it all out in the servers /etc/hosts?
2009-02-10T10:38:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- I build a lot of machines (get them on Freecycle, install Linux, and send them back out). I don't want to have to update the /etc/hosts every time I set up a new one.
2009-02-10T10:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	you could use a WINS server but its a old chatty protocol
2009-02-10T10:39:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	-- I may end up having to do set up static assignments for IP addresses by hostname and then put them all in /etc/hosts, though.
2009-02-10T10:41:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	mindrape -- Maybe I'll just have to learn about bind9.
2009-02-10T10:41:00.000Z	FactTech	Titan8990	mindrape -- Thanks for the help, though.
2009-02-10T10:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	DNS is not really dynamic....
2009-02-10T10:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	FactTech	I don't think dns is going to be what you are looking for at all
