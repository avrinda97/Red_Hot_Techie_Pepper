2008-02-08T11:25:00.000Z	Isaac_		Yes, my BIOS can boot from USB.
2008-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	Isaac_		But when I try to install Ubuntu to the flash drive, the installer doesn't recognize the flash drive as a hard drive.  Are there any flash drives that will be recognized as a normal hard drive by Ubuntu during a normal install?
2008-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	Isaac_		Can it be used as a hard drive though?
2008-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	Isaac_		As in, are there any flash drives that mimic hard drives?
2008-02-08T11:28:00.000Z	Isaac_		Yes
2008-02-08T11:28:00.000Z	Isaac_		Several times
2008-02-08T11:28:00.000Z	Isaac_		Never worked for me.  I've tried it before.
2008-02-08T11:30:00.000Z	Isaac_		Oh well.  Thanks y'all.  Guess I'll just have to put up with this big external hard drive for an external Ubuntu install...........
2008-02-08T11:31:00.000Z	Isaac_		Sure wish they'd make a hard drive as small as a pen drive though.  Seems they could if they wanted to these days.
2008-02-08T11:31:00.000Z	Isaac_		All I'd need is four gigs or so
2008-02-08T11:31:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	everyone here gave you options
2008-02-08T11:13:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	that seems unlikely
2008-02-08T11:13:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	you should look at the output of the 'dmesg' command to see if it says anything about your flash drive
2008-02-08T11:14:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	wait... you're trying to install Ubuntu onto a USB flash drive?
2008-02-08T11:14:00.000Z	Isaac_	nemilar	yes
2008-02-08T11:15:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	ahh okay that is a different story ... I thought you just couldn't get your flash drive recognized inside Ubuntu
2008-02-08T11:16:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-on-usb-bar have you seen this?
2008-02-08T11:20:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	if memory serves, old flash drives don't have mbrs, or for some reason don't serve as bootable
2008-02-08T11:22:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	that's for flash, the plugin from adobe
2008-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	a flash drive is not a hard drive
2008-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	they are both storage devices.  That is all they have in common
2008-02-08T11:31:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	google it, dude
2008-02-08T11:31:00.000Z	nemilar	Isaac_	stop whining and GOOGLE it
