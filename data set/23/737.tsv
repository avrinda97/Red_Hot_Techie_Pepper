2011-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	trey		seriously... pick up Linux for Dummies, it will answer your questions better, and more passive than we could
2011-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	PsyForce		quick(?) question: how secure would an ubuntu machine be if stolen?
2011-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	PsyForce		I'm guessing pretty secure, but just curious as my laptop was just stolen
2011-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	PsyForce		no
2011-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	trey		Sorry to say, not very psyforce, if someone had half a brain
2011-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	PsyForce		yeah, especially since I'm in China...I think just finding that it doesn't have windows on it will be daunting
2011-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	trey		This is true, generally laptop thieves aren't the brightest.
2011-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	PsyForce		though maybe I should encrypt my home directory on the new machine...?
2011-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	trey		lol, yes psyforce
2011-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	PsyForce		no, just standard install
2011-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	PsyForce		does encryption have any effect on performance?
2011-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	PsyForce		hmm, so what are options if I've already done a standard install on the new machine?
2011-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	PsyForce		can I still encrypt? would that help?
2011-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	trey		Psyforce, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome
2011-03-28T07:28:00.000Z	PsyForce	trey	btw, just noticed empathy does have notifications if my name is typed cap-sensitively
