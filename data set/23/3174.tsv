2010-09-13T19:19:00.000Z	B|ackPanther		Hi, i changed the permission of /etc/* to 777 and now i when i try to install anything i get a segmentation fault. How can i restore the permission to the default ?
2010-09-13T19:20:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	why would you do that?
2010-09-13T19:21:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	for future reference, brute chmod'ing like that is never a good idea, and never warranted heh
2010-09-13T19:22:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	but i believe those files should be editable by root only, so a 711 (maybe 771) should be correct
2010-09-13T19:22:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	with root as owner
2010-09-13T19:23:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	no you should be able to restore the defaults
2010-09-13T19:23:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	:I cannot login as root either, i get a segmentation fault. I tried sudo -s and it failed.
2010-09-13T19:24:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	login as a user, then su
2010-09-13T19:27:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	did you try su?
2010-09-13T19:27:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	permissions for /etc should be 754
2010-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	yes, authentication failure when i use my password.
2010-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	youre using the root password for su, not the admin password, right?
2010-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	i mean not your user acct pw
2010-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	i never set the password for su.
2010-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	yea it's the user acct pw then...
2010-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	at least it should work
2010-09-13T19:33:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	this is weird, i change root password through system-Admin-user and groups. Close the window but when i open it again the password is blank.
2010-09-13T19:34:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	your password file is located in /etc
2010-09-13T19:37:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	which file, passwd just contains paths.
2010-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	um you wont be able to edit it manually, passwords are encrpyted
2010-09-13T19:39:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	ViN86	am going for a re install. Thanks anyway.
2010-09-13T19:40:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	sorry, idk what to do if you cant even login as root :(
2010-09-13T19:40:00.000Z	ViN86	B|ackPanther	only other idea is to use live disc and chmod that way
