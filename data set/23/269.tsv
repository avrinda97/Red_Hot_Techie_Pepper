2012-05-08T07:32:00.000Z	iananananan		okay, gnomeshell is installed,but attempting to run gives me an error message, unable to open X display
2012-05-08T07:32:00.000Z	iananananan		whilst installing it told me to edit some config files, does anyone know these?
2012-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	how are you trying to run gnome-shell?  "unable to open X display" is suspicious
2012-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	sudo gnome-shell from a forced cli
2012-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	oh my
2012-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	way off, aren't i?
2012-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	unity will work this way but unity doesn't work.
2012-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	1) don't use sudo when you don't need to 2) don't use sudo for GUI apps 3) use a DM to select gnome-shell
2012-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	lightdm, gdm, kdm, etc
2012-05-08T07:36:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	desktop manager
2012-05-08T07:36:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	so what do i need to enter in the cli?
2012-05-08T07:37:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	"startx" you could try
2012-05-08T07:37:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	literally startx?
2012-05-08T07:37:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	yes, "startx" as a command
2012-05-08T07:43:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	startx prints more errors
2012-05-08T07:43:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	do you already have an Xorg session running?
2012-05-08T07:44:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	probably
2012-05-08T07:44:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	then "startx" won't work until you stop it
2012-05-08T07:44:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	i'm getting into the CLI via booting into ubuntu, then cntrl+alt+f6
2012-05-08T07:45:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	my spideysense is tingling telling me that's causing issues
2012-05-08T07:45:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	ya, "sudo service lightdm" should stop it probably
2012-05-08T07:45:00.000Z	zykotic10	iananananan	ya, "sudo service lightdm stop" sorry
2012-05-08T07:46:00.000Z	iananananan	zykotic10	i have funky graphics card setup
