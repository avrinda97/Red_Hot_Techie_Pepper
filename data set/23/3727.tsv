2008-02-07T02:19:00.000Z	goppp_		 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics  and VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV280 [Radeon 9200 PRO]  are my cards neverblue .
2008-02-07T02:22:00.000Z	goppp_	neverblue	 I tryed the gui, screen and graphic to get dual monitor in 7.10 but it only allowed one card at a time
2008-02-07T02:26:00.000Z	neverblue	goppp_	not sure what that means, but you certainly wont edit your xorg.conf manually and get it working correctly all in one night
2008-02-07T02:26:00.000Z	goppp_	neverblue	 is there a ubuntu gui tool to do this
2008-02-07T02:27:00.000Z	goppp_	neverblue	 going to reboot X
2008-02-07T02:27:00.000Z	neverblue	goppp_	there are many tools to edit xorg.conf, for ATI, i have no idea what they might be
