2005-09-14T09:41:00.000Z	linuxsbartley		Hi.  Trying to configure eth1 on a first time ubuntu-server install.  Can anyone help?
2005-09-14T09:42:00.000Z	linuxsbartley		ifconfig only shows eth0.  unsure how to configure ubuntu network devices.
2005-09-14T09:42:00.000Z	linuxsbartley		Is there a tool or howto?
2005-09-14T09:42:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	sudo network-admin (usually do the trick)
2005-09-14T09:43:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	cool. thx.
2005-09-14T09:43:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	what package installs network-admin?
2005-09-14T09:45:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	i think it is a part of gnome....
2005-09-14T09:48:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	if you made a server-install for ubuntu then you will not have network-admin. but as a standard install it will be there.
2005-09-14T09:48:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	thus the question on what package would provide it. :)
2005-09-14T09:50:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	i will have to go in just a minute so unfortunatley i do not have the time to check... :-/
2005-09-14T09:51:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	k.np.
2005-09-17T12:24:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	xdm is not in /usr/lib. it work anyway
2005-09-17T12:25:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	so "no" it should not exist.
2005-09-17T12:26:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	my problem, is that it is not working.  I get what looks like 3 errors.  The first is the missing libXdmGreet.so. Followed by xdm error: Server for display echo terminated unexpectedly: 1  and then followed by xdm error: Unknown session exit code2304 from process 5357
2005-09-17T12:29:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	i just tried xdm today and it works fine. try to re-install it. and in /etc/rc2.d/ create a symlink for xdm as S20xdm
2005-09-17T12:30:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	you can also try S99xdm if it hangs.
2005-09-17T12:31:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	k.  Have done all that.  no go.  thx. though.
2005-09-17T12:32:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	strange. since i'm using ubuntu 5.10 as you do. tested with both 386 and 686 versions
2005-09-17T12:37:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	I am assuming that you did a full install?  I did a server and added the same packages that made 5.04 work w/ xdm but it doesnt work on 5.10.
2005-09-17T12:38:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	yes
2005-09-17T12:38:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	well, that tells me I am missing something but no idea what yet.  Guess I will reload 5.04 and get it working again and output a package list to compare.
2005-09-17T12:39:00.000Z	linuxsbartley	Jowi	thx for the help.
2005-09-17T12:39:00.000Z	Jowi	linuxsbartley	np
