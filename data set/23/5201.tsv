2007-01-20T09:54:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		so many things you have to configure,everytime you want to do something
2007-01-20T09:55:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		sometimes makes me think its not worth it

2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		i mean, they should have it more configured

2007-01-20T09:58:00.000Z	BlueEagle	blueprints88888_	Well, seing as linux is a very powerful and versatile system it is only natural that there are many configuration settings. Especially when setting up servers there is no good "default" settings as there are so many other things to concidere. In my opinion it's only good that things are unconfigured as it forces people to understand the software that they are running and thus doesn't let you do very stupid things witho
2007-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	blueprints88888_	BlueEagle	that is true, but i think there should be tutorials for every error and so,or how to configure certain things
2007-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		i like Linux dont get me wrong
2007-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		its my main OS now
2007-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	BlueEagle	blueprints88888_	Well aren't there?
2007-01-20T09:59:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		there is some
2007-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		but you have to SEARCH for it,and sometimes it can take days,or weeks to fix
2007-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		my internet connection for example
2007-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle	blueprints88888_	I find that in almost all cases googling an error message given by any linux program gives multiple hits.
2007-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	blueprints88888_	BlueEagle	yes true. but finding YOUR exact error sometimes take some time
2007-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	blueprints88888_		ya
2007-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	blueprints88888_	So the problem is not actually a lack of documentation but too much of it?
2007-01-20T10:02:00.000Z	blueprints88888_	BlueEagle	in a way ya
