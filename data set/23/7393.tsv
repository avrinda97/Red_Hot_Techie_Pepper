2007-04-18T08:47:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	I used Scribus for publishing.... its really quite neat
2007-04-18T08:47:00.000Z	lwizardl	Toma-	basically a flyer maker
2007-04-18T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	just how serious do you want to get with these flyers?
2007-04-18T08:51:00.000Z	lwizardl	Toma-	well I'm working on opening a game shop and want to have nice looking flyers I figure I can use gimp for the graphics and I could insert the text that way using fonts etc but I also want to make it easy for anyone working their also
2007-04-18T08:53:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	well openoffice can export of PDF, and you can input graphics into that. If you want aswell, you can use inkscape, as thats a full featured SVG edited, and SVG is beautiful for printing. not too fancy on text tho.
2007-04-18T08:53:00.000Z	lwizardl	Toma-	I'm make a note of those apps thanks :)
2007-04-18T08:54:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	no probs :)
2007-04-18T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	I think scribus would be your best bet. its got a bit of a learning curve, but really, what doesnt? :)
2007-04-18T08:55:00.000Z	lwizardl	Toma-	and I thought that was the beauty of linux learning to do everything you want to do and then some.
2007-04-18T08:56:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	exactly :) take your time and just read the tutorials and youll be a Scribus champion in no time. Theres also Scribus-NG if im not mistaken

2007-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	Toma-	lwizardl	i mean, /etc/hosts
