2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	usb hdd should mount automaticaly,  make sure itis properly plugged in and powered  it should appear on your desktop
2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	try to mount it without  FS options see if it does
2007-09-03T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	we start with the generic stuff to make sure nothing has been overlooked
2007-09-03T08:38:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	  sudo mount /dev/.... /mountpoint
2007-09-03T08:39:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	befor you tried to add it to fstab did you try mounting it manualy ?
2007-09-03T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	I'd start with that before messing with  fstab
2007-09-03T08:45:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	once the usb hdd is plugged in  type lsusb see if it gets listed
2007-09-03T08:54:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	 you might need to install it ,  sudo apt-get install gparted  ( it will show in the admin menu)
2007-09-03T08:55:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser	you shouldn' thave to put usb drives in fstab,  you need to fix the auto mount
