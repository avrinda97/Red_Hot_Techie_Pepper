2012-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	gh0strider		hey can someone remind me how i would go about adding "root" the audio group?
2012-05-11T05:13:00.000Z	gh0strider		when i do the command: "cat /etc/group |egrep -i audio" i get the following -> "audio:x:29:pulse" how can i add root to this group?
2012-05-11T05:13:00.000Z	gh0strider		i think that may be a reason why i am not getting any audio from vlc...?
2012-05-11T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	root doesn't need to be in any groups, it has absolute system access
2012-05-11T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	why are you messing with root anyway?
2012-05-11T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	that command will break your OS
2012-05-11T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	you want:  useradd -a -G audio root     to add the user to the supplementary group
2012-05-11T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	root doesn't gain anything by being in groups, as it can access anything at any time
2012-05-11T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	why are you messing with root anyway?
2012-05-11T05:20:00.000Z	gh0strider	ActionParsnip	when i did useradd -a -G audio root it complained about "-a" saying it was not an option...
2012-05-11T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	do other apps work with sound?
2012-05-11T05:31:00.000Z	gh0strider	ActionParsnip	everything else works with sound except vlc, such as dragon player, kmplayer, my web browswer when i play youtube videos
2012-05-11T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	why are you running the GUI as root?
2012-05-11T05:32:00.000Z	gh0strider	ActionParsnip	i understand the risks
2012-05-11T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	i doubt it, heavilly
2012-05-11T05:33:00.000Z	gh0strider	ActionParsnip	i really do
2012-05-11T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	the OS isn't designed to be ran as root, which is why you  are getting issues
2012-05-11T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	check the sound setting in VLC....
2012-05-11T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	do you wonder why.......
2012-05-11T05:38:00.000Z	gh0strider	ActionParsnip	since i have pulseaudio running in the background i will try the "pulseaudio" option for vlc but i doubt it will work...
2012-05-11T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	try:  rm -r ~/.config/vlc      then rerun the app, or just use another player.....
2012-05-11T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	is it ok as your normal user, how you are supposed to use the OS?
2012-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gh0strider	could use su to run VLC as your user.
