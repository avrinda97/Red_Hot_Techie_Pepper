2005-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	bob2		programs on unix are not run by typign their name in the dir they are in
2005-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	bob2		./foobar will work, tho
2005-08-27T05:43:00.000Z	bob2		what an awesome attitude
2005-08-27T05:44:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	that may not be obvious to everyone
2005-08-27T05:47:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	language?
2005-08-27T05:47:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	oh nvm me, i told someone else to watch his/her language, i'm being stupid right now
2005-08-27T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	they're a Debian-derived-distribution thing, not a general Linux/Unix thing
2005-08-27T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	it will only stop it if you started it with the init script
2005-08-27T06:39:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	thx, and my third problem? =/
2005-08-27T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	find out what's binding it
2005-08-27T06:55:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	rzip is the best you know of? regardless of speed?
2005-08-27T06:56:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	rzip is slow and memory-hungry, but I don't know of a better compressor
2005-08-27T07:01:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	is saying that installing from tarball into /usr?
2005-08-27T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	no, it's not a shell script
2005-08-27T07:15:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	i just executed it and didn't get any errors
2005-08-27T07:16:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	you don't execute it, ever, at all
2005-08-27T07:16:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	it's a config file
2005-08-27T07:17:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	yes
2005-08-29T08:26:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	cvs installs will break my system? then how would you recommend getting a fast cedega?
2005-08-29T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	I didn't say that
2005-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	installing random drivers from cvs to /lib/ can break things, tho
2005-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	bob2	ah, i thought you were saying about alll cvs
2005-08-29T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	EasterSunshine	no
