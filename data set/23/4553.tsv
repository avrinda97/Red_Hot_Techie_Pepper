2007-07-14T08:09:00.000Z	francis_		Could some one please tell me how to I reinstall the nvidia drivers . It was working fine till i recompiled my Kernel to .6.21
2007-07-14T08:10:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	try sudo depmod -a
2007-07-14T08:11:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	is there a newer driver for the .21
2007-07-14T08:13:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	depmod -a gives no output
2007-07-14T08:13:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	how do I recompile it with the new kernel ?
2007-07-14T08:16:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	will look up the nvidia page
2007-07-14T08:23:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	i am downloading the driver as we speek
2007-07-14T08:25:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	it contains a script with either a graphical and a text based menu
2007-07-14T08:28:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	lspci | grep Audio tells me that i have a nVidia Cprp. MCP51 High Definiation Audio >> Though i cant get the sound to work
2007-07-14T08:45:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	i currently have this module for the sound card loaded
2007-07-14T08:31:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	yea I was telling ya abt the hardware I have . Any idea how i could get it working
2007-07-14T08:33:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	I have no clue
2007-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	try "sudo modprobe nvsound"
2007-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	if it does not work, there is another: "sudo modprobe intel8x0"
2007-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	nvsound is not a module
2007-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	maybe it is "sudo modprobe snd_intel8x0"
2007-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2622017 check the post by farbird on the 9th of may
2007-07-14T08:39:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	did modprobe find the intel module?
2007-07-14T08:43:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	type "cp /dev/urandom /dev/dsp" you should hear noise, if you got sound working
2007-07-14T08:45:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	if you want to test it further, there is a command line mp3 player named mpg321
2007-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	hmm. maybe it uses another driver. at least /dev/dsp works
2007-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	francis_	HEP85	kitche , i just got the nvdia video driver downloaded , will have to pull it off my desk top
2007-07-14T09:07:00.000Z	HEP85	francis_	what error?
