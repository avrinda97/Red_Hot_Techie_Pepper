2009-06-01T10:18:00.000Z	AlexKpow		Hello
2009-06-01T10:19:00.000Z	AlexKpow		Does anyone know anything about why event sounds won't play?
2009-06-01T10:21:00.000Z	AlexKpow		:(
2009-06-01T10:21:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	try setting alsa or other drivers in system prefs sound and see if it changes
2009-06-01T10:21:00.000Z	darlek		!sound
2009-06-01T10:22:00.000Z	AlexKpow		Question, is the Sound capture: test supposed to make the beeping noise?
2009-06-01T10:24:00.000Z	AlexKpow		Yeah, changing to ASLA doesn't do anything, I still don't hear event sounds. It used to make my internal speaker beep until I removed the driver with a tutorial I found online
2009-06-01T10:25:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	only if a sound has already been assigned.  If it's blank then no sound can play as there is no association.  Click the "Sounds" tab and hit the play buttons beside each sound.  Try the defaults
2009-06-01T10:26:00.000Z	AlexKpow	darlek	pressing the play button does work
2009-06-01T10:28:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	ok, so you hear the basic stuff then... I tried a few myself and not all are on, just alerts and logins
2009-06-01T10:29:00.000Z	AlexKpow	darlek	I used to get an internal beep from pressing backspace too many times, does that have an alert sound associated with it?
2009-06-01T10:30:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	don't know about that
2009-06-01T10:30:00.000Z	darlek		might be in a theme package
2009-06-01T10:31:00.000Z	AlexKpow	darlek	Oh well, I'll live without them
2009-06-01T10:31:00.000Z	darlek		kk
2009-06-01T10:31:00.000Z	darlek		me too ;)
2009-06-01T10:32:00.000Z	AlexKpow		I've got another question, when I boot from GRUB, it sits at the "Starting up..." screen for like 25 seconds
2009-06-01T10:32:00.000Z	AlexKpow		It doesn't do that when I boot to Windows, though
2009-06-01T10:33:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	that's true.  in 8.10 the login sound was on time with the login window, but in Jaunty it lags or sometimes doesn't play
2009-06-01T10:34:00.000Z	AlexKpow	darlek	the login sounds seems to work fine
2009-06-01T10:36:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	I'm guessing themes has more information about locations and settings.  Although you're not doing themes, those links might have more data for you
2009-06-01T10:36:00.000Z	darlek		!themes
2009-06-01T10:37:00.000Z	darlek	AlexKpow	but maybe not, it's just a guess
