2011-10-06T17:57:00.000Z	lucid9		guys?
2011-10-06T17:57:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	what's the output when you run the command?
2011-10-06T17:57:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	please copy it to pastebin too
2011-10-06T17:58:00.000Z	lucid9		just a sec
2011-10-06T17:58:00.000Z	lucid9		http://pastebin.com/P5YujRDX

2011-10-06T17:59:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	there you are, the directory you're trying to 'cd' to doesn't exist
2011-10-06T17:59:00.000Z	lucid9		it does
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lmontrieux		bash: cd: /home/vikramshankar/.gimp2.6/plug-ins/: No such file or directory
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	either it doesn't or the permissions are wrong
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lucid9		yes, but the directory does exist
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lucid9		and it is in my ~
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lucid9		so i don't see how it has something to do with permissions
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	can you check the directory's permissions ?
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lucid9		i works if i don't use ~
2011-10-06T18:00:00.000Z	lucid9		ok, just a sec
2011-10-06T18:01:00.000Z	lucid9		drwxr-xr-x
2011-10-06T18:01:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	and the owner is the user with which you're running the command, right?
2011-10-06T18:02:00.000Z	lucid9		yes
2011-10-06T18:02:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	isn't is .gimp-2.6 instead of .gimp2.6?
2011-10-06T18:02:00.000Z	lucid9		:)
2011-10-06T18:03:00.000Z	lucid9		thanks a ton, my bad
2011-10-06T18:03:00.000Z	lmontrieux	lucid9	no problem, these things happen and are hard to spot :)
