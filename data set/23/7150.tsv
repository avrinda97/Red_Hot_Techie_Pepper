2007-04-29T07:44:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	try this: notify-send title body
2007-04-29T07:51:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	nothing

2007-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	bash is trying to interpret the !
2007-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	and it works for me in gnome, it must be a kde issue
2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	Unknown urgency Hello world\! specified. Known urgency levels: low, normal, critical.
2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	err, don't use -u
2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	that sets the urgency of the message
2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	nothing... and it works in KDE according to nixternal: http://blog.nixternal.com/2007.03.22/notify-works-in-kubuntu/
2007-04-29T07:54:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	what is the exact command you are running?
2007-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	do  /usr/bin/notify-send -u critical -i /usr/share/icons/default.kde/48x48/apps/edu_languages.png -t 10000 -- "${heading}" "${message}";
2007-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	i am actually working on getting it working for myself right now (the irssi + notification thing looks awesome), i'll let you know if i get it working
2007-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	kk, thanks
2007-04-29T08:05:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	you'll probably be interested in this as well: http://f0rked.com/articles/irssi
2007-04-29T08:05:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	i've already seen that one before :-)
2007-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	i followed exactly the instructions on nixternal's site and it works here :-)
2007-04-29T08:17:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	odd
2007-04-29T08:17:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	I wonder if I installed ubuntu-desktop, if it would work in gnome
2007-04-29T08:18:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	you said that "notify-send title body" didn't work?
2007-04-29T08:18:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	nope
2007-04-29T08:18:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	i wonder if you need to enable something in kde to get libnotification working
2007-04-29T08:20:00.000Z	eck	ryanakca	this is excellent, previously i had it set to sound the system bell on highlights :-)
2007-04-29T08:22:00.000Z	ryanakca	eck	cool
