2007-05-25T08:27:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	what version of wine did you install? the one out of theofficial repositories or the one from winehq.org?
2007-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	ahmed_	varka	the one from the official repositories
2007-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	ahmed_	varka	??
2007-05-25T08:30:00.000Z	ahmed_		C++ ? wat does C++ has to do with emulation ?
2007-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	deinstall the one from the official and add the winehq-repository and install from there and forget about any kind of virtualisation solutions like virtual box, xen, qemu or vmware, they are no choice for 3D-gaming
2007-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	ahmed_	varka	i heard that there is xwine for direct x gaming
2007-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	ahmed_		is that true ??

2007-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	but cedega isnt for free
2007-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	ahmed_		and crossover too
2007-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	ahmed_		google is ma best friend ;)
2007-05-25T08:34:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	i can only repeat what the others said, wine/cedega are by now the best solutions for your kind of problem
2007-05-25T08:34:00.000Z	ahmed_	varka	k to install wine .... i shudnt run sudo apt-get wine .., instead i shud download it from the website
2007-05-25T08:36:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	if you already installed it just deinstall it with 'sudo apt-get remove wine' then goto the winehq.org page, look for the howto for your version of ubuntu, add the repository from winehq and install wine with 'sudo apt-get install wine', thats it
2007-05-25T08:37:00.000Z	varka	ahmed_	remember to update your repository after adding the winehq one with 'sudo apt-get update'
2007-05-25T08:38:00.000Z	ahmed_		guys.. as for gaming emulation, instead of emulating windows now,, will ps2 emulating be a good suggestion for games on linux ??
