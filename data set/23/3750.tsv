2008-02-01T00:59:00.000Z	scorphus		hello, metacity is not running when I log in and the window decorations are gone, can you help me?
2008-02-01T01:00:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	, open terminal and write:   metacity --replace
2008-02-01T01:01:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	I do and it gets fixed. but have to do it everytime I log in.
2008-02-01T01:02:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	add that command to the session. System->Preferences->Sessions -> Startup programs
2008-02-01T01:02:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	ok
2008-02-01T01:04:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	it's already there, on top position
2008-02-01T01:05:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	did you installed emerald manager?
2008-02-01T01:06:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	no, not beryl nor compiz... I just did "aptitude install gnome-session" to have a gui on this gutsy server (under Xen over NoMachine)
2008-02-01T01:08:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	sudo apt-get install gnome  , or try sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity
2008-02-01T01:09:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	hmm.. good points, let me try them
2008-02-01T01:11:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	, also try sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity-commons
2008-02-01T01:11:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	ok
2008-02-01T01:18:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	hmm... nautilus is consuming 99% of the virtual CPU
2008-02-01T01:18:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	nautilus is a file browser. As you know. try kiling it
2008-02-01T01:19:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	I already killed it and aptitude purged it and some others
2008-02-01T01:20:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	why you purged nautilus?
2008-02-01T01:20:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	to see how it goes without it, but I'm installing it again
2008-02-01T01:22:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	yes
2008-02-01T01:24:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	, did you tried: sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core gnome-core
2008-02-01T01:25:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	no, I'm installing them
2008-02-01T01:26:00.000Z	hsystemxX	scorphus	if gnome is consuming more resources than the acceptable, try a lighter desktop manager like xfce.
2008-02-01T01:27:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	I have to mimic the most used configuration, as this is for software tests purposes, and many ubuntu users report problems with it
2008-02-01T01:31:00.000Z	scorphus	hsystemxX	maybe it is something with NoMachine. I'll backup this image and "aptitude install ubuntu-desktop" to see if I get this fixed... the drawback is that this will install 400+ packages and more than 380MB
