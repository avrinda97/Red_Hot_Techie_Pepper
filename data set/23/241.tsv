2012-02-26T13:49:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	fuse-vdi package
2012-02-26T13:50:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	should i apt-get install fuse-vdi package
2012-02-26T13:50:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	used to be called that I thought, but I can't find it now...hang on
2012-02-26T13:51:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	thanks, any help apprecaated at this time
2012-02-26T13:51:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	ah, called virtualbox-ose-fuse now
2012-02-26T13:52:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	then you should be able to loopback mount the vdi
2012-02-26T13:52:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	thanks, ill give its a try
2012-02-26T13:52:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	how do i  loopback mount the vdi?
2012-02-26T13:54:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	something like: mount -o loop foo.vdi mountpoint/
2012-02-26T13:54:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	there are probably instructions in the package (/usr/share/doc/<packagename> often has hints)
2012-02-26T13:57:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	okay ill give its a look
2012-02-26T13:59:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	nope nothing there
2012-02-26T14:00:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	im thinking about just scraping the whole idea and just getting a dos emulator to do what im trying to do
2012-02-26T14:07:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	you could put the files into an iso and mount the iso in the vm
2012-02-26T14:08:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	how do i go about makeing an .iso   is it as simple as placeing them in a . zip and renameing it?
2012-02-26T14:08:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	no.  nowhere near as simple as that sadly :)
2012-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	ah ha.. alright well how do i do that?
2012-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	Personally I'd use mkisofs, but there's probably a better way
2012-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	ah, there you go.  "brasareo" (whatever that is)
2012-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	distracting eye-candy
2012-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	ssta	brian1992	you just enable all the eye-candy IIRC...
2012-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	brian1992	ssta	hahaha
