2012-10-20T21:38:00.000Z	ajacom		Oh no. not again.
2012-10-20T21:38:00.000Z	ajacom		the usb stick died.
2012-10-20T21:38:00.000Z	ajacom		it's the second USB stick that is killed trying to install ubuntu =(
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	ajacom		i don't know why. maybe it's that "persistence" stuff.
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	The USB stick doesn't function at all anymore?
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	ajacom	kpullen	no. it's the second one
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	ajacom	kpullen	it shows up in My Computer, though
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	ajacom		and on disk administrator as well
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	Oh good, so theoretically it still functions
2012-10-20T21:40:00.000Z	ajacom		yea
2012-10-20T21:40:00.000Z	ajacom		i just can't format it
2012-10-20T21:41:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	Do you know the USB stick's device path? It should be something like /dev/sdb
2012-10-20T21:41:00.000Z	ajacom		windows was unable to complete the format
2012-10-20T21:41:00.000Z	ajacom	kpullen	i'm on windows. i couldn't boot into linux
2012-10-20T21:42:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	Ohhhh
2012-10-20T21:42:00.000Z	ajacom		i had the live cd there =
2012-10-20T21:42:00.000Z	ajacom		=(
2012-10-20T21:42:00.000Z	ajacom		i must really want to install linux....
2012-10-20T21:42:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	Any chance you live in Portland, Oregon? There's an Ubuntu 12.10 release party, and if you come to that we might be able to get your USB stick working again.
2012-10-20T21:43:00.000Z	ajacom	kpullen	i'd love to, but i'm at the other side of the world right now
2012-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	ajacom		:)
2012-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	ajacom		what if i just use Wubi... ?
2012-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	kpullen	ajacom	That makes it difficult. Wubi is a good option. I think it will allow you to install right from Windows, so you won't even need to use your thumb drive. I've never used it though.
