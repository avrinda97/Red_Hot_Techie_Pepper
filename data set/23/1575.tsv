2010-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	Roasted		Has anybody had their wireless just drop randomly for no reason even with having good signal?
2010-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	yep
2010-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	every 5 minutes on my other laptop
2010-04-05T20:59:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	is it a Dell?
2010-04-05T20:59:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	yes, latitude E5500s. both of them
2010-04-05T21:00:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	you cnecked if its the wifi card(s)?
2010-04-05T21:00:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	checked what about the wifi cards?
2010-04-05T21:00:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	the wifi card in my dell latitude E6500 decided to die shortly after Ubu was installed, and I narrowed it down to the wifi card failing
2010-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	so check that out and try swapping the cards, seeing if it works
2010-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	not sure... I mean, its a new laptop. both of them. *shrug*
2010-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	I dual boot with XP on this, and I haven't noticed the same issues here.
2010-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	and besides, I have Ubuntu on a toshiba laptop at home that does the same thing.
2010-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	^^
2010-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	realteak card in the toshiba, broadocm in both dells.
2010-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	and Broadcom drivers are loaded correctly in the Dell one?
2010-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	*shrug* I just installed them through the network manager.
2010-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	might be the drivers it uses...
2010-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	that would be the case
2010-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	i bounce between wireless access points but thats it
2010-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	we're talking about two cards here. on tiop of that, I dual boot XP on this same laptop and XP doenst exhibit these same issues. Its definitely not a failing card, and unless the linux drivers for realtek and broadcom both suck, only then could that be a possibility.
2010-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted	Trek	I have no issues going from access point to access point unless I go running down the hall quickly enough for the controller not to pass me off to the next AP properly.
2010-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	The broadcom and realtek drivers are compiled by reverse-engineering the closed source drivers that are for those cards
2010-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	Trek	Roasted	its possible they're just bad
