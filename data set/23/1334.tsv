2010-05-10T06:14:00.000Z	g0tcha		hey guys, what makes a fresh install of 10.04 not list windows networks when i go to the Network tab?
2010-05-10T06:15:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	network tab where?
2010-05-10T06:15:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	Places -> Network -> Windows Network
2010-05-10T06:15:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	please note that default ubuntu install is not compatible with Vista, 7 and Server 200
2010-05-10T06:16:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	so how can i be able to see the shared folders from my windows machines?
2010-05-10T06:18:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	no, like i said, when i go to 'Windows Network' it doesnt list any of my windows machines
2010-05-10T06:19:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	i want to access my windows shared folders from my 10.04, not the other way around
2010-05-10T06:19:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	where is that?!
2010-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	i dont really get it.. with 9.10 my windows machines used to show fine under Place/Network/Windows Network
2010-05-10T06:24:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	hm strange
2010-05-10T06:24:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	can you connect to them providing IP address directly?
2010-05-10T06:25:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	i know how to do that in a windows machine.. how can i do that in ubuntu?
2010-05-10T06:26:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	open nautilus and type in Location bar smb://<IP address>
2010-05-10T06:29:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	i cant type anything in the Location bar
2010-05-10T06:29:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	why?
2010-05-10T06:29:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	there is no bar to type in.. it just shows the filesystem and the home folder
2010-05-10T06:30:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	press Ctrl+L or click the little pencil icon
2010-05-10T06:32:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	yes, i can connect that way
2010-05-10T06:32:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	used windows user/pass as well
2010-05-10T06:35:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	i didnt set it to master and i dont see that option there
2010-05-10T06:36:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	it should be there, set it up
2010-05-10T06:37:00.000Z	g0tcha	hjdshjsd	do i have to do anything after changing settings in smb.conf?
2010-05-10T06:37:00.000Z	hjdshjsd	g0tcha	if you have samba demon running, restart it and wait about 15 minutes
