2012-05-27T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	xbmcubuntu isn't supported here
2012-05-27T00:10:00.000Z	stueng	ActionParsnip	I am running Ubuntu Server 12.04 btw, not xbmcbuntu... but the problem I have will apply to xbmcbuntu users specifically
2012-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	its not supported here
2012-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	stueng	ActionParsnip	ubuntu server is supported here surely?
2012-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	I though you were having issue with xbmcubuntu?
2012-05-27T00:25:00.000Z	stueng	ActionParsnip	I run ubuntu server but hte issue I am having would effect xbmcbuntu users  as well
2012-05-27T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	why not use the web interface, there is a sweet app for android and iphone to control it
2012-05-27T00:28:00.000Z	stueng	ActionParsnip	yeah the http interface works fine atm, its just that hipporemote requires the vnc protocol
2012-05-30T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	there are loads of native email clients
2012-05-30T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	thats the kicker, exchange. If you get a groupwise server you'll see all that is available in evolution
2012-06-07T21:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stueng	indeed
