2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		So Flannel, I read Invocation, and what is says is that I don't need .bash_profile, .bash_login and .profile?
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		But just one of them?
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		It said bash only reads from the first one it finds
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		I cant find .bash_profile
2008-06-22T12:35:00.000Z	Hermes		Well I want to add a command to .bash_profile
2008-06-22T12:36:00.000Z	Hermes		II did make my own .bash_profile and put alias l='ls -l' in it, but I don't think it worked
2008-06-22T12:36:00.000Z	Hermes		Okay Okay
2008-06-22T12:36:00.000Z	Hermes		I'll add alias l='ls -l' to .profile, and create my own .bash_profile
2008-06-22T12:37:00.000Z	Hermes		then ill log out and back in, and see if what i tried to do worked
2008-06-22T12:37:00.000Z	Hermes		:D
2008-06-22T12:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hermes	I believe ~/.bash_profile needs to be an executable
