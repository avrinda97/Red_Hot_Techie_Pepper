2012-11-18T16:04:00.000Z	mando_		ok I ran into a few problems. My nephews computer is an older dell with a single pentium 4 with a 1 gig of ram and a 256 mbs nvidia card. I honestly thought it could take unity but I am experiencing all sorts of lag and I can't do snap windows. Would mints mate be a better choice for this pc. Hell lxde is laggy running ubuntu :(
2012-11-18T16:04:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Yikes - may consider running a lighter OS
2012-11-18T16:05:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Though it may be a vid driver issue
2012-11-18T16:05:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	mint seems like a better choice
2012-11-18T16:05:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	I like mint a lot myself - currently on Arch
2012-11-18T16:05:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Ubuntu has gotten rather bloated as of late
2012-11-18T16:07:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	thank you for pointing that out. Thats sad becuase my nephew really like the unity bar.
2012-11-18T16:07:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Have you installed the nvidia restricted drivers?
2012-11-18T16:08:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	yes I did. No dice
2012-11-18T16:08:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Ah bummer
2012-11-18T16:08:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	The is strange - 256mb card is rather good
2012-11-18T16:08:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	hey question. is ubuntu unity more bloated then kde? I currently have that but I have been admiring unity
2012-11-18T16:09:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Cant say. Didnt like unity enough to play around with it
2012-11-18T16:09:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Its also dependant on what effects youve got turned on
2012-11-18T16:10:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	XFCE with a dock may end up running faster than Unity
2012-11-18T16:10:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	I know right? but what I think it is the single processor. I think unity would demand something newwer. I dunno
2012-11-18T16:11:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Yeah, you are on a P4 . . . and only 1 GB of RAM
2012-11-18T16:11:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Those may be your bottleneck
2012-11-18T16:12:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	yep. I guess I'll go lower in os. Whatever will run his minecraft gamer better lol
2012-11-18T16:12:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Lol
2012-11-18T16:12:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	Minecraft can be rather demanding, do a light DE may be better
2012-11-18T16:12:00.000Z	Bl4cklisted	mando_	so*
2012-11-18T16:13:00.000Z	mando_	Bl4cklisted	I will. thank you for the help
