2011-05-11T07:28:00.000Z	ubuntu		hello, ive installed ms windows right after install ubuntu and i cant boot ubuntu anymore, how can i fix such problem
2011-05-11T07:30:00.000Z	ubuntu		this guide is confusing for beginners
2011-05-11T07:30:00.000Z	ubuntu		i dont know how to mount the ubuntu partition to my places thing
2011-05-11T07:30:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	feel free to pm me if you want a walkthrough
2011-05-11T08:10:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	the problem you would have is not being able to pipe direct3d from windows guest into opengl calls on the ubuntu host
2011-05-11T08:11:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	if you want 3d graphics in both systems usually people run win7 as the host and ubuntu as the guest and install the guest additions to ubuntu. i don't know of any guest additions for windows that would enable 3d graphics with an ubuntu host
2011-05-11T08:25:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	you are already on 11.04 so dist-upgrade is not needed it would take you to 11.10 which isn't available
2011-05-12T07:12:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	the two are incompatible at least until 11.10
2011-05-12T07:14:00.000Z	ubuntu	escott	Is it confirmed that compatibility will be fixed by 11.10?
2011-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	i read a blog saying they were already starting the process of porting unity to gtk3 which would be needed to support both on the same system
2011-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	ubuntu	escott	thanks, I can wait for a while
2011-08-07T22:00:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	assume you are the same ubuntu_ from earlier i think you will need to solve that problem and the fakeraid to get anything to work. do you know if grub will play nice with your fakeraid
2011-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	there isn't much point in working on one without a solution for the other. ask here or in #grub if grub2 will support fakeraid stripping with your chipset
2011-08-09T06:56:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	sudo apt-get install apt-file; apt-file nm-applet
2011-08-09T06:57:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	that should tell you what to install
2011-08-09T06:58:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	no its a tool to tell you where to find a program. apt-file search nm-applet. once you know what package you can just install that
2011-08-09T06:59:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	apt will make sure to install all the things that said package needs
2011-08-17T04:37:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	sounds like grub is missing some modules but you shouldn't need the aufs component anyways
2011-08-17T04:38:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	are you running a stock kernel?
2011-08-17T04:38:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	ok then yes you would need aufs. im not sure this would work. what exactly do you want to do
2011-08-17T04:43:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	can you back up a bit, and describe what you want to do. you probably want to be using usb-creator-gtk
2011-08-17T04:45:00.000Z	escott	ubuntu	you cannot use usb-creator-gtk on the same usb you just booted. so yes you need two
2011-08-17T04:45:00.000Z	ubuntu	escott	yea i no my problem now thanks :)
