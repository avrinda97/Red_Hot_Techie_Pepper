2008-01-07T05:32:00.000Z	Am|sh		is there a way to do remote desktop, other than VNC?  IE, using a desktop with ubuntu to connect remotely to a server running ubuntu?
2008-01-07T05:33:00.000Z	Am|sh		I'm trying to configure VMWare server on a box.  I couldn't get it running on 7.10-server, so i'm trying regular old 7.10...  but the box's vid card is so bad, it doesn't even load in safe-graphics mode...
2008-01-07T05:34:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	define "bad", in terms of the video card; bad as in broken, or bad as in "mis-configured"
2008-01-07T05:35:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	dunno, it's an old ibm netfinity 5500 server...   i had to do ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a prompt, and it's at 320x180 or some gawd awful resolution
2008-01-07T05:36:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	dear god.  will it take a normal pci video card?
2008-01-07T05:37:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	possibly... the server is about 3' by 3' by 2' tall (massive cube) with an attached 10-drive scsi array, and it's backed into a closet.  i really don't want to pull it out and try sticking a new card into it
2008-01-07T05:38:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	but the funny thing is that it ran normally all throught the text-only install, and after it's installed it decided to go all wonky.
2008-01-07T05:40:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	the only differences between (Ku|Xu|U)buntu are the graphics managers
2008-01-07T05:40:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	ssh -X
2008-01-07T05:50:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	while it's installing, it will ask you what to use as the default environment
2008-01-07T05:51:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	Starnestommy:  thanks!  so if I want to swtich back, then just apt-get install ubuntu-desktop?
2008-01-07T05:51:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	they'll be installed side-by-side, you can switch back and forth on the fly
2008-01-07T06:10:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	did reconfiguring xserver get you going?
2008-01-07T06:11:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	yup, changed from the S3 trio driver to VESA... and a ctrl-alt-backspace reloaded X to a nice login screen :)
2008-01-07T06:11:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	: )
2008-01-07T06:12:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	now to get remote desktop working properly... since that box doesn't have a mouse... so i'm still up a creek unless i get really good at tabbing & alting
2008-01-07T06:14:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	did "ssh -X" not do the trick for you?
2008-01-07T06:15:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	ssh -X did work, i was able to run the vino-preferences command to load the remote desktop tool to enable remote desktop
2008-01-07T06:15:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	but i want to get the full desktop, not just run apps remotely
2008-01-07T06:15:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	ah.  i've never needed that.  i know it can be done, but i don't know how
2008-01-07T06:16:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	I enabled remote desktop, and it told me to use the command "vncviewer HOSTNAME:0" to connect... when I try, it gives me a connection refused (111) error
2008-01-07T06:17:00.000Z	joh6nn	Am|sh	out of my realm of experience.  sorry.  ; (
2008-01-07T06:18:00.000Z	Am|sh	joh6nn	np, thanks for the help though!  i'm off to try this: http://grumpymole.blogspot.com/2006/12/xubuntu-remote-desktop-with-vnc4server.html
