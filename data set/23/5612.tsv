2008-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	Will		Choudesh: It didn't work. It took a while because I tried to install it again after it failed, but that didn't work either.
2008-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	Will		Choudesh: By failed I mean it said "Missing operating system" once again.
2008-07-20T08:33:00.000Z	Will		Captain: I tried before the install and it didn't work. Choudesh left?
2008-07-20T08:34:00.000Z	Will		Captain: Well this sucks.
2008-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	Will		<tab> ?
2008-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	the TAB key on your keyboard
2008-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	mechdave, run the command 'mount' at the command line to see what partitions you've already got mounted
2008-07-20T08:45:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	mount in the terminal?
2008-07-20T08:45:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	yes, just type the word 'mount' and hit enter it should show you what partitions are already mounted.
2008-07-20T08:49:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	what were you trying to do again?  I think the beginning of yours and mechdave's conversation got lost in the mix and I cant find it.  clue me in on what's wrong and ill be glad to pitch in a bit of help if i can
2008-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	basically I've tried to install Ubuntu multiple times through the Live CD and install right off of the CD without going into the demo, but every time I reboot the system has a message that just says "Missing operating system". It always completes the installation process, but never works upon reboot
2008-07-20T08:53:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	mechdave, do you think that could be something to do with the MBR?  Will, are you duel booting?  Can you boot into Windows?
2008-07-20T08:54:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	Ubuntu removed Windows.
2008-07-20T08:57:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	mechdave, can you access gParted in an Ubuntu liveCD while on that computer?  that should show you the labels for the partitions... it might not be /dev/sda2 for your what you're trying to get into
2008-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	explain what I'm trying to do again?
2008-07-20T09:00:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	when you boot up into the Ubuntu LiveCD, go to System>Administration>Partition Editor
2008-07-20T09:00:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	I did what mechdave said
2008-07-20T09:06:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	mechdave, what are you guys trying to locate in swap?  try mounting /dev/sda1 and then checking out what all parts of the FS got installed.  if you can find the grub menu in /boot/grub/menu.lst then paste that in a pastebin
2008-07-20T09:06:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	I'll try /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-07-20T09:07:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	you'll have to find a way to mount /dev/sda1 first
2008-07-20T09:07:00.000Z	Will	FastZ	how?
2008-07-20T09:07:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	not sure yet,
2008-07-20T09:09:00.000Z	FastZ	Will	mechdave, I gotta split guys.  Sorry i cant stick around and help longer.  good luck Will
