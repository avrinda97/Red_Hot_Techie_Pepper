2006-04-23T09:35:00.000Z	RipVanFish		I can't get my wired ethernet working
2006-04-23T09:37:00.000Z	RipVanFish		AA
2006-04-23T09:37:00.000Z	RipVanFish		AAA yes it does
2006-04-23T09:37:00.000Z	RipVanFish		AAA I think DCHP isn't giving me an IP but I don't see why not
2006-04-23T09:39:00.000Z	RipVanFish		AAA I'm on my University's network, it uses DHCP and the MAC address of my ethernet controller
2006-04-23T09:39:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	What happens if you do "sudo dhclient eth0" in a terminal?
2006-04-23T09:40:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	when I use sudo dhclient it searches for a while and then fails
2006-04-23T09:44:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	Maybe you need to register the mac address with your university.
2006-04-23T09:44:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	it is already registered, I can tell because I'm using the computer right now in windows
2006-04-23T09:46:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	How can you use the computer in windows and test ubuntu commands at the same time?
2006-04-23T09:46:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	I'm starting up my laptop
2006-04-23T09:47:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	So you're running two different computers? Are you behind a router?
2006-04-23T09:47:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	not behind a router
2006-04-23T09:48:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	So, two different computers, directly connected to the university lan?
2006-04-23T09:48:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	yes
2006-04-23T09:49:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	I'll brb
2006-04-23T09:50:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	But the computer running ubuntu will have a different mac address from the one running windows. Unless you've registered them both, you won't get an IP for the ubuntu machine.
2006-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	ready for any ideas that you might have
2006-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	When you run "ifconfig -a" it prints a mac address for eth0. Have you registered that specific mac address with your university?
2006-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	yes it is registered
2006-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	when I am on my windows partition I can connect to the internet
2006-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	RipVanFish	johanbr	unless for some reason the mac address is changing in ubuntu
2006-04-23T09:56:00.000Z	johanbr	RipVanFish	Which ubuntu version are you running?
