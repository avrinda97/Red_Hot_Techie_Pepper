2010-03-25T05:56:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy		I am getting this error when trying to run a daily update
2010-03-25T05:56:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy		E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2010-03-25T05:56:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy		anyone know WTF is up with this?  I cant update my system anymore
2010-03-25T05:56:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	run sudo dpkg --configure -a in terminal
2010-03-25T05:57:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	I did and it still does the same thing
2010-03-25T05:57:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	go look for broken packages in synaptics
2010-03-25T05:57:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	I dont use synaptics.
2010-03-25T05:58:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	most likely something happened before and broke a package
2010-03-25T05:58:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	i am saying use the synaptic package manager to check for broken packages
2010-03-25T06:04:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	and I am saying I dont use synaptic..I use aptitude
2010-03-25T06:06:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	are you sure you "actually Read" what i said?
2010-03-25T06:07:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	I am not on Ubuntu, I use Kubuntu and I am not installing Synaptic..Sorry.
2010-03-25T06:07:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	hmmm other than apt does kubuntu have a secondary package manager?
2010-03-25T06:09:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	You didnt read what *I* said.  I said I use aptitude..Not apt, not synaptic
2010-03-25T06:10:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	well you didn't tell me you were using kubuntu
2010-03-25T06:10:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	okay other than apt does Kubuntu have any other kind of package manager?
2010-03-25T06:11:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	well i call them apt :CP
2010-03-25T06:11:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	booksbuggy	apt != aptitude
2010-03-25T06:12:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	just tell me if there is any other package manager existant in kubuntu other than the one you always used?
2010-03-25T06:15:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	well then use that to look for the broken packages
2010-03-25T06:15:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	since if that's the equavlent of synaptics in gnome then it should work pretty much the same thing
2010-03-25T06:18:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	use adept to find the broken packages before YOUR system actually kills itself
2010-03-25T06:24:00.000Z	booksbuggy	FeasibilityStudy	good luck
