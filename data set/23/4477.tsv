2007-08-03T05:26:00.000Z	Splitburst		hello all, i have a problem. When i installed the nvidia driver in ubunto the sytem "broke" down
2007-08-03T05:26:00.000Z	Splitburst		it says that the x server is miss configerd something
2007-08-03T05:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Splitburst	if i remember correctly, there are lots of nvidia drivers. you have to make sure to install the right one for your card
2007-08-03T05:27:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Splitburst	for example, i have an old geforce 440 and the current driver no longer supports it, so i have to download the old driver and compile it myself
2007-08-03T05:27:00.000Z	Splitburst	howlingmadhowie	okay, i got the new 8800gts
2007-08-03T05:28:00.000Z	Splitburst	howlingmadhowie	but how to redo this so i cant install anoter driver?
2007-08-03T05:28:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Splitburst	just to get you back to the land of window managers: open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and scan down the file to where you see a driver called "nvidia" or similar. change the driver to "vesa" and restart x
2007-08-03T05:30:00.000Z	Splitburst	howlingmadhowie	gaaah i know nothing about this hehe. what i can do now is logon with no gnu
