2007-08-15T09:15:00.000Z	Lappy		the brightness of my sony vaio is killing me... and there's no way for me to reduce it.. i've tried so many things.. none seemed to work... anyone has any ideas? (SONY VAIO VGN-FE38GP)
2007-08-15T09:15:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	did you tried xgamme
2007-08-15T09:15:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	no I did not.. noone mentioned it in any forums.. i'll try it
2007-08-15T09:17:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	Does it work now....
2007-08-15T09:17:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	 yeah but still brightness too high.
2007-08-15T09:17:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	reduce the value....
2007-08-15T09:17:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	I did, I dont want this, I need something to do with brightness.
2007-08-15T09:17:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	what graphic card is that?
2007-08-15T09:18:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	geforce 7600 go
2007-08-15T09:18:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	Do you have nvidia settings...
2007-08-15T09:18:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	I installed some... not sure if that's everything though...
2007-08-15T09:19:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	nvidia-gls
2007-08-15T09:19:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	nvidia-glx
2007-08-15T09:19:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	If you have installed the drivers manually..then you will get the settings manager..
2007-08-15T09:19:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	when i installed ubuntu it updated a lot of stuff, and it dled the nvidia thing.. I didn't apt-get them or anything.
2007-08-15T09:20:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	Difficult to instruct now...if you have nvidia settings...then..you can control these display parameters...
2007-08-15T09:20:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	I went to nvidia-settings now, and was able to do it.
2007-08-15T09:20:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	thx...
2007-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	do you by any chance know how to make the fn keys work?
2007-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	Got the nice display now...or still you have any issues
2007-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	thanda	Lappy	I never tried...but there is a topic about that in the forum.
2007-08-15T09:22:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	i've looked a lot and did many of the stuff asked, none of them worked.. as for brightness yeah it worked thx
2007-08-15T09:34:00.000Z	Lappy	thanda	just found 'smartdimmer' also does the job it seems :)
