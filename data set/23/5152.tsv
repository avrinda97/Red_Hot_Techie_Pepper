2007-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	Silthrim		or are they programs that "cancel each other out"?
2007-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	quaal	Silthrim	dont know
2007-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	Silthrim		hmm
2007-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	quaal	Silthrim	just trying to install fluxbox for the first time now
2007-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	Silthrim	quaal	tell me if you have any problems because it seems that its not a fan of GNOME
2007-02-07T17:53:00.000Z	quaal	Silthrim	i believe it replaces gnome.
2007-02-07T17:53:00.000Z	Silthrim		correct me if im wrong but GNOME and KDE are desktop managers and Beryl is a window manager
2007-02-07T17:53:00.000Z	Silthrim	quaal	oh i didnt realize that
2007-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	Silthrim		beryl is a window manager that runs inside the KDE or GNOME desktop manager (i believe :P)
2007-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	quaal	Silthrim	http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net
2007-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	Silthrim	quaal	yeah thanks
