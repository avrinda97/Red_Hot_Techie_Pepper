2006-08-03T09:32:00.000Z	ardy		when I try to go to ubuntuforum.org I always redirected to my localhost page
2006-08-03T09:32:00.000Z	ardy		anybody know how to troubleshoot my problem
2006-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 Are your nameservers set properly?
2006-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 In /etc/resolv.conf?
2006-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	yes I have it correctly
2006-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 What about /etc/hosts?
2006-08-03T09:34:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	ok i check again
2006-08-03T09:42:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	I'll cek already noting wrong with my configuration
2006-08-03T09:42:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	when i try to login to yahoo mail I always get this page "The requested URL /ym/login was not found on this server."
2006-08-03T09:43:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	when i try to login to yahoo mail I always get this page "The requested URL /ym/login was not found on this server." Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.2 Server at us.f517.mail.yahoo.com Port 80
2006-08-03T09:43:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 That DEFINITELY sounds like a problem with Yahoo, not your PC.
2006-08-03T09:44:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	no, If I try on my xp machines it works fine
2006-08-03T09:45:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 what is the output when you type in "ping us.f517.mail.yahoo.com"?
2006-08-03T09:46:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	64 bytes from 61.6.222.233: icmp_seq=16 ttl=64 time=0.067 ms
2006-08-03T09:47:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 Well see, from the looks of it, all outbound traffic is being redirected to localhost
2006-08-03T09:47:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	then what should I do?
2006-08-03T09:47:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	 What is the output of "cat /etc/hosts"?  Usually when that happens you have a line in /etc/hosts that shouldn't be in there.
2006-08-03T09:48:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	can I paste it in pastebin
2006-08-03T09:49:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	go ahead
2006-08-03T09:50:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19537
2006-08-03T09:54:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	do you have any idea about it?
2006-08-03T09:54:00.000Z	liquidten2	ardy	I'm stumped at the moment.  Your /etc/hosts looks fine to me...
2006-08-03T09:55:00.000Z	ardy	liquidten2	yeah same to me... I dont know why it redirected to my localhost
