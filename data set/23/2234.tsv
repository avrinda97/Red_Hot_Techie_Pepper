2010-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	y7deluxe		^^something like this
2010-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	a deb ?
2010-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	what's a deb?
2010-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	a installable software package,  like blah.deb
2010-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	correct
2010-05-12T08:58:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	i can tell you, but which is it (mostly better from a repo)?
2010-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	i don't know what you're asking me... it's a .tgz that i dled from 3ware's website, put on a flash drive, opened on my ubuntu machine... the two files inside are install.3dm and 3dm-lnx.tgz
2010-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	ic, so no debs but tarballs ..
2010-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	i'm going to go with yes :D
2010-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	I don't know that app, but from your knowledge it might be better to look in synaptic first
2010-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	have you got a link to that website ?
2010-05-12T09:02:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	http://www.lsi.com/cm/License.do?url=http://www.lsi.com/DistributionSystem/AssetDocument/3DM-linux-x86-7.7.1.tgz&prodName=3ware%208006-2LP&subType=Software&locale=
2010-05-12T09:02:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	looking up, seconds..
2010-05-12T09:07:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	I will try to compile it on a vm, but still have no clue about that soft
2010-05-12T09:07:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	i found this on it, but it assumes i have an internet connection: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-263288.html
2010-05-12T09:10:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	from just unpacking it I can see it's for redhat and suse..
2010-05-12T09:10:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	what do you want the soft to do ?
2010-05-12T09:11:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	it runs an html file that'll allow me to view my array's rebuilding progress
2010-05-12T09:11:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	not that same, but most can be ported, especially from source, but I found no configur-able so far
2010-05-12T09:13:00.000Z	y7deluxe	DasEi	guess i'll give up and hope it rebuilds. gotta wait 2-3 days to find out :\ - thank you for all of your help. it's definitely appreciated
2010-05-12T09:15:00.000Z	DasEi	y7deluxe	mainly html-files and no install-subdir , I don't know how to handle it
