2008-02-13T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	thanks for the spam - is the server running, is the password set ? is the password set for user@localhost ?
2008-02-14T00:00:00.000Z	qwerkus	ikonia	server is running, and the point is resetting the password
2008-02-14T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	reseting the password has nothing to do with it 1.) have you SET the MYSQL (not ubuntu) root password 2.) is the user@host correct
2008-02-14T00:01:00.000Z	qwerkus	ikonia	where can i check this ?
2008-02-14T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	check what, did you or did you not set the MYSQL root user password (not the ubuntu one) yes or no
2008-02-14T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	you either did - or you didn't
2008-02-14T00:02:00.000Z	qwerkus	ikonia	this is an old install, and i guess a few years ago, everything has been set
2008-02-14T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	try mysql -u root -p
2008-02-14T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	right so your password is most probably wrong
2008-02-14T00:03:00.000Z	qwerkus	ikonia	is it possible to read the database ?
2008-02-14T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	if you have a valid user that has connect and read permissions, sure
2008-02-14T00:04:00.000Z	qwerkus	ikonia	so what are my options ?
2008-02-14T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	get the right password
2008-02-14T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	re-install mysql
2008-02-14T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	if you don't know the password - your out of luck
2008-02-14T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerkus	you may want to join #mysql and see if they will offer more advanced options
