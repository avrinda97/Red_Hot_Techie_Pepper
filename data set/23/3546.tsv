2008-03-23T17:33:00.000Z	roychri		Can I install ubuntu on a logical partition and make that my only os?
2008-03-23T17:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	yes
2008-03-23T17:33:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	cool. thanks for answring,
2008-03-23T17:34:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	I have Suse right now and I want to use ubuntu.  I do not want to loose my /home and /usr/local so I am re-paritionning right now and my two primary partition I do not want the installer to touch (not format).  Easy?
2008-03-23T17:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	the livecd install always formats it/s own / root.. but not other partitions on the drive. as in seperate /home or /var..
2008-03-23T17:37:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	So... all I have to do is select "manual" on the partition screen and specify the logcial partition I am building right now as the root and the other partition will not be touched?
2008-03-23T17:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	correct.  it will only force you to format whatever partition you chose for /root
2008-03-23T17:38:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	Nice!!!!
2008-03-23T17:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	if you have enough for a second swap partition you can do that as it will eliminate one issue for hibernate/suspend etc.
2008-03-23T17:39:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	What do you mean? What issue?
2008-03-23T17:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	if you have enough for a second swap partition you can do that as it will eliminate one issue for hibernate/suspend etc. If you dual boot, and hibernate one os and boot the other, you may be overwriting something in swap you wanted..
2008-03-23T17:41:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	If I do not want to dual boot, will I have this issue?
2008-03-23T17:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	no
2008-03-23T17:41:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	I do not want to dual boot. I want to replace Suse.
2008-03-23T17:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	may I suggest one thing...
2008-03-23T17:42:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	PLEASE :)! :)
2008-03-23T17:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	if you install full working system on a single partition you will not have any issuses as home will be inside root,  it is then a known working system so you can redirect from a working system to your old home as I think that is what you want to do eventually
2008-03-23T17:44:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	yes, that is what I want to do.  Once the install is finished, I will change it so that the home partition is using my existing/old partition.
2008-03-23T17:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	just pointing that option out,  It is easy to point to your old home during the install, but if there is a conflict you dont get a working system
2008-03-23T17:46:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	thanks, it is appreciated.
2008-03-23T17:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	you sound like you have a good understanding of the process.  it will go fine
2008-03-23T17:47:00.000Z	roychri	Jack_Sparrow	I have been using linux for 5+ years now, but my first time with ubuntu.  Tried many distro before, but I am not an admin, I am a user.
2008-03-23T17:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	roychri	welcome to ubuntu
