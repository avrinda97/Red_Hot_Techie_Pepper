2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	swoody		I'm dual booting Ubuntu and FreeBSD, but I need to add FreeBSD to the GRUB menu, anyone know how?
2009-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	yes it's rather easy really just haev to remember the third part of the devices and such
2009-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	copy the Ubuntu entry that is there but you need to change root so it goes liek root (hdX, a) for the root part and the kernel is /boot/loader
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 ok, well I actually just wrote over the Fedora I had installed with FreeBSD, so would I just rename the Fedora entry to 'FreeBSD' and leave the rest alone?
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	no you need to edit root and the kernel lines
2009-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	what does the root line say for the old fedora lin
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 (hd0,2) - I also have openSuse installed on (hd0,1)
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	well it would be root (hd0,a)
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	and the kerne;l line should read /boot/loader
2009-06-05T04:14:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 ok, so change it to (hd0,a), and the kernel to '/boot/loader' and that's it?
2009-06-05T04:15:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	pretty much :) jsut be glad your not usuing grub on FreeBSD itself it's a bit different for that
2009-06-05T04:15:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 haha, ok, well I'll give it a try and reboot :) thanks!
2009-06-05T04:18:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 nope, "bad file or directory type"
2009-06-05T04:19:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	opps forgot another thing
2009-06-05T04:20:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	root (hd0,2,a) :) been a while sicne I setup grub for freebsd sicne I just use freebsd without a bootloader
2009-06-05T04:20:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 ok, thanks :)
2009-06-05T04:21:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 ok, will try again :)
2009-06-05T04:24:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 nope, still "Error 2: Bad File or Entry type"
2009-06-05T04:25:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	well you need to figure out what's wrong since if it's on the second partition it should be hd0,2 but the a could be different
2009-06-05T04:26:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 well first partition is Ubuntu (hd0,0), openSuse is second partition (hd0,1), and BSD should be 3rd partition (hd0,2) right?
2009-06-05T04:28:00.000Z	kitche	swoody	correct for my system I would use hd0,0,a for my root line
2009-06-05T04:29:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 nope, no spaces in there
2009-06-05T04:29:00.000Z	swoody	kitche	 it's "(hd0,2,a)"
