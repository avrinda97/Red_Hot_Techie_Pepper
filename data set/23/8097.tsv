2006-05-31T08:30:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	oh really ?? should I replace /dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root to /dev/sda5 then ?
2006-05-31T08:31:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	oki, rebooting ;) tx
2006-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	ok, sda5 is not my / partition, using this line : kernel          /vmlinuz-2.6.16.18 root=/dev/sda1 ro is working ... root partition is mounted but I got an error : Warning: enable to  open an initial console | kernel panic : not syncing :: no init found; try passing init= option to kernel. i tried to do this : mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.16.18 2.6.16.18 but here is the output : /usr/sbin/mkinitrd: /dev/mapper/Ubuntu-swap_1: Kernel does not suppor
2006-05-31T08:56:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	yeah, I just used the default partition scheme when i installed ubuntu. one / on sda1 and one swap ... what can I do to solve this initrd pblm ?
2006-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	where can i paste the output of df -h ?  #flood ?
2006-05-31T09:03:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	nope, I dont have it .. it's at home ...I'm at work
2006-05-31T09:04:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	kernel panic with the kernel i just built ... but the default one (from ubuntu cd) is working

2006-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	i think so, but i have a pblm when doing the mkinitrd command ... I updated the paste, I added a section of my meny.lst ... right now i'm booting from /vmlinuz-2.6.12-10-386 root=/dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root ro quiet splash

2006-05-31T09:07:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	yeah i built it myself
2006-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	i see; because I prefer to go on a monolithic kernel insead of loading modules ...
2006-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	the easiest way should be to install the .deb kernel image right ?
2006-05-31T09:15:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	oki ... well I just found something, according to df -h sda1 is the /boot and sda5 the / ; menu.lst  contains :

2006-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	hmmm really? right now, it's downloading one pkg at a time ... when the first one is finished, then it downloads the 2nd ...
2006-06-09T09:45:00.000Z	cam	intelikey	what kind of settings do you have in /etc/apt/ ?
