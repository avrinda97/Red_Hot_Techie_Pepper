2011-03-08T03:53:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		hey everyone, I need some help
2011-03-08T03:53:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		my Ubuntu is corrupted
2011-03-08T03:54:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		but I cannot format it
2011-03-08T03:54:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		and it wont let me install
2011-03-08T03:55:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		I think that when I had a power cut, it corrupted the data on the hard drive
2011-03-08T03:56:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		I need a way to format the Hard Drive, I cannot enter the live CD or Enter Ubuntu
2011-03-08T03:56:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		how can I do it?
2011-03-08T03:57:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	why can't you boot the liveCD?
2011-03-08T04:00:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	hmm, can you run the test memory option?
2011-03-08T04:01:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	its doing it, it seems fine..
2011-03-08T04:02:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	There is another way I know that it is the hard drive
2011-03-08T04:03:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	is there an axe embedded in it?
2011-03-08T04:03:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	no, a power cut caused it, I think
2011-03-08T04:07:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	Could a powercut cause the Hard Drive to corrupt?
2011-03-08T04:08:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	i'd be surprised if it did
2011-03-08T04:08:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	it was in the middle of Updating when the power failed...
2011-03-08T04:15:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	you'd be surprised how little people generally try before asking in here. if i were you i'd disconnect power to the HDD and boot the livecd to see what happens, next
2011-03-08T04:15:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	so are you actually saying you have an iMac?
2011-03-08T04:17:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	what model?
2011-03-08T04:19:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	I bought it to play minecraft and games that take more RAM
2011-03-08T04:20:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	hmm, that's an awkward one. can you get into the BIOS and disable the hard disk controllers, or google for a way to boot the livecd without probing for disks?
2011-03-08T04:23:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	daftykins	Can I PM you, I think I've found something...
2011-03-08T04:24:00.000Z	daftykins	christhecoolboy	i should really sleep now. paste a link if you like
