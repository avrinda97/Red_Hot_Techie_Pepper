2009-04-21T09:10:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	at what point are you getting stuck, and what version of ubuntu do you have?
2009-04-21T09:12:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	It shows up in hardware drivers but will not work I tried some different tuts which include using ndis and madwifi(which isnt working anymore) but cant get it to work.
2009-04-21T09:13:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	what version of ubuntu?
2009-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	I downloaded driver from toshiba site and tried using wine to extract it 8.04
2009-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	can't find where wine extracted it to
2009-04-21T09:15:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	i'm not sure just yet, but sounds like it might be a permissions issue writing to a file
2009-04-21T09:16:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	any ideas how to fix?
2009-04-21T09:17:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	you'd have to know where you downloaded the driver to
2009-04-21T09:18:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	I have the file on my desktop i just dont know where it extracts to
2009-04-21T09:18:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	I believe you can pick where to extract to
2009-04-21T09:19:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	but you need read write permissions to the install directory
2009-04-21T09:19:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	its using winzip and doesnt give the option
2009-04-21T09:20:00.000Z	RandomUsr	matt_	extract on a windows box and copy to usb thumb drive?
2009-04-21T09:20:00.000Z	matt_	RandomUsr	tried that same issue extracts where it wants
