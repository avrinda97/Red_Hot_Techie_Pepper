2008-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	Indoctrine		I've had so many problems with this laptop.
2008-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	Indoctrine		It's just not very Linux friendly
2008-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	what laptop
2008-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	Acer Aspire 4710
2008-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	oh dear god
2008-09-30T08:20:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	That bad, eh?
2008-09-30T08:21:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	im having some real problems with a thinkpad.  i don't even wanna know what it'd be like on that thing
2008-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	Ohh yeah. In Gutsy, I couldn't get my wireless working, nor can I get it to work in Debian, Gentoo, etc.
2008-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	I even had problems with this thing in VISTA, which is what it was designed for.
2008-09-30T08:23:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	In other words, it's a right piece of ...
2008-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	i bet you could get it to work on gentoo if you tried really hard
2008-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	but i wouldn't want to be doing it :-)
2008-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	you a long time linux user?  lot of experience w/ gentoo?
2008-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	I sat for about an hour trying to get it to connect to my wireless... it recognised the card was there and everything
2008-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	I had access to docs and IRC the entire time I was troubleshooting it.
2008-09-30T08:26:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	It was actually my second install... the first time didn't work either, because I got the wrong arch of CD
2008-09-30T08:26:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	did you follow somethin like this? http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Acer_Aspire_5102WLMi
2008-09-30T08:27:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	No, I was trying to get my wireless going before I even started anything else
2008-09-30T08:27:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	just use a cable :P
2008-09-30T08:27:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	Also, none of that is my hardware
2008-09-30T08:28:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	Not possible without trailing a cable through the house
2008-09-30T08:28:00.000Z	hell_lord	Indoctrine	you can probably get it working with a cheap wireless card and unencrypted wifi
2008-09-30T08:29:00.000Z	Indoctrine	hell_lord	It had the drivers and everything loaded for my wireless and I had unencrypted wifi at the time and it wouldn't connect
