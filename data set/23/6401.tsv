2006-04-25T08:07:00.000Z	pip		Can I play computer games on ubuntu ? such as Football games ,or some big games
2006-04-25T08:08:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	You can play lots of simple games which come with Ubuntu, download extra ones from the repositories, emulate pretty much anythinkg and virtualise Windows games
2006-04-25T08:55:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	Sorry, didn't get last word
2006-04-25T08:56:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	OK!he can't do anything with it ,for there is no power.
2006-04-25T08:56:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	I dont know why
2006-04-25T08:57:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	Could you help me ?
2006-04-25T08:57:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	No power? As in electricity? Does it require an external plug?
2006-04-25T08:58:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	No ,he cant do with it any more because he has not any permission to do antthing
2006-04-25T08:59:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	If he uses Linux then sudo will give super user permission (careful when using it). If you know basic terminal commands then you can access files from usb easily
2006-04-25T09:00:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	After I have moved the files he wanted to his ubuntu ,he couldnt do with it ,no permission.
2006-04-25T09:00:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	You will want to know: cd /place/where/USBDrive/is (will go to the drive) ls (will list what's there) cp filename /where/you/want/it (will copy file "filename" to "/where/you/want/it")
2006-04-25T09:01:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	Use sudo "chown hisusername thefilesyouwanttoaccess"
2006-04-25T09:01:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	add a "-R" if it includes directories
2006-04-25T09:04:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	OK! I am trying..thank you
2006-04-25T09:06:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	on his computer or on mine whe I use that command ?
2006-04-25T09:06:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	On his computer, so it sets the permissions to his username on his machine
2006-04-26T09:17:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	I think GAIM is fine
2006-04-26T09:18:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	the question is should others install any programme to chat with me ?
2006-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	GAIM uses Jabber which was improved by Google. It doesn't use voice chat, but text is compatible with anyone else using GAIM or other Jabber client on any other platform
2006-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	I see! you mean that I can use Gaim to chat with others who are in my Gmail ,or ues google talk as well ,right?
2006-04-26T09:25:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	I think Google recommend GAIM on Linux (sorry, been away)
2006-04-26T09:25:00.000Z	pip	Warbo	OK! but how to use it
2006-04-26T09:25:00.000Z	Warbo	pip	Just open it up and you will be asked to put in some details. Choose Jabber for protocol, etc.
