2009-05-30T16:15:00.000Z	ToStItOs		Usb Pci cards are linux drivers required for install?
2009-05-30T16:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	nope
2009-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	well I bought one installed it and when I tried to install 8.10 the installation stalled
2009-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	and why do you think is becouse of that card ?
2009-05-30T16:17:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	when I removed the card 8.10 installed
2009-05-30T16:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	ok; i see. it was correctly placed on the slot? may have been a phisycal problem...
2009-05-30T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	i can tell that i have one of those and has given me 0 problems. usb controllers are all standar and driven by a common driver (uhci ohci or ehci)
2009-05-30T16:18:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	I inserted the card between my soundcard and my video card
2009-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	I am guessing a hardware conflict
2009-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	maybe. did you installed it back once ubuntu was installed ?
2009-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	not yet should play with it and find out where the problem is?
2009-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	well all i can say is that they just work (tm) if there is no hardware problem
2009-05-30T16:23:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	the first card I bought I was getting a resource conflict error in slot #2
2009-05-30T16:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	:|
2009-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	i am afraid i can not help further... it there are hardware conflicts your options are tweaking or updating the BIOS
2009-05-30T16:25:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	my bios maybe old this PC is from early 2000
2009-05-30T16:27:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	I hate old dino boxes
2009-05-30T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	no much you can do about it...
2009-05-30T16:28:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	let me ask you this is how can you update the bios?
2009-05-30T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	depends on the manufacturer usually with a dos floppy disk. consult the mobo homepage
2009-05-30T16:29:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	that may be a problem this is a OEM Mobo
2009-05-30T16:30:00.000Z	ToStItOs	erUSUL	i'll just see what I can do
2009-05-30T16:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	ToStItOs	then i dunno. visit the oem website support page etc. google is your friend
