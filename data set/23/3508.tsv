2008-04-03T08:43:00.000Z	MeatGrinder		why is it so difficult (impossible) to rename an NTFS usb flash drive in ubuntu?
2008-04-03T08:43:00.000Z	MeatGrinder		why can't i rename a flash drive in nautilus? It lets me select rename and type a new name but then gives me an error?
2008-04-03T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive (works for partitions as well)
2008-04-03T08:46:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	I'm there and tried that, didn't work at all
2008-04-03T08:46:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	worked for renaming my windows hdd but not my usb flash drives
2008-04-03T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	were they mounted?
2008-04-03T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	hm, I just used the vfat today on my usb stick, don't have an ntfs one
2008-04-03T08:48:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	doh! dammit i forgot it's FAT32, let me try that
2008-04-03T08:49:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	actually it doesn't say anything about vfat in that webpage, which command do I use in terminal... vfat or mlabel...I tried mlabel...didn't work
2008-04-03T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	vfat, it works on fat32
2008-04-03T08:50:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	ok i'll read up on it
2008-04-03T08:52:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	I cannot find information in the ubuntu forums about using vfat to rename usb volumes, what is the syntax?
2008-04-03T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	that page I gave you tells you exactly how to use mtools to do the job
2008-04-03T08:54:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	ok i'm confuse, I told you i used mtools and it didn't work and you said to use vfat
2008-04-03T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	did you get some error about mtools_skip_check?
2008-04-03T08:56:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	yes
2008-04-03T08:56:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	then errors about it not being mounted when it was and vice versa
2008-04-03T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	  echo mtools_skip_check=1 >> ~/.mtoolsrc , and try again
2008-04-03T08:57:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	ok lemme try that, brb
2008-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	thank you sir, working fine now
2008-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	no problem. But I am going to point out that the error message said exactly what to do ;)
2008-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	MeatGrinder	nickrud	doh, guess I need to read fine print
2008-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	MeatGrinder	sometimes the error messages are more obscure than religious texts, and sometimes they tell you what to do. We were lucky today ;)
