2009-03-20T09:28:00.000Z	MindVirus		Hi. I want to install Ubuntu on my Asus Eee 1000.
2009-03-20T09:29:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 Do it up.  :-)
2009-03-20T09:29:00.000Z	MindVirus		I put the CDROM iso onto my USB drive.
2009-03-20T09:29:00.000Z	MindVirus		But it's telling me "invalid operating system."
2009-03-20T09:29:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 What did you use to burn the ISO?
2009-03-20T09:29:00.000Z	MindVirus		System->Administration->USB whatever.
2009-03-20T09:30:00.000Z	MindVirus		Create a USB Startup Disk.
2009-03-20T09:30:00.000Z	MindVirus		I haven't tried.
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 So what's your current status?
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	TwoToneSpirit	trying to figure out whether or not I have Virus Protection enabled.
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	MindVirus		Looking for Linux CDs.
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	MindVirus		Oh just realized.
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	MindVirus		The Eee has no CD drive.
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 I have exactly zero experience installing from USB
2009-03-20T09:33:00.000Z	MindVirus		I as well.
2009-03-20T09:34:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 Well that kind of forces our hand then doesn't it.  :-)
2009-03-20T09:34:00.000Z	MindVirus	TwoToneSpirit	:)
2009-03-20T09:34:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 So, to your knowledge, is it as simple as copying the ISO to the USB drive?  Doesn't seem like that can be right.
2009-03-20T09:35:00.000Z	MindVirus		I reconfigured my BIOS settings as well.
2009-03-20T09:35:00.000Z	MindVirus		I didn't copy the Iso.
2009-03-20T09:35:00.000Z	MindVirus		*ISO.
2009-03-20T09:35:00.000Z	MindVirus		I burned the ISO.
2009-03-20T09:35:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	MindVirus	 Wonderful.  :-)
