2008-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	caligarn1037		my firefox won't let me do "copy image" with right click...has anybody hacked through this problem. or know where the solution is on the net?
2008-02-21T10:32:00.000Z	caligarn1037		copy image...
2008-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	i do not believe that this is possible using firefox
2008-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	ive done it before though
2008-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	I believe QT and KDE apps do support copying image data.  That might not get you anywhere, but i'm just tossing it out there
2008-02-21T10:37:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	for example, you may be able to right-click an image in konqueror and paste it into ... uh, some other kde app
2008-02-21T10:37:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	that's a bit tedious.
2008-02-21T10:37:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	but usr13's work around is good enough for me
2008-02-21T10:38:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	it's a long standing issue with X framework clipboards unfortunately
2008-02-21T10:39:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	really?...maybe it'll be solved in 8.;04?
2008-02-21T10:39:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	don't count on it.
2008-02-21T10:39:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	by long standing issue, i mean i don't think anyone's invented a fix for the problem yet.  sure would like someone to prove otherwise
2008-02-21T10:40:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	then again firefox may not be the best app, as it is not truly GNOME, but only ancillarily so
2008-02-21T10:40:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	GIMP supports copy/paste of images..  Maybe try copying an image or image segment in gimp and pasting to Openoffice?
2008-02-21T10:41:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	i did that....i've tried out most of the convenient work arounds...but i'd prefer the immediacy of this simple function....
2008-02-21T10:41:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	im patient about a fix though
2008-02-21T10:41:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	does it work though?
2008-02-21T10:41:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	i mean, between GIMP and Ooo
2008-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	yah, that works fine...i think it's a firefox thing
2008-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	not an ubuntu problem
2008-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	spowers	caligarn1037	you might try grabbing a firefox 3 beta and see if you can get it working there
2008-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	i was thinking about that...have you played around with FF3 yet?
2008-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	caligarn1037	spowers	im not sure how stable it is yet.
