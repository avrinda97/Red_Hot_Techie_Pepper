2008-03-01T20:38:00.000Z	soc		someone?!
2008-03-01T20:38:00.000Z	soc		pleeease!
2008-03-01T20:39:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	give your mail reader app, your mail server types (POP/IMAP) and reask your question in one line..
2008-03-01T20:39:00.000Z	soc		how can i configure evolution, so that it stores emails in seperate folder structures per account instead of cluttering "on this computer" with mails from different accounts?
2008-03-01T20:40:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	POP accounts I guess
2008-03-01T20:40:00.000Z	soc		basically i want to clean up an imap account^
2008-03-01T20:40:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	yes, that's the problem
2008-03-01T20:41:00.000Z	soc		i want to clean up an imap account, because it takes too much space o the server, so i want the old things only to be stored locally
2008-03-01T20:41:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	There is a Message filter in the Edit menue. Create differents folder and add sorting filters
2008-03-01T20:41:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	i figured out that the best way would be to set the account from imap to pop, download everything and set it back to imap
2008-03-01T20:42:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	but of course, evo thinks it is smarter than me and just throws every mail now in "stored on this pc" or what it is called in english
2008-03-01T20:43:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	are you sure this works as expected?
2008-03-01T20:43:00.000Z	soc		i basically only have one chance to get it right ...
2008-03-01T20:44:00.000Z	soc		and what will happen to the mails i send from that account?
2008-03-01T20:44:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	I only use IMAP so only think I can do is to advise you to use filters..
2008-03-01T20:45:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	i use imap, too
2008-03-01T20:46:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	what do you do, when your space on the server gets full?
2008-03-01T20:46:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	i mean, the idea to switch shortly to pop, was just ... well an idea! if there's another way i would try it that way
2008-03-01T20:47:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	emm, for my own I delete old mails on evolution, then confirm the deletion on web interface on my mailbox..
2008-03-01T20:50:00.000Z	soc	thannoy	when i right-click on a folder and select "properties" there is an option to copy things to work offline
2008-03-01T20:50:00.000Z	soc		do you think that might help
2008-03-01T20:51:00.000Z	soc		or will it delete these things too, when it figures out that the local mail is gone on the remote server?
2008-03-01T20:52:00.000Z	thannoy	soc	yes, but it does not remove it from the server and not sure mails remains when you ask to delete them. It seems just to read non-deleted mails whil offline (to verify)
