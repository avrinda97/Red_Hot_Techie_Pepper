2010-08-26T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	try some manners, you'll get further in life
2010-08-26T09:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	depends where YOU download them to
2010-08-26T09:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	browsers download to either the desktop or ~/Downloads
2010-08-26T09:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	the command I gave downloaded the file to $HOME
2010-08-26T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	mark it as executable and run it. If you are STILL on about googleearth then the whole command I agave you will make it work
2010-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	are you trying to install googleearth still?
2010-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	i gave a big command earlier to download the .bin and install it, all you had to do was copy and paste it to terinal
2010-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	jeez.....ok
2010-08-26T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	if you ask a question, in future do us all a favour and READ the replys
2010-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	cd ~; wget http://dl.google.com/earth/client/current/GoogleEarthLinux.bin; chmod +x ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin; sudo ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin; rm ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin
2010-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	copy all that and paste it to a terminal, it will then setup everything for you. I gave you the exact same command earlier
2010-08-26T09:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	use tab to complete nicks, its easier
2010-08-26T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	yes, its a community
2010-08-26T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lock_drive_	we arent douchy windows users
