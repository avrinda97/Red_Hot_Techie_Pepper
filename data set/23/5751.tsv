2007-07-18T05:21:00.000Z	martyyyr		oh ok.
2007-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	martyyyr		So, anyone? How big should I make my var and tmp partitions for my home server?
2007-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	why you need seperate partirions?
2007-07-18T05:23:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	Perhaps, but that's what I'm trying to find out. Everyone talks about seperate partitions, I'm trying to find out why.
2007-07-18T05:24:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	on a *busy* server, a separate partition better if on a separate disk can help performance
2007-07-18T05:26:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	Well, the server will be pretty busy, even tho it's a home server.
2007-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	It's going to have to download/upload a lot of files from/to clients in the network regularly (read: A LOT). And there will be a few databases on it as well.
2007-07-18T05:29:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	I see, maybe you should consider using a separate hard disk. for the size of the partition... try to estimate how much space you're going to need and multiply that 3x :)
2007-07-18T05:30:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	"for the size of the partition"? I'm not sure what you mean by this?
2007-07-18T05:30:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	nevermind.
2007-07-18T05:30:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	I simply mean "about the size etc..."
2007-07-18T05:31:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	Yeah, I should read more carefully :) I'm still lost btw...do I need var en tmp partitions or not?
2007-07-18T05:32:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	wher do you plan to "copy" those files you were talkng about?
2007-07-18T05:34:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	I'm not really sure about that yet either. (I know, I suck)  Most of those files are video files,20+ MB each. I was thinking about having them reside in the home directory.
2007-07-18T05:34:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	then don't use separate partitions for /var and so on.
2007-07-18T05:35:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	but why?
2007-07-18T05:37:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	and what if I plan on installing a webserver and database server eventually? Basicall what I'm asking is, when would I need seperate partitions for var and tmp and the likes?
2007-07-18T05:37:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	if you're not going to use /var and /tmp *a lot*, there are no reasons in my opinion to mount those directoryies in a separate partition
2007-07-18T05:38:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	That makes sense.
2007-07-18T05:39:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	and you can switch to separate partitions "on the fly" in the future if you realize you need them
2007-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	martyyyr	alesan	I can? You mean, if I'd still have free disk space by that time, right?
2007-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	alesan	martyyyr	sure, but the best then would be to use a new hard disk
