2009-05-24T11:57:00.000Z	lazyangel		how do i set the env for ruby? /usr/bin/env: ruby: No such file or directory
2009-05-24T11:58:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	what's the problem ?
2009-05-24T11:59:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	if i try to run a ruby program, i get that output
2009-05-24T12:00:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	 add /usr/bin/ruby1.9 to your ENVPATH
2009-05-24T12:01:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	(and you might want to check in your ruby src file if the path is correctly set to this path)
2009-05-24T12:01:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	(and you might want to install ruby XD apt-get install ruby1.9..... not sure about the orthograph
2009-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	but how do i add it to ENVPATH?
2009-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	do it manually : /home/you/.bashrc
2009-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	thanks
2009-05-24T12:05:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	you have to close and relaunch your tem after that
2009-05-24T12:05:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	didnt know that ENVPATH and PATH was the same thing :)
2009-05-24T12:08:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	now i get /usr/bin/env: ruby: Not a directory
2009-05-24T12:09:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	what's the first line of your ruby file ?
2009-05-24T12:10:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	#!/usr/bin/env ruby
2009-05-24T12:10:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	i think it has to be the directory for the ruby, not the executable
2009-05-24T12:11:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	didnt help
2009-05-24T12:12:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	guess the easiest is to change the first line :)
2009-05-24T12:13:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	yep buty you have to do that in every ruby file, quite annoying, there is a command to do that, like env -u or something like that, i'm trying to fin the good one
2009-05-24T12:15:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	i guess env ruby=/usr/bin/ruby1.9
2009-05-24T12:15:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	should do the trick
2009-05-24T12:16:00.000Z	dSlaM	lazyangel	but u have to have install ruby 1.9 first
2009-05-24T12:18:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	it didnt, but this worked: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.9 /usr/bin/ruby
2009-05-24T12:19:00.000Z	lazyangel	dSlaM	thanks for helping me :)
