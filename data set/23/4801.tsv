2009-01-06T09:45:00.000Z	hobo		how come i have no sound
2009-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	hobo		i got xchat running, but no sound : (
2009-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	hobo		can anyone tell me how i'd know if my sound was installed correctly? other than that it would play sounds when i try... ?
2009-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	essial	hobo	do you have an audigy card?
2009-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	hobo	essial	no a realtek ac97
2009-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	essial	hobo	I know on my card personally, I had to go to the "switches" and uncheck the digital out option to get sound... but generally, if you have a mixer, its detecting your soundcard
2009-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	hobo	essial	i get no sound, apparently, i thought though, it was detected and set up automatically during install of ubuntu,
2009-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	essial	hobo	is there a mixer near the clock?
2009-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	hobo	essial	yes there is
2009-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	essial	hobo	double-click it, and tell me if it shows anything
2009-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	essial	hobo	note if it has your soundcard listed, and if there is a dropdown list of multiple sound cards or not
2009-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	hobo	essial	yes. it shows PCM-2 on the right side, and on the left side it shows speaker both i have maxed with no avail
2009-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	essial	hobo	is there a switches tab? And if so, go there and tell me if theres an option related to "Analog/Digital Output Jack" or the like
2009-01-06T09:53:00.000Z	hobo	essial	i see FILE EDIT HELP, and then the PCM and speaker vol controls are in a playback tab, next to that is recording tab, that is all.
2009-01-06T09:53:00.000Z	essial	hobo	what device is the mixer saying its using
2009-01-06T09:54:00.000Z	hobo	essial	realtek ALC250 rev 2 (OSS Mixer)
2009-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	essial	hobo	go to system->preferences->sound
2009-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	hobo	essial	there
2009-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	essial	hobo	and select your sound card on each, try selecting ones with ALSA instead of OSS if possible
2009-01-06T09:57:00.000Z	hobo	essial	so which one would i choose to test? theres via 8237 twice, then alsa mixer, oss mixer, and pulse sound
2009-01-06T09:58:00.000Z	essial	hobo	you can select each one and press test, it should emit a rather annoying tone :)
2009-01-06T10:01:00.000Z	essial	hobo	typically if it doesn't work it will give you an error. If it says its playing but you hear nothing do this: Go back to the mixer, click "Preferences", and mark anything categorized as "switches" or "options", as well as anything with "PCM" or "Wave" in it
2009-01-06T10:05:00.000Z	hobo	essial	yeah it says its playing and i cant hear anything
