2012-05-02T21:48:00.000Z	qEssence		Anyone knows how to force xrdp ro use gnome-shell? If i enter from windows to ubuntu, automatically logs into Unity Without asking what WM to use.
2012-05-02T21:49:00.000Z	qEssence		Or Anyone can recommend an Remote desktop server wich allows me to select the WM?
2012-05-02T21:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding	qEssence	try logging in using xdmcp
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	qEssence	tensorpudding	do you mean xrdp?
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		no?
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		what's xrdp?
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		is that like windows RDP for X?
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		that's not the same thing
2012-05-02T21:52:00.000Z	qEssence	tensorpudding	A remote desktop server for ubuntu.
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding	qEssence	you can configure remote login using XDMCP still, I think
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		!es | ignacio
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	qEssence	tensorpudding	Well thanks, i'll give a try.
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		!xdmcp
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		oh, that's not it
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		what the heck
2012-05-02T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		who would put a TLDP link on here
2012-05-02T21:54:00.000Z	tensorpudding		those things are amazingly out-of-date
2012-05-02T21:54:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i can't remember how you setup xdmcp on ubuntu though
2012-05-02T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i know that xdmcp is still supported in debian, since that's what i'm using as my server
2012-05-02T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i'd be most disappointed if they removed that functionality from gdm 3
2012-05-02T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding		what about lightdm
2012-05-02T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i'm asking on qEssence's behalf
2012-05-02T21:57:00.000Z	qEssence	tensorpudding	you got more attention in five minutes than I in the whole day :P
