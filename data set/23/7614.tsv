2005-06-12T09:07:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	thank you for the link
2005-06-12T09:15:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Good idea. :)
2005-06-12T09:16:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Python teaches you the one BEST way to accomplish a task. That mindset will help you in all other programming languages, even C++ if you decide to learn it.
2005-06-12T09:16:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Plus, there are libraries like Pygame and PyOpenGL for game creation which you might be interested in.
2005-06-12T09:17:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	bwlang, dooglus , shanon, thank you
2005-06-12T09:17:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	No problem. I wish you the best of luck in your programming times! :)
2005-06-12T09:18:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	thank you, however looking at the Pygame site... the games didnt really look modern.. so i dunno, didnt make me too excited
2005-06-12T09:19:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Well, Pygame is more oriented for 2D gaming. Take a look at PyOGRE and PyOpenGL for modern stuff.
2005-06-12T09:20:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	oh ok awesome, thank you
2005-06-12T09:20:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	If you'd like to spend lots and lots of time working with memory addressing + allocation as well as pointers and type declaration of objects which just might make your head spin, which is what tsume is recommending you to do, do C++.
2005-06-12T09:21:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	If you'd like to learn the best methods of object-oriented programming, and have a good time while programming and learning all of the concepts, choose Python.
2005-06-12T09:21:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	i dont know what any of that means lol
2005-06-12T09:21:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Exactly. That's why you want to start off with Python. :)
2005-06-12T09:21:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	i hope python will be fun, but it does sound like a good place to start
2005-06-12T09:23:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Yes.
2005-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	ok thank you (ones better than flash?)
2005-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	With PyOpenGL, you sure will :)
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	ok, so flash cant do anything game wise that python cant?
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Besides running on a web browser, no.
2005-06-12T09:27:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Yep.
2005-06-12T09:33:00.000Z	Chislon	Quest-Master	may i pm you?
2005-06-12T09:33:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Chislon	Sure!
