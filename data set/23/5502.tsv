2006-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	Tup4c		okei all ya .How do i remove hda1 just delete it ? .cause i cant with my .it says you dont have permission to do this .and i do then chmod 500 hda1 but steel not working .
2006-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	Tup4c		what could be wrong :x
2006-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	what do you mean "remove hda1"? destroy the partition?
2006-11-16T09:58:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	either go into it as root, or mount it with user permissions
2006-11-16T10:00:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	that makes no sense. i'm not giving you a command that deletes a hard drive partition just because you can't read from it.
2006-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	what do you think you'll obtain by wiping your Windows partition?
2006-11-16T10:35:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	you don't have multiverse enabled
2006-11-16T10:39:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	i can't help you with Synaptic because i don't have it. put, please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2006-11-16T10:41:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	you can ask things to the bot in a private query with it
2006-11-16T10:42:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	that is a Breezy that was upgraded to Dapper later, isn't it?
2006-11-16T10:45:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	try changing it like this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32134/
2006-11-16T10:45:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	and then issue a "sudo apt-get update"
2006-11-16T11:02:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	sorry, try this one http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32136/
2006-11-16T11:12:00.000Z	Tup4c	LjL	i have updated the nvidia card
2006-11-16T11:12:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	now just install the msttcorefonts package
2006-11-16T11:12:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	yes that was sent by mistake
2006-11-16T11:13:00.000Z	Tup4c	LjL	maybe ???? restart X ? after the update .cause it is not workin .
2006-11-16T11:14:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	no
2006-11-16T11:14:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	same problem as in "Package not found"?
2006-11-16T11:16:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	ouch, i also forgot to add dapper-updates for universe and multiverse... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32139/  (but that's not the reason why msttcorefonts isn't working)
2006-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	hm, please pastebin the full output of it
2006-11-16T11:21:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	aagh i must be kind of stoned today. hold on
2006-11-16T11:22:00.000Z	LjL	Tup4c	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32144/ <- hopefully...
