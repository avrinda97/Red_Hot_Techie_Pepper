2008-07-23T03:08:00.000Z	wlievens		unfortunately I'm a horrible newbie at linux administration
2008-07-23T03:08:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	we all were at once
2008-07-23T03:09:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	yeah, it's just that this "learn from banging your head against the wall" process is bad for headaches
2008-07-23T03:09:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	lol , your should try dsome googleing processes instead
2008-07-23T03:09:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	in fact I have
2008-07-23T03:10:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	lol , thought the head banging was getting you farther?
2008-07-23T03:10:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	barely :)
2008-07-23T03:10:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	what are you trying to do?
2008-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	it's version hell all over with apache
2008-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	you lost me  o.0
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	so your just trying to get apache 2.2?
2008-07-23T03:13:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	I have apache 2.2 installed, but it won't start because the mod_dav_svn module is built for the wrong platform
2008-07-23T03:13:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	better off just upgrading like flannel said
2008-07-23T03:14:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	i havent either   :D
2008-07-23T03:15:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	probably a good idea
2008-07-23T03:17:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	you could just reinstall the whole OS like i did if you dont have anything you need on your comp
2008-07-23T03:17:00.000Z	wlievens	chriswr	can I really do that on a VPS?
2008-07-23T03:17:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	vps?
2008-07-23T03:18:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	oh well i have no idea about that stuff
2008-07-23T03:18:00.000Z	chriswr	wlievens	better just to ignore reinstalling lol , cause i would be afraid too
