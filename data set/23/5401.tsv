2008-01-02T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	tons on https://help.ubuntu.com mostly around postfix
2008-01-02T20:23:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	I should go for postfix?
2008-01-02T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	keep in mind that if your on a dsl/cable line you will most likley be black listed by a lot of mail servers
2008-01-02T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	your call what you go for
2008-01-02T20:23:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	No ot is for a dedicated server I just rented
2008-01-02T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	no problem then, just make sure your not blacklisted before starting and make sure you set it up safley so that you don't get blacklisted for being a spam host
2008-01-02T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	some isp's can / will sue you if you run a mail server on their network that acts as a spam host
2008-01-02T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	it can be done. I've seen it from usa to europe. I'm in europe
2008-01-02T20:26:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	mm well anyways im just using it for 1 domain... Im gonna close it :)
2008-01-02T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	close it ?
2008-01-02T20:26:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	well, not allow SMTP - just some pop3 boxes
2008-01-02T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	that sounds excellent.
2008-01-02T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	you should be fine on that config
2008-01-02T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	webmin - don't use it, webmail squirrelmail, horde, squaremail, sqwebmail
2008-01-07T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	don't make a mistake
2008-01-07T21:47:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	ehrm any practical tips for not doing so?
2008-01-07T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	well you have no reason to firewall ssh as thats your admin controll so as long as you don't mess with that you'll be fine
2008-01-07T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	keep away from deny all rules
2008-01-07T21:48:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	I should firewall the machine right? just keep ports 22, 80, 25 and such open?
2008-01-19T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	robdeman	the package or the actual cetificate
2008-01-19T00:50:00.000Z	robdeman	ikonia	the package to generate a certificate
