2007-08-28T13:22:00.000Z	sahil		should'nt this command 'sudo chmod 755 -R '/usr/share/fonts/truetype' change the permissions for this folder so that i can read and write
2007-08-28T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	no.  6 is rw 5 is rx.  But, you probably don't want to recursively chmod it anyway.  Use sudo to modify system files
2007-08-28T13:23:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	im  not sure i understand
2007-08-28T13:24:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	i need permissions to write to that directory, and it says that i don't have the permissions
2007-08-28T13:24:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	Right, use sudo to do the writing/whatevder
2007-08-28T13:24:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	i want to just drag and drop stuff in there
2007-08-28T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	alright, then use sudo (for graphical programs, gksu) to open nautilus: alt-f2, `gksu nautilus` then do it (and close that window AS SOON AS you're done)
2007-08-28T13:27:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	isn't there a way to just change the permission on the entire folder so i can just open it up and put stuff into it whenever i want by just dragging and dropping
2007-08-28T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	you can.  But that's the wrong way (and a very dangerous way) to do it.
2007-08-28T13:28:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	why is it dangerous, or wrong. I am the only person who uses this laptop
2007-08-28T13:29:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	plus it looks easier when non-linux people do it. Do you know how to do it?
2007-08-28T13:30:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	Linux is not windows.  Linux is inheritly more secure precisely because regular users can't modify system directories.
2007-08-28T13:30:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	i would like to modify the fonts directory, i think its safe can you tell me how to do it?
2007-08-28T13:31:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	I already told you.  5 is rx, 6 is rw.  But again, you really don't want to do it that way.
2007-08-28T13:32:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	im sorry i still don't quite get what you want me to do. do you want me to enter "sudo chmod 766 'usr/share/fonts/'
2007-08-28T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	No, I don't want you to do that.  But your previous command was correct except for the fact that you were using 5 (r-x) instead of 6 (rw-)
2007-08-28T13:35:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	can you tell me what the command is, i don't want to mess up anything
2007-08-28T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	If you don't want to mess anything up, don't chmod it.  use `gksu nautilus` to drag and drop
2007-08-28T13:36:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	i meant that i didn't want to mess up the chmod command, but i do want to chmod it, i understand what ur saying, but it is a big inconvience
2007-08-28T13:38:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	can you tell me the correct command to type?
2007-08-28T13:38:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil	You had it right in your original command: chmod -R 766 /path/to/whatever
2007-08-28T13:39:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	thank you. I am testing it now, will let you know if it works
2007-08-28T13:40:00.000Z	sahil	Flannel	that did not work, and in fact it changed all the icons in that folder and did not allow me to access them
