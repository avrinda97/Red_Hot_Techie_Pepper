2008-03-23T02:13:00.000Z	liquid1033		can anyone help me with some keycode trouble?
2008-03-23T02:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	are you trying to find keycodes?
2008-03-23T02:14:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	i have a remote and some keys have more than one keycode
2008-03-23T02:15:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	i'm looking for a config to change them to only one keycode
2008-03-23T02:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	I don't know if it will work for a remote but I used evtest to find keycodes for a multimedia keyboard
2008-03-23T02:18:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	i can't find it, what package is it?
2008-03-23T02:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	evtest
2008-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	sorry  it's part of another package called dvb-utils
2008-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	just found it.. thnx
2008-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	similar to xev
2008-03-23T02:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	yes.. however xev couldn't see the codes from the keyboard I was trying to use  evtest did.
2008-03-23T02:24:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	i think the problem isn't the assignment but that 3 keys are "activated" at the same time
2008-03-23T02:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	is it like a shift keystroke function?
2008-03-23T02:25:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	yes
2008-03-23T02:25:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	control_l shift_l and d
2008-03-23T02:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	same issue on my keyboard.. it had an Fn button.. push one button individually at a time to find the scan code for each one. then do the combo and compare the output. if you're lucky you'll discover a new number. that will typically be it.. also hitting the combo then type dmesg in a terminal SOMETIME will reveal it.
2008-03-23T02:28:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	i try
2008-03-23T02:32:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	no didn't wokr
2008-03-23T02:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	sorry,, I'm out of ideas.
2008-03-23T02:34:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	is there any file, in which a key can be assigned to a couple of keycodes
2008-03-23T02:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	liquid1033	I'm not sure.. I just started diving into this type of thing in the last couple of days... it's frustrating!
2008-03-23T02:36:00.000Z	liquid1033	Scunizi	yes it is ;)
