2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	Guest65941		My gnome desktop is missing the menu bars at the top and bottom when I started my computer today. Last night I deleted quite a lot from the computer so I deleted something I shouldn't. Is there an easy way to reinstate??
2008-10-09T01:38:00.000Z	Guest65941		Is there any way I can divide my computer to keep all files etc., separate from programs?
2008-10-09T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	install your home folder on a separate partition
2008-10-09T01:39:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	does this mean I have to reinstall the programs to do that
2008-10-09T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	nope.. you can move it without reinstalling.. but it takes a little work and some planning
2008-10-09T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	not really.. but you'll have to use it to create a new partition
2008-10-09T01:41:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	I think I need to reinstall the Ubuntu CD again to reprogram as I am having problem with gnome. How would I start separating beforehand so I dont lose the folders
2008-10-09T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	just create a partition and copy your home folder to it
2008-10-09T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	nb!, copy!.. not move
2008-10-09T01:42:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	you make it sound so easy. How do I start partitioning?
2008-10-09T01:43:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	partitioning is done using gparted.. or system, administration, partition editor
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	so if I go to terminal (which I can still do without my menu bars) what do I type in?
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	you need to create a partition that's big enough for your files.. copy everything to it.. I'm not really sure how to keep the installer from killing it but there ought to be a way.. please do a backup first though
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	I cant get into sysem, administration etc., as I have no menu bars
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	to start the partition editor? gksudo gparted
2008-10-09T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	if that doesn't work you have to install it first.. sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-10-09T01:45:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	could I just try terminal and type in gksudo gparted
2008-10-09T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	sure.
2008-10-09T01:45:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	will it then show me thru what to do
2008-10-09T01:46:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	once I have created a new partition what do I do
2008-10-09T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	you create a partition, format it (use ext3), then copy the files from your home to that new partition
2008-10-09T01:47:00.000Z	Guest65941	Slart	can I send you a private message plse?
2008-10-09T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	Guest65941	sure
