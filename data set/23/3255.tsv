2008-06-04T09:02:00.000Z	Jburrke		Can anyone help me out? How do I mount an iso in ubuntu so a program will recognize it as if I had a disk in?
2008-06-04T09:02:00.000Z	Jburrke		I tried mounting it to media/iso but the program still asks for me to insert the disk
2008-06-04T09:03:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	there are a couple options, easiest might be to use gmountiso: sudo apt-get install gmountiso
2008-06-04T09:03:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	thanks, I'll give it a shot
2008-06-04T09:04:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	thanks, is there a way I could do this without this program? Just curious, cuz when I started this and I was getting this error I wasn't connected to the net, so no way to get any other program
2008-06-04T09:06:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	yep, look at the ubottu answer for !iso
2008-06-04T09:06:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint>
2008-06-04T09:06:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	I did that, but the program kept asking for me to insert the disk.. It was like it was mounting only so I could access the info on the iso, but not as a virtual drive
2008-06-04T09:07:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	Btw, how do I work this program.. Lol
2008-06-04T09:07:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	hmm that is strange, never had any problems, you might want to post in forums and include more info about the iso
2008-06-04T09:08:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	have you tried the sudo mount method with other .iso files?
2008-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	Gmountiso shows up in System Tools, it's pretty straightforward :)
2008-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	hmm i thought this one was not working properly?
2008-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	It's not the iso that's the problem.. I guess I'll start with the beginning..
2008-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	I installed a game with this iso.. it worked fine until I tried to run the game, where it then asked for the disk to be inserted.. Now I'm trying to figure out how to mount the iso in some kind of a virtual disk form
2008-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	ah ok, what's the game? probably you are running into their copy protection scheme :)
2008-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	Probably.. It's gta vice city, running through wine
2008-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	But on the readme it says that the game runs fine so long as you keep the disk in / keep the iso mounted
2008-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	Actually it's the same iso I used on windows, and the game ran perfectly if I kept the iso mounted with daemon - tools
2008-06-04T09:13:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	that is because daemon-tools has special emulation options designed to bypass the ISO copy protections :)
2008-06-04T09:13:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	Is there no way to do that on ubuntu?
2008-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	Jburrke	bring3	Will this work? http://megagames.com/cgi/download/download.cgi?action=search&category=cracks&search=GRAND.THEFT.AUTO.VICE.CITY.V1.0.ENG.GIMPSRUS.NOCD.ZIP
2008-06-04T09:18:00.000Z	bring3	Jburrke	you might be interested in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=631185 , what you need is Wine to properly support SecuROM v4 with mounted ISOs
