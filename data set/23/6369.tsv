2006-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	well, maybe not, but universe is not very far from debian unstable, I think (unless I'm mistaken) and plenty of people use it daily
2006-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	debian binaries will screw up system
2006-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	debian and ubuntu use different package names/versions
2006-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	Where/what do the universe packages come from? Are those specially made for ubuntu as well? By whom?
2006-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	yes motu makes those
2006-06-22T13:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	muto handles universe and multiverse
2006-06-22T13:10:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	Sorry, I was born acronym blind... muto?
2006-06-22T13:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	I'd still be surprised if an average Debian package would break an average ubuntu system. I'd like to think Ubuntu is not quite that fragile.
2006-06-22T13:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	the packages are different in what they depend on
2006-06-22T13:14:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	Yes, I know, especially if one compares to sarge.
2006-06-22T13:15:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	but usually that just results in stuff not installing. Unless one is  foolhardy enough to add slinky repo to their sources.list and hope for the best (I could see things breaking then)
2006-06-22T13:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	i dont know how foolish people can be safer to not recommend it
2006-07-01T07:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Lynoure	there are many way to be involved in Ubuntu. thats  a good start
2006-07-01T07:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	gnomefreak	ok, what's a good way to continue? :)
