2008-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	drinkymilk		i have been working with cesium in #oss for this for a while but he had to split...
2008-12-02T04:44:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	that doesn't explain your problem. What's going on?
2008-12-02T04:46:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	it's not an issue of setting the application to use oss instead of alsa or pulse?
2008-12-02T04:47:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	what does it show under System -> Preferences -> Sound?
2008-12-02T04:52:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	just curious though, why not just use PulseAudio? Also, happen to have a little commandline tool called mpg123?
2008-12-02T04:53:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	if you have mpg123 and an mp3 somewhere on your disk, try to play it via the command line with 'mpg123 <filename>'
2008-12-02T04:55:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	anything?
2008-12-02T04:56:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	what does? ie. what's giving that as output?
2008-12-02T04:58:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	encapsulate the filename with single quotes, should work fine then
2008-12-02T04:58:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	ie.   user@host: ~$ mpg123 'your filename with spaces.mp3'
2008-12-02T05:00:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	if you're still here, probably not though, did you hear anything?
2008-12-02T05:01:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	speakers turned on? :)
2008-12-02T05:01:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	and IndyGunFreak makes a good point
2008-12-02T05:03:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	do you have a /dev/audio or /dev/dsp?
2008-12-02T05:05:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	it seems from that that it cannot find the correct card. do you have a /dev/dsp or /dev/audio ?
2008-12-02T05:06:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	"ls /dev/audio" and/or "ls /dev/dsp"
2008-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	see if that gives any output?
2008-12-02T05:08:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	run the following:   mpg123 -a /dev/dsp '/data/Music/A/alaska/01-untitled#1.mp3'
2008-12-02T05:10:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	did you run the exact string I gave you?
2008-12-02T05:10:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	if so, paste the output again
2008-12-02T05:11:00.000Z	ryushe	drinkymilk	what kind of card is it?
