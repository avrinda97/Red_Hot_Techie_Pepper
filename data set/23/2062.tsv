2009-07-16T19:10:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	i don't have it installed. is it in the repos?
2009-07-16T19:13:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	ok. MAN, i hate that. I run x11vnc on the computer I am doing the makedvd command on and sometimes when I am in Terminal Server Client (jaunty) connected using VNC protocol, i'll be entering a command in the terminal and it's like a key gets stuck and it'll just keep entering letters. this last time it was an 'e'. no matter what I can't stop the machine from entering an 'e'. it'll do it in a new terminal if I open one. the only wa
2009-07-16T19:15:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	ok, back at hand. the machine has restarted. so just install midnight commander from the repos?

2009-07-16T19:45:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	myine=mine
2009-07-16T19:47:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	i wonder how makedvd works? is it trying to save tmp files to that smb share and that's what's causing the io error?
2009-07-16T19:47:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	maybe i dont know makedvd
2009-07-16T19:47:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	i m afk now
2009-07-16T19:50:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	check read and write privilidges with ur smb mnt when accessing as non rott, thats how u run makedvd, right?
2009-07-16T19:51:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	now really afk
2009-07-16T19:52:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	the permissions on the /mnt/ directory are 777 and it owned by root. that's where I mounted the smb share. I have already confirmed I can mkdir and touch a file on the folder.
2009-07-16T19:52:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	ok
2009-07-16T19:52:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	so no idea after all
2009-07-16T19:53:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	ok. i'll just copy the folders over locally and then try to run makedvd again.

2009-07-16T19:58:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	i didn't realize nautilus is showing me the speed also. it's showing 6.1 MB/sec as I am transferring the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders and storing them locally.
2009-07-16T19:58:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	thats why i said "e.g. mc" ;)
2009-07-16T19:59:00.000Z	jduser	mazda01	i am one of those mc freaks, u must know
2009-07-16T19:59:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	it's no big deal. mc is like vim for me, it can do so much but I don't feel like taking the time to learn it.
2009-07-16T19:59:00.000Z	mazda01	jduser	everybody has their preferences.
