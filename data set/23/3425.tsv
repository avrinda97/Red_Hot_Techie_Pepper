2008-04-25T20:08:00.000Z	RoiG		i get this error when im trying to upgrade from the CD not the servers..
2008-04-25T20:09:00.000Z	amenado		RoiG-> how do you know its getting the update from the CD and not remotely? how did you verify this?
2008-04-25T20:09:00.000Z	amenado		CaptainMorgan-> alright..keep the person on the other end happy, send em cookies and pizza..hehe
2008-04-25T20:09:00.000Z	RoiG	amenado	-> because when updating from the CD you can select if install the updated packets from internet or use the ones from CD?
2008-04-25T20:10:00.000Z	amenado		RoiG-> how do you verify this? did you look at the scripts on what it does?
2008-04-25T20:11:00.000Z	RoiG	amenado	-> i unplugged my wired ethernet connection and its the same. its not the servers its a problem with something of the update.
2008-04-25T20:11:00.000Z	amenado		RoiG-> and if it finds the ones on the cd is older ..do you know if it attempts to retrieve from the archive?
2008-04-25T20:12:00.000Z	amenado		RoiG-> i asked you, did you have a chance to look at the scripts in how it upgrades? maybe it does look to the net too if it cant resolve ?
2008-04-25T20:12:00.000Z	RoiG	amenado	-> wait
