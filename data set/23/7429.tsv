2009-06-18T11:12:00.000Z	bingo		i am using ubuntu 8.04
2009-06-18T11:13:00.000Z	bingo		i want to stop my iptables service but i didnt find /etc/init.d/iptables there
2009-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	bingo		how?
2009-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	iptables is a tool, not a service.
2009-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	bingo		nomand777: and if i again want to start its service ?
2009-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	bingo	rob_p	tool yes tool for firewall ?
2009-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	bingo		actualy i am new so dont konw very well..
2009-06-18T11:16:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	Precisely.  It's a tool used in the configuration of the kernel packet filtering.
2009-06-18T11:16:00.000Z	bingo		rob_P: how is it not service ?
2009-06-18T11:16:00.000Z	bingo		nomand777: sudo iptables -F ok .. now i again want to start iptables then ?
2009-06-18T11:17:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	A service implies a process that runs... iptables is not, "running" but gets called during the initial configuration of the kernel packet filtering mechanism.
2009-06-18T11:17:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	Once iptables establishes the ruleset, it is not, "running."  Understand?
2009-06-18T11:18:00.000Z	bingo		rob_P: ok, so its mean it is not daemon, even in cEntos ?
2009-06-18T11:18:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	Yes.  Even in CentOS.
2009-06-18T11:18:00.000Z	bingo		lsarnes: ok..
2009-06-18T11:19:00.000Z	bingo		rob_P: $sudo iptables -L ok.. for flushing rules.. then $sudo iptables-save for again setup rules or in odl working condiition ?
2009-06-18T11:20:00.000Z	bingo		rob_P: but in centos when we do #service iptables stop then it got stop.. then no kernel etc ?
2009-06-18T11:20:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	I'm not familiar with iptables-save.
2009-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	That's because they happen to call it iptables even though it differs from the utility that is iptables.  Thank them for the confusion!
2009-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	They really should have called it something else.
2009-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	bingo		i see...
2009-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	rob_p	bingo	...like an iptables configurator or whatever...
