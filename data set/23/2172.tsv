2010-10-09T20:39:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	how can i copy amr files from my phone in ubuntu 10.04?
2010-10-09T20:40:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	Is your phone MSC or MTP ?
2010-10-09T20:42:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	i donno, all i know is that mp3 files and other tipe of files i can copy from my phone to pc but amr gives an error -6 unsupported
2010-10-09T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	What is an amr file?
2010-10-09T20:42:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	a sound file
2010-10-09T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	You can view the files on your phone as if it were a usb jump drive I presume?  Then it's MSC (media storage controller)
2010-10-09T20:43:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	yes, usb
2010-10-09T20:43:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	Go in there, change the extension (to .mine or something, it's arbitrary) and then try to move them.  Are they in a different folder or something than then .mp3 ?
2010-10-09T20:43:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	i tried that, to change the extension, but i cannot change it
2010-10-09T20:44:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	Try moving the files as root. gksu nautilus
2010-10-09T20:45:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	in gksu nautilus it doesn't show me the phone
2010-10-09T20:45:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	You just have to find it.  Go to /media
2010-10-09T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	The phones connected I presume
2010-10-09T20:46:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	it only shows my HDD, i went there at media, only floppy and HDD are shown
2010-10-09T20:47:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	still i see the phone icons on the desktop so the phone is connected
2010-10-09T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	open a normal nautilus window and go to the phone.  Press the up button once and see what folder you're in.  Go to that same folder with root nautilus.
2010-10-09T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	I GUARANTEE that root nautilus can get to the phone.  We just have to find it.
2010-10-09T20:48:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	u mean something like this? gphoto2://[usb:002,004]/
2010-10-09T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	I don't understand that output.  Go up again and again.  Eventually you will be in a folder.
2010-10-09T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	How are you viewing the files on the phone?
2010-10-09T20:50:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	they show in normal nautilus like separate partitions mounted on the desktop
2010-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	edbian	ovy	Usually when something is mounted on the desktop it's secretly mounted in folders in /media and symlinked to the desktop.  Can you give me a screenshot?
2010-10-09T20:53:00.000Z	ovy	edbian	it would be easyer to fix the problem in teamviewer (rather than to send photos) i give u my id and passw in private
