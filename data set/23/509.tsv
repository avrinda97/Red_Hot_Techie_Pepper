2011-07-13T14:14:00.000Z	Kaoloi		I'm dual booting windows vista and ubuntu 11.04. But now, i want to make the change. How to install ubuntu 11.04 and format the rest of the hard disk? (I installed it with wubi)
2011-07-13T14:14:00.000Z	Kaoloi		i'm currently burning a CD with ubuntu, hoping that there will be an option when i launch it to format everything else

2011-07-13T14:16:00.000Z	Kaoloi		anyone please?
2011-07-13T14:17:00.000Z	Kaoloi		ive backed up all my important data Dr_Willis
2011-07-13T14:18:00.000Z	Kaoloi		will it delete my vista and ubuntu partition?
2011-07-13T14:18:00.000Z	Kaoloi		i dont mind losing my data on ubuntu
2011-07-13T14:19:00.000Z	Kaoloi		ahh.. but it gave me a little 13gb partition for ubuntu and the rest for vista
2011-07-13T14:20:00.000Z	Kaoloi		i'm sorry i'm very new to this. i just launched the installer and followed the instructions
2011-07-13T14:20:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	so as Dr_Willis said, you don't have a full ubuntu partition
2011-07-13T14:21:00.000Z	Kaoloi	arfbtwn	 ok, so now if I want to use ubuntu only. I insert my install CD and restart my laptop. follow the instructions and look for an option where i have 'install ubuntu and format the entire drive'?
2011-07-13T14:21:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	bingo ;)
2011-07-13T14:22:00.000Z	Kaoloi	arfbtwn	and this will erase my current data on ubuntu right?
2011-07-13T14:23:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	The option actually says erase entire disk, so, yes. Do you want to backup your home dir first?
2011-07-13T14:23:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	tar -jcvf homebackup.tar.bz2 $HOME from ubuntu should do it
2011-07-13T14:24:00.000Z	Kaoloi	arfbtwn	when i reinstall ubuntu i'll be able to use that back up? I just need the settings and app i've downloaded...
2011-07-13T14:25:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	where ever you say homebackup.tar.bz2 will be. Then you can put that anywhere
2011-07-13T14:27:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	don't worry, it's probably natty but that doesn't really matter too much
2011-07-13T14:33:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	That command will only backup your settings
2011-07-13T14:33:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	you'll still need to re-install the programs fresh
2011-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	Once you've reinstalled, you unzip with tar -jxvf homebackup.tar.bz2 but execute from /home
2011-07-13T14:36:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	If anything goes wrong, keep a hold of that file ;)
2011-07-13T14:37:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Kaoloi	hacking_u talks sense!
