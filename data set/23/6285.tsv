2006-05-18T11:12:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	how so?
2006-05-18T11:14:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	it says uncompressing linux and then right below it it says invalid compressed format
2006-05-18T11:14:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	have you tried a different CD?
2006-05-18T11:15:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	i would try a different CD if its shipit CDs, if it is burned check the md5sum then if it matches re-burn
2006-05-18T11:15:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	mirrors matter not
2006-05-18T11:18:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	yes?
2006-05-18T11:18:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	why?
2006-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	what were you sayingbefore
2006-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	if you burnered the cd check the md5sum to make sure it isnt corrupt
2006-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	how do I check that
2006-05-18T11:20:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	what OS are you running atm?
2006-05-18T11:21:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	do a google search for "Windows md5"
2006-05-18T11:21:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	ok
2006-05-18T11:22:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	once you get it you will need to match it with the Ubuntu md5, which should be downloaded at the same place you got the iso
2006-05-18T11:23:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	it is possible yess
2006-05-18T11:23:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	idk if windows can talk to Ubuntu but i do know Ubuntu can talk to Windows
2006-05-18T11:34:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	it said the checksums are the same
2006-05-18T11:36:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	ok now try burning again at a REAL slow speed
2006-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	I'll burn it at the slowest speed with no interruptions and report back
2006-05-18T13:37:00.000Z	Falluccer	hybrid	I reburned it and it worked
2006-05-18T13:37:00.000Z	hybrid	Falluccer	YAY!
