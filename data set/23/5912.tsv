2006-08-03T13:48:00.000Z	roe		anyone know how to disable iptables, I just wanna make sure that iptables is infact causing my problem
2006-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	django_	roe	 what does iptables -L give you?
2006-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	django_	roe	all ACCEPT?
2006-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	roe	django_	yup all 3 tables
2006-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	django_	roe	then it likely isn't your problem
2006-08-03T13:50:00.000Z	django_	roe	you could unload the module if you really wanted to be sure
2006-08-03T13:50:00.000Z	roe	django_	wanna take a stab at what my problem could be
2006-08-03T13:50:00.000Z	django_	roe	what is the problem?
2006-08-03T13:51:00.000Z	roe	django_	fresh install of ubuntu-server, bind9 is setup and works locally, dhcp is setup and works on the the network, the server can ping the other computers on the network but the other computers can't ping it
2006-08-03T13:51:00.000Z	django_	roe	if it's connection from two machines, ping might sort out if their is connectivity
2006-08-03T13:51:00.000Z	django_	roe	oh you're on it :) ...roe do you know how to use tcpdump?
2006-08-03T13:52:00.000Z	django_	roe	if you can use tcpdump on the server machine, you can see what's happening to the packets
2006-08-03T13:53:00.000Z	roe	django_	I will investigate
2006-08-03T14:01:00.000Z	roe	django_	AAA ok I have some info... the pinging computer returns destination host unreachable, the tcpdump reports arp who-has <sever-ip> tell <pinging-IP>
2006-08-03T14:03:00.000Z	django_	roe	so your routing is wrong
2006-08-03T14:04:00.000Z	django_	roe	how are these computers connected?
2006-08-03T14:05:00.000Z	django_	roe	yeah what about 'netstat -r'?
2006-08-03T14:08:00.000Z	django_	roe	>>
2006-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	django_	roe	ah so it's bind
2006-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	django_	roe	have you used the bind testing utilities?
2006-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	roe	django_	but pinging I wasn't using host names... straight IPS
2006-08-03T14:16:00.000Z	django_	roe	of course, sorry
2006-08-03T14:16:00.000Z	roe	django_	bind is happy locally everything resolves correctly
