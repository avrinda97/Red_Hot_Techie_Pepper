2010-10-20T08:07:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	no
2010-10-20T08:07:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	Cool
2010-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	I don't know what rock you've been under, but microsoft disagrees with that statement
2010-10-25T10:55:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	windows 7 is microsoft's new thing, and I had to reinstall it /three times today/ while ubuntu functioned perfectly
2010-10-25T10:55:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	Compared to ubuntu its bug free
2010-10-25T10:55:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	I don't think you read this...
2010-10-25T11:02:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	Oh ok
2010-10-25T10:56:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	you got lucky with windows and unlucky with ubuntu. go back to using windows and shut up.
2010-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	if you want help fixing your problems, ASK. normally we're very nice here, but some of us can get mean when annoyed by people who can't be nice too.
2010-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	I believe I just did.  I asked for help finding drivers for my printer
2010-10-25T11:02:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	I hit enter about when I saw that.
2010-10-25T11:03:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	look, ubuntu doesn't support all the same things XP does, the same way windows 7/vista doesn't support all the same things - xp was the most supported OS on the planet, and if you don't like these less supported OSes, by all means keep using XP, we won't hate you
2010-10-25T11:04:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	Xp ftw
2010-10-25T11:04:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	now, stop trying to pin it on us for ubuntu not being able to support something that lazy vendors won't let us support.
2010-10-25T11:05:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	and then go deal with ubuntu not supporting your hardware perfectly or use windows! now please, no more!
2010-10-25T11:08:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	And "not supporting it perfectly" is definitely an underexaggeration... It doesnt  work AT ALL
2010-10-25T11:09:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	why are you using ubuntu? honestly, it soudns like you're better off in XP
2010-10-25T11:10:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	see, contrary to what canonical says, ubuntu is not the os to end all OSes; not only are there other linuxes, but windows isn't inherently bad, just different
2010-10-25T11:10:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	I wanted to see what it was like... And I was sick of my antivirus using what little ram I already have (1gb)
2010-10-25T11:11:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	ahhh. if you'll take this to ##windows, that can be helped instead.
2010-10-25T11:11:00.000Z	earthshade	lahwran	What can be helped?
2010-10-25T11:12:00.000Z	lahwran	earthshade	move over there please
