2007-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	Almindor		hey guys
2007-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	Almindor		I got a problem with this crappy ipod shuffle (didn't buy, got it)
2007-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	Almindor		it keeps unmounting and mounting itself all the time
2007-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	Almindor		I tried following a gtkpod guide but it doesn't say anything about this
2007-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	wiseleo	Almindor	- try a different USB host card?
2007-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	Almindor	wiseleo	I don't have different ones this is mobo usb
2007-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	Almindor	wiseleo	the usb works fine, it's something the iPod does..
2007-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	Almindor	wiseleo	or perhaps the gnome automount system ..
2007-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	Almindor		(or both)
2007-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	wiseleo	Almindor	- I can understand that, but you can add a different USB PCI card. Usually it's hardware.
2007-11-15T16:11:00.000Z	Almindor		I doubt that
2007-11-15T16:11:00.000Z	Almindor		why would it be hardware? the thing works in windows
2007-11-15T16:11:00.000Z	wiseleo		You are welcome to doubt :)
2007-11-15T16:11:00.000Z	wiseleo		nDeva - well, the easiest way would be to setup webmin :)
2007-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	wiseleo		Works fine for me, never cared about support :) Clients love webmin/usermin
2007-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	wiseleo		Hehe love bosts
2007-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	wiseleo		love bots taht is
2007-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	wiseleo		ara - tar -zxvpf
2007-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	wiseleo		p - permissions
2007-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	wiseleo		Don't like to chmod things around
2007-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	Almindor	wiseleo	I had wrong /dev/sd* in fstab for it..
2007-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	wiseleo		Almin - that would do it
2007-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	Almindor	wiseleo	still I wonder why it disconnects itself
