2009-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	robin87		hello, i am using jaunty and i am having trouble getting a port to "open" when i run a game server...the port is forwarded correctly through my router and the port is visible as "closed" from the internet, i need it open so ppl can connect...can someone help?
2009-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	how are you opening the port?
2009-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	which port?
2009-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	just by running the server..? 27960 is port
2009-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	You need to go into your router, and forward the port.
2009-06-14T08:06:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	i have already forwarded the port, the port would be stealthed otherwise...the traffic is reaching the OS...i think it is a problem with security in the OS, not letting the server "listen"
2009-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	how do you know it's reaching the OS?
2009-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	i have a port forwarded in the same way for my torrent client and that works fine
2009-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	okay...
2009-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	because the port shows as "closed" when the OS is running, and "stealth" when the PC is off
2009-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	recursion		robin87:try out http://www.canyouseeme.org/
2009-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	recursion		robin87:what does it say?
2009-06-14T08:09:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	Error: I could not see your service on 78.32.193.174 on port (27960) Reason: Connection refused
2009-06-14T08:09:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	it appears the server isnt "listening"
2009-06-14T08:10:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	there you go. Has nothing to do woth the OS.
2009-06-14T08:10:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	the server doesnt even need to listen. it should at least it the router.
2009-06-14T08:10:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	so it is a problem with the server itself?
2009-06-14T08:10:00.000Z	recursion		anyone have XRANDR help?
2009-06-14T08:11:00.000Z	recursion	robin87	no, the port forwarding, I believe.
2009-06-14T08:11:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	but the port forwarding is fine...my router stealths all ports that aren't forwarded
2009-06-14T08:13:00.000Z	recursion		robin87:Well, all I know is that website can't see it.
2009-06-14T08:14:00.000Z	recursion		Robin87:sorry I cant help more.
2009-06-14T08:15:00.000Z	robin87	recursion	ok, thank you
