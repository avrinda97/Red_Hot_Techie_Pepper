2012-02-16T20:22:00.000Z	mastro		I've set up nfs in /etc/fstab. It is not mounting at boot time, if I mount -a after the system has been booted it works
2012-02-16T20:22:00.000Z	mastro		How do I make an NFS filesystem boot up on ubuntu server?
2012-02-16T20:22:00.000Z	mastro		sorry I meant mount at boot time
2012-02-16T20:24:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	are you using NetworkManager to configure interfaces? or is that all defined in /etc/network/interfaces and such?
2012-02-16T20:26:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	try adding 'sudo mount -a' to rc.local
2012-02-16T20:27:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	rc.local gets executed very late in the boot process.
2012-02-16T20:27:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	ok that's an hack tough
2012-02-16T20:27:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	are you using NetworkManager to configure interfaces? or is that all defined in /etc/network/interfaces and such?
2012-02-16T20:27:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	and I need the NFS to be up BEFORE ssh server
2012-02-16T20:28:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	is the network-manager package installed?
2012-02-16T20:29:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	I did an ubuntu server installation, no GUI so no NetworkManager (for instance dpkg -l network-manager show "un <none>") and I use DHCP to get up
2012-02-16T20:31:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	can you pastebin /etc/network/interfaces?
2012-02-16T20:32:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	nothing special on it... it's the default: auto eth0 \n iface eth0 inet dhcp
2012-02-16T20:33:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	and the loopback interface just before that
2012-02-16T20:34:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	OK, and is the mount point in fastab defined by IP address or name?
2012-02-16T20:35:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	martian 192.168.88.252:/repo  /mnt/repos   nfs      rw,hard,intr  0     0

2012-02-16T20:36:00.000Z	mneptok	mastro	see Keybuk's reply (S.J. Remnant)
2012-02-16T20:38:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	sorry don't see that even searching in the bug page
2012-02-16T20:38:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	no Keybuk's reply (S.J. Remnant)
2012-02-16T20:39:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	ah... sorry I was mistyping Remnant with Renmant
2012-02-16T20:40:00.000Z	mastro	mneptok	ok so you are saying this is an open issue since 2008 for ubuntu?
