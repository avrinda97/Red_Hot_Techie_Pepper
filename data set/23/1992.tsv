2009-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		no that was not to you, that was kinda directed at WilliamC
2009-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	hellothar	shazbotmcnasty	I'm looking for a miniminalist approach, kinda like window 7's new task bar
2009-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	hellothar	shazbotmcnasty	also need to find a toolbar or something like that to control rhythm box
2009-08-07T08:44:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	hellothar	do you mean you want to get rid of gnome itself? or do you just want to change the way it looks? Also - I've never looked for anything regarding the control bar for rythmbox
