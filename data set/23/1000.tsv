2011-07-06T04:56:00.000Z	asdf486		Hi, Im having trouble configuring comcast wireless with mint 11, anyone want to help?
2011-07-06T04:57:00.000Z	KM0201	asdf486	comcast wireless?
2011-07-06T04:58:00.000Z	asdf486		yeah
2011-07-06T04:59:00.000Z	KM0201	asdf486	why don't you state your problem... how do you usually connect via the comcast wireless?.. an internal wireless device, to a router, or an usb wireless device to a router, or what?
2011-07-06T05:00:00.000Z	asdf486		i was told any ubuntu help is still applicable in mint
2011-07-06T05:01:00.000Z	KM0201		oh i didn't see he was using Mint
2011-07-06T05:01:00.000Z	KM0201	asdf486	usually iti s, but people in #ubuntu, don't support Mint, you need to go to the mint channel
2011-07-06T05:01:00.000Z	asdf486		my card driver is working already, i see the wireless netowrks, there is just some extra authentication or something im not doing because it doesn't accept my sign in credentials
2011-07-06T05:03:00.000Z	KM0201		!doesntwork
2011-07-06T05:05:00.000Z	asdf486		can someone help me out?  the linux mint chat room is much smaller, the probbability of getting the help I need is fairly low
2011-07-06T05:05:00.000Z	asdf486		and ubuntu help for this also applies for mint
2011-07-06T05:05:00.000Z	KM0201		ugisozols: naa.
2011-07-06T05:09:00.000Z	asdf486		xmodmap
2011-07-06T05:10:00.000Z	asdf486		please does anyone have any ideas on how to configure linux wireless with comcast?
2011-07-06T05:10:00.000Z	asdf486		**linux with comcast wireless
2011-07-06T05:11:00.000Z	asdf486		here here godhan
2011-07-06T05:11:00.000Z	asdf486		no its not ugly_duck, can someone help me?
2011-07-06T05:14:00.000Z	asdf486	bazhang	can you repeat the question, I cant seem to find it
2011-07-06T05:15:00.000Z	asdf486		its not ubuntu, its linux mint 11 but I was told for the wireless config it would be the same, and linux mint irc is not being helpful
2011-07-06T05:22:00.000Z	asdf486		I have the same problemas locodir,there is some basic (probbably universal linux) wireless config that needs to be done to get wireless working with linux.  Im surprised no body knows how to do it...
2011-07-06T05:23:00.000Z	asdf486		I just tried an ubuntu live usb, it does the same thing
2011-07-06T05:28:00.000Z	asdf486		ok I no longer have mint11, now I have ubuntu.  Does anyone want to help configure comcast wireless with ubuntu?
2011-07-06T05:28:00.000Z	KM0201	asdf486	lol, you're lying, you can't install ubuntu that fast
