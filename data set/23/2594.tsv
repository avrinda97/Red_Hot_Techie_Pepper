2009-01-28T14:03:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	isnt cake just a php framework?
2009-01-28T14:03:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	yes, who is succesfully running an app developed with cakephp on ubuntu here?
2009-01-28T14:03:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	its just running on php, its unrelated to ubuntu
2009-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	I'm asking if anyone is running it, are you?
2009-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	ive used cake before yes.
2009-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	I have a problem which I'm having trouble solving, my apps display fine, but I can't access anything beyond the homepage
2009-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	sounds like an apache issue
2009-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	php and apache are completely separate from ubuntu
2009-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	I've asked in #cakephp, #apache, and haven't yet found a solution
2009-01-28T14:11:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	try #php
2009-01-28T14:11:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	did you have trouble running cake?
2009-01-28T14:17:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	im telling you it has nothing to do with ubuntu.  i run php apps all the time.  and you dont run cake.  its just a php framework
2009-01-28T14:18:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	I totally understand these, the fact is, I'm trying to develop an app with cakephp, and I can't access any page apart from the default page of this app. thanks for your help though.
2009-01-28T14:21:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	sounds like an issue with mod_rewrite
2009-01-28T14:21:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	yes, and so far, everyone says I'm the only one experiencing this issue. everyone else says it works out of the box
2009-01-28T14:22:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	see if apache has the allow overides set to true
2009-01-28T14:22:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	there are so many places where that can be set I don't quite know which specific one
2009-01-28T14:23:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	/etc/apache2
2009-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	the rewriting seems to be working, but it gives me an error saying "unable to access /home/.../index.php"
2009-01-28T14:26:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	if it gives you that then its not working. is there a .htaccess file with cake?
2009-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	nucc1	zmanning	yes, there is
2009-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	zmanning	nucc1	check what i said above
