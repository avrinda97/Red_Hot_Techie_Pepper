2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		it's not
2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		it's just a usb mem stick, fat32 i guess
2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		it automounts when i plug it in but the filesystem is read only
2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		i knowi  can mount it
2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		i want to write to it though
2005-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ratty_		it's not in fstab, it's automount
2005-12-17T07:25:00.000Z	Ratty_		did any of the previous people that asked get an answer?
2005-12-17T07:26:00.000Z	Ratty_		hmz
2005-12-17T07:26:00.000Z	Ratty_		guess not
2005-12-17T07:27:00.000Z	Ratty_		maybe in 2 years linux will be read for the desktop
2005-12-17T07:27:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	please don't be stupid
2005-12-17T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	also, fat32 should be mountred rw; if not, it's a bug, please report it
2005-12-17T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	more likely it's HFS+ or NTFS, though
2005-12-17T07:28:00.000Z	Ratty_	bob2	it's fat32
2005-12-17T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	show us the output from 'mount'
2005-12-17T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	show us the last 10 lines of 'dmesg' in #flood
2005-12-17T07:32:00.000Z	Ratty_	bob2	any idea why it decided to mount read only?
2005-12-17T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	uh, because the filesystem is corrupt?
2005-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	run chkdsk on it or something
2005-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	if you've found a bug in the linux vfat driver, report it
2005-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	this is breezy, right?
2005-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	what does 'uname -r' print?
2005-12-17T07:35:00.000Z	bob2	Ratty_	from chkdsk?
