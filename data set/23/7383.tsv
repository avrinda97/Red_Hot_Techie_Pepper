2005-11-01T12:11:00.000Z	chemisus		ok
2005-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	iiiears	chemisus	- I just right clicked on a folder in my home directory. answered a couple of questions when prompted and samba began installation automatically.
2005-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	chemisus		hehe
2005-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	chemisus		ok, i see the folder at the bottom of the list, and with 4 attributes all with value of yes
2005-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	iiiears		smb: makes me nervous going to remove it pronto - ssh is much better.
2005-11-01T12:13:00.000Z	chemisus	Severian	yes
2005-11-01T12:16:00.000Z	chemisus	Severian	ok, do i need to restart samba or anything?
2005-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	chemisus		yea
2005-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	chemisus		was npbody suppose to be nobody?
2005-11-01T12:20:00.000Z	chemisus		ok, still cant seem to connect, but it might be a windows problem =/
2005-11-01T12:21:00.000Z	chemisus		probably from domains or something
2005-11-01T12:21:00.000Z	chemisus		workgroup
2005-11-01T12:22:00.000Z	iiiears	chemisus	- windows doesn't refresh very often maybe every fifteen minutes or so.
2005-11-01T12:22:00.000Z	chemisus	Severian	ok, each time i connect though, it prompts me for a user name and password. when i put in username it retries with a computer name first then username
2005-11-01T12:23:00.000Z	chemisus	Severian	the computer name doesnt wont mess it up will it?
2005-11-01T12:24:00.000Z	iiiears	chemisus	- hm - my other machines show this one but not the shared folder. looks like editing samba.conf is absolutely inescapeable. - lol
2005-11-01T12:24:00.000Z	chemisus	Severian	wont let me =P the ok box is disabled
2005-11-01T12:26:00.000Z	chemisus		hmm
2005-11-01T12:26:00.000Z	chemisus		this is strange
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	chemisus		i typed net use \\otter (otter = my linux box) and it prompts for user and pass, i put them in with my account and pass, and it says invalid
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	chemisus		ok
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	iiiears	chemisus	- first a prompt to log on to the remote machine - okay that seems fine - then a prompt for password for the machine i am already on. - seems odd to me.
