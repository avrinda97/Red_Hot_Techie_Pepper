2005-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	they're all very different and have different flavors, it's a matter of taste basically
2005-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	M3G4		i don't get why this machine is so slow, though
2005-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	M3G4		it's hardly old by a long shot
2005-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	how much ram ?
2005-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	M3G4		1GHz is still kinda fast, and it is nowhere near this slow even in memory hungry WinXP
2005-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	M3G4		192MB with 8MB shared with GFX
2005-12-28T13:41:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	well, it's not much ram. I think you should try xfce4 instead of gnome/kde
2005-12-28T13:41:00.000Z	M3G4		if I added more ram, would it improve speed much?
2005-12-28T13:42:00.000Z	M3G4		the system generally crawls - from window rendering to actually launching applications
2005-12-28T13:42:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	yes, more ram would make much of a difference
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		I'll add some more RAM In the new year then
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		but until then it'll have to plod along like this. what sort of RAM would be optimal for this PC?
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		256?
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	i would not consider less than 512 ram actually
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		512MB for a 1GHz machine?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		isn't that overkill?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4	blanky	- me
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		and generally slow performance :p
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		pashow - how do i find out?
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		blanky- mines only a 1GHz but even windows runs faster than this
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	i do not think 512 Mb ram is overkill.
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		lol my new dell has 1GB of RAM
2005-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	kyncani	M3G4	and you hear the hard drive always running, especially when your desktop is crawling i guess
