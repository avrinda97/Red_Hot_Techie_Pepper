2008-01-15T00:42:00.000Z	WoodMaven		Hi, I'm not sure how to use IRC, but I need help installing ubuntu, can anyone help?
2008-01-15T00:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	for a laptopor desktop
2008-01-15T00:43:00.000Z	WoodMaven		Desktop, brand new iMac running Leopard  and Parallels
2008-01-15T00:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	IRC hint, when talking to someone specific, put their nick in the line.  It will highlight and/or beep to the person you're talking to.
2008-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	nicks are easier to complete by typing the first few characters then hitting tab.. look to see if it completed the nick correctly.  If not try again with more characters.
2008-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	How's that?
2008-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	good
2008-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	Can You Help me?
2008-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	maybe.. not being overly familure with mac, are you trying to setup a dual boot or using parrells?
2008-01-15T00:47:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	I think that I am trying to set up a dual boot, as I understand it Parallels will allow me to run both osx and ubuntu at the same time
2008-01-15T00:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	ok.. dual boot will give you one or the other... do you have bootcamp?
2008-01-15T00:48:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	no, I am using Parallels
2008-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	correct me if I'm wrong, but will Parallels allow you to load Mac's OS and Linux at the same time and let you bounce back and forth between the two or is it transparent.  That is running programs for both at the same time?
2008-01-15T00:51:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	As I understand it I can bounce back and forth between the two
2008-01-15T00:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	ok.. to install you have to be able to boot to the Ubuntu Live CD from within parelles.  Do you know how to do that?
2008-01-15T00:53:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	I downloaded ubuntu 7.10 burnt a disc, as instructed, but parallels won't see the disc
2008-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	Ok you probably need parallels "Image" of Ubuntu to get it to run.. here's a link I found for an image.. not sure which version of Ubuntu it is though.  Looks like Xubuntu.  http://digg.com/linux_unix/Triple_Boot_Using_Parallels_Run_Ubuntu_on_your_Macbook_using_Parallels
2008-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	or rather http://ramsinks.vox.com/library/post/xubuntu-parellels-image-for-macbooks.html
2008-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	OK I will try that , once I do can I check back with you if you are available?
2008-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	here's another link that might be more helpful.  It shows how to use any Ubuntu ISO image in Parallels. http://xanana.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/wiki/index.php/Running_Linux_via_Parallels_inside_another_operating_system
2008-01-15T00:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	I've gotta run see clients but someone here will help.
2008-01-15T00:59:00.000Z	WoodMaven	Scunizi	Thank you for your time
2008-01-15T00:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	WoodMaven	no problem
