2007-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	thanks
2007-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	is dma working now?
2007-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	i'm checking if i have it active but the prompt say almost nothing
2007-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	what does it say?
2007-07-27T12:13:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	 well, checking in sdc0 (my dvd burner) it says '/dev/sdc0: No such file or directory' with a dvd on it
2007-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	and without the dvd  is the same. Checking a harddrive it prompt the name of the drive
2007-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	ok, now i have something (the answer in lp have a mistake)
2007-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31575/ but with the dvd drive it says nothing
2007-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	and you did hdparm /dev/sdc0 ?
2007-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	yes
2007-07-27T12:21:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	I think you should use sdparm (it's an external USB?)
2007-07-27T12:22:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	no, is not usb. i use sdparm and it didn't work
2007-07-27T12:22:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	in the paste i send you. it didn't say nothing about dma, that means that its disable right?
2007-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	here is it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31575/ this is from a hdd
2007-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	it should say dma=0, or dma=1
2007-07-27T12:24:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	will be back in 5min
2007-07-27T12:24:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	ok
2007-07-27T12:36:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	could you try: hdparm -d /dev/cdrom
2007-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	without the '-d' it prompts something very similar to the one i pasted you (without anything dma related)
2007-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	and with the -d swith ?
2007-07-27T12:51:00.000Z	konam	CaptainFrisbee	it prompts '/dev/cdrom'
2007-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	konam	could you put the output of dmesg in a pastebin?
