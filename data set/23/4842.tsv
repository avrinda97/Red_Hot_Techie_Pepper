2007-07-17T08:01:00.000Z	Safrole		Anyone know of a program in the ubuntu repository that will allow creation of .pdf files from image files?
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	perhaps imagemagick's convert
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	perhaps gimp
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Safrole		gimp can create .pdf files?
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Safrole		I had no idea.
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	But technically it would rarely make any sense.
2007-07-17T08:02:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	read again; I wrote "perhaps"
2007-07-17T08:03:00.000Z	Zta		Or use OpenOffice Draw maybe.  I guess it will write pdf when the oowriter does.
2007-07-17T08:05:00.000Z	Safrole		gimp will save as ps
2007-07-17T08:05:00.000Z	Safrole		and from there ps2pdf in the terminal should do it
2007-07-17T08:05:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	but ... why?
2007-07-17T08:05:00.000Z	Safrole	Zta	So I scanned some pages in a book, and I want to make them into a .pdf file.
2007-07-17T08:06:00.000Z	Safrole	Zta	Does that sound like a good reason to you?
2007-07-17T08:07:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	I see.  Makes sense.  Then you should probably use OpenOffice Writer, import the images, resize them to fill the entire page, and then export to pdf.  Then you have a real pdf book.  I'm not aware of other tools for doing this.
2007-07-17T08:07:00.000Z	Safrole		Okay, I wasn't aware that OpenOffice had something.
2007-07-17T08:07:00.000Z	Safrole		This is a pain to do with windows, I'm glad it seems a lot easier with ubuntu. :)
2007-07-17T08:08:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	Otherwise you'll just have 1000 pdf files instead of 1 pdf file with 1000 pages.
2007-07-17T08:08:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	I don't know if it's easier, but it can be done =)
2007-07-17T08:08:00.000Z	Safrole		well with windows, all the programs usually aren't free, and the ones that are marketed as free are just trial editions
2007-07-17T08:09:00.000Z	Safrole		and they'll leave water marks on your .pdf
2007-07-17T08:09:00.000Z	Safrole		It's annoying.
2007-07-17T08:09:00.000Z	Zta	Safrole	don't ask about LaTeX .. don't got down that road.
2007-07-17T08:09:00.000Z	Safrole	Zta	I know a lot about LaTeX
