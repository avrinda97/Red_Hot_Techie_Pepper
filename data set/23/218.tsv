2012-03-19T00:00:00.000Z	quebre		alright, i heard the Ubuntu is newbie friendly, so i installed it on my daughter's PC but each time she run some game (such as 0ad, native for linux afaik, or game thru wine) the system crash without any message, this is the information i taken 2 seconds before crash: cpu temp: 52C, ram usage: 1672MB used, 2288MB free, the whole /var/log gives no information as well, except: Mar 18 20:56:45 HANIA AptDaemon: INFO: Quitting was requested - that's not

2012-03-19T00:04:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	smells like gfx related problem
2012-03-19T00:05:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	how do you know
2012-03-19T00:06:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	because that's what happens when your gfx card is trying to change the mode and fails at that
2012-03-19T00:06:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	when i run a game it works for lets say 3-8 minutes and then it suddenly freeze
2012-03-19T00:07:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	does it freeze in random moments?
2012-03-19T00:07:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	yes, but only in game, never in desktop
2012-03-19T00:07:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	did you mean random moments of the game, too? like not same location/menu/etc
2012-03-19T00:08:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	not in the main game menu, when the game map is loaded it works for few minutes and then BAM
2012-03-19T00:08:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	did you notice if it's always a few mins after starting the game? does it tend to stay longer on the first start and crashes faster on 2nd and 3rd run?
2012-03-19T00:09:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	it's similar, few minutes and crash
2012-03-19T00:09:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	but i mean its complete freeze, all you can do is reboot
2012-03-19T00:10:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	and did you try other games? no freezes?
2012-03-19T00:10:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	i tried 2 games: 0ad and Speelforce 2, i also playd Tuxracer but i think Tuxracer is ok ?
2012-03-19T00:11:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	i'm nearly sure that the problem is gfx related... either on a driver level or it is simply overheating at some point
2012-03-19T00:13:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	maybe i just need latest driver for the 8800GT card
2012-03-19T00:18:00.000Z	quebre	bunny69	what if it's really gfx problem but not temperature overheat?
2012-03-19T00:18:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	i would consider digging for newer drivers or trying to tweak the existing installation
2012-03-19T00:23:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	this also happens on winbloze alot
2012-03-19T00:23:00.000Z	bunny69	quebre	speaking of nice games - your daughter may like Minecraft :)
