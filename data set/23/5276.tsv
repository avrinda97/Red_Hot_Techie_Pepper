2007-01-04T17:13:00.000Z	Michael2		Anyone who knows how to format the whole Hard drive.  Want only to have Linux op. system on it
2007-01-04T17:14:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	boot using the ubuntu live cd, use gparted to remove all partitions.. install
2007-01-04T17:15:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	So when I run the Cd and choose install I shall select "format whole hard drive" (option 2)
2007-01-04T17:15:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	oh.. yes.. you can do that.. I haven't used that installer myself but if that's what you want it to do, sure..
2007-01-04T17:20:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	So can I run the live CD now and start it, or do I have to run it from srat up
2007-01-04T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	I don't think you can format the drive while still running the system from that hard drive so you'll have to boot from the live cd, yes
2007-01-04T17:23:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	Sorry to b e a bugger. Just gone over from WIn. So run the Ubuntu CD, and choose install. Then I got three options. Opt.1: The CD automaticly give me a partition suggestion. Opt2: Use the whole lot. Opt 3 : Do partitions myself.
2007-01-04T17:23:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	hehe, no worries. I'd go with 2 if it's just a home system
2007-01-04T17:24:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	Its a hoem system
2007-01-04T17:24:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	then go with "format the whole lot"
2007-01-04T17:25:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	So I won't wipe any vital information that actually make this thing work so I never get it on ever again? Like non operational system data.
2007-01-04T17:25:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	hm.. let's do this from the beginning.. what's on your hard drive right now?
2007-01-04T17:26:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	Do you want a accurate list on what it says on start up?
2007-01-04T17:26:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	no.. just the big picture.. do you have windows installed on this hard drive at the moment?
2007-01-04T17:28:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	I had Win ME, then instalkled XP (but from a New Version CD.....) Not at all happy how XP performed, so got Ubuntu. Installed Ubuntu.
2007-01-04T17:29:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	So win XP still on it it says, even if I though that would be wiped away. Maybe some ME left. And I did  format C: before I installed Ubuntu
2007-01-04T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	ok, is there anything on the hard drive you want to keep, like documents, images etc?
2007-01-04T17:29:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	No
2007-01-04T17:30:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	ok.. then you can format the whole thing
2007-01-04T17:30:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	All on back-up disk.
2007-01-04T17:31:00.000Z	Michael2	Slart	I always said that Scandinavians where very helpful and bright. Thanks. I see you one the other side. Have a nice day.
2007-01-04T17:31:00.000Z	Slart	Michael2	good luck
