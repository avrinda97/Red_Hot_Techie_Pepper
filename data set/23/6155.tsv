2006-08-16T08:17:00.000Z	heinouskyle		help me
2006-08-16T08:18:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i'm not able to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cursor in text
2006-08-16T08:18:00.000Z	bruenig	heinouskyle	what program?
2006-08-16T08:18:00.000Z	heinouskyle		in all applications
2006-08-16T08:19:00.000Z	heinouskyle		breunig, i don't even know where to start in solving this problem
2006-08-16T08:20:00.000Z	bruenig	heinouskyle	assuming your arrow keys actually work which unless you can verify that with another OS might not be true, I can't imagine why it wouldn't work unless you have some weird keyboard that x couldn't recognize or gave you a bad driver for
2006-08-16T08:20:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i was using them to play games earlier in windows
2006-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i have a standard keyboard too
2006-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	heinouskyle	bruenig	i'm pretty sure it has something to do with gnome keyboard shortcuts because earlier i tried to set up the shortcuts for media
2006-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	heinouskyle		like using the pause button to pause/play my music
2006-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	heinouskyle	well disable the shortcuts, that is probably it, you assigned the arrow keys to perform that function and now they wont work in other functions
2006-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i did that already, bruenig, but still no good
2006-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	heinouskyle		even after a restart
2006-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i don't know what else i could possible try
2006-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig		you clicked on every shortcut and hit backspace?
2006-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	heinouskyle		most of the shortcuts i cleared
2006-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig		do all of them,
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig		unless you are need them and are absolutely certain they don't conflict
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	heinouskyle		i just cleared everything
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig		try
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	heinouskyle		still isn't working
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	heinouskyle		do i have to restart gnome or X?
2006-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig	heinouskyle	you could try to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and accept all of the defaults, that is all I got left
