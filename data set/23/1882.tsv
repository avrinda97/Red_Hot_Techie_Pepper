2010-02-12T10:04:00.000Z	ajay		tell me a gui way rather than commands if possible
2010-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	ajay		hey i jus know my root password
2010-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	ajay		thats it
2010-02-12T10:06:00.000Z	ajay		yes
2010-02-12T10:06:00.000Z	ajay		know i know my sudo password
2010-02-12T10:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	It's the password you use to login to the system
2010-02-12T10:17:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	hey actually i forgot my keyring unlock password can any 1 tell me how should i deactivate it
2011-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	if you like Gnome2 I suggest you to consider Xfce. Ubuntu's getting rid of Gnome2 very soon.
2011-08-08T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	No, 11.04 still does have Gnome2 by default, you just have to switch to it
2011-08-08T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	11.10 won't, and it won't be in the repos either I suppose.
2011-08-08T11:53:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	I tell you, Xfce is almost a Gnome2 clone
2011-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	i dunno man, from watching the gnome3 videos i realize how unsatisfied i am w/ gnome2.. no i don't care for 3 better, but they've actually a few cool features, and i'd hate to go to a clone of 2 instead..
2011-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	Just a suggestion, if you like G3 stay on it
2011-08-08T11:58:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	I honestly hated it.
2011-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	for the issues you raised, i agree, i don't think i'll care for it.  the workspaces and type to search for apps is all i liked, and i'd like a window manager with those features, and more.
2011-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	Well you can try anything you want, it won't hurt.
2011-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	btw, there's a great app for... app searching, Launchy. See http://launchy.net
2011-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	nice, will check it.  Now just need a better workspace manager... seems like if something can integrate well w/ compiz it'd be pretty sweet
2011-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	but can you seriously NOT resize windows?? that's too _crazy_ for me to believe!
2011-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	You can resize, but to get the maximize button you have to dig with dconf a little :D
2011-08-08T12:05:00.000Z	ajay	theadmin	ok.. :)  Man sounds like i'm going to trip _out_ next time i reboot this computer!
2011-08-08T12:05:00.000Z	theadmin	ajay	...11.04 uses Unity, not Gnome3
