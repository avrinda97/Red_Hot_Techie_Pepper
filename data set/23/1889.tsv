2010-06-01T11:25:00.000Z	theadmin	nmvictor	You have to import the corresponding public key for the repo
2010-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	nmvictor	theadmin	how do i do that, isnt their a general method that would take the key as an argument
2010-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	theadmin	nmvictor	meh, there usually are instructions on site of corresponding repo
2010-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	nmvictor	theadmin	ActionParsnip : You guys assist, It was about #Opera browser deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free  #chromium browser deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu lucid main deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu lucid main
2010-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	theadmin	nmvictor	It's one of the last ones.
2010-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	nmvictor	theadmin	actually their is an error for opera too, the on i posted is for chromium
2010-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	nmvictor	theadmin	and bytheway, is chromium available for ubuntu powerpc?
2010-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	theadmin	nmvictor	no
2010-06-01T11:31:00.000Z	nmvictor	theadmin	so will removing the line on chromium solve one of the problems?
2012-05-26T15:40:00.000Z	theadmin	nmvictor	If you want a more lightweight Ubuntu edition, give Xubuntu or Lubuntu a go. Xubuntu is a good choice if you miss GNOME 2, it's similar. Then again, if you just want GNOME, install gnome-shell, remove Unity, problem solved.
