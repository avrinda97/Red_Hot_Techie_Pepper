2010-05-21T21:23:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	lamp don't include that ....
2010-05-21T21:24:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	it is easy to install ~ web based wizard
2010-05-21T21:26:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	idk ~ i always install and configure that by manual
2010-05-21T21:27:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	it only include (Linux) Apache Mysql PHP
2010-05-21T21:28:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	hmm
2010-05-21T21:28:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	there is info on phpmyAdmin homepage
2010-05-21T21:28:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	okies

2010-05-21T21:31:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	easy huh?~ XD
2010-05-21T21:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	can you tell me the diff b/w mysql-server and mysql-client??
2010-05-21T21:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	do I need mysql-client??
2010-05-21T21:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	I think LAMP comes with mysql-server only
2010-05-21T21:33:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	server is the database server XD ~ client is the cli for accessing the server ~ like phpmyadmin but in terminal
2010-05-21T21:34:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	ok so you mean i dont need the client??
2010-05-21T21:34:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	client also got the tools for backup databases ~ so i recommend kepping it
2010-05-21T21:34:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	is it commandline??
2010-05-21T21:34:00.000Z	wildbat	Krishnandu	yes
2010-05-21T21:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	I'm noob. I don't know how to use it
2010-05-21T21:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu	wildbat	till date i used XAMPP
