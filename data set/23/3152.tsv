2008-07-10T04:11:00.000Z	kkathman		is there anything I need to do special to get my ipod to mount in ubuntu Hardy ??
2008-07-10T04:12:00.000Z	kkathman		I plugged it into the USB and it seems "alive" but the system doesnt seem to know
2008-07-10T04:12:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	depends -- was it formatted for mac, or pc?
2008-07-10T04:13:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 hmm dunno ..I use it with my windows pc and itunes (used to)
2008-07-10T04:13:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	then "mounting" it is as simple as putting it in storage mode, but for itunes-like song management, install gtkpod
2008-07-10T04:14:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 ok, I'll try, but when I plug it into the USB nothing happens - seems like I remember in gutsy it just mounted automatically
2008-07-10T04:19:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 yeah that doesnt seem to work :(
2008-07-10T04:19:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 when you said putting it in "storage" mode..what did you mean?
2008-07-10T04:20:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	whatever you do to make it appear like an external drive
2008-07-10T04:20:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 well currently all I've done is plug it into the USB - the Ipod lights up...but the system knows nothing about it that I can tell
2008-07-10T04:24:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	by any chance, did you plug it into a usb hub?
2008-07-10T04:25:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 no no its a usb on the back of my computer
2008-07-10T04:25:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 the unit was getting REALLY hot thought - that seems a bit abnormal
2008-07-10T04:25:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	does it show up in lsusb?
2008-07-10T04:26:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 nope the only thing thats showing on lssub is the trackball
2008-07-10T04:27:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	then you've got bigger problems
2008-07-10T04:27:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	what unop said
2008-07-10T04:30:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	  see paste:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/26325/
2008-07-10T04:33:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 if you check that post - Im not sure I see anything odd - except that line 37
2008-07-10T04:36:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	something is wrong with your ipod hardware
2008-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 to follow up with you - seems that there was something very severely wrong with my iPod - its now completely dead in fact
2008-07-10T07:28:00.000Z	sn9_	kkathman	toldya
2008-07-10T07:28:00.000Z	kkathman	sn9_	 yeah when I put the external power on it. the display died and hasnt come back
