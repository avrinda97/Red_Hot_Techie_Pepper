2006-12-28T08:33:00.000Z	Erb_		How would I add 'xhost +' in my .bashrc? Can I just put it anywhere?
2006-12-28T08:33:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	what are you trying to do?
2006-12-28T08:34:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	I'm trying to open mplayer GUI from a php script from loacal and I need to give the correct permissions
2006-12-28T08:35:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	you definitely don't want it in your .bashrc
2006-12-28T08:35:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	you wnat it to be run every time you start an X11 session
2006-12-28T08:35:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	why? because of security?
2006-12-28T08:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	because it's not the right place - when you start an X11 session your .bashrc is NOT run
2006-12-28T08:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	only when you start bash is it run
2006-12-28T08:37:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	I'm trying to do what this guy did: http://groups.google.com.au/group/comp.os.linux.x/msg/9681681a9c277903?hl=en&
2006-12-28T08:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	what do you mean "x11 command"?
2006-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	please see http://groups.google.com.au/group/linux.debian.user/browse_thread/thread/39acc2665101e788/8b18481fa7649ba6?hl=en#8b18481fa7649ba6
2006-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	if i were you i'd do this with a client-server jobby over an IPC mechanism like D-Bus
2006-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	how good is your Python?
2006-12-28T08:49:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	PHP has less than stellar support for desktop programming
2006-12-28T08:50:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	I am trying to open a video file in mplayer from a php script in a browser
2006-12-28T08:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	do you REALLY want to run totem as user www-data?
2006-12-28T08:50:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	Yes!
2006-12-28T08:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	in an x11 session that's owned by YOU?
2006-12-28T08:51:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	Yes
2006-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	it's much MUCH cleaner to do this via IPC...
2006-12-28T08:54:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	if you have a program running on your desktop session that listens for commands and controls your multimedia software, and a program that is run via apache that sends the first program commands
2006-12-28T08:55:00.000Z	Erb_	alex-weej	Can you please send me a link with further information?
2006-12-28T08:57:00.000Z	alex-weej	Erb_	one minute
