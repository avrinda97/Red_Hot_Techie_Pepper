2007-03-11T10:04:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly		hi guys - i'm trying to install amarok 1.4.5, but following the instructions on the kubuntu site doesn't work, it doesn't want to update
2007-03-11T10:04:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly		anyone know what the problem is? ;/
2007-03-11T10:05:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Is there a particular reason you can't use the version in the repos?
2007-03-11T10:05:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	not really - i just want the newest version, is that a problem? :p
2007-03-11T10:05:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	No problem at all; I was just curious.  No sense in overcomplicating things if you don't need to.
2007-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	In general, I try to wait for the repos to handle things if possible, because manually installing an app tends to mean that aptitude no longer automatically updates it.
2007-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	but the kubuntu guide tells me to add a repo that has it in, then it should just upgrade :/
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Oh, I see - you're not *manually* installing it, you're just trying to GET the version in the repos.
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	yea
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Okay, so, amaroK is already installed, right?  Which version do you have right now?
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	1.4.3
2007-03-11T10:08:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	According to my repository cache, 1.4.3 is the latest version available in the repositories.
2007-03-11T10:08:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	It happens often that the repositories won't have the latest version actually available - lots of work has to be done to make sure that installing the new version won't break anyone's system.
2007-03-11T10:08:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.5.php
2007-03-11T10:10:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	I assume you've added that repository?  Have you run "sudo apt-get update" since adding that repo to your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2007-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	yes
2007-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Hmm... try doing "sudo aptitude install amarok=1.4.5"
2007-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	Unable to find a version "1.4.5" for the package "amarok"
2007-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Humm... what about amarok=2:1.4.5-0ubuntu10
2007-03-11T10:13:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	same :(
2007-03-11T10:13:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Lame.  I'm afraid I have no answer for you, my friend.
2007-03-11T10:16:00.000Z	Tonren	SanguineAnomaly	Have you asked in #kubuntu?
2007-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Tonren	well, i thought since i was on ubuntu, i'd ask here first :/
