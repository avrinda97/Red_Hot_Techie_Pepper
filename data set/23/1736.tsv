2009-11-09T07:56:00.000Z	f00b		seriously no one else is having issues with any external drives being recognized  in 9.10
2009-11-09T07:56:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	run sudo fdisk -l and let me know if it sees it in there?
2009-11-09T07:57:00.000Z	f00b	aaronorosen	it does see it with fdisk -l
2009-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	then you just need to mount it with like sudo mount -rw /dev/XXX /media/where you want OR you can use /etc/fstab if you want to keep it moounted all the time like after you reboot and all.
2009-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	I usually don't let linux automatically manage my mounts for me.
2009-11-09T08:00:00.000Z	f00b	aaronorosen	it use to see the whatever drive that i plugged in now it never sees any i dont get it
2009-11-09T08:00:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	sorry i'm not really sure what could be causing that.. hmmm
2009-11-09T08:02:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	mount -rw /dev/sdb1 /mnt
2009-11-09T08:02:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	that fix it?
2009-11-09T08:04:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	pastebin what your fdisk -l says...
2009-11-09T08:05:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	you may have to add -t <filesystem type>
2009-11-09T08:07:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	paste me the output of sudo fdisk -l
2009-11-09T08:09:00.000Z	f00b	aaronorosen	do i paste in here or somewhere else

2009-11-09T08:11:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	whats the output of this mount -rw /dev/sdb2 /mnt ?
2009-11-09T08:11:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	thats what your want not /dev/sdb1
2009-11-09T08:12:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	that work?
2009-11-09T08:14:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	now go to /mnt and your files on your flash drive will be there.
2009-11-09T08:14:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	figure it out?
2009-11-09T08:15:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	i'm not sure i don't really mess with plugin play (probably rebooting it will fix it)
2009-11-09T08:17:00.000Z	f00b	aaronorosen	actually rebooting doesnt fix it i've been trying to sort this out for about 4 days no jump drive ipod or anyting will work weird
2009-11-09T08:17:00.000Z	aaronorosen	f00b	hmm idk sorry perhaps its a setting somewhere that got messed up or something
