2012-04-26T18:24:00.000Z	limpc	TobiasTheCommie	probably. is mounted
2012-04-26T18:25:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie	limpc	wouldn't a reboot fix that?
2012-04-26T18:25:00.000Z	limpc		fix what?
2012-04-26T18:25:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie	limpc	the free space issue i'm having with encfs
2012-04-26T18:25:00.000Z	limpc		if its a mounted folder that you didnt manually mount, its probably in your fstab and will remount when you reboot
2012-04-26T18:25:00.000Z	limpc	TobiasTheCommie	idk about that i joined towards the end of your issue
2012-04-26T18:26:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie	limpc	encfs home folder, mounted on login(ie, after x and lightdm is up and running)
2012-04-26T18:26:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie		ah, oki. was just the 16:24:55 <limpc> TobiasTheCommie, probably. is mounted
2012-04-26T18:26:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie		i wanted to make sure i hadn't missed something stupid... again..
2012-04-26T18:26:00.000Z	limpc	TobiasTheCommie	yeah you mentioned the difference in df with . and /
2012-04-26T18:27:00.000Z	limpc		if the current folder is a mounted folder (e.g. of another partition), then it'll of course show a different size
2012-04-26T18:27:00.000Z	limpc	TobiasTheCommie	i believe the installer allows you to set up home as a separate partition by default
2012-04-26T18:27:00.000Z	TobiasTheCommie	limpc	yeah, with the . being /home/<user>/ encfs. but i guess that wasn't obvious
