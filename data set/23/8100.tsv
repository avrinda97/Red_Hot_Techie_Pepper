2005-01-20T16:18:00.000Z	zensamsara		what could be causing this?
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		my guess is that the only option i have is to take out the hard disk, put it into another machine as slave, and try to fix it
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		either formatting the mbr, or just formatting the whole disk
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		k
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		my home pc is a dual boot sys
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		and after everything installed correctly, and i rebooted the system
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		now i cannot get past the initial splash screen of my pc
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		etc
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		nothing loads
2005-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	zensamsara		it wont even recognize a bootable cd
2005-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	You sure you can't get into the BIOS config?
2005-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	damn sure
2005-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	Have you thought about taking out the HDD?
2005-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	Were you able to get into your bios config with the hdd off?
2005-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	didnt try it
2005-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	affirmative
2005-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	So your bios is ok?
2005-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	looks like it is
2005-01-20T16:48:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	You don't have a weird BIOS thats locked up with Winodows do you?
2005-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	i have no idea, how can i confirm that?
2005-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	You need to google on that.
2005-01-20T16:51:00.000Z	nirai	zensamsara	Lile somebody suggested earlier.  I think its best if you test your HDD on another machine.
2005-01-20T16:51:00.000Z	zensamsara	nirai	yes, will try that
