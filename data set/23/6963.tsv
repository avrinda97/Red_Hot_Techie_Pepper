2006-06-08T15:19:00.000Z	Plouj		yo guys
2006-06-08T15:19:00.000Z	Plouj		any idea why OOo on Ubuntu 6.06 doesn't find any spelling errors in a document which obviously has mistakes? I didn't change any dictionary settings, and I'm currently using English(Canada).
2006-06-08T15:20:00.000Z	Plouj		I have manually clicked the spell check button. The automatic spell check fails to underline badlyspelled words.
2006-06-08T15:21:00.000Z	judah	Plouj	do you have aspell and gnome-spell installed?
2006-06-08T15:21:00.000Z	Plouj	judah	dunno, should I?

2006-06-08T15:29:00.000Z	Plouj	judah	humm, it seems that it spell checks new documents, but old ones it doesn't :/ Maybe it has something to do with Load/Save > General > "Load user-specific settings with the document" setting.
2006-06-08T15:31:00.000Z	judah	Plouj	ah
2006-06-08T15:32:00.000Z	Plouj	judah	humm, still doesn't find old documents' errors.
2006-06-08T15:38:00.000Z	Plouj		gaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
2006-06-08T15:38:00.000Z	Plouj	judah	I just saved a simple document with spelling errors, and was able to open it and see the errors again. Then I copied text from an old document to this one, and no errors were noticed (I made some intentionally). :(
