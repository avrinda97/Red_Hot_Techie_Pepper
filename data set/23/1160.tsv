2010-07-26T02:57:00.000Z	Number6		How can I enter in text-mode after startup, cause my HD has no bytes free of space, I can't login properly in GUI
2010-07-26T02:57:00.000Z	Number6		I need to remove some files
2010-07-26T02:57:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	I'd boot to liveCD, chroot to the installed system and remove some packages
2010-07-26T02:58:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	I used LiveCD, but had no p[ermission to modify files (or remove)
2010-07-26T02:58:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	you will if you chroot
2010-07-26T02:59:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	I started nautilus as root but suddenly I can't see my partition....
2010-07-26T03:00:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	you dont need nautilus, you need a chroot. I'd use root recovery mode like erUSUL suggested
2010-07-26T03:02:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	yeah there is a USB bug with grub
2010-07-26T03:03:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	boot to liveCD then chroot, you can then remove packages as you wish
2010-07-26T03:05:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	thnx, I hope so
2010-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	you can mount the partition in the places menu, you can then run: gksudo nautilus   and get write access. The partition will be mounted as it's UUID under /media
2010-07-26T03:27:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	that did the dtrick!! Pffff, it got me nuts... The problem is I don't have much time, it's 00:30 h am here. Tomorrow I got to work
2010-07-26T03:27:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	erUSUL once again thank you very much.
2010-07-26T03:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	i suggest once you get booted, uninstall old kernels, this will get you ~120Mb per kernel
2010-07-26T03:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	also uninstal openoffice and install abiword if you only use writer
2010-07-26T03:31:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	lots of space saved :)
2010-07-26T03:32:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	just hangout, it will timeout
2010-07-26T03:32:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	really??
2010-07-26T03:33:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	it's a grub 1.97 (ubuntu 9.10)
2010-07-26T03:34:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	by default it should timeout and boot the deffault option
2010-07-26T03:35:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	Jordan_U is right, I also don't see count down
2010-07-26T03:38:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Number6	then you will need a chroot to mess with grub some
2010-07-26T03:39:00.000Z	Number6	actionParsnip	Jordan_U , well in that case I'll try tomorrow again, cuz I need some sleep, gotta work.
