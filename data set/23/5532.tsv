2009-05-27T09:39:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	Hey
2009-05-27T09:40:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	Ok, It looks like it removed all display drivers because now i have a jacked up screen.  flickery, lines running through it, etc
2009-05-27T09:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	What have you done since it was working?
2009-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Then going back to recovery mode and the "Fix X" menu should get you back, I told you not to do that untill you removed the manually installed drivers...
2009-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	I thought that WAS uninstalling the manually installed drivers
2009-05-27T09:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	What you did was install the Ubuntu package, then remove the Ubuntu package, but since it was the manual install we were trying to get rid of. I don't blame you for being confused, in the future know that sticking with Hardware Drivers and packages from the beggining makes things easier
2009-05-27T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Shutting down then starting up is fine
2009-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	Ok we're back where we started
2009-05-27T09:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Is there a file, "/usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh" ?
2009-05-27T09:59:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	Well it looks like I finally got it back to the way it started
2009-05-27T10:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Please don't use profanity
2009-05-27T10:01:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	I didn't mean to offend anyone
2009-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Have you run the uninstall script?
2009-05-27T10:04:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	how do I run an uninstall script?
2009-05-27T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	I think it's /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh but I haven't used it before and I'm juggling a lot right now :)
2009-05-27T10:11:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	ok, I ran the uninstall script
2009-05-27T10:35:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	No go.  It stuck me in "low graphics mode"
2009-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Go to Hardware Drivers and disable the driver ( or run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" )
2009-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	Not sure how to get the proprietary driver working
2009-05-27T10:37:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	get this, in hardware drivers it says it's in use, but the check box isn't checked
2009-05-27T10:39:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	so now what?
2009-05-27T10:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiseman	I don't know
2009-05-27T11:24:00.000Z	wiseman	Jordan_U	Hello again
