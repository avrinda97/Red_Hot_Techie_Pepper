2010-06-02T20:48:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	thanks a lot
2010-06-02T20:59:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	what do you mean? if you need 2 users to view/edit a file put them in the same group.. put the file in that group and give the group rw privs to the file
2010-06-02T21:02:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	magnen, there are 2 user accounts so 2 home directories..both dir can be viewed /modified from each account
2010-06-02T21:03:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	thats how it is now or thats how you want to set it up?

2010-06-02T21:04:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	ls -Fla on the /home folder pastebin it if you dont know how to read the permissions
2010-06-02T21:15:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	my connection disconnected

2010-06-02T21:23:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	looks like only ashish has write privs to those files but all have read... execpt the Ubuntu One directory
2010-06-02T21:24:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	can we change the read permissions to not accessible?
2010-06-02T21:25:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	yes... the program you want to use is chmod try typing man chmod and reading a bit
2010-06-02T21:27:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	i think you would want to cd /home
2010-06-02T21:28:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	look up forgot to add your name
2010-06-02T21:29:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	what would this do?
2010-06-02T21:30:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	chmod o-r will remove read privileges to a file from the "everyone" group as in anyone on the system
2010-06-02T21:35:00.000Z	a5h15h	voglster	thanks a lot..have a nice day
2010-06-02T21:35:00.000Z	voglster	a5h15h	anytime ;-)
