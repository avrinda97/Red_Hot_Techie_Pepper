2005-09-18T13:11:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	you're trying plain 'apt-get -f install' with no arguments?
2005-09-18T13:11:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	topyli	yes
2005-09-18T13:12:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	python2.4-opengl is an argument. lose it
2005-09-18T13:13:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	sounds like your system is in a bad state. you could try removing the package with dpkg and --force
2005-09-18T13:14:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	topyli	i'm trying it with build-dep, looks like there's some issues there that synaptic and apt-get didn't tell me about :|
2005-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	topyli	nope, didn't work...the problem seems to be that apt-get has cached the package as the very first item
2005-09-18T13:17:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	dpkg doesn't care about apt
2005-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	there's a file you can edit somewhere in /var to fool dpkg into thinking the package is ok. still looking
2005-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	topyli	i tried dpkg -r --force-all, it just tells me the package is in an inconsistent state
2005-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	topyli	do you know where packages from apt are cached?
2005-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	/var/lib/dpkg/status. make sure to make a backup
2005-09-18T13:19:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	/var/cache/apt/archives. but this is not an apt problem imo
2005-09-18T13:22:00.000Z	topyli	WMCoolmon	obviously it makes it hard for dpkg to install things :)
