2006-11-22T07:06:00.000Z	britt		do i need a special kernel for amd64?
2006-11-22T07:06:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	no, a 32bit kernel will run fine
2006-11-22T07:08:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	actually, i've seen the opposite said here.  no references though
2006-11-22T07:08:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	that a 64 kernel will slow things down?
2006-11-22T07:09:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	as i said, no reference sorry
2006-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	mythtv should be ok.  I've only really heard of issues with flash and w32codecs on 64bit
2006-11-28T09:25:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	/etc/inittab
2006-11-28T09:25:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	genius!
2006-11-28T09:28:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	doesnt exist
2006-11-28T09:29:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	ah yes, won't be on edgy, hmm
2006-11-28T09:30:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	although it was on sarge
2006-11-28T09:30:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	edgy uses upstart (not init)
2006-11-28T09:31:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	lucky me :/
2006-11-28T09:35:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	hrm, can't see it on my edgy install.  Dapper's inittab includes some sample lines: "/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100".  Give that a try.
2006-11-28T09:35:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	apparently there's a dir called event.d
2006-11-28T09:35:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	ah
2006-11-28T09:38:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	I'll pastebin the inittab from my dapper install - it has some sample lines that might be enought hints to make a /etc/event.d/ttyS0
2006-11-28T09:40:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34460/ (near the bottom)
2006-11-28T09:43:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	ttyS0 (start) running, process 11088 active
2006-11-28T09:43:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	i don't know sorry, I've never done it.  I'm making educated guesses.  Looks promising though :)
2006-11-28T09:44:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	i appreciate your help :)
2006-11-28T09:45:00.000Z	bimberi	britt	cool!  can't say the same here (kids want to play games that need shockwave :/ )
2006-11-28T09:46:00.000Z	britt	bimberi	i have a mythtv box with 320GBs of video space, a ibook with edgy ubuntu
