2006-10-13T09:55:00.000Z	Zambezi		Transfer files between two Ubuntucomputer? Need help.
2006-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	you can use scp
2006-10-13T09:57:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	scp or rsync
2006-10-13T09:57:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	rixth awilcox  Scp is slow. Only 1300 KB/s with gftp.
2006-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	Is rsync grafic?
2006-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	no, but it's easy to use... best suited for incremental updates though.  Otherwise scp is good
2006-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	I installed openssh-client on the recieving computer. But 1300 KB/S is like 20% off possible speed.
2006-10-13T10:01:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	scp should give you higher throughput, I think... Are you on dialup?
2006-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	No. Fast broadband and both computer in the same room.
2006-10-13T10:04:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	oh - you got 1.3MB/s then? I read it as 1.3KB/s
2006-10-13T10:05:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	awilcox  The LAN is 100 MBit. Will rsync replace openssh-server?
2006-10-13T10:06:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	isn't rsync is an intelligent frontend to ssh?
2006-10-13T10:07:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	Jag would like to transfer the files secure, but faster than 1,3 MB/s. 5 MB/s is okay, 10 MB/s would be wounderful.
2006-10-13T10:09:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	scp has never been too slow for me,  but I don't know how close it comes to maxing out your network connection
2006-10-13T10:10:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	With Windows I had 7-7.5 MB/s.
2006-10-13T10:11:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	Linux can't be so much slower. I transfered the files in Windows with encryption.
2006-10-13T10:13:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	What about this packages "scponly"?
2006-10-13T10:15:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	I don't know - you could try rcp instead of scp (apt-cache points to rsh-client),  which is less secure,  but that doesn't matter for your private LAN
2006-10-13T10:16:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	I prefer high security for my LAN too.
2006-10-13T10:17:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	If I can tripple the speed it's enough.
2006-10-13T10:20:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	Check here. It sounds good.
2006-10-13T10:26:00.000Z	JDahl	Zambezi	was getting some coffee - click where?
2006-10-13T10:27:00.000Z	Zambezi	JDahl	On the link. It has support for SFTP too. The adress is: http://www.sublimation.org/scponly/
