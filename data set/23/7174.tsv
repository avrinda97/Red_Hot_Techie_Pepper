2005-12-18T08:18:00.000Z	soundray		I think the Grumpy Editor series is great...
2005-12-18T08:20:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	glib and gtk are already ported
2005-12-18T08:20:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	evolution/xchat/gaim all use them
2005-12-18T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	it'll still be a fair amount of work, not least because of the lib dependencies.
2005-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	and as I said just now, most of the libraries are ported
2005-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	in fact all of the libraries it depends on have been ported
2005-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	I know what you said. gnomefreak will still have to do a fair amount of work if he wants to port gperiodic to Cygwin.
2005-12-18T08:24:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	correct, although I still contend cygwin wouldnt be the correct approach
2005-12-20T12:01:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	wanna pick a flamewar over my favourite encyclopedia?
2005-12-20T12:01:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	nope :)
2006-01-23T17:16:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	cool!
2006-01-23T10:22:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	and the same thing ("auto" removal) can be done through network-conf?
2006-01-23T10:22:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	well ish, you can disable a connection, which should do the same thing I think
2006-01-23T10:23:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	I may be wrong, but in my experience, it gets re-enabled after reboot.
2006-01-23T10:23:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	hmm, that sounds like a bug then
2006-01-23T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	oops, sorry, you were right. It does remove auto. I must have not closed it with okay previously.
2006-01-23T15:48:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	you are so right. I promise this will be my last line on the issue in this channel.
2006-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	correct, made by lucent/avaya or whatever they are called this week ;)
2006-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	thanks. Had a mental block there...
2006-03-05T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	I was just getting ready to mock you :)
2006-03-07T16:56:00.000Z	Ng	soundray	its memory usage is often misread and is easy to alter in 1.5
2006-03-07T16:57:00.000Z	soundray	Ng	thanks, I'll look it up when I get fed up with restarting it ;)
