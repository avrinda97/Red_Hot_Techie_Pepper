2009-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		Since I've upgraded to karmic, my opengl performance has been terrible
2009-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I'm using the Nvidia closed source drivers
2009-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		Quake Wars is all laggy now, where it wasn't before karmic
2009-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I have a fairly decent machine, quad core, 8 gigs of ram, GTX 280
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	cowbud	NoobFukaire	are you sure you are actually using that driver? i'd run a lsmod | grep nv and see if nvidia is returned and not nv
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		it should be able to handle quake wars on medium settings, yet Karmic stutters and lags badly
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		No, I"m sure i"m using the official one
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I do opengl development
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		and nv has no hardware 3d support
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		 lsmod | grep nvidia
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		nvidia              10316904  26
2009-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		but for the hell of it ;)
2009-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	cowbud	NoobFukaire	I know nv has no 3d accel hence my question, I would suggest filing a bug
2009-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	NoobFukaire	cowbud	okay thanks, I was curious if it was a well known issue or not
2009-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	cowbud	NoobFukaire	typically if a quick google doesn't return anything and you know what you are doing you are probably stuck with a new issue :(
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		yeah I was just making sure
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	cowbud	NoobFukaire	do other opengl apps run fine?
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		that google wasn't missing
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		generally they work okay, it's more obvious when you're really taxing the hardware
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		this is also an upgrade and not a clean install
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I was also thinking it could be a kernel/driver issue
2009-11-15T09:57:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I may try the nvidia beta drivers and see if it helps
2009-11-15T09:59:00.000Z	cowbud	NoobFukaire	technically doing an upgrade that shouldn't matter but if you are getting hardware accel in other apps and just not this one (There are other games you could try that 'tax' the hardware) then it may be a bug, any weird output when you start it?
