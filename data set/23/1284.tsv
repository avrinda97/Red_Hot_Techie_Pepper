2010-05-30T04:24:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	 can you use the cd to boot another pc?
2010-05-30T04:25:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	yes i can use this cd to boot another pc but not my laptop which is messed up. i just want to recover the files on the hdd by booting into livecd or something
2010-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	be sure your laptop is actually booting from the cd, check the boot options
2010-05-30T04:27:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	 but it gives me the cd menu.. i.e "Run without changes to computer" "Boot from first disk" etc so it must be loading from the cd
2010-05-30T04:28:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	and its only after this menu appears your getting the notice about the hdd? or just before?
2010-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	it's only after the menu has appeared and after i have selected "try ubuntu without any changes to your computer" .. after i choose this option i gett he ubuntu loading screen for a minute or so, then a black screen with a load of DRDY ERR errors
2010-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	can i assume that your HDD is not bootable at all, or it boots just fine
2010-05-30T04:34:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	no you see i dropped the laptop a couple of days ago. after i dropped it it worked fine for a few hours (i was on windows at the time) and so i assumed it was OK. then the next day i tried to start up the laptop and couldn't boot either windows or ubuntu
2010-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	unfortunately i think your HDD is damaged, can you tell during the boot process if the HDD even spins up?
2010-05-30T04:40:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	i'm not sure.. how can i tell that?  hmm i just selected the "check disc for defects" option  on the ubuntu cd menu. it got some errors at first saying "I/O error on device sda6 logical block __" then it ran some checks and said "Check finished: no errors found"
2010-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	during the boot process when you 1st power the laptop is when the drive spins up and the bios checks the boot order etc, are you comfortable with removing parts from your laptop,?
2010-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	well i can remove the casing of the laptop so i can see the harddrive and everything.. what is it you think i should do? by the way if i don't have a cd in the cd drive it will go to the grub bootloader and give me the option for windows or linux.. so doesn't that mean the hard disk is working?
2010-05-30T04:49:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	yes it does if you are dual booting, will it allow you to boot fully into ubuntu or windows?
2010-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	no, windows just stalls on the windows 7 loading screen indefinitely... and ubuntu gives me the DRDY ERR if i try to boot it.
2010-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	i just managed to boot the ubuntu livecd for the first time.. i don't know why but it worked this time (maybe to do with running the defect check?)
2010-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	yes there is, try checking the disk for errors
2010-05-30T04:56:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	try something like: sudo e2fsck -c /dev/sda5 or whichever letter your faulty hdd is
2010-05-30T04:57:00.000Z	azolap	Dizkonnekted	how can i check the disk for errors? Typos_King i tried to mount the WINDOWS volume (cause i want to get my files from windows) but it said "unable to mount location - did not receive a reply"
2010-05-30T05:13:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	type sudo fdisk -l that will get you what you need
2010-05-30T06:15:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	if there are bad blocks or your drive is badly damaged, that can take some time to complete yes, it may aslo appear to be "stuck" but generally if the HDD indicator light is still on its working
2010-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	once it gets past the bad sections it will, the fall probable damaged the drive a lot
2010-05-30T06:19:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	azolap	np ;)
