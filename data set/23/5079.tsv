2007-03-02T10:26:00.000Z	n-iCe		How can i read them ?
2007-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	you have to use openoffice
2007-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 than you very much, can i find it in symnaptic ?
2007-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	it should be installed by default
2007-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 really ? let me check
2007-03-02T10:31:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 isn't there
2007-03-02T10:31:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	try running ooimpress from the command line
2007-03-02T10:31:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	if it doesn't exist, the package name is openoffice.org-impress
2007-03-02T10:33:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 ok than you !
2007-03-02T10:33:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 any idea how can i install my lexmark 1100 printer ?
2007-03-02T10:34:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	i do not know what the xubuntu tool for cups is called
2007-03-02T10:34:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	in principle though that will provide you with a gui to configure the printer
2007-03-02T10:35:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 i'm new then i don't know what do you mean =p
2007-03-02T10:36:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	setting up printers is kind of tricky, i would look in the forums for your printer model
2007-03-02T10:45:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	: http://linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Lexmark-X1185 check this
2007-03-02T10:58:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	another operating system (unix)
2007-03-05T17:28:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	i read it and isn't for 6.10
2007-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	you just need to enable multiverse and install sun-java5-jre
2007-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 then:  sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre ?
2007-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	eck	n-iCe	yes, that is correct
2007-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	n-iCe	eck	 thank you
