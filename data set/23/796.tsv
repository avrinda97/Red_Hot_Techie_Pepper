2012-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	mimi_		thanks Oli ....in this instance, it's with skype
2012-07-16T13:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mimi_	 start from the beginning, what do you want to achieve, what have you done before you came here
2012-07-16T13:29:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	...I installed skype (4) and initially it worked fine. After a short period it now crashes on log in  :(   ....it seems to crash when the window resizes to what I changed it to
2012-07-16T13:29:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	 ...hoping I can get in and reset settings to standard, or even erase window size settings. Doesn't matter if the program won't start, because it's alreayd not working
2012-07-16T13:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mimi_	 skype 4, a ppa?
2012-07-16T13:30:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	I downloaded skype 4 from skype website and then installed via Software Centre
2012-07-16T13:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mimi_	 skype is also in the partner repos
2012-07-16T13:32:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	I'd like to muddle through this (and learn) so finding where program configuration files are would be handy please
2012-07-16T13:32:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	thanks. but what are 'partner repos' and where does one find them ??
2012-07-16T13:34:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mimi_	 repos are software sources, partners are non-ubuntu, well... partners
2012-07-16T13:35:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	thanks ...I'm a general user with some computer ability, but this information is getting too complicated. thanks for the help though
2012-07-16T13:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mimi_	 don't start with an external program if you're just learning
2012-07-16T13:37:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	an external program?  ...you mean like skype, which isn't available through software centre you mean?
2012-07-16T13:38:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	this is just too tempting for me though!!  haha  ...  ;)
2012-07-16T13:38:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	histo ...skype files aren't in .gconf  :((
2012-07-16T13:39:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	histo ..I'll keep searching I guess ... thanks
2012-07-16T13:40:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	...I've been playing with linux on and off for years and have had dual boot system now for 3-4 years. I use linux for 98% of the time these days
2012-07-16T13:41:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	histo  ..ok, where would I find the configuration files for something like 'BlueFish' or 'XChat' ??  (they're not in .gconf that I can see
2012-07-16T13:42:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	histo ...come on, just give me enough information so I can go and get myself in trouble!! haha  ;)

2012-07-16T13:51:00.000Z	mimi_	MonkeyDust	histo ...you guys are no fun ...thanks anyway ... ciao
