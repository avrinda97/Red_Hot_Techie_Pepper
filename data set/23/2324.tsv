2009-05-26T14:40:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	#telepathy
2009-05-26T14:40:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	possibly on irc.gnome.org would be better
2009-05-26T14:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	Your answer is essently wrong: There are discussing insiders among themselves Telepathy.
2009-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	You mean it isn't a support channel? OK well here works just as well - I jsut thought they might know more specific things
2009-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	Thank you for commenting.
2009-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	Empathy works for me here. What are you having problems with?
2009-05-26T14:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	I tested it with two 9.04 Ubunteros. I received the voice of one of them well but the voice readabilty of the other was only <5%. The voice was often interrupted and in addition chopped with a frequency of about 7 Hz. Both test partners could not understand my voice.
2009-05-26T14:48:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	I would suggest the #telepathy channel >.< that does suck
2009-05-26T14:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	I put a question in the #telepathy channel at 3 different times at 3 different days. I never got an answer.
2009-05-26T14:51:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	ah. Well I am sorry you are having this problem. I can't really help, but just form curiosity how does it sound when you call yourself?
2009-05-26T14:52:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	also are you using the telepathy ppa with latest builds?
2009-05-26T14:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	I do not know how to call myself using Empathy voice chat.
2009-05-26T14:52:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	I guess you would need to jabber accounts
2009-05-26T14:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	One Ubuntero used the telepathy PPA as a test. There was no improvement in voice readibility. Just no difference.
2009-05-26T14:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	I do have a Jabber account.

2009-05-26T15:10:00.000Z	kholerabbi1	bullgard4	ah, you would need two seperate accounts with Jabber or Google Talk I gather
2009-05-26T15:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	kholerabbi1	Ah, ok. Thank you.
