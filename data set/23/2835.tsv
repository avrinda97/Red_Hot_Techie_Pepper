2008-11-03T17:35:00.000Z	nickbooker		hi  I'm trying to fix suspend/hibernate on one of our laptops, which has to run Intrepid for graphics to work.
2008-11-03T17:36:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	sry
2008-11-03T17:36:00.000Z	nickbooker		Asus X51L
2008-11-03T17:37:00.000Z	nickbooker		What I need to know is where I should put my fixes nowadays -- up to hardy I'd have edited scripts in /etc/acpi, but I've read that the acpi-support is deprecated now.
2008-11-03T17:37:00.000Z	nickbooker		So where do I put my pre- and post- suspend scripts?
2008-11-03T17:38:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	not quite sure - google may be a help, but what graphics driver are u running?
2008-11-03T17:38:00.000Z	nickbooker		Intel
2008-11-03T17:39:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	google wasn't too helpful when I tried the other day.
2008-11-03T17:39:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	sry. what graphics driver are u running?
2008-11-03T17:44:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Where do I find out what driver is being used?  xorg.conf is as good as non-existent
2008-11-03T17:45:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Anyway the suspend/hibernate issue is with the wireless card.
2008-11-03T17:46:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	are there any bugs in launchpad associated with the problem?
2008-11-03T17:46:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	There wasn't last time I checked (Friday).  I'll have another look...
2008-11-03T17:47:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Should I search specifically for the laptop, for the wireless driver or for the wireless card model?
2008-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	just enter suspend and the wireless card, then try the driver
2008-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Thanks.
2008-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	dovel		nickbooder: found something?
2008-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	found something?
2008-11-03T17:51:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Something similar (#272169), but in my case the machine does come back, but wifi simply doesn't connect.  Attempting to connect wireless then messes up the next shutdown or suspend attempt.
2008-11-03T17:53:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Does /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d look like the right place?  Mentioned in another mildly-related bug report.
2008-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	dovel	nickbooker	that's a directory of various network related files
2008-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Looks like it'll do what I want.  Thanks for your search term suggestions -- they made all the difference.
2008-11-03T19:57:00.000Z	nickbooker	dovel	Thanks for your guidance, problem solved.
