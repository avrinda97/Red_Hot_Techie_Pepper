2012-09-06T20:14:00.000Z	Coded1	actionParsnip	good question
2012-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	Coded1	actionParsnip	it's a start but I still cant resize
2012-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Coded1	got resize enabled too?
2012-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	Coded1	actionParsnip	lol talk about starting from scratch eh, ya everything is enabled.  I guess I just can't get the bar back that will allow me to max/minimize?
