2008-08-19T11:03:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	that rcS file is nice. All these rc files. I never know where to find what I want. rc.conf Arch and BSD style is much more simpler
2008-08-19T11:04:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	I had searched FOREVER to find the right file to edit for this problem. I was so happy when I finally found it.
2008-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	in Arch it's everything in one file. No symlink mess
2008-08-19T11:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	Wow, that must be nice, but doesn't the file get kind of long then?
2008-08-19T11:08:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	not really. And it's full of comments explaining everything
2008-08-19T11:10:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	You know, I've been using Ubuntu, Fedora, and Solaris for a number of years now. I think I'm about ready to try something like Arch.
2008-08-19T11:10:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	you'll learn a lot of stuff with Arch. I did
2008-08-19T11:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	So is it pretty much all compiling source?
2008-08-19T11:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	We're getting a bit off topic here, :p
2008-08-19T11:12:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	yes, you're right. Mind if I PM you?
2008-08-19T11:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	sure thing
2008-08-21T08:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	I think prock means, substituting workspaces for the cube caps. By the way, you can have a top and bottom cap, R _YoYo_R
2008-08-21T08:34:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	the problem is that I don't know what cube cap means
2008-08-21T08:35:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	R_YoYo_R : ok. Thanks to both. I now know what he means. Since I don't see the cube as having a top and bottom (since it's always changing as you move it) I didn't understood
2008-09-09T06:22:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	you know if cory_ has tried this? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/RadeonXpress
2008-09-09T06:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	I doubt he has. I was trying to find that very entry. Things can be so hard to find in there sometimes :p
2008-09-25T02:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	He's not here. ubottu has been a sick bot the past few days :D
2008-09-25T02:07:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	damn. I need the bot. Is he available somewhere else? I want to take a look at his mind
2008-09-25T02:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	Hopefully they'll put ubot3 up for a while.
2008-09-28T11:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	Who in there right mind would do such a thing??
2008-09-28T11:16:00.000Z	carandraug	bobertdos	I guy I was helping. I figured it out with "sudo fdisk -l" (no ext3 partition appeared). He didn't knew if he installed with wubi or not
2008-09-28T11:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	Heh, that's........special :p
2008-09-30T23:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	carandraug	to remove the line that references the edgy cd
