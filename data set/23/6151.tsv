2006-06-14T12:59:00.000Z	mcpowley		 60 hd, then using the 320 for the filesystem for both systesms like a 320 gb fat32 hd?
2006-06-14T13:00:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 not sure about the speed... is that a firewire or USB based external drive?
2006-06-14T13:01:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 uhh do you know if its USB 2.0 or not? theres a majob speed boost between USB 2.0 and earlier
2006-06-14T13:04:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 refering from Wikipedia, USB 2.0 has at least 50Mb / second transfer rate, that should be sufficent for casual gaming
2006-06-14T13:06:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	you can also do that too-- but Im not sure if theres an easy _and_ automatic way of setting up a bootup menu for you to choose between Windows and Ubuntu/Linux.. this thing does exist, but you may have to get your hands dirty a bit
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	mcpowley	Bilange	So If I went ahead and installed ubuntu on an ext 3 20 gig partition, when I boot my computer, it would boot into windows automatically?
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 Did you say you had a 60gb internal drive? you can also use 30/30 for every os too
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 actually I have a 40gb here, and its more than enough if you download not oo much
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 well in this case I might save the external for moving data around, like Isos and such, and keep the windows' side of the disk for games
2006-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 my point is: keep the windows partition for gaming and ONLY that... downloads, patches, and _Everything_ except games installation can be put on your external, so you have more room for gaming
2006-06-14T13:16:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 well... consider a standard ubuntu installation needs like 3 gb to barely breathe, afterwards it depends of how much you add up new programs... but my guess is that you may be able to live well with 10gb, and add an external ext2 on your external too
2006-06-14T13:17:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 err, I meant: and you could also add up with an external ext2 partition for a complementary /home directory... i think you got the point :)
2006-06-14T13:19:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 basically no, but... [typing] 
2006-06-14T13:19:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 most people likes to add another partition for the /home directory, where most of the user downloads usually go
2006-06-14T13:20:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 but thats totally optionnal. the major advantage of doing this is that you can always reinstall ubuntu or any other linux distribution while keeping most of your settings for your programs
2006-06-14T13:21:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 for the swap, since you mentionned you had only like 64mb of memory, its quite vital, yeah...
2006-06-14T13:22:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 but the /home partition is quite necessary too.. you may boot even if your USB drive isnt there, but once you logged in, the system would whine about not finding your settings (aka the /home directory), so Im not sure how the system would react
2006-06-14T13:24:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 oh, sorry. I saw someone else answer gave me his specs and though he was you. Since you have 2gb of swap file, you dont need to make a big partition for swapping... 1gb will do
2006-06-14T13:26:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 to give you an example, on my 40gb installation, i have 15gb for /, 25 or so for /home, and the rest for my swap
2006-06-14T13:27:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 but if you use your external drive alot, you may also trim your /home a bit, but id say that 10 to 15gb for the / partition is more than sufficent, whatever you choose
2006-06-14T13:30:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 sounds good, as long as you dont fear about getting slowdowns when gaming from your external drive... you can also enlarge your windows partition by reducing the /home one, keeping /home big enough for your most important data (when you're not going to have your external around)
2006-06-14T13:35:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 welcome :)
2006-06-14T13:36:00.000Z	Bilange	mcpowley	 hmm, i would install windows first, then ubuntu
