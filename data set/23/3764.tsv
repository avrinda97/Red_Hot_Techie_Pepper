2008-01-26T19:50:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	it seems to be there
2008-01-26T19:53:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	yes, now it mounted. I was too noob to remove the casper name, since I was already in the directory...
2008-01-26T19:54:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	i'm in the firmware directory
2008-01-26T19:58:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	you lost me there... now if I put ls -la in the //mnt/lib/firmware I can see that there's 2.6.22-14-generic file?
2008-01-26T19:58:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	I mean directory
2008-01-26T19:59:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	wait a moment. I'll (try to) do that
2008-01-26T20:01:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	does the number 2.6.22-14 tell me it's the same or do I have to dig further to the files?
2008-01-26T20:04:00.000Z	ravennium	bkar	thanks for this.. have to go now..
