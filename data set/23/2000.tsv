2009-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	bummer!
2009-08-06T07:57:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	i know!
2009-08-06T07:57:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	i'm going to call it a lost cause! i don't need it that bad!
2009-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	maybe that's something that works when eeebuntu gets all its updates
2009-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	perhaps
2009-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	how do we go forth with installing it permanently?
2009-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	or it could break it like regular UNR
2009-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	is there an install icon on your desktop?
2009-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	yes but how do i exit nbr desktop! i can't get to it
2009-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	I think that needs to be added after you install
2009-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	i know but it is open
2009-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	and i can't get to the desktop! :(
2009-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	open??
2009-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	deexannihilate	mint-mdg	sudo netbook-launcher, displays it
2009-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	you mean you need to close synaptic?
2009-08-06T08:02:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	go to a terminal and type:  pidof netbook-launcher
2009-08-06T08:02:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	it will tell you a 4 digit number or so
2009-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	sudo killall netbook-launcher
2009-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	mint-mdg	deexannihilate	okay.  I may have to leave soon....
