2004-10-27T06:01:00.000Z	Kamion		there's a rant somewhere in the X documentation about "X-Windows" :)
2004-10-27T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	thanks
2004-12-09T17:45:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	very intrusive IMHO; consider somebody upgrading 100 machines
2004-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	yep. Sorry 'bout that.
2005-01-03T15:59:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	main reason is that we didn't want to use up precious space on the CD with lots of alternative kernels
2005-01-03T16:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	mp_ probably. :)
2005-01-04T17:45:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	I suppose 0.3.8-1 from Sid needs to be compiled with Hoary's python2.4
2005-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	I suppose you could do something akin to #3426, syncing from Debian
2005-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	hm?
2005-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	that'd be an excuse for updating 'bittornado' in hoary/universe
2005-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	;)
2005-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	I don't understand. That bug's fixed; the changes in Ubuntu were superseded by changes in Debian.
2005-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	sorry, you misunderstood me (and I was unclear)
2005-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	(note that that bug's assigned to me ...)
2005-01-04T17:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	in any case, it's not an issue; the version in sid is newer than in hoary/universe, so one could use that as rationale to update
2005-01-04T17:56:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	uh ... no it's not?
2005-01-04T17:57:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	right
2005-01-10T17:51:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	they do? I looked a while ago and didn't find one
2005-01-10T06:03:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	why> security update, obviously ...
2005-01-10T06:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	hence why I'm asking about the .1 :)
2005-01-22T14:08:00.000Z	Kamion	crimsun	not reliable because dpkg preserves build times in .debs
2005-01-22T14:08:00.000Z	crimsun	Kamion	ah, true.
