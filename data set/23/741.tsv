2011-03-02T19:58:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	yeah i checksummed it it's fine
2011-03-02T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	you could use the alternate cd to install then sort out the issues with compiz later.  Make sure you checksum the cd (/msg ubottu verify)
2011-03-02T19:56:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	that's what i'm doing now and sources.list is empty
2011-03-02T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	you said "live cd".  Why?
2011-03-02T19:57:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	either live or install, they both dont work, it's an intel graphics problem
2011-03-02T19:58:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	ok, let's use the alternate cd.  Did you checksum it?
2011-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	The INTEL R 82810 GRAPHICS
2011-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	what version of ubuntu is this?
2011-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	10.10
2011-03-02T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	why did you say earlier that sources.list is empty?
2011-03-02T20:00:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	the sources.list is empty. because I have finished an install from the alternate cd.
2011-03-02T20:01:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	so now you are saying you successfully installed ubuntu by using the alternate cd?
2011-03-02T20:01:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	i know it doesnt make sense, but I've installed over 12 cds of different flavours trying to make it work, nothing but the OLD 7.10, or 5.10's work fro mubuntu
2011-03-02T20:02:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	i'm not mucking you around, this laptop is a nightmare to install ubuntu onto
2011-03-02T20:02:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	i should give up and go bk to xp soon if i cant get it to run
2011-03-02T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	I'm trying to undertsand your current state
2011-03-02T20:03:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	i've got a laptop, with an alternate cd 10.10 ubuntu installed. it's on cli. it shows me an empty sources.list with vi.
2011-03-02T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	well I'd say that's not a successful install if your /etc/apt/sources.list is empty
2011-03-02T20:08:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	i've installed it badly i bet. however. my intel graphics is the problem here.
2011-03-02T20:09:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	what's the best ubuntu for the intel The INTEL R 82810 GRAPHICS
2011-03-02T20:09:00.000Z	jrib	citrus23455	do the install again. If you have a blank sources.list, something is wrong and it's likely a sign that other things are broken.  If you verified the integrity of the cd, then something else went wrong
2011-03-02T20:10:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	drat
2011-03-02T20:10:00.000Z	citrus23455	jrib	need to pee brb
