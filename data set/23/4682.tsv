2007-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	Tiradin		Anyone know how to further change the colour scheme in Xchat?
2007-06-01T11:07:00.000Z	Tiradin		Who was it that said they use Xchat?
2007-06-01T11:08:00.000Z	Tiradin		lol  well then SOMEONE in here should know how I can get access to the full colour scheme
2007-06-01T11:08:00.000Z	Tiradin		and how to change it.
2007-06-01T11:08:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	i dont.. in any case there a some themes on the homepage somewhere.
2007-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	Tiradin		Toma: already done... not extensive enough :/
2007-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	google it .. take a look at the official forum and from there on you'll find some links.
2007-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	good advice, thank you...
2007-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	that how i found it a few years ago :)
2007-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	Tiradin		:P
2007-06-01T11:10:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	How about minimizing Xchat off my bottom panel? :P
2007-06-01T11:10:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	do you mean the tray?
2007-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	most likely... the Xchat icon is already in the top right panel... i want to minimize it OFF the bottom panel, so it's only up there :P
2007-06-01T11:12:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	hmm afaik know that should be standard behaviour as of feisty. are you on feisty?
2007-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	did you click on the tray icon? (top right) and not just minimize it?
2007-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	if feisty is Ubuntu 7.04 or which
2007-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	Tiradin		whichever*
2007-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	idefixx		!paste | Tru7h
2007-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	clicking the Xchat icon does work.. i didn't know that
2007-06-01T11:14:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	:)
2007-06-01T11:16:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	AHAH! i have to do the colour in CODE
2007-06-01T11:17:00.000Z	idefixx	Tiradin	i think, its been a long time since i used xchat.. i know there a some theme files... that essentialy just set colors in a script.
2007-06-01T11:19:00.000Z	Tiradin	idefixx	I just confirmed it... if you go to "text events" in the Settings > Advanced, it gives you all the events colour coded.... the codes correspond to the colours in Preferences > Colors
