2009-11-01T11:13:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	no idea what you mean by "load up bar"
2009-11-01T11:13:00.000Z	oorah	Blue1	you know when you turn on the computer and you see the status bar of the boot up?
2009-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	downgrade what?
2009-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	oorah	Blue1	my Xubuntu version?
2009-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	I think you'd install a previous version then
2009-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	does non sequitur mean anything to you?
2009-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	oorah	Blue1	whats that?
2009-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	why would you want to downgrade to the current release?  (non sequitur -- literally "no sequence")
2009-11-07T09:55:00.000Z	oorah	Blue1	i wanna downgrade to 9.04, karmic is too buggy on my system
2009-11-07T09:55:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	then you'd have to install 9.04
2009-11-07T09:56:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	9.10 is marginal -- but it's getting better
2009-11-07T09:56:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	ditto on the usb
2009-11-07T09:57:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	sometimes I restart the gdm and that helps - not always...
2009-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	I don't think 9.10 is quite ready for prime time - but for me to go back is to hard - you'd do a sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	oorah	Blue1	how about xfce?
2009-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	that restarts x and give you and new login screen
2009-11-07T09:59:00.000Z	Blue1	oorah	I already told you...  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
