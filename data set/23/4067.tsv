2008-09-27T23:52:00.000Z	chew		uhm, very strange, like i said, tried booting the livecd but it asks me for a login/password.. why is that? no ubuntu previously installed on the box
2008-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	chew		?
2008-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	Did you try logging in as root?
2008-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	root/root?
2008-09-27T23:54:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	Well probably root/no password
2008-09-27T23:57:00.000Z	chew		damnit, tried with ubuntu/ubuntu ubuntu/ root/root root/ but can't login, my friend is not using a login/password in windows at all
2008-09-27T23:58:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	what else can i do? i don't want to do a fresh install on that box without knowing if all the hw works properly
2008-09-27T23:59:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	Are you sure you've got the LiveCD Desktop edition and not server?
2008-09-27T23:59:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	yes
2008-09-28T00:01:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	and it is a login prompt as opposed to a command prompt?
2008-09-28T00:02:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	it's gdm/xdm or whatever ubuntu uses, it says 'User ubuntu will be logged in in 10 seconds" but goes back to GDM again
2008-09-28T00:04:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	If you can get to a regular command prompt, what happens when you try to start x? (startx)
2008-09-28T00:04:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	w8
2008-09-28T00:05:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	You're stuck at the login prompt, right? or is it a ttyl prompt?
2008-09-28T00:06:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	no it's GDM.
2008-09-28T00:06:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	i know what i'm doing :) it's just weird that it's asking me for a login/passwd on the livecd
2008-09-28T00:06:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	some ppl on the ubuntuforums etc are experiencing the same problem
2008-09-28T00:07:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	if you google for 'ubuntu 8.04 default username'
2008-09-28T00:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	I know this is common, actually. We just have never been able to narrow it down to one solution. So you are getting into GDM briefly, which means X IS in fact starting.
2008-09-28T00:09:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	yes, it seems to be working like it should except that i can't access X.. don't know what to do then, i can't install ubuntu on my friend box without trying it out first ;)
2008-09-28T00:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	chew	Well, maybe it would be worth seeing if you can get the server edition working and worry about the X issues later.
2008-09-28T00:13:00.000Z	bobertdos		just a thought
2008-09-28T00:16:00.000Z	chew	bobertdos	yep, tomorrow. ;) but it's a little bit weird though.. thank you.
