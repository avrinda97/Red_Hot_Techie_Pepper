2007-02-18T14:23:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	try the following: dmesg | grep CD
2007-02-18T14:27:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	nothing happens
2007-02-18T14:28:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	It just goes down to the next line
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	It maybe that your cd drive was not recognized. Try the following: "dmesg | less" and look for a mention of hard disks (hda, hdb, etc) and cd drives.
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	Scroll with the arrow keys in less.
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	to exit type :q and press enter.
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	kubota		okay
2007-02-18T14:30:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	I'll try it real quick.
2007-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	I see mention of HDA, it says ide0.. The maxtor HDD is at hda.. I don't see anything about a CD-ROM drive
2007-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	It looks like your cd rom drive is not being recognized by the kernel. I am sorry about that.
2007-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	So that means I'm out of luck?
2007-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	With any linux distro?
2007-02-18T14:37:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	Could I just purchase a new Cd-rom drive?
2007-02-18T14:38:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	I am not sure... Maybe other distros could work.
2007-02-18T14:38:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	okay. Do you have any recomendations for an older system? (p2)
2007-02-18T14:39:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	I'm running 6.06
2007-02-18T14:39:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	BTW.
2007-02-18T14:43:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	I am sorry; I don't have any suggestions... If you were able to install from the CD then you should be able to access your CD. I am stumped...

2007-02-18T15:07:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	Are you there?
2007-02-18T15:17:00.000Z	kubota	zzz_	i'm here
2007-02-18T15:24:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	You might want to start your computer from the live CD and see which modules are loaded using lsmod. You can then compare this list of modules to your installed system's lsmod listing.
2007-02-18T15:31:00.000Z	zzz_	kubota	Bye for now. See you tomorrow.
