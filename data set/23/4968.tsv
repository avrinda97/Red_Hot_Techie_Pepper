2007-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	kbidd		my computer is rejecting incoming connections -- iptables-save gives an empty output -- any ideas?
2007-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 could be the specific service config
2007-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	this computer is the DMZ on my network, and several apps are complaining of a firewall.
2007-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	kbidd		i use debian
2007-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 so you can't connect to the ubuntu machine in the DMZ from clients on the LAN?
2007-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	kbidd		westrel, no, connections from the outside the network arent getting to my computer even though its the DMZ.
2007-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 can you ping it from outside?
2007-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	i dont have a computer outside the network to test with.
2007-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 what protocols are you serving?
2007-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	ssh
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	(its torrent applications complaining of the failed connections, but i have openssh-server installed)
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 i assume you can connect to ssh on localhost, and from the LAN.  anything in /etc/hosts.allow and .deny
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	wastrel		?
2007-04-22T09:23:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	I just tried localhost, it works, and then from the LAN, and that failed.
2007-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 check hosts.allow and .deny
2007-04-22T09:26:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	where are those files?
2007-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 /etc/hosts.allow   /etc/hosts.deny  (nothing should be enabled by default... just make sure tho)
2007-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	those files dont exist.
2007-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	kbidd		theres an /etc/hosts file, but not /etc/hosts.allow or .deny
2007-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 interesting..  try creating them (blank is fine.)   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root
2007-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	 no change
2007-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	kbidd	wastrel	any ideas?
2007-04-22T09:32:00.000Z	wastrel	kbidd	 sry that's all i've got...
