2006-11-14T13:18:00.000Z	durrie		Anyone know how to get a NetoDragon 56k modem to work on Ubuntu
2006-11-14T13:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 i think those are based on the lucent chipset
2006-11-14T13:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 either way, that guide is your best bet :)
2006-11-14T13:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	web accelerators just plain don't work under linux.  at least, none that i've found.
2006-11-14T13:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 most of the time, you can just use the built-in ppp stuff in linux to make the connection.  you won't get the acceleration stuff, but it'll work.
2006-11-14T13:24:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	i'm in much the same boat.  i live in the boonies, and i THOUGHT dialup was my only answer...
2006-11-14T13:24:00.000Z	durrie	SilentDis	Well it is my only one. No one offers cable, dsl or ISDN here, nor satellite due to tree coverage
2006-11-14T13:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 but... there are wireless carriers that use non LOS service now.  most have 15 mile radius.  i'm looking into it now myself
2006-11-14T13:25:00.000Z	durrie	SilentDis	Also..it seems in order to dial into netscape i HAVE to use the program otherwise it will not authenticate
2006-11-14T13:25:00.000Z	durrie	SilentDis	Only wireless provider is 5 miles and they have a 3 quare mile range which I'm out of
2006-11-14T13:26:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	you're using netscape's dialup service?  they just use username/password.  nothing special
2006-11-14T13:26:00.000Z	durrie	SilentDis	Well it won't authenticate without the program though. I have tried everything
2006-11-14T13:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 give this page a check.  choose your state from the dropdown.  you'd be surprized by what's actually out there - http://www.onelasvegas.com/wireless/
2006-11-14T13:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 i no longer use their service, found a much better local carrier.  *shrug*
2006-11-14T13:28:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	I'm in VERY much the same boat lol
2006-11-14T13:28:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 satellite is available to me... but the 3000ms ping times scare me :P
2006-11-14T13:30:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 yes, up-front costs on satellite 'net access is VERY expensive
2006-11-14T13:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 the web accellerator is just not gonna happen, sorry to say.
2006-11-14T13:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 the client app won't run, period.  they don't make anything that'll run under *nix.  none of them do.  those things are geared toward the low-end user, and the low-end user runs windows.  :P
2006-11-14T13:36:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 i recently (well, 2 months ago) switched to ubuntu, and haven't looked back.  sans accellerator and all :)
2006-11-14T13:39:00.000Z	durrie	SilentDis	in a nut shell lol
2006-11-14T13:54:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	very cool :)
2006-11-14T13:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	durrie	 tried that.  i guess I'll have to call 'em tomorrow :P
