2012-06-03T14:00:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	have you checked the setting through Super + Sounds ??
2012-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	go to Sound Effect tab, check if you have checked the Mute option there
2012-06-03T14:02:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	if yes, uncheck it, or maybe the volume is set too low it is unheard
2012-06-03T14:03:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	have you checked the setting through Super + Sounds ??
2012-06-03T14:04:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	on your keyboard, press Windows button (in Ubuntu we call it Super button), then type "Sounds"
2012-06-03T14:05:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	go to Sound Effect tab, and check the alert (notification) setting there, either it is muted or turned to low volume
2012-06-03T14:07:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	what's wrong? (be nice here, please.. :) )
2012-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	you're welcome... so nothing goes wrong now?? ;(
2012-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	yes, 12.04 comes with default login sound, unfortunately you can't test it there..
2012-06-03T14:10:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	i see, try it then.. :)
2012-06-03T14:24:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	still doesn't work?
2012-06-03T14:25:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	good then
2012-06-03T14:26:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	never experienced that before, i just shift+delete all the time :d
2012-06-03T14:29:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	seems that it's been disabled by default version after update
2012-06-03T14:30:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	a minute, i'm looking for a remedy.. :)
2012-06-03T14:31:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	open terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/loginsound.desktop
2012-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	it will open a gedit program, copy paste this: [Desktop Entry]Name=GNOME Login SoundType=ApplicationExec=/usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id="desktop-login" --description="GNOME Login sound"
2012-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	quixotedon	Saqks	sorry, copy paste this: [Desktop Entry]
