2008-06-28T02:54:00.000Z	erisco		I tried   $su - <username> -c "iptables"    but it comes back saying    -su: iptables: command not found
2008-06-28T02:54:00.000Z	erisco		it works with other commands I tried... not iptables though
2008-06-28T02:54:00.000Z	erisco		I am getting PISSED.
2008-06-28T02:54:00.000Z	erisco		how can iptables magically not be found by -su?
2008-06-28T02:55:00.000Z	erisco		everything else is there! damn!
2008-06-28T02:56:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	maybe you should just walk away and chill out for a bit.
2009-01-08T05:51:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	open a web browser.
2009-01-08T05:52:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	then what?
2009-01-08T05:53:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	browse the web. if you can, then NAT is working
2009-01-08T05:54:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	I want to know what mode it is in though. ie moderate, open, or strict
2009-01-08T05:55:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	you're using xbox lingo... that's not how we look at nat here
2009-01-08T05:56:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	I know I am using xbox lingo :P
2009-01-08T05:56:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	I did research on NAT but couldn't really find how those terms translated
2009-01-08T05:57:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	so I am not particularly sure what to look for. I am running through two networks and I want to know which one has the NAT problems, or both
2009-01-08T05:57:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	it's all right here: http://forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php?t=451043  they refer to what ports are being forwarded
2009-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	thanks
2009-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	there's also this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=538796
2009-08-06T01:07:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	because opera sucks
2009-08-06T01:07:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	but it is running, for example, JBox2D much better
2009-08-06T01:08:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	Firefox will repeatedly freeze every few seconds while Opera will run it smoothly
2009-08-06T01:08:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	jbox2d is a web browser?
2009-08-06T01:08:00.000Z	erisco	Gnea	no it is a physics engine in java and you can test it as a browser applet
2009-08-06T01:08:00.000Z	Gnea	erisco	oh, I misread-sorry
