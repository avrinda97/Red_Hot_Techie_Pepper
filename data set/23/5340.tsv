2007-06-14T16:28:00.000Z	cows		does anyone know how to resume your laptops screen after you close it while its in console mode
2007-06-14T16:28:00.000Z	vox754	cows	laptop-specific question, works for some, it doesn't for others
2007-06-14T16:29:00.000Z	cows	vox754	wat you mean?
2007-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	cows	vox754	what do you mean laptop specific? i have a dell inspiron 1300
2007-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	vox754	cows	it really depends on your computer, hibernating and suspending doesn't work on all laptops, so you are better searching the forums for your specific model, maybe someone has already written a guide for it.
2007-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	cows	vox754	so i can
2007-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	cows	vox754	i cant close my laptop while its in console? cause hibernating etc worked on windows
2007-06-14T16:31:00.000Z	cows	vox754	also the laptop is on .. i can hear the sound etc, its just the screen is off
2007-06-14T16:32:00.000Z	vox754	cows	I tell you, it is laptop-specif, it depends on drivers, it is tricky. Unless the manufacturers cooperate, these stuff may never totally work reversed-engineered on Linux
2007-06-14T16:32:00.000Z	cows	vox754	i have 1 more question. do you know how to connect a wireless card via terminal
2007-06-14T16:32:00.000Z	cows	vox754	like ifconfig eth1 essid="lol" etc//
2007-06-14T16:33:00.000Z	vox754	cows	most information to configure the card can be found in the manual "man iwconfig"  then read "man ifconfig"
2007-06-14T16:33:00.000Z	cows	vox754	alright ill take a look , because i got the card working on linux with ndiswrapper but i want to test the driver that comes with the distro
2007-06-14T16:34:00.000Z	cows	vox754	also i just remembered that when you close the laptop screen and you open it , it will resume but in locked mode. atm this is a fresh install so it has no gui
2007-06-14T16:36:00.000Z	vox754	cows	which wireless card? Probably intel, broadcom or ralink.
2007-06-14T16:36:00.000Z	cows	vox754	yea its broadcom 4318 i think
2007-06-14T16:36:00.000Z	cows	vox754	i know it works cause i used it before on ubuntu
2007-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	vox754	cows	yeah, it should work with ndiswrapper but probably you can only get 11 Mbps with the included bcm43xx
2007-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	cows	vox754	so i dont need help setting up the card. but i want to know how to connect a wireless card via terminal.. before i used the network-admin
2007-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	cows	vox754	yea cause this wireless card sux. it's only goes up to 11
2007-06-14T16:40:00.000Z	vox754	cows	you are confusing me... do you, or do you not how to connect through the terminal with "iwconfig" and "ifconfig"
