2008-07-10T03:21:00.000Z	akuma55		im trying to edit /etc/resolv.conf but it keep going back to how it was can any body tell me why?
2008-07-10T03:21:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	or because NetworkManager applet restores it
2008-07-10T03:23:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	Do you use DHCP or static address?
2008-07-10T03:23:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	ubuntu server?
2008-07-10T03:24:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	yeah
2008-07-10T03:24:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	:) Ok, let me put it the other way. Have you configured the ip address by hand on the server, or did you get it automatically upon connection?
2008-07-10T03:26:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	auto
2008-07-10T03:27:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	Hmm.. since Server comes without GUI by default, I assume you're not using NetworkManager applet, and thus, it's DHCP that rewrites your resolv.conf. "auto"... right, that's DHCP. So, reconfigure your DHCP server, or you'd have to rewrite it after each interface restart.
2008-07-10T03:29:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	were is DHCP server so i can mod it
2008-07-10T03:30:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	I don't know. It's your network, not mine.
2008-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	is it in i folder or something
2008-07-10T03:34:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	Are you still here?
2008-07-10T03:34:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	yeah
2008-07-10T03:36:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	try 'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -p udp port 53', substituting eth0 with your card and restart the interface (or all the networking). You should see the conversation between you machine and DHCP server, thus, the IP of the DHCP.
2008-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	ok
2008-07-10T03:42:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	you see it
2008-07-10T03:43:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	Only these tow lines?
2008-07-10T03:44:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	is there suppose to be more
2008-07-10T03:45:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	Uh, my bad.. I've confused DHCP port numbers with DNS. Hold on.
2008-07-10T03:46:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	ok
2008-07-10T03:48:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n port 67 or port 68' should do the work
2008-07-10T03:49:00.000Z	akuma55	macrobad	you see my message
2008-07-10T03:50:00.000Z	macrobad	akuma55	yep
