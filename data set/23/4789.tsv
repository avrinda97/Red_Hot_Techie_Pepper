2012-07-14T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	be aware that cron does not have an active "shell" enviornment so you have to set all that up in your script
2012-07-14T20:07:00.000Z	SoulRaven	ikonia	how, can you give me a example
2012-07-14T20:08:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	for example if you do " mv /tmp $HOME/new place" on the command line, your shell has a $PATH setup, so it knows mv is in /usr/bin, and that $HOME is /home/youruser, cron does not have any of that

2012-07-14T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	can you show me your crontab line too please.
2012-07-14T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	there isn't 1
2012-07-14T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	line 5 looks like this
2012-07-14T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	yes, but the pastebin doesn't show that
2012-07-14T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	the pastebin shows it missing the =
2012-07-14T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	yes, it's very odd
2012-07-14T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	you've not put an exit in
2012-07-14T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	ok, so it's not working as that process ID isn't valid
2012-07-14T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	what makes you think it's not exiting
2012-07-14T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	ok, I see what you are saying
2012-07-14T20:29:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	still working on your script
2012-07-14T20:29:00.000Z	SoulRaven	ikonia	thx:)
2012-07-14T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	SoulRaven	what did you change
