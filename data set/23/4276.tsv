2008-05-04T23:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	that kernel is not supported
2008-05-04T23:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	what is the chipset of that
2008-05-04T23:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	if pci then lspci; if usb then lsusb
2008-05-04T23:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	that is the brand name-->we need a chipset like broadcom or the like
2008-05-04T23:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	that site says you have to either: 1)compile the source yourself and insert the module, or 2) use ndiswrapper to do it-->no listing for Hardy though
2008-05-04T23:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	this is an external usb dongle correct?
2008-05-04T23:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	not sure how to get that working with either Hardy regular or your special kernel--> it works well with Gutsy though
2008-07-14T16:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	how about putting sources.list on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-07-14T16:33:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/27262/
2008-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	now I get this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/27264/
2008-07-14T16:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	what did you add to your sources.list? there are two sets (nearly) in there
2008-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	I replaced mine with yours, deleted all sources.list.save and deleted the contents in /var/lib/apt/lists and /var/lib/apt/lists/partial except the folder partial which is needed
2008-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	then sudo apt-get update
2008-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	that is not the correct directory; are you using ubuntu or another distro
2008-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	I am using Ubuntu Hardy
2008-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	the correct place is /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	yes I saved the contents of your file into that place
2008-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	are you using gnome?
2008-07-14T16:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and then paste in the new one over the old one
2008-07-14T16:46:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	OK I solved the problem. It was really strange and I don't understand what the reason was. I doubleclicked sources.list the assigned applications opened up. I changed the Mainserver to a Server in  Germany and it worked..
2008-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Xsss4hell	nice.
2008-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	bazhang	yes Security is ticked now..
