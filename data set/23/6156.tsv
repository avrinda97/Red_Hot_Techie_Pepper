2007-10-04T08:50:00.000Z	bruenig		-R chown is not always a good idea
2007-10-04T08:50:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	I'm assuming he wants the whole directory available
2007-10-04T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	directory being available and ever file in the directory being owned by the directory are obviously not the same
2007-10-04T08:51:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	why would he want access to a directory and not the files within?
2007-10-04T08:52:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	it's like /home
2007-12-08T09:30:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	this channel is not as full as it was even after dapper
2007-12-08T09:30:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	really? perhaps that's a good sign.. maybe things are 'just working' now
2007-12-08T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	I think people are switching to pclinuxos
2007-12-08T09:31:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	never heard of it, I'll look into it... i started out with debian, what base is pclinuxos built on?
2007-12-08T09:32:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	pclinuxos is like ubuntu but better
2007-12-08T09:32:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	oh well, I like the ubuntu community, and I have this gutsy install working fine now... Linux is linux imo... there will always be an infinite number of choices, I'll stay with ubuntu
2007-12-08T09:33:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	I am just kidding, I don't know how good pclinuxos, I imagine it is probably the same as ubuntu/fedora/opensuse which are pretty much identical
2007-12-08T09:34:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	doesn't fedora push the non-proprietary policy though? I think I remember it not being able to play mp3's default, only ogg...?
2007-12-08T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	not true
2007-12-08T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	well ubuntu can't play mp3's by default, no distro can except the lindows/linspire/mepis's of the world that pay to be able to include them
2007-12-08T09:36:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	true enough, but I like how synaptic works though.. makes installing further software a breeze
2007-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	yeah they all have graphical package managers
2007-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	looking at the screenshots, pclinuxos looks like any other kde-based linux with some nice themes
2007-12-08T09:38:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	ubuntu looks like any other gnome based distro with an ugly brown theme
2007-12-08T09:38:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	ahaha, I never use the default theme
2007-12-08T09:38:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	I don't know that anyone does
2007-12-09T04:35:00.000Z	bruenig	silent	just google it
2007-12-09T04:35:00.000Z	silent	bruenig	I jfgi, I understand now
