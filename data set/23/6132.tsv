2007-05-22T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	|_ocke	yes,  if it is possible is is not something obvious
2007-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	|_ocke	 and no  it's the number that is important , not the key
2007-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	|_ocke	Pelo	whats the deal with alt then, does it have to be a differnt keystroke?
2007-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	Pelo	|_ocke	 alt on the left side of the keyboard ( in dos/win anyway_ in combination with a number will select a character from a code page,   the alt-gr key on the right site of the space bar is like shift but for the character on the lower right side ofthe key
