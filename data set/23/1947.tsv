2009-08-26T11:13:00.000Z	aj_444	BioVore	The GRUB Loader that comes with ubuntu. I'm attempting to fully remove it, I have my system partitioned

2009-08-26T11:14:00.000Z	aj_444		I have the ability to dual boot currently. I want to fully remove GRUB, then remove ubuntu.
2009-08-26T11:15:00.000Z	BioVore	aj_444	if you  remove grub..  you can't  boot  into anything..  you need to replace grub with something..  (windows boot loader for instance)
2009-08-26T11:15:00.000Z	aj_444	BioVore	How do I do that?
2009-08-26T11:15:00.000Z	BioVore	aj_444	can you boot  into windows?
2009-08-26T11:16:00.000Z	aj_444	BioVore	Yes, I have access to windows. I don't have access to a dvd drive though.
2009-08-26T11:16:00.000Z	BioVore		ok.. from windows you can open a dos box as administrator and do fixmbr I think..
2009-08-26T11:17:00.000Z	BioVore	aj_444	should cause windows to restore its MBR record and overwrite grub.
2009-08-26T11:17:00.000Z	aj_444	BioVore	I've tried that.. it doesn't work.
