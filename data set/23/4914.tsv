2007-06-26T12:15:00.000Z	pyrak	administrator	serving over a network doesnt seem to present any issues with hard drive formats
2007-06-26T12:15:00.000Z	administrator		so a windows user can read the stuff of ext3 drive?
2007-06-26T12:15:00.000Z	administrator		that seems unbelievable
2007-06-26T12:15:00.000Z	administrator		But OK...how I format
2007-06-26T12:15:00.000Z	administrator		AH thats what i'm looking for
2007-06-26T12:16:00.000Z	administrator		OK lets do this, how I format this second ntfs HDD?
2007-06-26T12:16:00.000Z	pyrak	administrator	well all i know is that i could write to ntfs over a network before i installed ntfs3g to write to my internal ntfs partition
2007-06-26T12:17:00.000Z	administrator	pyrak	ah but you couldn't write to NTFS in linux right?
2007-06-26T12:17:00.000Z	administrator		So how I format NTFS to ext3...Im setting up a server with Samba so it doesn't matter I gues
2007-06-26T12:18:00.000Z	administrator		yes I know thats why im going to format, wols how iI man mkfs?
2007-06-26T12:18:00.000Z	administrator		I have to use this little xterm shoit right?
2007-06-26T12:19:00.000Z	administrator		Since my terminal isn't working god knows why
2007-06-26T12:19:00.000Z	pyrak	administrator	not on an internal drive until i installed ntfs-3g, which was cake.  also, i think that maybe perhaps possibly ntfs-3g is build into the ubuntu installation now.
