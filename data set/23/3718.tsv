2008-02-11T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	remove all the packages listed and then reinstall them
2008-02-11T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	you are told that a package is broken,  uninstall that pacakge and then reinstall it
2008-02-11T07:16:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	how would I do that? sorry i'm still a linux newb :(
2008-02-11T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	 you are in gparted,  the hdd is empty I assume ,  right cclick on it and select add a partiton, then select the size and the format

2008-02-11T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	sorry I'm doing more the one person here I may comfused my suggestion
2008-02-11T07:20:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	  i completely understand, you do look busy, do you know where i could go to find my answer so as not to bother you with my ultra newbiness?
2008-02-11T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	well if you asked more then what I told you earlier , not sure,  remove the broken package and purge it then reinstall it and try to install what ever it was again
2008-02-11T07:22:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	i got W: Unable to locate package libgnuomeui-dev.  How do I purge that file?
2008-02-11T07:22:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	you are doing this in cli ? try doing it with synaptic
2008-02-11T07:23:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	tried that, the file doesn't show up as being installed
2008-02-11T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	are you sure you ahve the correct spelling ?
2008-02-11T07:25:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	tried under synaptic, marked for installation, got an error message saying file has unresolved dependencies
2008-02-11T07:26:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	libgnomeui-dev:
2008-02-11T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	can you find those two packages in the repos ?
2008-02-11T07:26:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	yes
2008-02-11T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	 and ...
2008-02-11T07:27:00.000Z	jgodfrey0723	Pelo	both are unmarked, when i try to install them they come back saying unresolved dependencies, its really weird
2008-02-11T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	menu >ssystem > admin > software sources, check every box on the first tab and the backport box on the 3rd tab ,  then try again, close synaptic first
2008-02-11T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	jgodfrey0723	and after that you are on your own , I have to get to bed, work tomorrow
