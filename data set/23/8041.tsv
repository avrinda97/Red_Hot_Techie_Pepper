2005-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	davix		how can i change my ubuntu kernel?
2005-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	mebaran151	davix	install a new one
2005-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	mebaran151		well I never got in the deep recesses
2005-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	davix	mebaran151	ok, and what about viewing my kernel error log?
2005-02-14T06:32:00.000Z	mebaran151	davix	all the logs in /var/log
2005-02-14T06:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		named pretty easily
2005-02-14T06:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		to figure out
2005-02-14T06:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		but also
2005-02-14T06:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		you can run dmesg for boot mesgs
2005-02-14T06:33:00.000Z	davix		what do these lines say: Feb  1 02:07:22 Lenna kernel: acpi: Unknown symbol acpi_processor_unregister_performance
2005-02-14T06:33:00.000Z	davix		Feb  1 02:07:22 Lenna kernel: acpi: Unknown symbol acpi_processor_register_performance
2005-02-14T06:33:00.000Z	davix		?
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		just use the skype tarball
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		it is more generic
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		and you can take it static if you like
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		but I cant use it anymore
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		on AMD64
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		in a pure AMD64 environment
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		man fstab
2005-02-14T06:35:00.000Z	davix		Feb  1 02:07:22 Lenna kernel: acpi: Unknown symbol acpi_processor_register_performance?
2005-02-14T06:36:00.000Z	mebaran151	davix	I get those, too.  I am no expert, but I think that it is not a big deal, just the kernel cant load that command to the ACPI
2005-02-14T06:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		kind of like the unsupported feature list so it can keep track
2005-02-14T06:37:00.000Z	davix	mebaran151	what does it mean, that i have no acpi or that its malfunctioning?
