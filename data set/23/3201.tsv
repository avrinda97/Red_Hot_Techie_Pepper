2008-06-17T14:37:00.000Z	NewBeginer		does the one i download it from the internet?
2008-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	download the iso, md5 that file, then burn it to disk
2008-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	right; now you need to check the md5sum against the iso
2008-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	see the link above from ubottu
2008-06-17T14:42:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	no look for the pm (private message)
2008-06-17T14:46:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	yes
2008-06-17T14:46:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	did you read the link I gave you even?
2008-06-17T14:48:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	if you read the links then you will know what to do with that.
2008-06-17T14:49:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	what are you using to burn it; on windows with nero or other
2008-06-17T14:51:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	burn as image and not as data
2008-06-17T14:52:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	once that is done, (and burn very slow speed) then do the integrity check from within the livecd to look for burn errors
2008-06-17T14:54:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	lowest possible
2008-06-17T14:55:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	you will see if you have problems; focus now on just getting a good burn of that iso and booting from the livecd
2008-06-17T15:00:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	then set in bios to boot from cd as you restart computer with cd in drive tray
2008-06-17T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	that is fine
2008-06-17T15:03:00.000Z	NewBeginer	bazhang	will you be around everyday?
2008-06-17T15:04:00.000Z	bazhang	NewBeginer	sadly yes :)
