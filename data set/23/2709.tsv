2009-01-29T08:25:00.000Z	tritium6		I'm installing a second nic in my PC, but I don't have a monitor. I've done the physical install, so now I need to do whatever config needs to be done before a reboot. What do I need to do for config so that I can powerdown, switch the ethernet cable, reboot, and be up and running on the new interface?
2009-01-29T08:25:00.000Z	subinacls	tritium6	 you say no monitor, as in not configed properly and it fails, or headless system
2009-01-29T08:25:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	Headless system
2009-01-29T08:28:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	Hmm... tried that but was not able to ssh in afterward
2009-01-29T08:30:00.000Z	subinacls	tritium6	you follow what i am saying ?
2009-01-29T08:36:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	how do i set the interface to use dhcp?
2009-01-29T08:37:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	"what dhcp you use" - I don't know what that means!
2009-01-29T08:39:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	i think i need to set up dhclient to use the new eth2 on boot, because if i run it now it will just fail
2009-01-29T08:40:00.000Z	subinacls	tritium6	kinda the idea. you can issue the dhclient command and use
2009-01-29T08:41:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	no DHCP offers received
2009-01-29T08:43:00.000Z	subinacls	tritium6	whats you OS?
2009-01-29T08:44:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	Ubuntu
2009-01-29T08:45:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	I just switched the cable back but my router isnt getting any new dhcp requests
2009-01-29T08:45:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	:)

2009-01-29T08:49:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	ok, now do i need to reboot?
2009-01-29T08:50:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	or can i just restart some daemon or something
2009-01-29T08:52:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	hmmm I ran over and switched the cable back to eth2 but the router still isnt reporting any new dhcp requests
2009-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	tritium6	subinacls	well thanks for the help
2009-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	subinacls	tritium6	sometimes the hardest problems have the most simple solutions!
