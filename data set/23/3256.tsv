2008-06-04T11:12:00.000Z	grndslm		then np
2008-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	grndslm		he sent you another command to use the -r switch
2008-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	grndslm		rm -r ~/.mozilla
2008-06-04T11:16:00.000Z	grndslm		anybody here disable sudo??  i always type sudo -s to gain root shell, but i'm kinda getting sick of typing in my password 50 times everyday...  you guys really think it's that much of a threat to disable?
2008-06-04T11:18:00.000Z	grndslm		that is a bad habit of mine, but really... i'm wondering if anybody's system has been compromised by disabling sudo access??
2008-06-04T11:18:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	how come you need to use SUDO 50 times per day? that might mean you need to rearrange user permissions, since chances are you only need to use SUDO in rare cases like installing new software
2008-06-04T11:19:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 i'm talking about loging in & typing it in gdm.. & mostly me closing the terminal... bad habit
2008-06-04T11:19:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 i do install & remove packages daily, yes... at different times
2008-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	hehe yeah, just minimize instead :) but also, what are you actually using SUDO for?
2008-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	idk what those even do, why not just use regular sudo __command___?
2008-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	okay, there is no getting around that except minimizing terminal i think
2008-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	or disabling sudo
2008-06-04T11:21:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	i meant _good_ ways to get around that :D
2008-06-04T11:21:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	its probably not a huge security risk for a home computer, but id say don't do it on a server, plus you know it can be a bad habit to form :)
2008-06-04T11:22:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 i have no server other than mythtv
2008-06-04T11:22:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	what do you mean, windows constantly asks me for admin password :/
2008-06-04T11:23:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 i meant xp!  and most servers, you'd always wanna be logged in as root BEFORE you connect the machine to the network
2008-06-04T11:23:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	i mean if your computer is not exposed to public internet traffic. it is probably not too dangerous, but you might be better in the long run to find a safer way to do what you want
2008-06-04T11:24:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	well you know that is actually a bad thing about WinXP, it is perfectly happy to let the user be logged in with full root permissions :(
2008-06-04T11:25:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 i understand it's VERY bad on XP because of the vulnerabilities already presented thru it's widespread adoption... but on Ubuntu, for now... it couldn't be THAT bad, right?
2008-06-04T11:25:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	yeah i don't think it would be a huge risk for most users, but still if you can find a better way that will probably be better for you in the long run... :)
2008-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	grndslm	bring3	 because i always have to type sudo for every line.... f that
2008-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	bring3	grndslm	oh ok i see
