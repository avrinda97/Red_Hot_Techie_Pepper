2007-10-12T08:26:00.000Z	_var		how go I get ls to display colors by default
2007-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	bone	_var	its a switch you alias to ls normally
2007-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	_var	bone	how?
2007-10-12T08:29:00.000Z	bone	_var	let me chec. give me a few seconds
2007-10-12T08:30:00.000Z	bone	_var	type alias, and see if you already have it set
2007-10-12T08:31:00.000Z	_var	bone	just returns with anything to standard input
2007-10-12T08:31:00.000Z	bone	_var	what term program are you in?
2007-10-12T08:32:00.000Z	_var	bone	bash
2007-10-12T08:32:00.000Z	bone	_var	then type alias and make sure it set
2007-10-12T08:36:00.000Z	bone	_var	did you get it working?
2007-10-12T08:36:00.000Z	_var	bone	i'm unfamiliar with aliases; can you show me an example; I'm looking at the bash man page now...
2007-10-12T08:37:00.000Z	bone	_var	I showed you an example up top
2007-10-12T08:37:00.000Z	_var	bone	ah, missed it; thanks
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	bone	_var	you cant just look for the nick highlight when someone is talking to you :)  I missed the _
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	bone	_var	after you type that, type               alias
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	bone	_var	and see if its set
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	_var	bone	done and working...
2007-10-12T08:40:00.000Z	bone	_var	you might have to set that somewhere. Most likely your in a desktop install (based on your newbieism), so I would say check which startup files that term uses so that you can add it to them.
2007-10-12T08:42:00.000Z	_var	bone	so I should put alias ls='ls color=auto' in $HOME/.bash_profile (it's linked to .bashrc)?
2007-10-12T08:43:00.000Z	bone	_var	it depends on the term program. I dont use GUI's for the most part so I dont have a clue. If it were me... I would put it in /etc/profile or someplace that sources
2007-10-12T08:43:00.000Z	_var	bone	I'm using tty1 now myself
2007-10-12T08:43:00.000Z	bone	_var	so your console, and not GUI?
2007-10-12T08:43:00.000Z	_var	bone	correct
