2007-12-03T03:26:00.000Z	kravlin		hey. anyone know why the shutdown and reboot buttons dissapeared on my computer and how to fix it?
2007-12-03T03:27:00.000Z	kravlin		digatori: it was a joke. I would never go back. Its in the applet. I can reboot from the command line fine.
2007-12-03T03:28:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	its ok im not angry...i dont really get angry
2007-12-03T03:33:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	cool
2007-12-03T03:35:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	quickest route would be new install and dont wipe your home partition unless youve backed it up
2007-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	yeah. but this computer has issues. I tried the install with Gutsy and when i booted into the live cd the mouse wouldn't work. dapper did.
2007-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	try using the alternative cd instead
2007-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	or throw your mouse to the cat and buy a new one?
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	I figured that since i've got a working version here i might as well work with it.
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	and i would. but i needed a ps2 mouse and didn't haveone.
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	good point.
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	whats up with usb mice?
2007-12-03T03:38:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	they're plug and play in windows while ps2 isnt?
2007-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	and unfortunately most of the world uses windows.
2007-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	i cant remember I use usb on linux and only use windows in virtual machine so it works
2007-12-03T03:40:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	i use windows for gaming... So i have to have a dual boot computer.
2007-12-03T03:40:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	I use a seperate comp for that
2007-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	I'm a high school student. I have no money.
2007-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	Im an ewok, im skint too
2007-12-03T03:42:00.000Z	digitori	kravlin	off topic but what you studying?
2007-12-03T03:42:00.000Z	kravlin	digitori	currently Spanish, AP Stat, Physics and I'm an Aide for the school Tech.
