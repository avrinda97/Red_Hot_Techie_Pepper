2006-05-25T05:44:00.000Z	Armagguedes	Kyral	replace "noauto" to "auto" ?
2006-05-25T05:45:00.000Z	Kyral	Armagguedes	no, the part that says "iso<whatever>" or "udf"
2006-05-25T05:46:00.000Z	Armagguedes	Kyral	it had "udf,iso9660". changed for "auto"
2006-05-25T05:47:00.000Z	Kyral	Armagguedes	save it and ttry to mount it?
