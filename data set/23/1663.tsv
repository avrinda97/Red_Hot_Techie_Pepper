2009-12-14T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	it will be used automagically in firefox, make sure you have no other video plugin packages installed ( i believe ubuntu shiops with some totem mozilla plugin package). try: dpkg -l | grep mozilla
2009-12-14T02:41:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	:do you think you can check this:http://paste.ubuntu.com/340787/

2009-12-14T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	then paste the command
2009-12-14T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	you will need to delete the partition it resides on, this will destroy ALL data on the partition so you are on your own dude
2009-12-14T02:49:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	but I"m not sure which partition windows is located @?
2009-12-14T02:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	then run: sudo fdisk -l   this may help
2009-12-14T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	tread very carefully
2009-12-14T02:53:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	,there's nothing appears when I run:      sudo fdisk -l
2009-12-14T02:59:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	are you still there?
2009-12-14T03:02:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	could you check this and let me know: http://paste.ubuntu.com/340793/
2009-12-14T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	you just have 2 kernels installed, this is fine
2009-12-14T03:04:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	what you mean by kernels,versions of ubuntu maybe?
2009-12-14T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	you have 2 kernels, the updater doesnt remove the old kernels when a new one is installed. Ive seen systems with 6 kernels
2009-12-14T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	its a terminal command, it will show the partitions available
2009-12-14T03:10:00.000Z	always_smile	ActionParsnip	why can't i see divisions into the partition like C,D,E? it shows dev/sda?
2009-12-14T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	always_smile	drive letters are what windows uses, linux isnt windows, linux uses block devices and mount points
