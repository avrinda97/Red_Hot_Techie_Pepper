2010-02-16T17:49:00.000Z	peope		well... I would guess a virtual network interface in terms of eth0:1 is just another ip-address to the interface eth0?
2010-02-16T17:50:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	yes, i want to have a few services running in my chroot which has a different IP to that of the main computer, but i want it to think the virtual interface is actually the only real one
2010-02-16T17:51:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	there *might* be some way with iptables... but I am not sure. Never seen that configuration.
2010-02-16T17:53:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	there must be  some good use for it... it might be implemented somewhere...
2010-02-16T17:53:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	there is virtualization.. but I havn't seen any chroot implementations
2010-02-16T17:54:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	http://www.r1ch.net/stuff/forcebindip/   there is a windows version of the same kind of thing
2010-02-16T17:57:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	If you are interested in programming I have made a lib/prog that set the ip for a specific process being run. (Alpha though)

2010-02-16T18:01:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	wouldn't put my typing-puke excuse of a program on a production system though :)
2010-02-16T18:02:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	If you explain what you want to do I *might* come up with an alternative solution? :)
2010-02-16T18:04:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	basically i want to run things like ssh ftp apache etc. inside a chroot, with a seperate IP from the host machine, i know i can do with with the config files for all the programs, but i want to have it so that the chroot has its own interface, so that any traffic comes in and out of it, regardless of config files
2010-02-16T18:05:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	maybe a virtualization alternative would be proper?
2010-02-16T18:06:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ perhaps?
2010-02-16T18:06:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	yeah, probably, but that involves setting up a whole new OS. i have used virtualbox before, it would be so much easier using a chroot, becuase then i can copy file to a from really easily. but if virtualisation is the only way, ill have another look
2010-02-16T18:06:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	Wouldnt say it is the only way
2010-02-16T18:07:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	that openvz looks interesting...
2010-02-16T18:08:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	hmmm... there seem to be tools in the repos for openvz, but not the program itself?
2010-02-16T18:08:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	sorry to say I am not an OpenVZ expert
2010-02-16T18:09:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	no worries, looks like it has its own repos
2010-02-17T07:22:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	that takes *FOREVER*; i did it once, and it took a week to do all the compiling
2010-02-17T07:22:00.000Z	peope	PsychoMari0	yeah. But fun as heck. And at least I learn a *lot* :)
2010-02-17T07:22:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	snap
2010-02-17T07:31:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	peope	editing your code(html/php/etc)/moving it about, whilst previewing it
