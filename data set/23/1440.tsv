2010-11-20T22:13:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 if you wan a little more control over installation use the minmal install cd
2010-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 it comes to a point where you have along list of possible install options   arrows scroll and space bar  ticks the box  however this is NOT  alive cd
2010-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 and better still it is only about 12 megs download iso
2010-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 well then the minimal isnt for you ,,,all installable packages are downloaded during install
2010-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 the other options for  apps    http://portablelinuxapps.org/
2010-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 simply download the ones you want,,, they are executable  and can be saved to flash  driver   external media
2010-12-19T02:02:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 it comes out  in april of next year
2010-12-19T02:02:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	  it also defaults to the netbook interface
2010-12-19T02:02:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 and compiz is also a default
2010-12-19T02:03:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	  the  numbers  11.04  are actually the date of the release   11 = 2011  and  04   = the fourth monht  ie  April

2011-02-27T23:56:00.000Z	coz_	magicianlord	 I think it depends on the version but you can check in #winehq
