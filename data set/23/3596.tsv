2008-04-26T05:34:00.000Z	Anza		Hi, I have a question about Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. I upgraded like 4 days ago it was somethin like: Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy Heron (release candidate), so I suppose that was not the definitive version, so now I want to upgrade again to the definitive version, but when I go to "update manager" it says: an error has occured, W: GPG error: http://tskariah.000webhost.com ubuntu Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
2008-04-26T05:34:00.000Z	Anza		 NO_PUBKEY B5E73308E22CF38B.   How can I upgrade to the definitive version that is supposed to be available now????

2008-04-26T05:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	The updating and that error are two different things, you should remove that repository from your sources
2008-04-26T05:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	http://tskariah.000webhost.com, edit /etc/apt/sources.list (alt-f2 then `gksu "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"`), remove the line that that URL is in (it's probably near the bottom)
2008-04-26T05:43:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	it worked fine
2008-08-26T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	please don't do that
2008-08-26T05:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	You'll need to give us a bit more information than that.  IMAP? pop? etc.  What do you mean by loading?
2008-08-26T05:28:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	POP I think
2008-08-26T05:29:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	I mean, loading old mails as new, like something I received days ago, read days ago and today I get it again as a new mail
2008-10-13T04:25:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	ubottu I know it has to be on wine, I just dunno if it would work well because they info on that appdb thing is quite old, and otherwise I think the installation will be quite complicate, so I was wondering if someone has played it recently on ubuntu and if you know where I could find orientation for the installation process
2008-12-01T06:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	Attaching is attaching, there's no difference
2008-12-01T06:32:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	but to send pics to a cell phone it has to be attached as a photo
2008-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	"attached as a photo" is no different than a regular attachment
2008-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	if I attach it as any other file as is the only option hotmail on ubuntu would give me, it would fail
2008-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	Are you trying to include a photo in an HTML email perhaps?  "Attaching as a photo" doesn't make sense.
2008-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	if you have a hotmail account check what options it gives you on the attach button, on Ubuntu, and then check out on Windows
2008-12-01T06:34:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	I am trying to send a photo to a cellphone
2008-12-01T06:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	I just asked someone to check in windows, and hotmail doesn't have an "attach as" just "attach" and then a file dialog.
2008-12-01T06:37:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	maybe on Vista
2008-12-01T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	regardless, email has no notion of attaching "as a photo" just attaching files, which happen to be photos.
2008-12-01T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Anza	So, you should try and figure out what your cell phone is asking.  However, we're offtopic, you may want to ask in #ubuntu-offtopic, someone there may know what you're talking about
2008-12-01T06:39:00.000Z	Anza	Flannel	ok, thanks
