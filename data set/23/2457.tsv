2009-03-05T04:45:00.000Z	hunt577_		I don't understand this part - Retrieve the Windows driver corresponding to your chipset: Use the ID information you have just found and the ndiswrapper list to find and download the correct windows driver files for your wireless adapter, or one which is very similar (same chipset ID).

2009-03-05T04:52:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	hunt577_	lol sorry that looks too complicated for me :(
2009-03-05T04:52:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	hunt577_	what is your computer model
2009-03-05T04:53:00.000Z	hunt577_	Daft_Punk	its an HP G60-249WM
2009-03-05T04:54:00.000Z	hunt577_	Daft_Punk	I am having to follow this NDISWrapper because ubuntu doesn't have a driver for my wireless card
2009-03-05T04:55:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	hunt577_	did you install ubuntu, or are you using just the livecd
2009-03-05T04:56:00.000Z	hunt577_	Daft_Punk	I am using the livecd right now, want to make sure I can get wireless working before I install it
2009-03-05T04:56:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	hunt577_	i am not 100% sure that the wireless would always work in livecd and not the actual os
2009-03-05T04:56:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	hunt577_	do u know which card it is
2009-03-05T04:57:00.000Z	hunt577_	Daft_Punk	I'm pretty sure its my wireless card cause others who have it had to use ndiswrapper to get there wireless to work.  Daft_Punk its an Atheros AR242
