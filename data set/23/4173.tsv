2008-03-03T13:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Let's say you have a directory (/sales) that you only want yourself and the sales group to have access to: sudo chown -R arthur:sales /sales
2008-03-03T13:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	You'd replace arthur with your own username
2008-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	That sets the ownership of the directory, next you have to set the file permissions with chmod
2008-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	But I'm not too good at that... I just use the gui. :)
2008-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Once you setup the ownership with the command I gave you above, right click on the folder, set owner access, group access, then everyone else to no access.
2008-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	By default, other users are allowed to see the files, but nothing else. ie, they can't open them.
2008-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	 Oh, and make sure to check the little box that says make this the permissions for enclosed files too.
2008-03-03T13:12:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Ok.. based on that link, if the /sales wanted to belong to you and the sales group only, then I think the the command would be sudo chmod -R 660 /sales
2008-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Oops. That -R is in the wrong place. And sudo should be required if you are the owner. It's: chmod 660 -R /sales
2008-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Like the link says. ;)
2008-03-03T13:17:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	But if you chown the directory so that you're owner, you don't need to use sudo with chmod.
2008-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	 Do ls -l /path/to/directory/you/want/to/restrict and post the output here.
2008-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	 that's an 'L' not a 1
2008-03-03T13:28:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	I'd do a "groups username" and confirm that the user is a member of mk
2008-03-03T13:32:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	So run that grep command on /etc/groups/ but put your username in.
2008-03-03T13:42:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	 sudo mkdir /mytest && sudo chown root:mk /mytest && sudo chmod 770 /mytest
2008-03-03T13:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Copy and paste that command I gave, post any error messages it gives you. It should create a directory called "/mytest" then only allow mk group members into it.
2008-03-03T13:47:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	So it works is what you're saying?
2008-03-03T13:48:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Don't be distracted by the beautiful people. Can your mk usrs read/write, and others not see the directory pleasework?
2008-03-03T13:49:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	And what about users who shouldn't be able to?
2008-03-03T13:49:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	What does that mean?
2008-03-03T13:50:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Users who shouldn't have access to this directory, you are sayng they can read/write? Can you please post the groups membership of one of these supposed members?
2008-03-03T13:57:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	zippytech_	Ok.
