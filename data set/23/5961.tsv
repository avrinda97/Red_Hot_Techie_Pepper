2006-07-26T05:20:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	you do smbpasswd -L -a username and then smbpasswd -L -e username
2006-07-26T05:26:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	it still didn't work, though I know that the user is enabled now
2006-07-26T05:34:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	did you try sudo smbpasswd -L -a username and sudo smbpasswd -L -e username
2006-07-26T05:37:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	at the bottom where it says public change the force user and force group to your unix login name
2006-07-26T05:41:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	also try changing the create mask to 0644 and the directory mask 0755 in [public] 
2006-07-26T05:41:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	thanks, got it working
2006-07-26T05:42:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	what got it to work?
2006-07-26T05:42:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	the force user and force group settings
2006-07-26T05:46:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	using konquerer i can see it easily under smb://workgroupname
2006-07-26T05:49:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	okay, now we're getting somewhere.  I can see the computer in the workgroup, but it won't allow access, I believe I need a username and password.  do I need to mount it to enter username and password?
2006-07-26T05:50:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	are you talking about on your linux box? i just got into my windows boxes shared folder even though my windows account needs a password to log in
2006-07-26T05:51:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	no I'm talking about getting into my windows shared folder.  it's XP Home, so maybe that's the problem?
2006-07-26T05:52:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	thats what i have
2006-07-26T05:52:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	its hard looking through your smb.conf since it is so huge
2006-07-26T05:52:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	you using wins support?
2006-07-26T05:53:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	wins support?
2006-07-26T05:56:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	if your linux box has a static ip you can add a line to your smb.conof if it isnt already there that says wins support = yes and then on your windows box configure it to use wins in tcpi/ip protocal under advanced
2006-07-26T05:56:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	i dont think that is the problem though
2006-07-26T05:59:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	no that wasn't the problem
2006-07-26T06:01:00.000Z	cpk2	eternalswd	if you want you can use my smb.conf as a template since it is much cleaner and smaller
2006-07-26T06:02:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	my error screenshot is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/i18894
2006-07-26T06:03:00.000Z	eternalswd	cpk2	okay
