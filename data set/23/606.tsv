2011-05-12T18:05:00.000Z	hseritt		I've downloaded ubuntu  and installed it on to a windows partition. After i installed it, i notice that when i try to ssh to a server on the network i get this error: debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP
2011-05-12T18:05:00.000Z	hseritt		Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer
2011-05-12T18:05:00.000Z	hseritt		for some reason im not able to log in to a box onto a network although i can ping it.
2011-05-12T18:06:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	When you ping it are you pinging it on the port you are trying to connect on?
2011-05-12T18:07:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	yes i can run a telnet to it. so i know it's open
2011-05-12T18:07:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	My guess would be authentication problem then, have you checked the error logs?
2011-05-12T18:08:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	no i dont even get a password prompt. there is no issue with authentication.
2011-05-12T18:08:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	and actually in my error message this is what i see: debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP
2011-05-12T18:08:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	i did this with ssh -vvv ... i only get this with ubuntu
2011-05-12T18:09:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	Are you connecting with SSH2 or SSH?
2011-05-12T18:09:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	i can connect with redhat and windows to these servers - as they are also installed on this same laptop
2011-05-12T18:09:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-1ubuntu3, OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010
2011-05-12T18:11:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	why only on ubuntu i cant connect via ssh?
2011-05-12T18:12:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	I think you need to try with SSH2 instead of SSH
2011-05-12T18:12:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	umm i am using the ssh that comes with the install
2011-05-12T18:13:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	but the error message said it was expecting SSH2 no?
2011-05-12T18:13:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	how would i use ssh2 instead then?
2011-05-12T18:13:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	i am doing: ssh [username]@[server]
2011-05-12T18:14:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	and why doesnt ubuntu come default with ssh2 instead of ssh?
2011-05-12T18:15:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	I don't know. But I am sure you can get it from the repository
2011-05-12T18:20:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	hey i changed my client config to use Protocol 2 and it still does the same thing
2011-05-12T18:20:00.000Z	soyo	hseritt	Same error?
2011-05-12T18:20:00.000Z	hseritt	soyo	yes
