2010-09-21T02:42:00.000Z	Proumbro		can anyone here direct me to some documentation concerning process management in linux, I am trying to learn more about preemption, deadlock, etc...
2010-09-21T02:44:00.000Z	Proumbro		right now we are studying how the Os prioritizes processes to avoid deadlock
2010-09-21T02:44:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	first link on google: http://oreilly.com/catalog/linuxkernel/chapter/ch10.html
2010-09-21T02:44:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I was hoping there was something in Lucid I could explore and tinker with
2010-09-21T02:45:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	fyi processes can still deadlock despite any priority given to them by the scheduler
2010-09-21T02:46:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I know this :) I am trying to distinguish the differences between Windows Linux and OSX
2010-09-21T02:46:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	e.g. if one process X obtains a lock on resource A, and process Y obtains a lock on resource B, then X attempts to get a lock on B, and Y attempts to get a lock on A
2010-09-21T02:46:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	difference in process scheduling?
2010-09-21T02:46:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	yeah like how the prioritize and such
2010-09-21T02:47:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I really want to dig into Lucid and look at settings such as the time slice associated with preemption
2010-09-21T02:48:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	1) Lucid is a distribution of Ubuntu - what you want is the Linux kernel
2010-09-21T02:48:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	2) i forgot what 2 was going to be
2010-09-21T02:49:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	http://kernel.org/
2010-09-21T02:50:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I know, but I want to get to the Linux kernel inside my Lucid machine to toy with it a bit and look at the settings
2010-09-21T02:51:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I've looked at that too, and kernelnewbies.org
2010-09-21T02:52:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	sudo apt-get install fakeroot kernel-wedge build-essential makedumpfile kernel-package; sudo apt-get build-dep linux
2010-09-21T02:53:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I'm not a pro at this and I don't want to start building my own kernel :)
2010-09-21T02:53:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	you don't need to build it - but it can be helpful to read the source code
2010-09-21T02:54:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	I saw that earlier and thought about it (and may go back to it) but was afraid of doing something awesome to kill my laptop
2010-09-21T02:55:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	alright, that was what I was thinking, but I wanted to mae sure that Lucid didn't have something built into it where you can observe
2010-09-21T02:55:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Proumbro	top is probably the closest you'll get to observing that in "real time"
2010-09-21T02:56:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	what is top?
2010-09-21T02:57:00.000Z	Proumbro	mgmuscari	essentially a read-only task manager
