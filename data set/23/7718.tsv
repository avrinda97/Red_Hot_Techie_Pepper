2005-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	aladdin_		Hi guys.  I'm trying to compile a gwenview extension (external tool) that is called gwenrename.  I need to compile it.  When I run configure all is ok until it comes up with this message: "configure: error: Can't find X includes..." .  I know Ubuntu uses x.org instead of XFree86.org.  I need to know the path to x.org "includes" and "librairies".  I' m running a fresh install of Ubuntu Hoary upgraded with all available stable pack
2005-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	aladdin_		ages.  Can anybody assist. Thx.
2005-05-15T13:18:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	apt-get build-depends <some gnome tool>
2005-05-15T13:18:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	apt-get build depends gwenview
2005-05-15T13:33:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	you wrote: " apt-get build depends gwenview". that will do what? Install sources?
2005-05-15T13:56:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	guess I should have listened earlier... I'm like that sometimes  :o|
2005-05-15T13:51:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	k I'll do
2005-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	... by the way configure is asking for zilb, which is installed (zlib1g) do you think it's a good thing to install thde dev package too?
2005-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	yes
2005-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	k doing so..
2005-05-15T13:55:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	on my machine "sudo apt-get build-dep gwenview" gets all the dependencies
2005-05-15T13:56:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	I was misspelling it earlier ;)
2005-05-15T13:58:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	ok that's it I'm going for your  "sudo apt-get build-dep gwenview" command, configure keeps asking me for new dependdencies . lol
2005-05-15T14:02:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	mouhahaha! 59 packages to install... would have been long 1 at the time! thx guess this will do the job.  Gwenrename is basically a batch renaming scheme for gwenview.  You know what: the more I use Ubuntu (well Kubuntu) the more I love it.  Finaly I can run real apps that won't Winblow!
2005-05-15T14:03:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	yeah, I tested the command and replied "N" to downloading the complete KDE developer stuff
2005-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	tried gnome (Ubuntu) and liked it too. But am more the K style :o)
2005-05-15T14:08:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	what I love the most is that I've been trying for a very long time to run a http server (undern Windows) but it just wouldn't work with all I needed... Unless paying ($) alot. Now: wow! I just installed a Mambo php routine on my server and I am having the fun of my life.
2005-05-15T14:10:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	and I just can't believe how fast gcc compiles an app on my PIII   :o)
2005-05-15T14:29:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	My sources are all there. configure went trough the whole routine. I can make, make install. Many thx :o)
2005-05-15T14:29:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	best of british
2005-05-15T14:30:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	fast learning french canadian
2005-05-15T14:31:00.000Z	djm62	aladdin_	it's an expression..."best of british luck to you"
2005-05-15T14:31:00.000Z	aladdin_	djm62	oh... still having to learn french canadian then . lol
