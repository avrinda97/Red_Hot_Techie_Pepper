2006-10-29T06:41:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	toolbar? do you mean the panel at the top of the screen?
2006-10-29T06:42:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	you need to add a panel.. is the bottom panel still there?
2006-10-29T06:42:00.000Z	blisz	TankEnMate	there is nothing
2006-10-29T06:42:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	nothing on the bottom?
2006-10-29T06:43:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	right, in a shell type "ps aux | egrep panel"
2006-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	time to make a cutom launcher
2006-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	okies.. :)
2006-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	well the panel program is running, it would seem it just has lost its config for any panels..
2006-10-29T06:46:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	okies... this will give you back a default panel if there isn't any bugs at issue, is that ok?
2006-10-29T06:47:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	in a shell type the following..
2006-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	$ rm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/panel ; cp -r /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/apps/panel ~/.gconf/apps
2006-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	then restart the gnome-panel process with kill -1
2006-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	how you going?
2006-10-29T06:51:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	which query?
2006-10-29T06:52:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	ahhh!! no wonder you have lost your panel then...
2006-10-29T06:52:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	thats not such a good thing..
2006-10-29T06:53:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	you are using ubuntu and not kubuntu or xubuntu?
2006-10-29T06:53:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	i quick reinstall of a package should fix it.. hold on i'll find the right package for you...
2006-10-29T06:57:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	sorry about the delay.. slow disk.. you need to install gconf2-common
2006-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	TankEnMate	blisz	sudo apt-get install --reinstall gconf2-common
2006-10-29T07:38:00.000Z	blisz	TankEnMate	i already have gconf2-common installed :S
