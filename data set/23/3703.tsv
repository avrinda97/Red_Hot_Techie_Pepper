2008-05-21T19:19:00.000Z	bazhang	d4t4min3r	seems that movie has some new copy protection on it; thus the trouble of playing on your computer -->national treasure 2 copy protection brings up a number of links with this issue
2008-05-21T19:19:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	bazhang	cool good to know
2008-05-21T19:19:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	bazhang	was there any finds on how to play it
2008-05-21T19:20:00.000Z	bazhang	d4t4min3r	the consensus so far is dvdshrink does it (though that would have to be via wine)
2008-05-21T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	d4t4min3r	k9copy always did it for me; though in this case who knows
2008-05-21T19:27:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	bazhang	what did you google for nt2 issues on dvd playback
2008-05-21T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	d4t4min3r	national treasure 2 copy protection
2008-05-21T19:55:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	bazhang	what where you saying i should use via wine
2008-05-21T19:56:00.000Z	bazhang	d4t4min3r	dvdshrink might work; who knows
