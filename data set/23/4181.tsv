2007-10-22T05:13:00.000Z	garu		GOD...What a nightmare
2007-10-22T05:13:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	I guarantee I've had worse nightmares :p
2007-10-22T05:14:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	how come?
2007-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	well, there's the time I deleted the home directories of about 80 people
2007-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	and the tape machine started eating tapes :)
2007-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	for some reason, I can't stand still at home...I can't live without wireless...and wireless has been the biggest problem ever, with every distro
2007-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	ahahahahhahaha
2007-10-22T05:16:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	oh man...hwat hav u done?
2007-10-22T05:16:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	that was years ago, and years later they offered me twice my pay to stay :)
2007-10-22T05:16:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	ur problem is different...u'v deleted...caused the problem...lol!I'm a victim :D
2007-10-22T05:17:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	hey...twice?I assume that's a big number :o :)!IT Industry really pays well :)!Gotta finish Uni.lol
2007-10-22T05:17:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	ya, it was :p
2007-10-22T05:18:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	I could only get wireless working in sabayon, and that was after about 1 month killing myself to sort it out.lol
2007-10-22T05:18:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	but I was sick of paying absurd amounts for a single room an hours drive from work (only got worse as I got closer to work)
2007-10-22T05:18:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	what chipset?
2007-10-22T05:18:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	the ralink rt61!lol
2007-10-22T05:19:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	sorry, haven't used that card before;  might check to see if ndiswrapper is known to work with it
2007-10-22T05:19:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	now, gutsy gibbon detects and connects to my wireless network, but, if I start downloading anything, I lose the connection until I restart the computer.The same goes if I try to copy anything from one computer in my home network to this one.how weird is that?lol
2007-10-22T05:20:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	that's how I got it to work in sabayon!
2007-10-22T05:21:00.000Z	cwillu	garu	okay, then you want to install ndiswrapper and recommended/related packages, find out which module you're using right now, add it to /etc/modules/blacklist, and then install the firmware for ndiswrapper (possibly adding ndiswrapper by hand to /etc/modules)
2007-10-22T05:21:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	using ndiswrapper.But the problem then was different.It couldnt even detect my card, now...I can connect and do everything, untill I start downloading or try to copy things from another computer to this one!
2007-10-22T05:21:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	nah...I got sick and tired of ndiswrapper.lol
2007-10-22T05:22:00.000Z	garu	cwillu	my wireless works out of the box...only to download and copy from another computer to this one that's when the problem starts.isnt that weird?lol
