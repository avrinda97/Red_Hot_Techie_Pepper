2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	Seracht		Quick question guys. I have a 320 and a 80gb hdd. Windows is on the 320 and I want to install ubuntu on the 80gb. How should I partition it?
2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	Seracht		I am thinking 15 EMT3, 1 Swap Area, rest FAT32
2007-02-17T09:09:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	Consider a swap partition to make up the difference between your physical RAM and 1.5 gigs
2007-02-17T09:09:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	Oh, you said that :)
2007-02-17T09:10:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	You might consider not putting any FAT32 on it
2007-02-17T09:10:00.000Z	Seracht	padge_	I wanted it mainly for transferring media files over
2007-02-17T09:10:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	There's a much better way
2007-02-17T09:11:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	There's a driver for XP that allows you to read/write ext3
2007-02-17T09:11:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	charl_ie is on the ball here :)
2007-02-17T09:11:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I believe that the difference is transparant
2007-02-17T09:12:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	In my experience, I think that the driver doesn't journal its work, so when you mount it back up in linux, it freaks out and checks the filesystem, but never any major problems though
2007-02-17T09:13:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	aight. :)
2007-02-17T09:14:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I would do it like this
2007-02-17T09:14:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	You have your 320 set.  How much RAM do you have?
2007-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I would format the 80 gig drive with 79.5G EXT3 and the rest swap at the end of the drive
2007-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	To make up the difference between your memory and 1.5
2007-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I agree with charl_ie.
2007-02-17T09:20:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I don't know.  But guessing without knowing I would go with primary :)
2007-02-17T09:21:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I don't think it really matters.  Stick the ext2 part on /videos or something
2007-02-17T09:21:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	Assuming videos is what you're moving around :)
2007-02-17T09:22:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	I think he's suggesting using the ext3 partition for /home and /usr and /var and all the linux stuff
2007-02-17T09:22:00.000Z	padge_	Seracht	and /
