2011-07-22T22:24:00.000Z	Raven		I just installed Ubuntu and there's something that really confuses me
2011-07-22T22:24:00.000Z	Raven		Would this be the place to ask?
2011-07-22T22:25:00.000Z	Raven		Hello?
2011-07-22T22:25:00.000Z	Raven		ugh, never mind
2011-07-22T22:25:00.000Z	Raven		oh, ok.
2011-07-22T22:26:00.000Z	Raven		I was wondering if I download a program from firefox
2011-07-22T22:26:00.000Z	Raven		and it gives a .tar
2011-07-22T22:26:00.000Z	Raven		where do I extract it to so that ubuntu considers it an installed program?
2011-07-22T22:26:00.000Z	Raven		Yes, this is my first ubuntu install
2011-07-22T22:27:00.000Z	Raven		I'm running the newest version, by the way
2011-07-22T22:27:00.000Z	maco	Raven	for a pre-compiled tarball like firefox uses, it doesn't really matter where it is. it's statically compiled. you can run it from anywhere, as long as the thing to double click stays in the same spot in its untar'd directory
2011-07-22T22:27:00.000Z	maco	Raven	what you CAN do is make a launcher and tell it the path to wherever you stashed it
2011-07-22T22:33:00.000Z	maco	Raven	https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-next
2011-07-22T22:28:00.000Z	maco	Raven	there should be a way to make that launcher in the menu, but i use kubuntu so dont knw how to do it in ubuntu
2011-07-22T22:28:00.000Z	maco	Raven	i'm not sure why you need a static firefox though. firefox should be included in your ubuntu install
2011-07-22T22:29:00.000Z	maco	Raven	which version of ubuntu?
2011-07-22T22:29:00.000Z	maco	Raven	5.0 is in 11.04
2011-07-22T22:30:00.000Z	maco	Raven	you just need to install updates :)
2011-07-22T22:30:00.000Z	maco	Raven	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-07-22T22:30:00.000Z	maco	Raven	or use update-manager
2011-07-22T22:32:00.000Z	maco	Raven	you don't need to get firefox from a random point on the internet. it's in the repositories as version 5. there is an update available for your ubuntu to get it
2011-07-22T22:33:00.000Z	maco	Raven	the ubuntu mozilla team maintains a repository for the beta, linked above
2011-07-22T22:34:00.000Z	maco	Raven	somewhere in software center (sorry, i use kubuntu not ubuntu) there should be a way to add that repository
