2005-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	Amaranth		Sure.
2005-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	Amaranth		Actually, you'll probably want to purge qt too
2005-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	no there was no such alternative...
2005-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	What do you mean?
2005-05-24T07:46:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	there was no deletebutton :D
2005-05-24T07:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	Double-click on the entry...
2005-05-24T07:48:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	Hehe LOL :D Why must I be so stupid... :D
2005-05-24T07:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	My fault, I'll have to make it more obvious in the next version.
2005-05-24T07:49:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	So your the creator of smeg? What programming language?
2005-05-24T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	Python/PyGTK
2005-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	OK, I'm sitting here reading a pythonbook right now :P Interesting language, easy syntax to learn but powerfull functions...
2005-06-13T09:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	mod_python != CGI
2005-06-13T09:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	no, mod_python is so you can run python scripts without CGI
2005-06-13T09:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	If you just want CGI you just need to chmod +x the python script, there is no cgi-bin (unless you set it up to need one).
2005-06-13T09:17:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	OK
2005-06-13T09:21:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	I uninstalled mod_python and chmoded the file and put it in documentroot, but my browser want to donwload it instead? What do I do?
2005-06-13T09:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	make sure you have '#!/usr/bin/env python' (without quotes) at the top of the script
2005-06-13T09:23:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	I got that in top...
2005-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	hmm
2005-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	Helmutt	Amaranth	Maybe we should take this in #python but ;) This is the code:
2005-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	no clue then, sorry
2005-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	Helmutt	Please don't paste in the channel.
