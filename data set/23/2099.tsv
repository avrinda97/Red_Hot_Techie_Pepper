2009-07-27T22:23:00.000Z	pianistbaby		is it the "HWaddr"?
2009-07-27T22:23:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	ipconfig is the windows command doing the same
2009-07-27T22:27:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	if you're using a router, your ISP only sees the router.  It doesn't see the individual PCs behind it
2009-07-27T22:28:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	then the MAC address will be of no use to you.  Anybody use BitTorrent in your house?
2009-07-27T22:29:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	yes, but now I've blocked it.
2009-07-27T22:29:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	blocked what?
2009-07-27T22:29:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	blocked P2P/filesharing sites via opendns.com
2009-07-27T22:29:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	Modem address is just the MAC address of the cable/DSL modem
2009-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	you can block the sites, but that doesn't block the trackers or connections to individual users.  How many PCs are you looking at?
2009-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	iceroot. i see. how can i see the mac address of our cable modem
2009-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	2. mine and the "family" one
2009-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	but if we block the site, how will the naughty person in our house make filesharing work?
2009-07-27T22:31:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	here's the deal.  One of those 2 PCs is using a ton of bandwidth.  The MAC address (or modem address) won't help you because all of the PCs show up as a single PC to your ISP.
2009-07-27T22:32:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	You need to actually monitor what's going on in your house and who's using what programs.
2009-07-27T22:32:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	This is an issue of monitoring the family PC to find out what they're doing and who's hogging your bandwidth.
2009-07-27T22:33:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	is the family PC an Ubuntu PC?
2009-07-27T22:35:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	if the family's PC is an Ubuntu machine, we can probably provide solutions to let you monitor all traffic.
2009-07-27T22:37:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	the other (a.k.a "living room" /"family") PC uses WinXP.
2009-07-27T22:38:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	then I'd say you're out of luck finding help in here.  You have to monitor what's being done on that PC.  That's all there is to it.  I suspect someone deserves a butt whoopin', though
2009-07-27T22:39:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	I feel your pain, but #ubuntu won't help with the overuse charges, either.  ;P
2009-07-27T22:39:00.000Z	pianistbaby	ascheel	yes. i better leave this chatroom before some whoops my butt for going offtopic
2009-07-27T22:40:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	there you go.  :)  Done
2009-07-27T22:40:00.000Z	ascheel	pianistbaby	my pleasure
