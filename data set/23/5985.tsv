2007-08-27T07:29:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	It's getting better, slowly.
2007-08-27T07:30:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	What sort of hd? ide/sata?
2007-08-27T07:31:00.000Z	blix	nandemonai	YES
2007-08-27T07:32:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	Okies, reboot, go into Bios and check out your sata settings. If you find and change ahci to ide it might help. Know what sort of mobo it is?
2007-08-27T07:33:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	I'm just going off what my machine does. (Asus P5B)
2007-08-27T07:34:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	Win wont install on sata as ahci, has to be ide as it doesn't have the drivers on the install cd.
2007-08-27T07:34:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	Just a guess.
2007-08-27T09:12:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	gparted only partitions to my knowledge not format.
2007-08-27T09:14:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	depends on filesystem, for ext3 for example: mkfs.ext3
2007-08-27T10:01:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	Okies. Just I know that XP hates most ahci controllers without drivers and usually you can get around this by setting ahci to ide/compat mode.
2007-08-27T10:02:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	Without the option in bios you may need to track down installer drivers for that controller.
2007-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	That's my point though.. it sounds like your controller is just too new for xp's installer. I had the exact same thing on asus p5b but luckily I ave ahci options in bios.
2007-08-27T10:04:00.000Z	nandemonai	blix	So without drivers I doubt you'll get xp seeing the hd essentially.
