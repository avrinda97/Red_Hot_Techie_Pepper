2007-12-19T11:05:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS		im pretty impressed with wine, so far everything i've thrown at it works like a charm. is there anything this wonder program can't do?
2007-12-19T11:07:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS		i've even installed microsoft exchange 2008 on wine and it works fine
2007-12-19T11:09:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS		someone has just installed a sinister LKM on my machine what do i do.... i already punched em'
2007-12-19T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	pass me the password
2007-12-19T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	if you're serious, don't trust your data even
2008-01-17T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	sudo aptitude uninstall ndiswrapper
2008-01-17T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	doh, remove reather than the uninstall
2008-01-17T07:34:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	then, sudo modprobe -r ndiswrapper should remove it from the kernel so you don't need to reboot
2008-01-17T07:34:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	nickrud	ok good, im going to try and use fwcutter instead, i expect better results
2008-01-17T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	worked with mine
2008-01-17T07:37:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	nickrud	yeah when i use ndiswrapper the ssid's arn't updated as often as i'd like. i need to remove nidswrapper from the kernel and then put it back in with modprobe
2008-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	 use    defaults,umask=007,gid=46   in /etc/fstab and make sure you're in the plugdev group
2008-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	groups in a terminal
2008-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	that doesn't actually make you own the files, but you can read/write if mounted with ntfs-3g
2008-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	nickrud	yes im trying to copy all the files off of a windows partition to my box but i know using windows to copy another windows partition from another computer you need to take ownership of the first or you will get access violations
2008-02-06T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	assuming you're writing to the ntfs drive, and it's mounted with ntfs-3g , having it mounted as I described above will give you proper permissions
2008-02-06T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	it sets it up so anyone in the group plugdev can write to the mounted drive
2008-02-08T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	 ecneitap
2008-02-08T07:59:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	nickrud	i've been in the waiting room all day, i need to see the doctor
2008-02-08T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	what did you do, hold it up to a mirror :)
2008-02-19T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	possibly because no one's written a plugin for kontact?
2008-02-19T11:19:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	nickrud	write me a plugin real quick...
2008-02-19T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	KiD_ChAoS	a plugin
