2008-10-17T18:53:00.000Z	Whitor		Hi, I'm having a problem with my network adapter. for some reason there is an ip assigned to my eth0 when its not plugged into a jack and its not staticly assigned. This is a problem becasue its default gateway is causing problems with my Wlan0 adapter.
2008-10-17T18:53:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	have you tried to tried dropping the connection and bringing it back up?
2008-10-17T18:54:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	yeah, that works until the next reboot
2008-10-17T18:55:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	so you're getting an IP address even though there's no physical connection to the router?
2008-10-17T18:55:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	yeah
2008-10-17T18:55:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	what happens if you do sudo etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-10-17T18:57:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	What IP address are you getting when your PC boots up?
2008-10-17T18:58:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	I'm getting the ip that /was/ previously obtained via dhcp ... its like its 'sticking'
2008-10-17T18:58:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	So you're not getting the 162.254.x.y IP that was mentioned?
2008-10-17T18:59:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	no... not from that subnet pool
2008-10-17T19:00:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	can you post the output of your interfaces file to pastebin ... /etc/network/interfaces
2008-10-17T19:01:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	http://pastebin.com/m7ec36988
2008-10-17T19:03:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	try adding 'auto eth0' (without quotes) underneath line 11 then do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-10-17T19:04:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	was also thinking of taking out the inet  .... part of the eth0 line ... Does that tell the system to use it as a gateway to the internet ?
2008-10-17T19:05:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	just wondering, is there any reason that you can't give eth0 a static IP address
2008-10-17T19:06:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	It is possible... but not my prefered route
2008-10-17T19:06:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	have you done what I suggested above?
2008-10-17T19:06:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	working on it :)
2008-10-17T19:07:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	Let me know when you've got it done
2008-10-17T19:08:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	got a big [Fail] when ading that line then restarting networking ...
2008-10-17T19:10:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	I'm a bit stumped. Can you paste the details of ifconfig to pastebin please
2008-10-17T19:13:00.000Z	Whitor	mick02	http://pastebin.com/m113e7b57
2008-10-17T19:15:00.000Z	mick02	Whitor	I'm stumped, I've no idea why this is happening. THe best advice I can give you now is to check out www.Google.com ... sorry bru
