2008-01-03T10:22:00.000Z	zero88		where are commands such as ls and cd and such located???
2008-01-03T10:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	located?
2008-01-03T10:22:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey ya, when i type ls, how does the terminal know what to do at that point?
2008-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	it's part of the bash shell
2008-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey ah. is it expandable?
2008-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	What is it you want to do?
2008-01-03T10:24:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey, say I wanted to make my own commands.
2008-01-03T10:24:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	Then you'd need to code them and compile them.
2008-01-03T10:25:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey ya, just your basic bash commands I assume? But how do I incorporate it with the bash shell?
2008-01-03T10:26:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	I'm not sure I am understanding oyu
2008-01-03T10:28:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey, ok. In a terminal, when I type ls, it list's the current dir's contents. If I wanted to type make my own command say lsb and have that command list the contents of a previous dir, with the command  cd .. ls, or something like that, how would i make that work
2008-01-03T10:29:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey sorry, i cant really say what im really trying to say :)
2008-01-03T10:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	Sounds like you could write a bash script
2008-01-03T10:29:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey, ya , but i only want to type lsb, instead of ./lsb or ./home/user/folder/lsb
2008-01-03T10:30:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	but will the command be perminant after that
2008-01-03T10:30:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	awsome thanks. and thanks purpzey for the help
2008-01-03T10:31:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	:)
2008-01-03T10:32:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	 so add alias lsp='ls ..' to the end of the file?
2008-01-03T10:33:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	kool
2008-01-03T10:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	I'd suggest asking in #bash they can help with this sort of thing, sounds like you might have other plans in mind
2008-01-03T10:33:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey what do u mean
2008-01-03T10:34:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	how do i update the ~/.bashrc file so the command works?
2008-01-03T10:34:00.000Z	PurpZeY	zero88	If you are doing what you simply saying to do....you can do it...just like solid_liquid says....BUT...if you intend to start messing around with bash scripts and all sorts of thing like that asking in #bash is a good idea
