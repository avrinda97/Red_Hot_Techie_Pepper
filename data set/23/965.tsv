2011-05-15T05:36:00.000Z	qin	wafa	ok, you would want to remind yourself (command is "history | less" )  what you did to your system, any file removal or instalation, also would try to run: sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get install -f && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-05-15T05:39:00.000Z	wafa	qin	download failed
