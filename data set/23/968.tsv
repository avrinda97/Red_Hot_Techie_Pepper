2010-10-31T07:59:00.000Z	caleb_		Hey guys, I'm installing the java package so I can play minecraft and other things, but on the license agreement, when I press space, it doesn't work. Could someone enlighten me to what I'm meant to do?
2010-10-31T08:00:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	which java package are you installing?
2010-10-31T08:00:00.000Z	caleb_	PJSingh5000	At the moment, sun-java6-bin I think.
2010-10-31T08:00:00.000Z	PJSingh5000		Are you installing using Software Center or using command line?
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	caleb_		Yeah, it's on the license agreement for that and I can't get past it.
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	caleb_		Erm
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	caleb_		It's the terminal command line, yeah.
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	caleb_		!enter rquiros
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	ok, then did you get to the blue screen that asks if you accept the license?
2010-10-31T08:01:00.000Z	caleb_		It's just on the license, lots of words etc about it, and an Ok button.
2010-10-31T08:02:00.000Z	caleb_		May I add I spammed the heck out of the Ok button.
2010-10-31T08:02:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	Press tab key to highlight the OK button in red.  Then press enter.
2010-10-31T08:02:00.000Z	caleb_		Oh thanks!!!
2010-10-31T08:02:00.000Z	caleb_		:D
2010-10-31T08:03:00.000Z	caleb_		Thanks for the help :)
2010-10-31T08:03:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	yw
2010-10-31T08:03:00.000Z	caleb_		I knew it was something stupid like that I've got to do lol.
2010-10-31T08:03:00.000Z	caleb_		There we go, all installed -)
2010-10-31T08:03:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	nothing is stupid!  Glad it worked for you.  But, there is one more thing you need to do...
2010-10-31T08:04:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	are you singh Ubuntu 10.10 ?
2010-10-31T08:05:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	Ubuntu 10.10 comes with Open JDK.  You will need to tell it to use the Sun version/
2010-10-31T08:06:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	on the terminal type: sudo update-alternatives --config java
2010-10-31T08:06:00.000Z	PJSingh5000	caleb_	then pick the number for /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java
