2008-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	Oh wait you want to restart X or kill X ?
2008-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	Are you familar with VTs ?
2008-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	fauzie	DaskreecH	ummm.. not sure.... what is that anyway?
2008-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	Well you X is in virtual Terminal 7
2008-08-21T08:07:00.000Z	fauzie	DaskreecH	yup .. i got it. I need to kill X from all terminals
2008-08-21T08:07:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	ou can jump to the first one with alt+Ctrl+F1 you can come back here with Alt+Ctrl+F7. Try it
2008-08-21T08:08:00.000Z	fauzie	DaskreecH	I'm trying to install nvidia driver from their website as the one from repo don't work very well. It still detects my X server running at VT7 if i'm running it from VT1
2008-08-21T08:08:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	Ah good
2008-08-21T08:08:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	In VT1 type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2008-08-21T08:09:00.000Z	fauzie	DaskreecH	Okay.. trying that. If i went offline than it works. If i went offline for more than an hour then i got my X server messed up :D
2008-08-21T08:10:00.000Z	DaskreecH	fauzie	Wait
