2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	hmm, i'm not sure i follow? what do you mean?
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	 3.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3 is the current version
2008-07-29T14:16:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	you on hardy i assume?
2008-07-29T14:17:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	unfortunately, firefox3 is only available in the hardy repos.
2008-07-29T14:19:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	pretty much yea
2008-07-29T14:21:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	there are a few nagging issues -- if firefox3 is the only reason you have to upgrade, i would say, don't
2008-07-29T14:21:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	you can install firefox 3 from mozilla's download
2008-07-29T14:24:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-3.0.1&os=linux&lang=en-US
2008-07-29T14:26:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	these instructions work despite being for the beta.  http://linuxowns.wordpress.com/2008/02/15/install-firefox-3-beta-3-on-ubuntu/
2008-07-29T14:28:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	errm no, but the command i gave you earlier should remove the "preview"
2008-07-30T15:23:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	what's up/?
2008-07-30T18:20:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	you don't usually have permissions in that directory. you might need to use sudo as appropriate
2008-07-30T18:22:00.000Z	unop	Rageon	you can, though it's not recommended.
