2008-01-08T07:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	What filesystem is it using
2008-01-08T07:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	Ward1983 And I've tried to help...
2008-01-08T07:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	Ah ^^ ntfs. Right. (preface with the nick of the person, helps to see)
2008-01-08T07:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	Ok so you need it to auto mount with persisten naming. That can be a little flaky from my experience but I'll find a link.

2008-01-08T07:51:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	And unless you have an entry in fstab it will probably mount it with the native ntfs driver which can't do 'write'
2008-01-08T07:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	and can you 'mount /dev/sdb1' from the command line?
2008-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	ok. wait one.
2008-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	unagi	gyaresu	ok
2008-01-08T07:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	Does this help: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/widows-ntfs-partitions-readwrite-support-made-easy-in-ubuntu-feisty.html
2008-01-08T08:02:00.000Z	unagi	gyaresu	no not really, because my external doesnt show up in the config
2008-01-08T08:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	unagi	You're welcome.
