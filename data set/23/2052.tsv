2009-11-26T19:24:00.000Z	blackxored		there's a linux command equivalent to this utc to local time ruby conversion: ruby -e "puts Time.utc(2009,11,26,17,00).getlocal"?????
2009-11-26T19:26:00.000Z	blackxored		anyone??
2009-11-26T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	man time    will fill you in
2009-11-26T19:26:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	time isn't for time, its for benchmarking lol
2009-11-26T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	sounded like you wanted to set or display te time
2009-11-26T19:28:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	but the command is date, and doesn't convert, something like date -R -u -d "2009-11-26 17:00" won't do any conversion at all
2010-05-11T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	edit -> profile preferences   tick the terminal bell box
2010-05-11T20:40:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	don't take for that lol, it's something wrong with pulseaudio, when I do a pactl list on fedora shows a gnome-terminal profile preference, in lucid it doesn't
2010-07-02T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	you can't. You can mark them as ignored. But bad sectors mean the drive is dying and should be replaced pdq
2010-07-02T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	could be a bad batch
2010-07-02T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	you may be able to skip the bad sectors. Not sure how though
2010-07-02T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	like mint / ultimate etc?
2010-07-02T23:38:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	yeah
2010-07-02T23:38:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	where i can see the channel for the distros on this network
2010-07-02T23:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	I use !ultimate
2010-07-14T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	you can use dd_rescue to zero the partition
2010-07-14T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	if you want the whole device wiping then use the disk name instead of the partition
2010-07-14T23:28:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	again i did dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb where sdb is my sdcard
2010-07-14T23:34:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	Dr_Willis: so?
2010-07-14T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blackxored	use fdisk to remove all partitions then zero it off.
2010-07-14T23:36:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	blan, I did that the time i zeroed
2010-07-14T23:39:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	Dr_Willis: somehow after 2 o 3 usb-24 reset hs usb device ehci_hcd mounted it, i don't know how, the phone can't mount it
2010-07-14T23:44:00.000Z	blackxored	ActionParsnip	do you know why is now mounting the ext2 fs when i formatted with the phone, and why is resetting 3 or 4 times before so
