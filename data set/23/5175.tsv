2007-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	Phylo		what should those be set to?
2007-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	your domain
2007-06-01T15:51:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 if I do set new values, won't those values be reset when I reboot?
2007-06-01T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	depends on your config
2007-06-01T15:53:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 I've solved this problem before with someone's help from here.  They had me fix a file (sudo gedit ????) to remove a command in some system file pertaining to this
2007-06-01T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	I don't see how its a problem
2007-06-01T15:54:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 okay, how do I know what address to type when it I add a dns?
2007-06-01T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	you get it from your dhcp server
2007-06-01T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	how do you know your router is not acting as your dns server
2007-06-01T15:56:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 I assume it's not meant to because it isn't working as is.  I cannot load the page http://www.google.com/
2007-06-01T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	what happens if you type "nslookup www.google.com"
2007-06-01T15:57:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 ";; connection timed out; no servers could be reached"
2007-06-01T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	seems reasonable to assume that its not working. Contact your ISP or router vendor to find out why its not giving you the correct dns settings
2007-06-01T16:00:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 does it matter that it works for the computer I'm on here?
2007-06-01T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	yes, sounds like your dhcp client is not asking for dns servers
2007-06-01T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	check your dhclient.conf
2007-06-01T16:13:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 I'm looking in my dhclient.conf file.  It has a line "request subnet-mask, ..., domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name, ...;"
2007-06-01T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	uncomment what you want
2007-06-01T16:13:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 what do I need?
2007-06-01T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	I don't know - what do you want
2007-06-01T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	sounds good
2007-06-01T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Phylo	well done
2007-06-01T16:23:00.000Z	Phylo	ikonia	 after reset, it didn't change anything.  I removed domain-name-servers from the request in dhclient.conf since it isn't giving me anything usable anyway
