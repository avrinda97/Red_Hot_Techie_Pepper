2011-05-11T01:43:00.000Z	froq		Okay.  So i have files from an old OSx HFS+ partition that only allows that have the following permissions: owner: read/write group: ZERO Others: ZERO.... I cannot do anything with them... anyway I can get those files?  the hdd was not encryped
2011-05-11T01:44:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	if you mount hfs+ you need to pass an extra parameter to mount r/w
2011-05-11T01:44:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	how do I do that?
2011-05-11T01:44:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	let me check, im running osx too on this pc
2011-05-11T01:45:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	thanks.
2011-05-11T01:49:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	is the hfs+ partition journalled?
2011-05-11T01:49:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	yes sir.
2011-05-11T01:49:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	i think thats only mountable read
2011-05-11T01:50:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	but it won't even let me do that.  it tells has an X over the folder and says I don't have the permissions to do it.
2011-05-11T01:50:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	you mean when its mounted? my hfs+ partitions mount just fine but just as read
2011-05-11T01:51:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	yeah, when it is mounted, it won't even let read/ open the folder.
2011-05-11T01:52:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	else i can only think of connecting it to a pc and use a hackingtosh style boot cd so you can use disktools to change permissions or disable yournalling
2011-05-11T01:52:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	or a mac if you got one around
2011-05-11T01:53:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	okay, so the only way to fix the permissions is from the mac.  that is what I needed to know.  Dang, wish I could just see what was in the folder, but I don't ahve read permissions, that sucks.
2011-05-11T01:53:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	you can try mounting it
2011-05-11T01:53:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	 if it doesnt work no loss
2011-05-11T01:53:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	just install hfsplus hfsprogs and hfsutils
2011-05-11T01:53:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	I have it mounted, and everything, but the single folder, when I double click it to open it, I get the following: You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "Desktop".
2011-05-11T01:54:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	and then mount -o force -t hfsplus
2011-05-11T01:54:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	if you manage to mount it rw like that you can change the permissions
2011-05-11T01:54:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	but if its journalled that might not work, but you can always try
2011-05-11T01:55:00.000Z	froq	sgaap	I am downloading those tools, thanks dude!
2011-05-11T01:55:00.000Z	sgaap	froq	gl
