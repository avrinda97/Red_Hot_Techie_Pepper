2008-08-23T00:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	Its a known bug, let me find you the workaround
2008-08-23T00:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=865679 I believe in the right one.  If not, just google for "Ubuntu generating Locales hardy" and I'm sure you'll find another one
2008-08-23T00:50:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Can you direct me to the correct post?
2008-08-23T00:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	Actually, I have a better link: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/langpack-locales/+bug/249340
2008-08-23T00:53:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Still nervous about which procedure to use.....
2008-08-23T00:55:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Your suggestion? There are a number of methods to try.

2008-08-23T01:00:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	That didn't work. "dpkg: status database area is locked by another process"
2008-08-23T01:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	you need to have the installer finish: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/langpack-locales/+bug/249340  (sudo killall locales-whatever)
2008-08-23T01:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	first post there
2008-08-23T01:06:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Ran the killall, install's continuing.
2008-08-23T01:06:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Java is left unconfuigured.....
2008-08-23T01:17:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Is there an easy way to check which packages aren't upgraded/configured (as a result of the kill) after the reboot?
2008-08-23T01:17:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Does "sudo aptitude upgrade" do this?
2008-08-23T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Strife89	Thats what the other commands were for, the dpkg -r whatever and the reconfigure
2008-08-23T01:19:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Oh, alright. Haven't rebooted any yet, just waiting on the upgrade to finish.
2008-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	If this is bothering you, tell me: Ten minutes to go.
2008-08-23T01:36:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	I'll come back after the reboot. Closing Pidgin early.
2008-08-23T02:29:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	So far, so good.
2008-08-23T02:29:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	My screen got messed with. Evidently my driver is no longer working.
2008-08-23T02:30:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	My resolution dropped from 1024x800 to 800x600
2008-10-26T03:51:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	Sorry about that, I'm letting X-Chat do the talking....
2009-09-27T07:11:00.000Z	Strife89	Flannel	That honestly surprises me.
