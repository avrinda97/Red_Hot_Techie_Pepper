2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		yeh
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		it lists it as 'amd64'
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		we run intel
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		perhaps amd64 is not the most appropriate name?
2010-07-28T15:35:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		ok cheers
2010-07-28T15:36:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		presumably it's now deprecated in 10*
2010-07-28T15:38:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		it's still called amdblah?
2010-07-28T15:38:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		lol

2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		how is 'amd' the correct name for a distribution which applies to architecture extending beyond amd?
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	wgrant	hrhrhr_	AMD invented the architecture.
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		citation? :)
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		anyway
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		who cares
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		is there a changelog for 8.04.04
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_	SwedeMike	my apologies
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		you are all right
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		The original specification was created by AMD, and has been implemented by AMD, Intel, VIA, and others.
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		now it makes perfect sense
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		i am very grateful to all :)
2010-07-28T15:41:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		cheers jpds
2010-07-28T15:42:00.000Z	wgrant	hrhrhr_	Other distributions and operating systems may use other names. Partly because Debian adopted the architecture quite early.
2010-07-28T15:42:00.000Z	wgrant	hrhrhr_	And we inherited the name from Debian.
