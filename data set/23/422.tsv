2011-10-04T20:21:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		I can take a minute to find out which computer blongs to who so I can connect to the correct computer
2011-10-04T20:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	try fingering the system names
2011-10-04T20:24:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	I have system names, I just don't have the assoication with people's namesâ€¦ Which I am building that list now.
2012-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	what video chip do you use?
2012-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	Let me remote in for you
2012-10-30T21:33:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller
2012-10-30T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	try the boot option: nomodeset
2012-10-30T21:34:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	Does "checking battery status" make sense to you? To me it makes me think that is is an issue with the hardware being from an laptop.
2012-10-30T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	yes, you'll get that, then the login manager loads, sometimes intel GPUs need the option to run ok
2012-10-30T21:35:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	Is there a way for me to change that option remotely? The computers are 5 miles from here.
2012-10-30T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	if you press CTRL+ALT+F1 do you get a prompt?
2012-10-30T21:36:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	5 miles from here means nothing to you?
2012-10-30T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	you can add the option in /etc/default/grub    with the other options:  quiet splash    then run:  sudo update-grub
2012-10-30T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	calm down
2012-10-30T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	yes, save the new file, close the editor and run:   sudo update-grub
2012-10-30T21:41:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	I'll try this, thanks
2012-10-30T21:52:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	What if I forgot to run sudo update-grub?
2012-10-30T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	then no change is made to grub, you haven't told it to reread the configs
2012-10-30T21:53:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	Will I need to reboot the system again after this?
2012-10-30T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	after you run:  sudo update-grub     yes
2012-10-30T21:55:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	thanks for the help
2012-10-30T22:03:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	ActionParsnip	After running that, ubuntu doesn't seem to know resolutions and it uses 1024x768. Is there a way to force it to be 1360x768 (or whatever the resolution was). If this fixes our issue, I don't see why we can't compromise it.
2012-10-30T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GRMrGecko	not sure dude, least you have some sort of desktop
