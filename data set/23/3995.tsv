2009-11-30T14:52:00.000Z	SmokeyD		hey everyone, how can I make my wireless lan card connect on startup of the machine, instead of on login? It is using wpa2 encryption
2009-11-30T14:53:00.000Z	SmokeyD		right now I have to login first, before the macine comes online, but I want it to go online already on startup so I can ssh into it and stuff
2009-11-30T14:53:00.000Z	SmokeyD		I am running ubuntu karmic
2009-11-30T14:53:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Write a script to connect and put it in /etc/rc.local
2009-11-30T14:54:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	hmm, what script should I write? Does network manager work when I am not logged in? Or should I disable network manager completely if I want this?
2009-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	I disable all network manager facilities and use wpa-supplicant for the job
2009-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	ok, thanks
2009-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip1s suggestion might be better though I have not tested that route
2009-11-30T14:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	this sounds interesting: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834
2009-11-30T15:00:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Looks good, try it out
2011-09-29T20:00:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	What makes you think libssl is to blame?
2011-09-29T20:01:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	since I am requesting a https url, both from wget and from a python script using the httplib
2011-09-29T20:01:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Sounds like it's time for some bisecticide :P
2011-09-29T20:02:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	bisecticide?
2011-09-29T20:02:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Sorry, I was being facetious. If you build the problem component from source, you can then perform a bisect which basically means, systematically find which commit broke it
2011-09-29T20:03:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Most revision control tools have bisect functions built-in to help automate the process
2011-09-29T20:03:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	:) yeah ok. I could do that, but that will take me a full day I think to find first which package is the problem in the first case, then hand compile and isntall it intill I found it. I am not sure it is libssl itself or another library
2011-09-29T20:04:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Alternatively, you can file a bug against ubuntu and hope someone else will fix it
2011-09-29T20:19:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	packages.ubuntu.com
2011-09-29T20:22:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	llutz is there also some place I can see what changed in the source code? In those two tips I can only see the changelog
2011-09-29T20:29:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	Apparently, libssl is provided by openssl. You'd have to locate the upstream repo or checkout the source to browse it
2011-09-29T20:35:00.000Z	SmokeyD	soreau	but don't the ubuntu maintainers also patch packages? So I guess there has to be some ubuntu specific repository somewhere doesn't there? I mean, the version numbers 0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.6 and 0.9.8o-1ubuntu are also ubuntu specific
2011-09-29T20:36:00.000Z	soreau	SmokeyD	If you look on packages.ubuntu.com, you can see for each package, they provide the original source tarball, a diff and then their final tarball for the target ubuntu version
