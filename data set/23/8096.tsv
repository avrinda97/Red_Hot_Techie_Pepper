2005-01-24T11:57:00.000Z	goofykinky		can anyone helpme or not?
2005-01-24T11:59:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	what's the problem
2005-01-24T12:02:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	look when ubuntu starts on my system it hangs in the "Starting Hotplug Subsystem" thing and some times it finish loading and some times no..
2005-01-24T12:02:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	what peripherals do you have connected to your PC
2005-01-24T12:03:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	i have one usb cam thats all
2005-01-24T12:04:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	the camera might be causing the problem I'm afraid
2005-01-24T12:05:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	i'm afraid so, well thats one part of it, then my cable modem does not start by default and i already check the "start internet by default" whats wrong there?
2005-01-24T12:06:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	is the cable modem otherwise correctly configured, do you know? (i.e., IP address/DHCP set up, etc)
2005-01-24T12:07:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	 yes my DHCP its correctly configured but every time i have the chance to log in on my system i have to start it manually..
2005-01-24T12:08:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	what command do you use to start it manually?
2005-01-24T12:09:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	well i go under the networking seccion on my computer configuration settings and then i check the section "Activate when computer starts"
2005-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	yes i click ok and Apply
2005-01-24T12:14:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	basically the file /etc/network/interfaces needs to have a line in it saying "auto eth0", where eth0 is the device name of the modem
2005-01-24T12:16:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	ok let me check it!
2005-01-24T12:17:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	look this is what it says # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
2005-01-24T12:19:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	I'm probably wrong, but I think "auto eth0" has to come before any other mention of eth0
2005-01-24T12:20:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	ok should i move it?
2005-01-24T12:20:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	try it, yeah
2005-01-24T12:20:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	 and i suppose i need to restart right?
2005-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	generally in linux you can modify pretty much anything and it take effect without a complete system restart
2005-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	oooh thank god another linux advantage..
2005-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	Markrian	goofykinky	time for me to hit the sac - good luck
2005-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	goofykinky	Markrian	 thankyou very much for all!!
