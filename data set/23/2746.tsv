2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	B0BBY		Hello People.
2009-07-03T00:20:00.000Z	B0BBY		so a Sheeva Plug has a ubuntu variant or something installed.
2009-07-03T00:20:00.000Z	B0BBY		would it be ok to ask questions for that in this channel?
2009-07-03T00:20:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	depends on the question, give it a try.  Worst-case scenario, it seems like it's not default ubuntu behavior and we send you away :)
2009-07-03T00:21:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	ok I'll send my friend with the question in here. :)
2009-07-03T00:48:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	thanks.
2009-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	I see. I guess I'm not sure how to retrieve a particular version.
2009-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	My friend and I are tyring to compile a wifi driver. which need the kernel sources....
2009-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	header files and such.
2009-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	you are using the default linux kernel?
2009-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	it's a Sheeva Plug which report to uname -a with a ubuntu something something 2.6.30-rc6
2009-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	it's on the MIPs arch.
2009-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	ah...
2009-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	use the git instructions and checkout the right version, does that help?
2009-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	that does help. I just have to now figure out all of that. :)
2009-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	so when you say get out my own, you mean from kernel.org sources, right?
2009-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	if your kernel is a vanilla kernel without the ubuntu patches, yeah
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	otherwise, it could be trouble...?
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	I don't know
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	hehe, it's always a lot of fun compile random drivers, eh?
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	that's for your help.
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	jrib	B0BBY	that may have some hints about your card too
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	B0BBY	jrib	cool. thanks for your help.
