2006-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	Omeg		Oh wait, now it works. I didn't use the sh command.
2006-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	Omeg		Thanks, spikeb :)
2006-04-22T07:46:00.000Z	Omeg		Hi everyone
2006-04-22T07:46:00.000Z	Omeg		I just downloaded a demo of Sim City 3000. Upon trying to run it, I get an error message:
2006-04-22T07:46:00.000Z	Omeg		./sc3u_demo: relocation error: ./sc3u_demo: symbol _dl_global_scope, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
2006-04-22T07:47:00.000Z	Omeg		So I guess I need to get GLIBC_2.0?
2006-04-22T07:47:00.000Z	Omeg		I tried looking for it in the repositories, but couldn't find it.
2006-04-22T07:48:00.000Z	Omeg		Anybody who can tell me what to get to fix this?
2006-04-22T07:49:00.000Z	Omeg		Can anyone help me with my problem?
2006-04-22T07:51:00.000Z	Omeg		Does anybody know what this error message could mean? ./sc3u_demo: relocation error: ./sc3u_demo: symbol _dl_global_scope, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference
2006-04-22T07:51:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	the problem is that loki basically hard-coded to the then current GLIBC.
2006-04-22T07:51:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	and don't repeat yourself
2006-04-22T07:52:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	I was typing... Anyway, AFAIK there is NO way to run older games like that on newer GLIBC's
2006-04-22T07:52:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	are you on Breezy or Dapper?
2006-04-22T07:55:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	AFAIK it is not. I'd love to hear otherwise... I'm not doing much else, so let me research it. please stand by.
2006-04-22T07:57:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	BTW, one possible solution may be to use dchroot to basically install a parallel Debian/Ubuntu version... I know some PPL on AMD64 setup an i386 dchroot to run 32-bit firefox plugins and win32codecs.
2006-04-22T07:59:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	I mean basically two distros.
2006-04-22T08:00:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	well, fortunately you mostly just need the libraries
2006-04-22T08:02:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	I installed an Ubuntu Dapper base i386 chroot earlier today and it's only 191MB.
2006-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	checking it out...
2006-04-22T08:36:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	that gentoo HOWTO seems quite complete and exactly what you need. How is it working for you?
2006-04-22T08:38:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	np.
2006-04-22T08:40:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Omeg	this might help:  http://www.swanson.ukfsn.org/loki/00README.loki_compat
