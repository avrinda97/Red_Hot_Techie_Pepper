2007-08-02T12:12:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	feistyfawn
2007-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; how old is the machine, and wich type is it again?
2007-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	brand new machine
2007-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	it is almost same specs as ubundell except gfx card
2007-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; normally intel is well supported , but in your case it might be to new, you see, linux hackers need time to figure out hardware
2007-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; you are running from livecd right?
2007-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	i already installed
2007-08-02T12:15:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; if you run from livecd , you get the same thing ? or try an older ubuntu version to see if the same thing happens
2007-08-02T12:15:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	yes
2007-08-02T12:16:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; lspci --vv ( wich is v v )

2007-08-02T12:19:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; really odd , and what does not work ? sound / network etc?
2007-08-02T12:21:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	i mean everytime i update kernel i need to reinstall ethernet drivers
2007-08-02T12:22:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; kernel updates can mess up installation , that does happen
2007-08-02T12:23:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	i just want a stable install with all hardware with their drivers, if they are not out yet, i guess i can wait, but im pretty sure dell has the drivers considering they sell the ubundell
2007-08-02T12:23:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; try to create an working ubuntu , and not update the kernel ...
2007-08-02T12:24:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; Dell themselve also want better drivers , they are working on it woth the hardware vendors
2007-08-02T12:25:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	so you are saying dell are sending out these systems without full compatibility and all the drivers?
2007-08-02T12:25:00.000Z	unimatrix9	bz0b	; so best for you is to create an working desktop , and not to mess to much with it when its stable..( no kernel updates and the like )
2007-08-02T13:20:00.000Z	bz0b	unimatrix9	do you recommend the 64 bit or 32 bit for my system, considering i have a intel core 2 duo 6420
