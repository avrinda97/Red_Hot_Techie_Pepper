2010-09-12T18:50:00.000Z	whippiii		hi there, i have the next question: i forgot to set sda4 for being auto-mounted on /mnt/datos, i've tried every way with no positive results :S. "dmesg | tail" says: "EXT4-fs (sda4): VFS: Can't find ext4 filesystem"
2010-09-12T18:51:00.000Z	whippiii		however, if i click the partition bookmark on the file manager, that partition is mounted with no problems :S
2010-09-12T18:51:00.000Z	whippiii		sorry by my bad English, i'm not an English speaker ;)
2010-09-12T18:52:00.000Z	whippiii		i've used: "UUID=5EE7FF505918248E      /mnt/datos       ext4    defaults      0       0" or /dev/sda4 instead UUID, but it doesn't work either :S
2010-09-12T18:53:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	for one I doubt you can use 0 in the last field and have it automatically mount
2010-09-12T18:54:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	generally it should be 2 for regular filesystems that are not /
2010-09-12T18:54:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	lemme try, wait a second
2010-09-12T18:55:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	i get the same message :S
2010-09-12T18:56:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	I didn't think that would be it anyway, that would have caused a different problem
2010-09-12T18:56:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	what do you normally type to mount it manually?
2010-09-12T18:56:00.000Z	quiescens		oh right, gui
2010-09-12T18:57:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	i dont have to type anything, i just click on the dolphin's bookmark for that partition and it just successes
2010-09-12T18:57:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	can you use the gui to mount it, then open a terminal and do: cat /etc/mtab
2010-09-12T18:59:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	it's line says: /dev/sda4 /media/disk-1 fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0
2010-09-12T19:01:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	are you sure about the filesystem type
2010-09-12T19:01:00.000Z	whippiii		quiescens:
2010-09-12T19:01:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	of course
2010-09-12T19:02:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	the last time i installed ubuntu, it never changed (the partition's format)
2010-09-12T19:02:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	i've always keep my data in there :S
2010-09-12T19:06:00.000Z	quiescens	whippiii	I hate to do this but could you do: sudo file -sL /dev/sda4
2010-09-12T19:06:00.000Z	quiescens		just in case
2010-09-12T19:07:00.000Z	whippiii		quiescens:
2010-09-12T19:07:00.000Z	whippiii	quiescens	i dont understand this xD: /dev/sda4: x86 boot sector, code offset 0x52, OEM-ID "NTFS    ", sectors/cluster 8, reserved sectors 0, Media descriptor 0xf8, heads 255, hidden sectors 84036015, dos < 4.0 BootSector (0x80)
