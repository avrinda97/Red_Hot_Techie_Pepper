2012-11-09T04:16:00.000Z	sharon		anyone had luck with a Nikon Coolpix l110?  I plug it in via USB and get nothing.
2012-11-09T04:18:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	do you have an external storage card on the device you could use instead of plugging in the camera directly? i'm assuming you just want to transfer files?
2012-11-09T04:19:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	yes, but that slot doesnt' seem to be working either.  tailing /var/log/syslog doesn't show anything helpful
2012-11-09T04:20:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	is it a little sd card
2012-11-09T04:21:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	it is.
2012-11-09T04:21:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	lsmod | grep sd, please?
2012-11-09T04:23:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	nothing, but the card is back in the camera at the moment
2012-11-09T04:26:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	have you verified that the card is readable?
2012-11-09T04:26:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	they show up on the camera's screen
2012-11-09T04:27:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	ok so it's likely fine. would you plug it in to your pc? what version of ubuntu are you running?
2012-11-09T04:27:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	12.04
2012-11-09T04:27:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	by "it" i mean the sd card, not the camera. unless you want to set up the camera for some reason?
2012-11-09T04:29:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	what gives you that error?
2012-11-09T04:30:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	already installed
2012-11-09T04:31:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	sudo apt-get install libgphoto2-2
2012-11-09T04:31:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	and lsmod | grep sd is showing nothing.  I wonder if the card reader is broke.  It doesn't feel right
2012-11-09T04:31:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	you've already done that?
2012-11-09T04:31:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	it was already installed I guess before I sat down here tonihgt
2012-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	could you try running that apt-get real quick anyway
2012-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	sharon	nydel	libgphoto2-2 is already the newest version.
2012-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	then try "sudo mount -a" & open nautilus
2012-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	if "sudo mount -a" has odd output please pastebin it
2012-11-09T04:39:00.000Z	nydel	sharon	i'm reading that people have luck rebooting with the sd card in the slot. it's not ideal but it could be a solution. also after reboot you can try "sudo su -l; echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan"
