2006-03-19T09:40:00.000Z	TheWrench		so, inorder. C: (25GB NTFS) for windows, / (10GB ext3) for Ubuntu, D: (40GB NTFS) for windows wares,/home (15GB ext3),media (110GB fat32).
2006-03-19T09:41:00.000Z	TheWrench		Falstius:and to do this, I install windows first, leaving blank partitions, then install ubuntu?
2006-03-19T09:41:00.000Z	TheWrench		Falstius:500megs
2006-03-19T09:42:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	 C: (24GB NTFS) for windows, e: (1gig ntfs) for virtual memory, (swap) (1gig) / (10GB ext3) for Ubuntu, D: (40GB NTFS) for windows wares,/home (15GB ext3),media (110GB fat32)
2006-03-19T09:43:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	why 40 gig warez?
2006-03-19T09:44:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	Flastius: i have lots of large windows applications.  Actually, no games.
2006-03-19T09:45:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	i wanted the media partition to contain files that i would use from both operating systems
2006-03-19T09:47:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	well, no, but I don't have that much media either...
2006-03-19T09:57:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	Falstius: does swap need to be called /swap?
2006-03-19T09:58:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	no... let the install decide the for your swap...
2006-03-19T10:00:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	Falstius: does media need to be called something like F:, not just media?
2006-03-19T10:01:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	you have to mount it somewhere like /stuff,  I would recommend /home/media or /home/[username] /media
2006-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	I don't know about mounting. I have never used linux, could you give more detail?
2006-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	when you install ubuntu it will ask you about the mountpoint, it will feel a wee bit natural... linux uses a "root" / for all the media instead of A: b: C: D: etx
2006-03-19T10:10:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	ok. I am still not quite clear. I want a big partition which is accessable from both linux and windows, on which to store my media files.  I will make it fat32 since I am new to linux, so I will probably create it when I install windows.  this means thatit will have a lettername, like a: right?
2006-03-19T10:13:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	yes, in windows it will have a lettername, in linux, no!
2006-03-19T10:13:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	but I would recommend you to create the fat artition in linux instead!
2006-03-19T10:14:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	why?
2006-03-19T10:14:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	if you are new to linux it will be easier to find for you...
2006-03-19T10:15:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	just a thing tha will make your total setup easier...
2006-03-19T10:15:00.000Z	TheWrench	Blippe	it will be easier from both windows and linux, or just from linux?
2006-03-19T10:16:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	otherwise you need to learn how to automount and stuff... And easier from both...
2006-03-19T10:23:00.000Z	Blippe	TheWrench	good luck and have fun!
