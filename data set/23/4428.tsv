2007-09-22T15:32:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	.daa is disgusting proprietary PowerISO, best bet is to use it on Wine or something :(
2007-09-22T15:35:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	know that PowerISO is payware, so you may have to look around if your daa file is big
2007-09-27T10:30:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	prob not very well
2007-09-27T10:31:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	change your Windows version in winecfg, and do file one over at AppDb
2007-09-27T10:33:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	winecfg in Terminal? what Wine version are you using anyway?
2007-09-27T10:34:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	change it
2007-09-27T10:36:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	even with that, i dont expect much success with latest version really
2007-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	it means the server is offline, and thus the TCP stack sends a nice RST
2007-09-30T12:42:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	chmod +x it, cd to where the .run file is, then type ./<name of run file>
2007-09-30T12:42:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	what are you trying to install?
2007-09-30T12:43:00.000Z	narothepharoh	scguy318	enemy territory
2007-09-30T12:43:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	prefix sudo? perhaps you have to install it as root?
2007-12-07T04:17:00.000Z	scguy318	narothepharoh	from their site
2007-12-07T04:18:00.000Z	narothepharoh	scguy318	I have downloaded the tar.gz files how do I run them?
