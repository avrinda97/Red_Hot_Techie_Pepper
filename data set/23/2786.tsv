2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	d0netsFN		hey im having troubles with this toshiba laptop with  Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG in a fresh and updated (via ethernet) install of 8.10
2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	d0netsFN		if someone could pm about this issue i would greatly appreciate it
2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	d0netsFN		it shows up in lshw and everythiing, but its greyed out in network manager
2009-01-30T02:21:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> seems like the nm or gui fronts for configuring network in 8.10 is a bit faulty, does your wifi work if you use command line ?
2009-01-30T02:24:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	im not sure could you help me see?
2009-01-30T02:25:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> what does sudo iwlist wlan0 scan  tell you?
2009-01-30T02:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> what does it say?
2009-01-30T02:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> post your /etc/network/interfaces file
2009-01-30T02:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> in pastebin
2009-01-30T02:32:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	sorry
2009-01-30T02:33:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> anyhow, put an entry for your wifi on that file,   auto wlan0;  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
2009-01-30T02:38:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	do i need to do anything after that
2009-01-30T02:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> try sudo ifup wlan0;
2009-01-30T02:38:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	ifup interface wlan0 already configured
2009-01-30T02:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> sudo dhclient wlan0
2009-01-30T02:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> but now you have both your wifi and eth0 on same router, dont expect things to work correctly, as the packets will get confused as to which nic to take
2009-01-30T02:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> yes?
2009-01-30T02:42:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	ok sorry, any ideas?
2009-01-30T02:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> i have plenty, what is the result of the command i told you?
2009-01-30T02:44:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	its pretty long but basically no such device
2009-01-30T02:44:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> learn to use the pastebin to post, if you dont want to cooperate, sorry.. cant help you
2009-01-30T02:49:00.000Z	d0netsFN	n8tuser	ok sorry i was just trying to refrain from setting up ppidgin on this laptop
2009-01-30T02:51:00.000Z	n8tuser	d0netsFN	-> you mentioned you have loaded the driver, you verified with sudo lshw -C network ?
