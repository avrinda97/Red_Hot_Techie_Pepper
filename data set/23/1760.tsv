2009-11-03T00:36:00.000Z	souler		So can anyone help me flip my webcam????
2009-11-03T00:38:00.000Z	souler		Kjarli, what problems you have installing it?
2009-11-03T00:38:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	First of all, loading takes way longer in 9.10 than in 9.04
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	after the GUI finally loaded, you get the install icon
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	souler		I thought you have problems installing it, as in haven't installed yet.
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	clicking it won't do anything tho
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	souler		It's stable enough for me.
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	souler		Except my webcam is upside down.
2009-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	souler		Though I updated mine over the older distribution'
2009-11-03T00:40:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	anything on it?? :P or are you not familiar with it :P

2009-11-03T00:41:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	k, did your grub update aswell?? I have a 9.04 cd, so i might try thayone
2009-11-03T00:41:00.000Z	souler	kjarli	not that I noticed.

2009-11-03T00:42:00.000Z	souler	kjarli	how do I upgrade my grub?
2009-11-03T00:42:00.000Z	kjarli		LOL!!, using the live CD i'm not even allowed to shut down :S
2009-11-03T00:42:00.000Z	souler		So CAN ANYONE HELP ME FLIP MY BLOODY WEBCAM? IT'S INTEGRATED AND I DON't KNO WHOW ELSE.
2009-11-03T00:43:00.000Z	souler		Kjarli that's odd.
2009-11-03T00:43:00.000Z	kjarli	souler	yes... also some applets died on startup, got some I/O errors, while 9.04 runs fine
