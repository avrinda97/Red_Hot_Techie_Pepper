2011-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	or maybe just ntfs
2011-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	however, if you put the wrong device there, you have troubles (like losing data)
2011-06-16T13:31:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	so be warned
2011-06-16T13:31:00.000Z	kontagious2		mkfs.ntfs3g no such file or dir
2011-06-16T13:32:00.000Z	kontagious2		ntfs-3g
2011-06-16T13:32:00.000Z	kontagious2		the dash is there
2011-06-16T13:32:00.000Z	guzu		then try ntfs
2011-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	kontagious2	guzu	seems to be working
2011-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	guzu		ok
2011-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	guzu		now you'll have to wait :)

2011-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	kontagious2		:)
2011-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	of course as a lot of guys already said it, the windows way is the preferred way for such things.. but you can use linux if you want
2011-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	guzu		hi palmje
2011-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	guzu		hi Palzieri
2011-06-16T13:35:00.000Z	kontagious2	guzu	i realise that but its not possible to boot right now because xp wont boot from usb
2011-06-16T13:35:00.000Z	kontagious2	guzu	i had the same problem a while ago but gparted worked back then (10.04) i think
2011-06-16T13:35:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	there is a tutorial about custimizing your windows install disk to boot from usb
2011-06-16T13:35:00.000Z	kontagious2	guzu	i have the install usb beside me :)
2011-06-16T13:36:00.000Z	guzu	kontagious2	already customized?
2011-06-16T13:36:00.000Z	kontagious2		it was just a problem with gparted
2011-06-16T13:36:00.000Z	kontagious2	guzu	yeah, wintoflash
