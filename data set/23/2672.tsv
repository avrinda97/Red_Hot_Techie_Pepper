2008-12-20T07:00:00.000Z	xtreme		Hello Guys, when i disconnect my Charger from my laptop, My keyboard stops working, is it a known issue?
2008-12-20T07:01:00.000Z	chefan	xtreme	only if your battery is unplugged, but then everything else would fail too
2008-12-20T07:02:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	lol, yes
2008-12-20T07:02:00.000Z	chefan	xtreme	sorry, could not resist. depending on the version you are using at least not generally
2008-12-20T07:02:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	why my keyboard stops working?
2008-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	chefan		i have/had ubuntu running on various machines now and never had that issue
2008-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	chefan	xtreme	usb keyboard?
2008-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	no.. Laptop keyboard
2008-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	chefan		plus a lot of usb devices attached?
2008-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	chefan		ah, ok
2008-12-20T07:04:00.000Z	chefan	xtreme	just for curiosity, what brand of laptop? did you review the HCL?
2008-12-20T07:04:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	Dell E1405
2008-12-20T07:04:00.000Z	xtreme		Chefan: Ubuntu version Ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-20T07:05:00.000Z	chefan		hmm, iirc dell even delivers with ubuntu, so basic stuff like that should work
2008-12-20T07:06:00.000Z	chefan		what you could try is using a couple of live cd's to test if something got fubared in the latest release
2008-12-20T07:06:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	how to debug this weird issue?
2008-12-20T07:06:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	Okay
2008-12-20T07:07:00.000Z	chefan	xtreme	very difficult. 1st try would be to attach an external keyboard
2008-12-20T07:07:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	hmm.. ok
2008-12-20T07:07:00.000Z	chefan		and get a second box to connect to the laptop via ssh
2008-12-20T07:07:00.000Z	chefan		it's a bit difficult to debug stuff without even a keyboard to use :D
2008-12-20T07:08:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	OK.. then
2008-12-20T07:08:00.000Z	xtreme	chefan	i will install another linux flavor ;-)
