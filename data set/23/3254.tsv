2008-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	thanks a lot man
2008-06-04T09:49:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	this is not a place for Xamp discussion, what Lamp question do you have?
2008-06-04T09:53:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	save the file as /var/www/test.html then go to http://localhost/test.html in your browser
2008-06-04T09:54:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	what version of Ubuntu are you running? also, can you post the sourceforge link you used?
2008-06-04T09:55:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	hardy, http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html and http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61776&package_id=60248
2008-06-04T09:57:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	hrm you probably do not want to be using either of those, unless you know they are needed for some reason
2008-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	it is much better to install whatever programs you need (like Apache2 or MySQL server) using Applications -> Add/Remove
2008-06-04T10:00:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	install apache2 and mysql using System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
2008-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	 "LAMP" stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, install each one separately (they are pretty quick to install)
2008-06-04T10:03:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	so LAMP is not a file but an accronim
2008-06-04T10:04:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	yes exactly, it just refers to those 4 software products, Linux is the Operating System of course, Apache is the webserver, MySQL is for databases, and PHP is a programming language. They each work fine separately, but also work really well together :)
2008-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	nope you are all set for that part :) just make sure apache and mysql and php are installed :)
2008-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	great, now about the mail server thing...
2008-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	can i use no-ip?
2008-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	m_newton1	bring3	can i use no-ip for mail so something@(my no ip website)
2008-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	there are a few mail servers to choose from, i don't have experience so i can't recommend one, but you can try "dovecot" or "xmail" just search for them in System -> Admin -> Synaptic
2008-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	probably but i have never used no-ip myself :)
2008-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	sendmail is another option, there is an in-depth guide at http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch21_:_Configuring_Linux_Mail_Servers
2008-06-04T10:15:00.000Z	bring3	m_newton1	sure thing hope that helps :)
