2005-04-30T07:37:00.000Z	steve_		anybody up for the task?
2005-04-30T07:38:00.000Z	steve_		Anybody at all?
2005-04-30T07:38:00.000Z	steve_		just a question regarding modversions.h
2005-04-30T07:38:00.000Z	steve_		Oh.  Good point.
2005-04-30T07:39:00.000Z	steve_		WELL: I've installed Hoary on my parents' machine; runs great, with the exception of the Rockwell Riptide modem/soundcard
2005-04-30T07:39:00.000Z	steve_		I don't really need the modem, just the sound
2005-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	steve_		installed modem drivers from linuxant.com
2005-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	steve_		and the audio, which relies on the modem, claims I don't have modversions.h
2005-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	steve_		(I've installed the headers as well as the modules)
2005-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	steve_		Where do I go from here?
2005-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	perhaps there are additional headers that it depends on
2005-04-30T07:42:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	no, within the repos
2005-04-30T07:43:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	Whoops.  I should've checked the repos before I came here.  I just realized I don't have the multiverse enabled.
2005-04-30T07:43:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	BRB
2005-04-30T07:44:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	it should be in linux-headers-(uname -r)
2005-04-30T07:44:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	linux-headers-2.6.10-5 has it and is in main
2005-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	Still won't work.
2005-04-30T07:51:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	Not sure where else to go here...I've installed every header package there  (there're three for my architecture)
2005-04-30T07:59:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	I'm quite sure you have the file, gcc just doesn't see it. I don't know how to troubleshoot gcc though
2005-04-30T08:00:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	Hrm.
2005-04-30T08:00:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	Thank you for your help.
2005-04-30T08:00:00.000Z	steve_	farruinn	I'll keep searching and come back here if I can't find it.
2005-04-30T08:00:00.000Z	farruinn	steve_	don't thank me too much, I can't say I'm helping that much :/
