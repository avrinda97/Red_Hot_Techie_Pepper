2009-08-23T03:07:00.000Z	Slart	RenagadeX	hmm.. there is a command to reconfigure graphics drivers.. something like "dpkg-reconfigure Xorg" or something like that
2009-08-23T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	RenagadeX	I can't remember exactly
2009-08-23T03:08:00.000Z	RenagadeX	Slart	 I'll try google again
2009-08-23T03:08:00.000Z	RenagadeX	Slart	BTW is the command prompt/terminal the same for windows/linux/macintosh?
2009-08-23T03:09:00.000Z	RenagadeX	Slart	 I know Linux and Mac are the same
2009-08-23T03:09:00.000Z	RenagadeX		oh
2009-08-23T03:09:00.000Z	RenagadeX		ok
2009-08-23T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	RenagadeX	well.. the term "command prompt" means mostly the same no matter what system you're using.. but how it works and what you can do with it.. and most importantly.. how to do it can be very different
2009-08-23T03:10:00.000Z	RenagadeX	Slart	found this:: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-08-23T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	RenagadeX	ah.. that looks like it
2009-08-23T03:11:00.000Z	RenagadeX	Slart	do I get to terminal from live CD??
2009-08-23T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	RenagadeX	yes, you can get to a terminal from a live cd
