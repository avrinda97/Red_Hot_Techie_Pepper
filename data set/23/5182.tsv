2007-10-05T05:57:00.000Z	smultron		how do i get Keyring to auto-start without asking me for a password every time i turn the computer on? i've tried the pam-keyring thing suggested in the forms, but no luck
2007-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	did you delete the existing keyring so the password can be set to your user password?
2007-10-05T06:00:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	they're both the same to begin with. i only have one password
2007-10-05T06:01:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	and you edited /etc/pam.d/gdm ?
2007-10-05T06:04:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	and you are using Gnome with gdm correct? maybe you need to restart gdm... sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
2007-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	wouldn't that be restarted when i reboot the computer?
2007-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	indeed
2007-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	have you successfully done this yourself?
2007-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	yes
2007-10-05T06:05:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	I think you should try deleting your keyring anyway
2007-10-05T06:06:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	where is that?
2007-10-05T06:06:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	~/.gnome2/keyrings/default.keyring
2007-10-05T06:06:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	then restart gdm and relogin
2007-10-05T06:09:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	cool, seems to have worked. i'll do a full reboot just to check
2007-10-05T06:12:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	i did a full reboot, now it's asking me for my wireless network password
2007-10-05T06:12:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	you'll need to enter it the first time, you deleted your keyring
2007-10-05T06:14:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	now it's asking to make a new Keyring password
2007-10-05T06:14:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	I can't remember if it should do that or not, try setting to your user password
2007-10-05T06:15:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	ok, i'll try another reboot now
2007-10-05T06:15:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	logging out and loggin in should be sufficient
2007-10-05T06:16:00.000Z	smultron	astro76	nope, asking for a password again
2007-10-05T06:18:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	have you done it according to these directions? http://staff.xiaoka.com/smoku/2007/05/17/password-hell-resolved/
2007-10-05T06:18:00.000Z	astro76	smultron	note, seahorse isn't strictly necessary but it's nice to have
