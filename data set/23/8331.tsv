2004-12-09T07:19:00.000Z	sertmann		hmmm
2004-12-09T07:21:00.000Z	sertmann		even google doesn't come up with something usefull, how can there be no big database that you can actually enter data into for linux.... ah well, guess ill just use CrossOver office and install access through that
2004-12-09T07:22:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	big database != desktop thing with built in Visual Basic
2004-12-09T07:24:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	isn't a commandline database pretty hard to work with :-/
2004-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	no, you write an actual access layer for it
2004-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	or use something dodgy like openoffice's db thing
2005-09-24T09:15:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	you're sure? the snd_emu10k1 module really isn't loaded?
2005-09-24T09:16:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	sure no... but it says it's not detected
2005-09-24T09:16:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	"it says"? where?
2005-09-24T09:16:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	under the boot
2005-09-24T09:17:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	ALSA that is....
2005-09-24T09:17:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	alsa prints something along the lines of 'soundcard not detected'
2005-09-24T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	so, run lsmod and see if the module is loaded?
2005-09-24T09:19:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	well emu10k1 is there...
2005-09-24T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	because you're using warty from mid 2004
2005-09-24T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	then you removed ubuntu-desktop
2005-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	past your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-09-24T11:24:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	ok, hold on...
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	sertmann	bob2	there
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	well, you have other kernels available
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	er, they're not called kernel-image
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	and never have been in ubuntu
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	sertmann	sudo aptitude install linux-686
