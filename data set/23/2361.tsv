2009-05-09T20:39:00.000Z	Yanick_		there is a .ebuild for gentoo to add the Canon iP2200 printer (compile) but I don't know how to use it in Ubuntu. I have an jackalope and64 installation, and I cannot print to my Canon iP2200. Can anyone assist?
2009-05-09T20:39:00.000Z	Yanick_		or help, whatever
2009-05-09T20:39:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	does that thing even compile on a 64 bit system?
2009-05-09T20:39:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	(were you in here earlier asking about the same driver?)
2009-05-09T20:40:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	link me to the ebuild?
2009-05-09T20:40:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	(preferably include the "m" too :)
2009-05-09T20:42:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	as I thought, compiles a 32 bit package. I don't know where the corresponding 32 bit libraries live in ubuntu.
2009-05-09T20:43:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	(you keep doing "zz: ..." where you want to do "mzz: ..." to trigger my hilight...)
2009-05-09T20:43:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	that ebuild compiles a 32 bit driver
2009-05-09T20:43:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	sorry, your nick appeared on my screen as a square and two z's sorry :)
2009-05-09T20:44:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	your font must be horrible :P
2009-05-09T20:44:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	well, anyway
2009-05-09T20:45:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	I've looked everywhere to find how I can compile these drivers, but I'm no Linux guru, so all this is unsettling
2009-05-09T20:46:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	most of the answers are for x86, but nothing for amd64 except Turboprint... (ew)
2009-05-09T20:46:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	they are not good drivers. It would probably be better if gutenprint supports this printer (I'd expect it to in the future)
2009-05-09T20:47:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	I certainly hope so. how hard could it be? as one have said, it's merely a text file
2009-05-09T20:47:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	I would edit it if I had some base... and time :)
2009-05-09T20:47:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	(I have compiled them on a 32 bit system, they're part binary blob (which is why they won't compile as a 64 bit app) and the part that isn't blob is lacking decent error handling, so the results of running a miscompiled driver are confusing)
2009-05-09T20:48:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	("confusing" in a "hey, why is my system running so slowly? Oh, there's a stale driver process attempting and failing to spawn some other process as quickly as it can" way)
2009-05-09T20:48:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	hehe
2009-05-09T20:48:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	well, thanks for your help. I'll keep on using my wife's computer (windows) to print stuff :(
2009-05-09T20:49:00.000Z	mzz	Yanick_	because you know, if /usr/local/bin/whatever doesn't exist, obviously attempting to spawn it a few million times will make it exist!
2009-05-09T20:51:00.000Z	Yanick_	mzz	despite it all, I'm glad that Ubuntu runs stable enough on this Studio XPS 16. My other system was an Inspiron 5150, and was horribly unstable, so I was forced to use XP. I won't complain too much about a stupid Canon driver :)
