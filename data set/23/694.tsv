2011-10-17T09:54:00.000Z	cpgo		I'm on ubuntu 11.10 32-bit and when installing nvidia driver via "Additional Drivers" I get "Sorry, installation of this driver failed."
2011-10-17T09:54:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	Maybe there is a network problem.
2011-10-17T09:55:00.000Z	cpgo		with ubuntu servers?
2011-10-17T09:55:00.000Z	cpgo		downloading directly from nvidia will work though, right? usr13
2011-10-17T09:57:00.000Z	cpgo	usr13	here's a log: http://pastebin.com/QjaJ1CzK

2011-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	sudo apt-get install nvidia_current
2011-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	cpgo		user13: E: Unable to locate package nvidia_current
2011-10-17T10:01:00.000Z	cpgo	usr13	all the software sources are checked

2011-10-17T10:02:00.000Z	cpgo		hmm says already installed
2011-10-17T10:04:00.000Z	cpgo		going to restart, thanks for the help, I'll be back if problem persists
2011-10-17T10:12:00.000Z	cpgo	usr13	no luck
2011-10-17T10:12:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	Let me look at the log again.

2011-10-17T10:15:00.000Z	cpgo	usr13	idk why the driver was already installed (nvidia-current) but "Additional Drivers" says it isnt. I uninstalled nvidia-current and just re-installed it. Going to restart again
2011-10-17T10:15:00.000Z	cpgo		thanks for taking a look at it
2011-10-17T10:15:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	ls /var/cache/jockey/
2011-10-17T10:15:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	Ok.
2011-10-17T10:15:00.000Z	usr13	cpgo	You might also do   apt-get -f install
