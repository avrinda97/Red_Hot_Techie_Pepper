2007-08-10T12:32:00.000Z	tach00		is this what you were looking for
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	tach00		yes, the problem is, the screen is so big that i cant see the buttons at the bottom of windows
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	tach00		it says i only have one screen resolution
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 you need to have more resolutions available on your screen? as in 1024x768 and 1280x1024 ?   edit xorg.conf and add them manualy to the list then restart x
2007-08-10T12:37:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 in the terminal    type  gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    about half way down the file you will see the list of available resolutions , follow the syntax carefully
2007-08-10T12:43:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	you have an intel video card ?
2007-08-10T12:44:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	what kind of screen ?
2007-08-10T12:45:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 I think that's an ati or nvidia card,   closed gedit, goto  menu > system > admin > restricted drivers , see what it tells you
2007-08-10T12:46:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	there is a catch ,  you'll need to give us 6 months of your time troubleshooting other ppl for each problems of yours we solve
2007-08-10T12:47:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	ok,  you will need to check your documentation to make sure what video card model you have,  just to make sure
2007-08-10T13:00:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 anyting look like the intel 86.... series of your vidoe card ?
2007-08-10T12:52:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 hold on let me look
2007-08-10T12:53:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	ok  when you look in  menu > system > prefs > resolution  , what is it set to ?
2007-08-10T12:56:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	from the command line type   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg , when in doubt use the default answer provided
2007-08-10T12:57:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	what are your options ?
2007-08-10T12:58:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	what are the other options ?

2007-08-10T13:02:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	forget the copy paste fro now look for something in the intel 82845  range
2007-08-10T13:04:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	go for vga
2007-08-10T13:08:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	 you need to turn off capslock first
2007-08-10T13:08:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	  ctrl alt backspace will restart X   and should start the new settings
2007-08-10T13:44:00.000Z	Pelo	tach00	sorry aboutthat,   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg,  and pick only the default options
