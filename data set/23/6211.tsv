2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		all right, what's the deal with upgrading to Dapper through the Update Manager?
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		I can't get this to work at all.
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	what can't you get to work?
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	I click "Check", it says my system is up to date.
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	and I do have the newest Update Manager.
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	where do you click check?  what applications aren't working?
2006-06-01T07:51:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	in the Update Manager, as explained on the wiki.
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	I'm still missing the big picture.  what is happening that shouldn't happen?
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	that should upgrade my system, or so the wiki claims.
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	in reality, nothing happens.

2006-06-01T07:53:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	  gksudo update-manager -d
2006-06-01T07:53:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	what's that do?
2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	"Your system is up-to-date"
2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	grep dapper /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	nothing.
2006-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	edit that file.  change all the  'breezy'  into  'dapper'    then  sudo apt-get update
2006-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	great, I installed Ubuntu so I wouldn't have to edit files in /etc/.
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	the instructions in that document, *should* install a new breezy version of update-manager;  which then should allow you to upgrade the distribution to dapper.  did you restart the application after install the new version of update-manager?
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	several times.
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	sladen	WAHa_06x36	what version of update-manager do you have installed?   Can you find out the version?
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	I also checked with synaptic that I've got the newest version.
2006-06-01T08:06:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	sladen	getting any messages back yet?
