2010-10-13T09:24:00.000Z	doc1987_		im running ubuntu netbook version 10.04 and when i start up my bluetooth applet does not start. How do I get it to start up?
2010-10-13T09:24:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	there's a switch to make it always display or only when connected, are you wanting that?
2010-10-13T09:25:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	im wanting it to always display
2010-10-13T09:26:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	okay, the way I would do it is different than the sane way
2010-10-13T09:26:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	sane way is System > Preferences > Bluetooth [x] Show Bluetooth icon
2010-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	insane way is install 'dconf-tools' and run dconf-editor to edit the GSettings value manually
2010-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	ok...i dont really know if my laptop is supporting bluetooth honestly. it tells me no adapters but when i had windows on this thing it had bluetooth
2010-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	it is telling me i have no adapters installed but when i had windows i had bluetooth on my laptop?
2010-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	too bad about that
2010-10-13T09:31:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	I only know how to tell the bluetooth applet software to be there when a supported bluetooth device is there
2010-10-13T09:31:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	ah ok..thanks tho
2010-10-13T09:32:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	the output of 'hcitool dev' can show you any supported hci (bluetooth)
2010-10-13T09:33:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	you need to make it so that your bluetooth is working before the software can interact
2010-10-13T09:33:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	ok
2010-10-13T09:34:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	so if it comes up blank my guess is its not supported
2010-10-13T09:35:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	correct !
2010-10-13T09:35:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	ok thanks...i was hoping that it had bluetooth wanted to play around with that
2010-10-13T09:36:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	some laptops disable wifi to enable bluetooth, or they are switched on and off together
2010-10-13T09:36:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	try your switches on your laptop's surface
2010-10-13T09:36:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	its a netbook and has no switches
2010-10-13T09:37:00.000Z	lucent	doc1987_	you can make a switch with a sharp bowie knife, and repeated stabbing motions? >:-)
2010-10-13T09:38:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	lol this is true
2010-10-13T09:41:00.000Z	doc1987_	lucent	maybe you can help me...im taking a networking class in school and looking for cool and useful networking programs for ubuntu...any you know of?
