2007-04-24T10:39:00.000Z	scarter		does bcm43xx support 54mb?
2007-04-24T10:39:00.000Z	syke	scarter	I've seen it work
2007-04-24T10:39:00.000Z	syke	scarter	but only with certain APs, which is my current problem
2007-04-24T10:40:00.000Z	scarter	syke	i'm on 7.04 amd64... can you point me to some useful docs... i'm at my wits end with google. thanks
2007-04-24T10:40:00.000Z	syke	scarter	there's a Wireless FAQ
2007-04-24T10:41:00.000Z	scarter	syke	i've got 2 diff APs, one linksys and one d-link... either of them promising from your experience?
2007-04-24T10:41:00.000Z	syke	scarter	it seems to depend how old it is
2007-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	syke	scarter	the one I had luck with was a netgear that's 2 years old
2007-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	scarter	syke	wrt54gs and di-624, both are probably 3 yrs
2007-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	syke	scarter	they may work fine
2007-04-24T10:43:00.000Z	scarter	syke	i'll check to FAQ to see what some tweaks might be to jump out of 11mb into 54mb. thanks
2007-04-24T10:43:00.000Z	syke	scarter	you've got it connected, which is better than me :(
2007-04-24T10:44:00.000Z	scarter	syke	i had to enable b/g on the di-624 before it would connect. i do have my ssid 'off' and i'm using wpa2, which both worked fine right away...
2007-04-24T10:46:00.000Z	scarter	syke	the biggest issue was finding a firmware that would function properly. i have a cpq notebook but ended up using a dell v3.100.64 driver to cut the fw.
2007-04-24T10:47:00.000Z	syke	scarter	hm, maybe I should try that
2007-04-24T10:47:00.000Z	scarter	syke	i've got one of the bcm4306 rev3 nightmares
2007-04-24T10:53:00.000Z	scarter	syke	initially, i didn't realize that bcm43xx doesn't support v4.xxx.xx properly, so you've got to find v3.xxx.xx drivers to cut
2007-04-24T10:53:00.000Z	syke	scarter	crap. ok.
2007-04-24T10:54:00.000Z	syke	scarter	how do I found out the exact rev I have?
2007-04-24T10:55:00.000Z	scarter	syke	dell and hp/cpq list the versions, so i didn't have an issue finding one of their older listings
2007-04-24T10:56:00.000Z	scarter	syke	the one i pulled from dell was for a truemobile 1350
2007-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	syke	scarter	a truemobile 1350 is what I have
2007-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	scarter	syke	well... isn't that handy ;-)
