2009-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	joaopinto		Wincerind, because grub1 is no longer maintaned, and grub2 provides new features like booting from ISOs, NFS, encrypted boots, etc
2009-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	joaopinto		erm was for Windcape
2009-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	Windcape	joaopinto	but they didn't think people would EVER want to change the boot order?
2009-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	Windcape	you can, but don't ask me how, I didn't needed
2009-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	Windcape		ah, so it's the usual GNU thing. No documentation, hurray
2009-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	joaopinto		The order of the /etc/grub.d/ numbering is probably helpful for the grub menu order building
2009-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	Windcape	joaopinto	and? that's irrelevant as you can't rename those files
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	joaopinto		Wincerind, uh ? you can't ???
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	Windcape		and *sigh* all articles say /etc/default/grub , but that's funny enough, not existant on Ubuntu
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	joaopinto		Windcape,
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	Windcape	if you don't have /etc/default/grub, you don't have grub2 installed
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	Windcape		I clearly do, according to grub itself
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	Windcape		since the /boot/grub/menu.lst isn't there
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	Windcape	I do have /etc/default/grub
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	Windcape		oh great, it's available though the filesystem, just not the stupid terminal autocomplete shit
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	joaopinto		!language | Windcape
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	Windcape		why make tools like this "run 'update-grub' afterwards"
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	Windcape		why didn't they just code a GUI tool for the purpose, who does so automatically upon save, with included error checking
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	Windcape		like gaaaaah
2009-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	Windcape	if you have free time and the skills, feel free to do it, help first, complain later
2009-10-29T21:45:00.000Z	Windcape		why is /etc/default/grub read-only?
2009-10-29T21:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	Windcape	to protect if from accidental changes
