2005-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	i can't get into ubuntu
2005-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	define can't get?
2005-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	you want me to chroot in?
2005-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	if you can, yes.
2005-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	what menu.lst will it use?
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	which is generated by update-grub
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	i get permission denied
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	slightly more info would be handy. :)
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	/dev/null: Permission denied
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	I'm out of my depth here, but I'd say you're messed up.
2005-10-27T11:30:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	perhaps seveas is the smarter man, but a reinstall is probably the best thing to do.
2005-10-27T11:30:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	maybe it's a read/write issue in knoppix
2005-10-27T11:31:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	can't i use the installCD to reinstall grub
2005-10-27T11:32:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	might be possible to pass your root=/ etc variables to the cd boot prompt, in fact.
2005-10-27T11:33:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	i have no idea how to do that
2005-10-27T11:35:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	/sbin/grub-install: line 479: /dev/null: Permission denied
2005-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	avinoam	pop in an ubuntu install cd, and instead of pressing enter try root=/dev/yourdisk/partition, but I must admit, i'm not up to speed on those options.
2005-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	avinoam	HiddenWolf	I'll try that
