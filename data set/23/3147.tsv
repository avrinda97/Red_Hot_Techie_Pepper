2008-07-10T13:23:00.000Z	Sivam		hi all
2008-07-10T13:23:00.000Z	Sivam		gvfs-fuse-daemon is consuming more diskspace in hdd
2008-07-10T13:23:00.000Z	Sivam		how to recover ?
2008-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	Sivam		no
2008-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	Sivam		I understand that the gvfs is taking is more space
2008-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	Sivam		I got this from df -k output
2008-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	Sivam		df -k
2008-07-10T13:26:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	gvfs is a virtual filesystem -- it doesn't take space in reality
2008-07-10T13:29:00.000Z	Sivam	sn9_	so what might be the cause
2008-07-10T13:30:00.000Z	Sivam	sn9_	/dev/sda1 is showing   available: 4916892 used:4799736
2008-07-10T13:30:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	i don't really know, but my point is that it shouldn't matter
2008-07-10T13:30:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	oh, sda1 is different
2008-07-10T13:31:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	du -ham /*|sort -gr
2008-07-10T13:31:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	du -ham /*|sort -gr|head
2008-07-10T13:33:00.000Z	Sivam	sn9_	/usr, /usr/src, /usr/src/linux, /lib,/usr/share, /lib/modules , /lib/modules/kernelver/kernel, /usr/lib
2008-07-10T13:34:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	then your partition is just way too small -- those are normal sizes
2008-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	kernel building takes a lot of space
2008-07-10T13:38:00.000Z	Sivam	sn9_	but it is also showing another , du: cannot access /proc/5439/task/5439/fd/3
2008-07-10T13:38:00.000Z	sn9_	Sivam	that's ok
2008-07-10T13:55:00.000Z	Sivam	sn9_	Hi sorry for disturbance, the /usr/src folder had got the source code which took 3 GB
