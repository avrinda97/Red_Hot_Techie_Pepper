2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	urlwolf		updates brought a new kernel, and my non-free nvidia drivers need to be reinstalled
2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	urlwolf		I'm in a console. if I try to stop gdm it says:  unknown instance, but nvidia drivers say there's X running and I should stop
2009-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	urlwolf		I tried the init.d script, no way to stop gdm
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	urlwolf		ok chmod -x done
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	urlwolf		then?
2009-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	urlwolf		still, stop:unknown instance
2009-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	urlwolf		but they don't like that there's X running already, and I cannot stop gdm
2009-12-06T18:55:00.000Z	urlwolf		I'm following tutorials, but gdm: unknown service is stopping me
2009-12-06T18:57:00.000Z	urlwolf		If applying recommended updates (new kernel) will kill your guI for good and getting it back requires command line work, we are far from reaching mainstream desktop users...
2009-12-06T18:59:00.000Z	urlwolf		how do I force shutdown X?
2009-12-06T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	why?
2009-12-06T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	why do you want to shut down X...
2009-12-06T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	you're likely doing something the hard way.  Tell us what you want to accomplish
2009-12-06T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	are you using the drivers provided by ubuntu in System -> Hardware Drivers?
2009-12-06T19:02:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	the ones in Hardware Drivers are also the non-free ones.
2009-12-06T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	if you use the Hardware Drivers ones then you won't have the issue you are currently having
2009-12-06T19:03:00.000Z	urlwolf	jrib	ok, but how do I get back to normal?
2009-12-06T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	then use System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers ?
2009-12-06T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	so?
2009-12-06T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	because you aren't using the drivers from ubuntu
2009-12-06T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	yes
2009-12-06T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	no mucking about with xorg.conf
2009-12-06T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	urlwolf	depending on what you've done so far though, you may have to undo that
