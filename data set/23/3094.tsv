2008-09-17T21:24:00.000Z	hyperair_		how does one get an ubuntu server installation with root on lvm to boot? it says waiting for root, and then it waits until i reset it
2008-09-17T21:26:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	/boot is on ext3 not LVM?
2008-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	yes. ext3
2008-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	dev/sda1, ext3
2008-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	out of any LVM volume?
2008-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	/dev/sda1 is the partition /boot is on
2008-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	doesn't that say something?
2008-09-17T21:28:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	is /dev/sda1 an LVM volume or not?
2008-09-17T21:28:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	note, i don't have problems with grub looking for the kernel or the initrd, i have problems with the kernel and initrd finding the damn root.
2008-09-17T21:28:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	no!
2008-09-17T21:29:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	poke
2008-09-17T21:29:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	anything particular you did in the install? LVM on RAID or you just let the installer partitioned the disk?
2008-09-17T21:29:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	no RAID. just LVM
2008-09-17T21:30:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	used the ubuntu server cd
2008-09-17T21:30:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	if it helps, i needed to chroot and get linux-virtual
2008-09-17T21:31:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	virtualized server?
2008-09-17T21:31:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	yes
2008-09-17T21:31:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	am afraid my knowledge stops here then
2008-09-17T21:31:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	so this issue shouldn't appear with normal computers?
2008-09-17T21:32:00.000Z	blue-frog	hyperair_	it will not indeed
2008-09-17T21:32:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	okay then.
2008-09-17T21:33:00.000Z	hyperair_	blue-frog	oho. i've finally been dumped into busybox to debug. and it seems /dev/sda is missing.
