2007-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	alex_mayorga		can someone help me troubleshoot my wifi?
2007-04-25T06:13:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	what type of card? i only have experience w/ broadcom, but if it is that, I might be able to help.
2007-04-25T06:14:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	do you have windows drivers for your card? are you using ndiswrapper?
2007-04-25T06:15:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	definitely try ndiswrapper. it usually works.
2007-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	greywhind	is there a guide?
2007-04-25T06:17:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	i have written a guide for a different Broadcom card, or there's the official ndiswrapper guide.
2007-04-25T06:18:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	the official one would be https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-04-25T06:19:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	if you use that, i wouldn't suggest the "automated installation for Broadcom 4318"
2007-04-25T06:19:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	i wouldn't do the automated one because you don't have a 4318, although you do have a Broadcom
2007-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	greywhind	do you have the "powers" to kick that bug forward?
2007-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	heh... no.
2007-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	greywhind	from the reports looks fixable, just above my league
2007-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	here's the guide I wrote: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2505546&postcount=3
2007-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	the part you would do differently is the driver - rather than using the one i listed there, you would find another windows driver that's specific to your card.
2007-04-25T06:24:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	neither way is more "ubuntu
2007-04-25T06:24:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	both bcm43xx and ndiswrapper are fairly ugly hacks, but there isn't a better way that I know of.
2007-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	I found the recommended driver for your card
2007-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	greywhind	the bcm43xx was on feisty by default
2007-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	yes, it was for me too. but it didn't work for my card either, and ndiswrapper does.
2007-04-25T06:26:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	the following link is the driver you should use with ndiswrapper: "http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-45290-1&lc=en&cc=sg&dlc=en&product=3245619&os=228&lang=en" title="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-45290-1&lc=en&cc=sg&dlc=en&product=3245619&os=228&lang=en"
2007-04-25T06:34:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	did you get it to work?
2007-04-25T06:36:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	you could just log out and log back in, i guess.
2007-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	greywhind	alex_mayorga	congrats
