2011-01-15T20:24:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	that's detailed in the !dvd link... but you can't "just run that command" pretty sure you have to install libdvdread4
2011-01-15T20:24:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 mm no   I run that all the time with no issues   as far as I know it is installed
2011-01-15T20:25:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	then it (libdvdread4) must be installed out of the box now
2011-01-15T20:26:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 seems to be... i could be wrong however that command always works even on ubuntu 11.04
2011-01-15T20:26:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	it works, if libdvdread4 is installed.. if it's not.. it won't work
2011-01-15T20:26:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	  it works  :)
2011-01-28T03:32:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	on the minimal cd, does it give you the choice of which GUI to install, etc?
2011-01-28T03:33:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	  yes is does  I am not sure if lubuntu desktop is on ther however
2011-01-28T03:33:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	ah ok... i think his ram limitations will kinda suck w/ gnome, kde, or xfce
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 yes indeed, that's why the minimal install cd  at 12 megs is ideal
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	if he's gonna do that, i'd just download and install lubuntu... wouldn't that be easier?
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	why not use the lubuntu alternate install cd?
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 well with only a 12meg cd to burn  there is far less chance of  corrupted downloads
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	  but either way would be fine
2011-01-28T03:35:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	yeah, but..c orrupted downloads, vs low system specs, are two separate issues.
2011-01-28T03:35:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 this is true  and the minimal install cd relies on internet connection rather than ram
2011-01-28T03:38:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	strange, lubuntu doesn't seem to have a alt. cd
2011-01-28T03:38:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 ah ok then the minimal install cd  and then  sudo apt-get install lxde  might be the best way to go
2011-01-28T03:39:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	yep, you may well be correct on that
2011-05-31T22:13:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	thats why choice is a beautiful thing... i prefer lxde
2011-05-31T22:14:00.000Z	coz_	KM0201	 absolutely ,, and if it were not for my loyalties to compiz and cairo dock I probably would swtich  because I refuse to use gnome3
2011-07-20T06:40:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	lol
2011-08-03T06:45:00.000Z	KM0201	coz_	BINGO!!!
