2007-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	freakabcd		do i need to do something about the gpg keys ?
2007-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	probably. have you googled for this?
2007-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	nope.
2007-01-11T10:55:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	then why are you hassling us about it?
2007-01-11T10:55:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	cos you might know what i need to search for?
2007-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	i have checked on the net andmostly i see people saying it will say 'not authenticated' when installing fom repositories without keys. but i have checked the keys in synaptic and the ubuntu keys are there!
2007-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	ok, so the problem is that your system can't find the correct gpg keys, right?
2007-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	i'm not sure. because the beryl packages i installed from the ubuntu.beryl-project.org repo didnt say not authenticated
2007-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	try "apt-key update "
2007-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	the  ubuntu.beryl-project.org packages may not be signed
2007-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	they are
2007-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	ok: have you tried my command?
2007-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	trying now
2007-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	thanks. that solved the problem.
2007-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	can i ask a favour?
2007-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	freakabcd	snail	yes
2007-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	find a wiki somewhere, anywhere and enter the full text of your problem and solution
2007-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	then the next time someone has the problem, they can google the answer
2007-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	particularly important is the full text of the error message you got
2007-01-11T11:12:00.000Z	snail	freakabcd	only the western ones, not the asian ones
