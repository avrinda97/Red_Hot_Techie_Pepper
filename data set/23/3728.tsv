2009-06-07T07:53:00.000Z	rohit		oops wrong window...
2009-06-07T07:55:00.000Z	rohit		Okay what's my password for IRC because I don't remember giving one ...
2009-06-07T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	That account hasn't been used in almost four years. So if you did give a password, it would be four years ago.
2009-06-07T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	Hasn't been logged in.  Whoever registered it hasn't logged on in four years.  Although people may have used the nick without identifying.
2009-06-07T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	Because you don't have to identify to log in with that nick.  It just may kick you off that nick if you don't identify.
2009-06-07T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	But, this is offtopic.  If you have more questions about it, I'd be happy to go over them with you in #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-06-07T07:59:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	yeah right ... sorry about that :D
2009-06-09T06:06:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	well the laptop doesn't have an internet connection. And I was thinking of taking the package files, copying them to the cache dir of apt and installing
2009-06-09T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	Right.  That website should be able to do it.
2009-06-09T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	I'm not sure if there's an easier way (maybe synaptic can do that download script for other arches? I don't know)
2009-06-09T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	No, but that last website will generate them for you.  http://apt.alturl.com/
2009-06-09T06:09:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	avgbvg Paddy_EIRE alright thanks I will give it a go
2009-06-09T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	Another alternative (click-wise easier) is to boot a liveCD and use aptonCD to generate an iso
2009-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	why boot from a live cd ?
2009-06-09T06:20:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	I can install ubuntu 32 bit in a virtual box, install the packages and then save the cached package files right ? Because I don't want to burn a cd :D
2009-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	yeah.  You can also do an iso via USB or whatever.
2009-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	Any form of sneakernet
2009-06-09T06:30:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	I think i preffer copying the packages - isn't that simpler and better ? It will work right ? :P Cuz my friend would kill me if it didn't :P
2009-06-09T06:31:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	It'll work as far as installation goes, yes.  I'm not sure if the packages will be seen coming from the internet (because there's some metafiles associated with it), but I suppose in his case, that's moot.
2009-06-09T06:32:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	in an emergency I could just double click on the packages right ? APT should install them that way ?
2009-06-09T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	rohit	yeah, dpkg -i /folder/of/debs/*
2009-06-09T06:33:00.000Z	rohit	Flannel	okay great - thanks again :D
