2011-01-02T17:04:00.000Z	Israfel		Anyone know why custom icons don't work?
2011-01-02T17:05:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	don't work how?
2011-01-02T17:05:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	I downloaded a 48x48 icon and selected it from the launcher properties, but it disappears and never shows it.
2011-01-02T17:06:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	This icon: http://www.softicons.com/download/internet-icons/google-chrome-icons-by-ever/png/48/Google%20Black.png
2011-01-02T17:07:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	I have 2 launchers for Chromium, one regular, one incognito, the new launcher works, but I wanted a different icon so i could tell the two apart.
2011-01-02T17:08:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	how did you try install icon?
2011-01-02T17:09:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	install icon? I moved it to /usr/shared/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps and changed the group and owner to root. It should be like every other icon in that folder now.
2011-01-02T17:09:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	yep. and then?
2011-01-02T17:09:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	did you select it for app?
2011-01-02T17:10:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	i opened the Launcher Properties and browsed to the icon in the list.
2011-01-02T17:10:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	As soon as I open the icon, it reverts back to the springboard icon.
2011-01-02T17:10:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	so you select it by open, and it reverts?
2011-01-02T17:11:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	Does it have to have some special coding behind the .png file?
2011-01-02T17:11:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	As if I never selected it.
2011-01-02T17:12:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	hmmh. let my try
2011-01-02T17:42:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	No luck? I haven't found anything in a while.
2011-01-02T17:47:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	no. the icon you gave is not working but i have several others that are
2011-01-02T17:48:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	I wonder why that icon doesn't work? maybe it shows as a PNG file, but not the right kind of PNG? transparency, etc.. But that's not the only icon i've tried.
2011-01-02T17:49:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	hmmh, and sorry. It's working
2011-01-02T17:49:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	try to add it from your home folder
2011-01-02T17:49:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	just browse there and select it, like that i was able to use it
2011-01-02T17:52:00.000Z	Israfel	gobbe	Maybe gtm needed a refresh? it's odd though, because the Launcher properties never showed the icon as being selected, using any other icon worked though.
2011-01-03T02:18:00.000Z	gobbe	Israfel	what do you mean that doesn't see it?
