2011-02-10T10:01:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	ah okay so it worked -- sorta
2011-02-10T10:01:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	my windows is smaller, and my ubuntu main is bigger, but my swap didnt get bigger. midway errors popped up and it canceled
2011-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	jack_	ny51bern	you can try it again :D
2011-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	no, all space is allocated, just none of it went to swap
2011-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	anything i took from windows is in my main ubuntu now
2011-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	 is it bad to have only 666mb swap?
2011-02-10T10:05:00.000Z	jack_	ny51bern	as long as youre not running out of memory you'll be fine
2011-02-10T10:05:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	how do i know if i am?
2011-02-10T10:06:00.000Z	jack_	ny51bern	do a `free -m` if you have 0 free memory and 0 swap space you're in trouble :)
2011-02-10T10:07:00.000Z	ny51bern	jack_	got all 664 free :) ...im not going anything that hogs so much RAM so i think ill be fine
