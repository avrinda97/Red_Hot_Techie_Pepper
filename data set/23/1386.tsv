2010-04-23T14:39:00.000Z	BRc		in compiz
2010-04-23T14:39:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Yes, that is a Problem related to Special Effects. Did you turn Reflections on?
2010-04-23T14:41:00.000Z	BRc	rocket16	 its ticked but cannot move or drag windows
2010-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	BRc	rocket16	still the same
2010-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Try this, press Alt+F2, and type "gtk-window-decorator" without quotes
2010-04-23T14:44:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Did it work?
2010-04-23T14:45:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Ok, try Alt+F2, and use "metacity --replace" without quotes
2010-04-23T14:46:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Did it work now??
2010-04-23T14:46:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	??
2010-04-23T14:47:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Did the command work there?
2010-04-23T14:48:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	I see, can you open Terminal?
2010-04-23T14:48:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	If so, type "sudo apt-get install emerald emerald-themes" and then "compiz --replace -c emerald &"
2010-04-23T14:49:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	I think, you are using Compiz Fusion. If so, this will install Window Decorations from Emerald.
2010-04-23T14:50:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	I see. I think turning off Desktop effects might help. Your Drivers are nit compatible with the ED effects I suppose. Happened to me in 9.04
2010-04-23T14:54:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Any result?
2010-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	BRc	rocket16	no go darn it
2010-04-23T14:59:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	I see. Compiz is really a problem some times. I think, restarting Graphics and turning effects on will help. First use in Terminal "killall -user username" (without quotes, where username is your username). It will log you out, and take you back to the login screen. Login again, and then right-click on Desktop, select "change desktop background" and then select Visual effects Tab, and select "No effects"
2010-04-23T15:02:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Did you try that?
2010-04-23T15:03:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	If no result, use this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=485863
2010-04-23T15:10:00.000Z	BRc	rocket16	 thx again
2010-04-23T15:10:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Ah, did it work?
2010-04-23T15:11:00.000Z	rocket16	BRc	Sure, :)
