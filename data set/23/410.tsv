2012-09-15T18:33:00.000Z	Cong		is there no way to empty the rubbish bin on a usb storage device?
2012-09-15T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	unmounting doesn't do it?  I vaguely remember that suggestion once
2012-09-15T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	I don't know then :/  What happens when you try to use the GUI to empty trash?  You could always just delete the relevant directory on the usb, but again, I don't know if there is a better way
2012-09-15T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	I see.  Well is just deleting the trash directory on the usb a possibility?
2012-09-15T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	that sounds odd.  What did you delete exactly?
2012-09-15T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	yep
2012-09-15T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	ah.  Don't know then :)
2012-09-15T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	you could log in as a new user and then empty the trash, though you probably consider that a hack too
2012-10-04T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	the anti-alias :)
2012-10-04T14:19:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	be more specific
2012-10-04T14:11:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	aptitude has the best searching...
2012-10-04T14:11:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	better than synaptic?
2012-10-04T14:15:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	yes, better than synaptic :)  http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/projects/aptitude/doc/en/ch02s03s05.html
2012-10-04T14:18:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	what is used to search for fixed names or complete package name?
2012-10-04T14:19:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	aptitude search '~nNAME'
2012-10-04T14:19:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	didn't work.
2012-10-04T14:20:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	just the letters "ri".
2012-10-04T14:21:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	aptitude search '~nri'   will return only packages with "ri" in their names.  What did you want it to do?
2012-10-04T14:23:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	search from within the program.,and get only the packages that match ri completely.
2012-10-04T14:24:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	aptitude has a curses mode.
2012-10-04T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	you can use regex in the search.  You would never want to search for exactly the package "ri" though because, well obviously there's only one package with the name exactly "ri".  But using regex: aptitude search '~n^ri$'.  I never cared for aptitude's curses interface
2012-10-04T14:28:00.000Z	Cong	jrib	regexes function in curses mode too.
2012-10-04T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	Cong	k
