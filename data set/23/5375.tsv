2007-06-17T06:53:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	CallWeaver?
2007-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	yes.
2007-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	it's something like Asterisk.
2007-06-17T06:55:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	ok,
2007-06-17T06:57:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	so kppp is supposed to do the same thing as minicom? (Hee-Ho!)
2007-06-17T06:59:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	yes, but kppp doesn't do as much as minicom, but for what we are trying to do, kppp is fine.
2007-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	it establishes a connection and gets out of the way?
2007-06-17T07:01:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	I don't know, all I've used it for was to configure the comm port, and then run it with another app.
2007-06-17T07:04:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	I see that there's an option to send files. Maybe that's what I want. But it sends me to a menu with "zmodem, ymodem, xmodem, kermit, and ascii". And then sends me to a file selection screen with all my files.
2007-06-17T07:04:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	on minicom, I mean.
2007-06-17T07:05:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	roger that, I don't know what protocol a fax uses, so I don't know if any of those options would work?
2007-06-17T07:05:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	so you don't know what is zmodem, for example?
2007-06-17T07:07:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	yes, it is a modem protocol, from the 80,s and 90,s for sending files over BBS systems, but that is history now, do to the WWW.
2007-06-17T07:08:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	I see. I just tried the autodetect feature on the default network configurator, with the same result. Maybe you are right about the modem playing dead...
2007-06-17T07:09:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	yep, re-seat it, make sure it is enabled in bios, and then....?
2007-06-17T07:10:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	I'll do that, but for the time being, I'll just go to some Office Max and send the damn fax...:).
2007-06-17T07:12:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	what time is it?
2007-06-17T07:13:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	here? 2111
2007-06-17T07:13:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	you're in the US?
2007-06-17T07:14:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	yep
2007-06-17T07:16:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	OK. I have to tend some family matters...my children have been jumping around me for quite a while waiting for me to go out..
2007-06-17T07:20:00.000Z	lgc	n2diy	I really appreciate your help and patience. Even though I didn't get the damn modem work, at least I gained some exposure to some technicalities of it. I'll try again later when I reboot my machine (maybe after the impending upgrade to Edgy). I'll feel better trying things out by myself next time. Thanks again and bye for now.
2007-06-17T07:26:00.000Z	n2diy	lgc	roger that, GL
