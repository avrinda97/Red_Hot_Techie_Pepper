2008-09-12T03:18:00.000Z	ImSoNewb		hi linux gurus, i am installing ubntu 8.04 on a newly built system. at the prepare partitions screen, it's not showing either of my SATA hdds, though they're detected by the BIOS. what should i do?
2008-09-12T03:19:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	you've tried "sudo fdisk -l" ?
2008-09-12T03:20:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	no, and i don't see a place to type in any commands
2008-09-12T03:20:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	Applications > Acessories > Terminal
2008-09-12T03:21:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	the OS hasn't been installed yet. there are no menus.
2008-09-12T03:21:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	But the Live CD should load anyway. You'll have an experimental desktop with an "Install" in the desktop
2008-09-12T03:22:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	ah ok. i do have the live CD but i'm not running it in live mode, just went straight to install
2008-09-12T03:25:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	the command you need to memorize when you're there is "sudo fdisk -l" This will take a look at your disks and list all partitions. Once you get your system installed you'll have loads of time to try out the terminal
2008-09-12T03:27:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	you should have no problem. That command will show us if it's truly not seeing anything. You can use IRC from within the LiveCD so we can give you a hand once you're there
2008-09-12T03:32:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	nothing at all?
2008-09-12T03:35:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	"sudo fdisk -l" <-- that's a small L just in case you entered a caps i
2008-09-12T03:43:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	you're you installed the disks correctly?
2008-09-12T03:44:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	i don't know what i could have done wrong, just plugged in SATA signal and power cables to the mainboard
2008-09-12T03:44:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	you also connected them to power source?
2008-09-12T03:45:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	hmm. I don't them. But now I'm wondering if it's unpartioned space would appear in fdisk. Try cfdisk /dev/sda
2008-09-12T03:48:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	sorry. You have to prefix that command with sudo
2008-09-12T03:48:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	oh, you did add sudo. Hmmmm
2008-09-12T03:49:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	try also "sudo cfdisk /dev/hda"
2008-09-12T03:49:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	i get the same error
2008-09-12T03:51:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	there's an application somewhere called gparted. Look for it in the menus ( I don't have it installed so I don't know where it is)
2008-09-12T04:05:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	did you figure out what was wrong?
2008-09-12T04:05:00.000Z	ImSoNewb	carandraug	i rebooted, loaded up the live session, and ran the installer. at the partitioning screen, the same thing is happening. no hard disks displayed and i can't proceed.
2008-09-12T04:08:00.000Z	carandraug	ImSoNewb	that's really strange. Only thing that occurs to me is some problem with the disks installation. You'll have to ask around and say that nothing appears appears under "sudo fdisk -l"
