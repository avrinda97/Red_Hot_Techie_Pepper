2011-07-30T17:33:00.000Z	StevenR		hi. X11 keeps freezing. I can switch to a tty, and the underlying OS seems fine. I just can't seem to fix X11 without rebooting.
2011-07-30T17:33:00.000Z	StevenR		The only way I've found so far to fix it, is rebooting.
2011-07-30T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	restarting the gdm service doesn't work?
2011-07-30T17:36:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	that's no improvement over rebooting.
2011-07-30T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	merely to aid in troubleshooting...
2011-07-30T17:39:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	ok....
2011-07-30T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	check ~/.xsession-errors, /var/log/Xorg.0.log, dmesg
2011-07-30T17:50:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	dmesg showed up lots of wireless events, but nothing display related. .xsession-errors shows a few events of Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_nvidia.so (but there isn't a piece of nvidia hardware in this laptop).. X.org.log.old (the one I was writing to when the problem occurred shows only one EE line, relating to the wireless mouse receiver during startup, but nothing more.
2011-07-30T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	are you using unity?
2011-07-30T17:51:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	no
2011-07-30T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	what are you using?
2011-07-30T17:52:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	"Classic" mode
2011-07-30T17:53:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	this laptop has been running natty for a while, with classic all the time (apart from a couple of periods of experimentation)... this freezing issue only started occuring quite recently
2011-07-30T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	any recent upgrades?
2011-07-30T17:54:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	hardware, no. Software, when it prompts me. I installed a couple of softwre packages (a game that I haven't played since last weekend)
2011-07-30T17:55:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	I'm just having a read of dpkg.log
2011-07-30T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	and the freezes seem to happen randomly?  No common action you can think of?
2011-07-30T17:58:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	they don't happen when I'm using it, it's a "when I come back to it" event
2011-07-30T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Debugging might have some hints.  My suggestion would be to try a different window manager to rule that out (I don't think it matters).  With classic, are effects still enabled?  Try disabling those to see if it still happens.  Given your last statement, is it screensaver related?
2011-07-30T18:00:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	no screensaver, only dpms.
2011-07-30T18:05:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	I'll just have to wait until it happens again to get some more info :S
2011-07-30T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	StevenR	make sure you check bugs.ubuntu.com too to see if others are experiencing it
2011-07-30T18:06:00.000Z	StevenR	jrib	I've not turned anything up yet
