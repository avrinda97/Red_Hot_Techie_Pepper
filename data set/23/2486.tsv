2009-03-28T20:00:00.000Z	unko		hey guys... i got a 250gb hdd... what should i format it too? whats the best format for using it constanly like media wise?
2009-03-28T20:01:00.000Z	undecim	unko	That depends... are you going to be using it on other operating systems (such as windows) or just linux machines?
2009-03-28T20:01:00.000Z	unko	undecim	just linux machines
2009-03-28T20:02:00.000Z	undecim	unko	well then ext3 would be a good choice... although, I personally perfer reiserfs, but you may need to install the drivers for that
2009-03-28T20:03:00.000Z	unko	undecim	whats the difference?
2009-03-28T20:03:00.000Z	undecim	unko	I prefer reiserfs mostly because it doesn't require that periodic filesystem check on boot
2009-03-28T20:03:00.000Z	unko	undecim	ohhh
2009-03-28T20:03:00.000Z	undecim	unko	also, some benchmarks say that its faster
2009-03-28T20:04:00.000Z	unko	undecim	ok well ill format it that... and why do i need drivers?
2009-03-28T20:04:00.000Z	undecim	unko	Because it may or may not be installed by default.. On my machine (Linux mint) its already installed, but i don't know if it is by default on ubuntu
2009-03-28T20:05:00.000Z	undecim	unko	to install it just type in a terminal: sudo apt-get install reiserfsprogs
2009-03-28T20:05:00.000Z	unko	undecim	i already have it i think in the partition editor it says i can format it to that
2009-03-28T20:06:00.000Z	undecim	unko	okay, then you should be good to go
2009-03-28T20:06:00.000Z	unko	undecim	nice thanks
2009-03-28T20:08:00.000Z	unko	undecim	do you know how to make a trash can on a ntfs partition? cuz it says i can only perm delete when i hit delete
2009-03-28T20:08:00.000Z	undecim	unko	Not off the top of my head...
2009-03-28T20:08:00.000Z	unko	undecim	ok
2009-03-28T20:08:00.000Z	undecim	unko	other patitions use a .Trash-[uid] folder
2009-03-28T20:09:00.000Z	unko	undecim	whats the [uid] ? i might be able to make one
2009-03-28T20:09:00.000Z	undecim	unko	its your user id # (usually 1000 for the first user on the system)
2009-03-28T20:10:00.000Z	unko	undecim	and will that work if i put it there?
2009-03-28T20:10:00.000Z	undecim	unko	but simply having that folder won't make it use it as a trash folder
2009-03-28T20:11:00.000Z	unko	undecim	ohh
