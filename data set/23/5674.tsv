2006-10-11T14:16:00.000Z	avagant		Huh.
2006-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	avagant		How'd you lose your source list?
2006-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	avagant		Did you mess around with it at all? I'm just asking.
2006-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	avagant		Anybody know the correct way to burn an iso of ubuntu or that? Is it suppose to be a raw image, or what?
2006-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	avagant		No but I mean when I'm burning an image with a cdburner, is it suppose to be raw?
2006-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	avagant		Cause there's different options for that.
2006-10-11T14:19:00.000Z	avagant		I've been burning them "raw" which apparently causes them to not work well after the first install?
2006-10-11T14:19:00.000Z	avagant		No no no, I know the cd burners, but when it asks me what form to burn the iso in, do i burn it as raw or tao or whatever?
2006-10-11T14:20:00.000Z	avagant		Hmm.
2006-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	avagant		The cd's stop working right after the 1st install.
2006-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	there is also dao, but you probably don't need to know about that
2006-10-11T14:22:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	that's really odd
2006-10-11T14:22:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	it doesn't make sense at all, there is a foreign agent at work here...
2006-10-11T14:25:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	in the future though, definitely burn using tao
2006-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	ah, that has everything to do with the sound server you choose.
2006-10-11T14:27:00.000Z	avagant	capitalidea	If I run xmms and firefox with youtube it gets all insano and doesn't let me do much.
2006-10-11T14:27:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	the most popular one is alsa, and everyone who uses alsa just installs oss compatibility so that oss pipes to alsa too. it also has to do with sharing alsa amongst apps and that's easy too
2006-10-11T14:28:00.000Z	avagant	capitalidea	maybe a walk through?
2006-10-11T14:29:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	no idea, but I'm sure it's mentioned on the forum. Dapper Drake is treating me well, I haven't noticed this problem. I use Gentoo on another box though and I remember having to set up my alsa configuration for this. It's trivial to pull off.
2006-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	search with terms like "alsa sharing"
2006-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	not an Athlon XP 2000 :-)
2006-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	capitalidea	avagant	If it weren't for some trouble with some libs on Gentoo's AMD64 and the fact that Ubuntu 'just works' I'd probably using Gentoo on this laptop. CBA setting up all the laptop hardware though.
