2008-12-27T13:46:00.000Z	mindrape		but as an FYI I dont think that 2nd line is going to execute unless you throw a ./ infront of ioUrbanTeorr.i386
2008-12-27T13:46:00.000Z	mindrape		/home/maveric/Desktop/UrbanTerror/./ioUrbanTeorr.i386
2008-12-27T13:47:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	that's definitely not going to change anything :)
2008-12-27T13:47:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	what wont?
2008-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	the ./
2008-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- ...?  Pull up a terminal... edit a file and save it as blarp.sh...          ./blarp.sh
2008-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	no
2008-12-27T13:49:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	./foo means specifying a path
2008-12-27T13:49:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	no, you told him to add a stupid extra ./ in the middle of a path which won't change anything
2008-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- yes it will... its saying in that path to execute that script
2008-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	please take linux lessons. The stupidity is radiating from you :)
2008-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- well it apparently worked for him... :)
2008-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- read up on executing scripts... it worked for him.  Apparently my "stupidity" helps people. :)
2008-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	ok, here's a quick lesson in how bash executes things:
2008-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- when you get done rambling feel free to explain why my solution worked for him... yawn.
2008-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	now shut up until you know what you're doing. This time your 'help' was innocent, next time it might inadvertantly break someone's machine
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- I've been a Linux admin for 10 yrs.  :)
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	rofl. Nobody in here believes that now :)
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	it did not, he probably did something else as well or something completely different was acting odd temporarily
2008-12-27T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	<maveric> Either way, the script is now loading my game. I miss spelled terror at the end of it >.<
2008-12-27T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	so once again I urge to stop 'helping' if you don't know what you're doing. Next mistake can break someones machine
2008-12-27T13:58:00.000Z	mindrape	Seveas	- I help hundreds of people a day in here... no broken machines yet but I'll keep you posted.
2008-12-27T14:03:00.000Z	Seveas	mindrape	once again you're talking nonsense. Stop it.
