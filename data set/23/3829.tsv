2012-10-04T06:36:00.000Z	morbo3000		cong: dammit. i was so excited that that might have fixed it.
2012-10-04T06:37:00.000Z	morbo3000		just the same in both firefox and chromium.
2012-10-04T06:38:00.000Z	morbo3000		yourdaddy: downgraded to make flash work? or are you talking about something else.
2012-10-04T06:39:00.000Z	morbo3000		cong: i did reinstall flash player. i just went in to chromium's about:plugins, and sure enough, there are two of them again. one in flashplugin-installer and the other one regular.
2012-10-04T06:39:00.000Z	morbo3000		maybe if i delete just the one.
2012-10-04T06:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	can you give a pastebin of the output of: lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
2012-10-04T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	what is the output of: lsb_release -sc
2012-10-04T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	and the output of: uname -m
2012-10-04T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	try:  sudo apt-get --purge remove flashpluin-installer
2012-10-04T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	morbo3000 enable the partner repo and install the adobe-flashplugin
2012-10-04T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	in software centre enable the partner repo
2012-10-04T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	sweet, close all web browsers then rerun it, should be ok
2012-10-04T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	the web browser, to then use flash
2012-10-04T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	if you run:  gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list     you can uncomment the lines with 'partner' on that start with the word 'deb'
2012-10-04T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	then save the new file, close gedit and run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin
2012-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	chrome does flash internally, not chromium
2012-10-04T07:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	uninstall all flash packages and install chrome from the google website, you will then have flash
2012-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	you need to download it separate
2012-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/?platform=linux&hl=en
2012-10-04T08:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	not heard of a package called gtk+ control, is that the actual name?
2012-10-04T08:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	thats fine
2012-10-04T08:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morbo3000	if it wants to remove them, those packages are not critical
