2010-12-29T00:44:00.000Z	stealthc		I have a dual core laptop with 4 gb's of ram
2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	stealthc		that seems to be adequate for a vbox setup
2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	stealthc		runs a little slow on my dual core netbook with 2gb's
2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	stealthc		the space in ram seems a little too tight
2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	stealthc		I wouldn't say less work
2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	stealthc		but at least you aren't fucking with your hard drive
2010-12-29T00:46:00.000Z	stealthc		I like how it uses files as virtual drives
2010-12-29T00:46:00.000Z	stealthc		if you are using linux
2010-12-29T00:46:00.000Z	stealthc		then you aren't worried about user friendly entirely all the time
2010-12-29T00:46:00.000Z	stealthc		it's been getting friendlier, but still has a ways to go in my books
2010-12-29T00:47:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	vbox is fine. . but if you're going to regularly use the OS, i'd rather have a traditional dual boot setup... I keep Xp in Vbox for one or two things I need, and probably boot it 2-4x a month
2010-12-29T00:48:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	thats why i use windows in vbox... but if i regularly used Windows for something, i wouldn't use vbox, i'd dual boot.
2010-12-29T00:48:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	a usb hard drive should work under either OS w/o issue.
2010-12-29T00:49:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	thats just a matter of setting up a network device under ubuntu.
2010-12-29T00:50:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	is it plugged into your router?
2010-12-29T00:50:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	you keep repeating yourself w/o answering the question.. is the hard drive, connected to the router.
2010-12-29T00:51:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	then it should just be a matter of going to "Places" and "Network places".. and going through the icons there till you find your device...
2010-12-29T00:52:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	dunno, but i'm sure it can be done, im not making much sense out of what you're sayin g.
2010-12-29T00:55:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	just go to places/network.. there can't be more than 2 or 3 group names there... tr them all
2010-12-29T01:20:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	it's probably gonna be along the lines of "we dont' support linux".... if you're the type to call tech support, linux is not for you
2010-12-29T01:20:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	can you ping your virtual install?
2010-12-29T01:21:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	they wont, all she's gonna tell you is their device doesn't support linux(because they dont support it)
2010-12-29T01:28:00.000Z	KM0201	stealthc	i wouldn't get your hopes off
