2007-06-14T11:05:00.000Z	TheCougar		any one get ubuntu to run in virtual PC?
2007-06-14T11:06:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	Yes, I have at work
2007-06-14T11:06:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	did you have any issues getting it started? whenever i boot up the screen goes nuts in the VPC
2007-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	No issues. But if I recall correctly I am running a somewhat old version of Virtual PC
2007-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	ah i'm running the newest one which might be the issue
2007-06-14T11:09:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	Well supposedly the latest one should have official support for Linux guests. Not sure which distros are officially supported though. I guess RedHat and maybe Suse
2007-06-14T11:10:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	 Is this problem while you are booting the LiveCD? Did you try the "safe" option?
2007-06-14T11:10:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	i'm going to try again right now so i will tell you :)
2007-06-14T11:19:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	ah it booted this time but i can't control it. the mouse won't intergrate into it when i click on it
2007-06-14T11:20:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	Try Alt-F1 for the Menu launcher and Alt-F2 for "run". You can then type "gnome-terminal" to get a terminal
2007-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	got me right to a prompt. but the bigger issue now is i don't know how to do anything with commands;)
2007-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	in Virtual PC (the same as in VMWare) if you click inside the host window it should "grab" the focus and the mouse should start moving only inside the host. You have to press right Control key to release the control. The keys might be different. See in Settings
2007-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	trying to do the install with the keyboard and see if the installed copy will use the mouse
2007-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	yeah i use vpc for a lot of things. its not grabbing the host mouse
2007-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	Most likely you are going to have the same problems as in the LiveCD
2007-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	Not grabbing the mouse is pretty odd
2007-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	yeah i agree:-/ and it is extremely slow. i think thats why i thought the display wasn't working before. the live cd took at least 2 minutes to boot even though it was an iso
2007-06-14T11:28:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	ha even stranger, scroll lock gets turned on every time i click on the virtaul PC to try to lock the mouse
2007-06-14T11:28:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	There should be a way to install the equivalent of "VMWare tools" inside the Ubuntu guest and the mouse should work properly then. Don't remember what it was called in Virtual PC. I use mostly VMWare Server and only have a few "inherited" virtual machines inside Virtual PC. For me the big advantage of VMWare over Virtual PC is the support for USB devices.
2007-06-14T11:33:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	the fact that vpc doesn't have usb support is a huge disapointment for me. but it has installed on my systems easier then vmware has in the past
2007-06-14T11:33:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	and yeah the virtaul machine additions can't be installed on a *nix os. microsoft hates all things different:)
2007-06-14T11:35:00.000Z	ih70	TheCougar	MS is now in very tight competition with VMWare in that market. I remember reading a press release that they do support Linux as guest
2007-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	TheCougar	ih70	yeah i've been able to install various *nix OSes on it in the past. with mixed results
