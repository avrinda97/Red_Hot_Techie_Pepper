2011-01-06T20:23:00.000Z	ra2011		guys, I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 with nvidia 96.43.19 driver and I can't get compiz to work. any tips?
2011-01-06T20:24:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	did you use system > admin > additional drivers?
2011-01-06T20:27:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	nvidia 96.43.129 driver
2011-01-06T20:28:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	what do you mean you can't get compiz to work?
2011-01-06T20:29:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	all the special visual effects doesn't work... such as desktop cube
2011-01-06T20:29:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	well you have to enable that
2011-01-06T20:30:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	you need compizconfig-settings-manager to do that.  If you enalbe the extra effects under system > preferences > appeareance. You will only get wobbly windows.
2011-01-06T20:30:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	I already did this in the compiz config
2011-01-06T20:30:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	are wobbly windows working?
2011-01-06T20:31:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	or any of the compiz effects?
2011-01-06T20:31:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	this is the point... when I try to enable extra effects the system tries to probe my card and then says that it cannot find anything...
2011-01-06T20:32:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	does glxinfo | grep render   show direct rendering: yes?
2011-01-06T20:32:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	yep
2011-01-06T20:33:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	that's odd. what type of nvidia card do you have?
2011-01-06T20:33:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	this one: GeForce4 MX 440 with AGP8X/AGP/SSE/3DNOW!
2011-01-06T20:34:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	let me look something up
2011-01-06T20:34:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	ok
2011-01-06T20:35:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	idd you download the driver from nvidia?
2011-01-06T20:36:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	Yes, I got it there
2011-01-06T20:36:00.000Z	histo	ra2011	i'm not sure why it's not working. I'd try asking in the #compiz rooms. Or searching for a bug. It is an older card.
2011-01-06T20:39:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	thanks a lot... It's and older card... I got this one http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-96.43.19-driver.html
2011-01-06T21:17:00.000Z	ra2011	histo	do you have any news?
