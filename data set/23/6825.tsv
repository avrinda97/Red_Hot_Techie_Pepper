2006-09-05T06:38:00.000Z	hondje		drop from what?
2006-09-05T06:39:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	drop from instant
2006-09-05T06:39:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	I recently did a fresh install, restoring my /home directory
2006-09-05T06:40:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	I bet cafuego is right, if that's the only thing going weird instead of just an example
2006-09-05T06:41:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	well, it doesn't stop with the screensavers. I'm noticing a highter than usual system load (normally at 0%, now it idles around 20%) Swap file usage, even through I have a gig of ram. Slow response from the keyboard and programs
2006-09-05T06:42:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Ah, interesting indeed :) I assume you've run top to see what's going on?
2006-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	the system monitor, and I don't see anything that out of the ordinary. The highest cpu usage on it is the actual system monitor
2006-09-05T06:44:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	it is strange, and annoying. I can't figure out what is causing this for the life of me. It's getting to the point where the machine is annoying to use because I know it works faster than this
2006-09-05T06:44:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Hmmm, could your CPU be throttled back and not turning back on when it has a load?
2006-09-05T06:45:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	I have that monitored as well, It does throttle, but it always ramps up when needed.
2006-09-05T06:45:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	I notice a lot of harddisk access whenever it gets slow
2006-09-05T06:46:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	which concerns me, because my system never used the swap file before, and now it constantly uses 3% of a gig
2006-09-05T06:47:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Here's a fun thought....try /sbin/swapoff and see what happens?
2006-09-05T06:49:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	no xgl, I'm not brave enough for that yet. I also stopped using gdesklets since this last install
2006-09-05T06:50:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	If you're familiar with sysctl I would look around there for anything fishy
2006-09-05T06:51:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Performance is such a tricky thing :( I'd still look at the graphic card first :-/
2006-09-05T06:51:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	would there be anything from my old /home directory that might cause this?
2006-09-05T06:51:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Not that I can think of. $HOME is pretty isolated from important things
2006-09-05T06:52:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	so create another user and login? and see if the performance is still cripled?
2006-09-05T06:53:00.000Z	hondje	Linuturk	Oh, not a bad idea at all :D
2006-09-05T15:33:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	hey, lets see if we can figure out the bottleneck in my system
2006-09-05T15:33:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	I'm still seeing low performance
2006-09-05T15:33:00.000Z	Linuturk	hondje	and I'm currently on my problem system
