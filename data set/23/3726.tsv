2008-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	joecurlee		hi, i'm running ubuntu 7.10. i have an external firewire hd and when I plug it in it isn't recognized by the system at all... it does power up, but does not auto mount
2008-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	joecurlee		the system may be recognizing it, but i'm not sure how to check for this sort of thing... have been doing research but nothing is helping out too much
2008-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	usser	joecurlee	see if anything new appears in /dev
2008-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	usser	joecurlee	unplug it and do ls /dev/*d*
2008-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	usser	joecurlee	then plug it back in and do ls /dev/*d* again

2008-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	joecurlee	usser	(had to answer phone)... so i'm assuming i'll have to do this every time I want to use it?
