2010-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	|NX|		I'm trying to login as root
2010-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	|NX|		every time
2010-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	|NX|		all the time
2010-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	|NX|		can you just tell me how to do it
2010-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	|NX|		instead of telling me why I shouldn't?
2010-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	|NX|		I don't know what a standart is
2010-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	|NX|		because, you know
2010-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	|NX|		I used windows from 3.1 all the way to XP
2010-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	|NX|		and never had issues with root permissions ;P
2010-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	|NX|		I don't see why I can't operate as root if I want to
2010-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	you can operate as root
2010-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	|NX|	histo	I don't want sudo
2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	then create a root password and use the root account
2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	|NX|	histo	thats what I'm asking about :P
2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	although there is a reason for sudo if you'd like to learn why sudo is used.
2010-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	well then all you have to do is set a root password then you can login as root
2010-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	yeap
2010-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	|NX|	histo	and it will let me login as root once I set the password?
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	sudo passwd root    in a terminal
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	if you just want to temporarily be root you can just sudo -i
2010-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	then use the above mentioned command and set a password for root.
2010-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	histo	|NX|	currently the account is locked because one is not set.  If you ever want to disable it then you would sudo passwd -l root
