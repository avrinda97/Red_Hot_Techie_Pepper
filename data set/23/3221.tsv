2009-12-20T12:27:00.000Z	error404notfound		what other package management alternated based on source code like pkgsrc are available for ubuntu?
2009-12-20T12:28:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	Most distributions are very tightly bound to their package management system. You can't just substitute nother one in.
2009-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	There are Debian source packages.
2009-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	Which is what you get when you run 'apt-get source SOMEPACKAGE'
2009-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	yes, but what if i want ubuntu, but with source code compilation like srpms on fedora?
2009-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	ahan... lemme see...
2009-12-20T13:36:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	The equivalent is the 'debian' directory inside the unpacked source package.
2009-12-20T13:37:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide
2009-12-20T13:37:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	yes, but that inseparable from the code, right?
2009-12-20T13:37:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	lemme check, thanks :)
2009-12-20T13:38:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	What do you mean?
2009-12-20T13:40:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	in red hat, you have two files package.srpm and package.spec, you can edit package.spec to your customization needs and take it anywhere, you don't need the srpm file, but in ubuntu's case, isn't deb pretty much integrated to the tar.gz file?
2009-12-20T13:42:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	No. The debian directory lives in the diff.gz.
2009-12-20T13:42:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	Separate from the tarball.
2009-12-20T13:43:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	ahan, and i just need to take diff.tz file with me if i want to recompile the package somewhere else, right?
2009-12-20T13:44:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	You should take the dsc, diff.gz and orig.tar.gz.
2009-12-20T13:45:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	hmmm, what if i mix diff.gz with another version's tar.gz and orig.tar.gz?
2009-12-20T13:45:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete has a section on upgrading to a newer version.
2009-12-20T14:25:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	lstarnes, i can't find the "debian/" in the extraction of diff.gz or even the orig.tar.gz
2009-12-20T14:26:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	It's in the diff.gz. How did you unpack the source?
2009-12-20T14:27:00.000Z	error404notfound	wgrant	gunzip for diff.gz, it show only one file with .diff and it opens in text editor
2009-12-20T14:27:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	It's a diff.
2009-12-20T14:27:00.000Z	wgrant	error404notfound	You could unpack the source using dpkg-source, but you should first realise that you don't want to do what you are trying.
