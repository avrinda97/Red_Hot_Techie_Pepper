2008-03-30T01:40:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	okay.
2008-03-30T01:42:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	How did you try to install it?
2008-03-30T01:43:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Any errors in particular?
2008-03-30T01:45:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Can you paste the output of /var/log/s3setup.log and /var/log/s3build.log ?
2008-03-30T01:46:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Well that's odd, as it says to refer to both of those at the end of the log...
2008-03-30T01:47:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Are you running the install with X server shut down?
2008-03-30T01:47:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	This might help: http://drivers.s3graphics.com/en/download/drivers/chrome_PCIe-Linux/Readme
2008-03-30T01:49:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	In the console: sudo /etc/init.d/Xdm stop
2008-03-30T01:49:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	That will kill all graphical applications though, including your IRC client if you are using a graphical one...
2008-03-30T01:51:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Okay, but to get to a console after killing X type: CTRL+ALT+F1
2008-03-30T01:52:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2008-03-30T01:53:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	or kdm stop, depending on which one you are using.
2008-03-30T01:54:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	As HardyOne pointed out, you can type sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop
2008-03-30T01:55:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	hello.
2008-03-30T01:56:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	It should kill X...
2008-03-30T02:02:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Yes.
2008-03-30T02:04:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	If you had a working configuration, it's possible that that is the best it's going to get. Changing the drivers will not significantly affect performance unless the drivers are notably poor.
2008-03-30T02:04:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Perhaps what you really want is a better graphics card?
2008-03-30T02:06:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	Well do you have the driver properly installed?
2008-03-30T02:07:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	If the included driver has 3D acceleration, then maybe you just don't have it configured properly.
2008-03-30T02:08:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	The vesa driver is probably not the driver you are supposed to be using with your graphics card. Other people have said there is a driver for your card included in Ubuntu... Did you look into that?
2008-03-30T02:10:00.000Z	ankit_	thegotogeek	I think that route is probably a better bet than recompiling the drivers yourself... Maybe you should try fixing that instead of compiling drivers?
