2010-06-15T19:28:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	on what site?
2010-06-15T19:29:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	there's no specific site..
2010-06-15T19:29:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	as long as the site is accessing flash
2010-06-15T19:29:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	it just crashed on any flash site? can you view video in youtube?
2010-06-15T19:30:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	yes. the side effect is on the user's perspective, it is very slow then it will eat a lot of cpu load
2010-06-15T19:31:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	which method you're using to install flash?
2010-06-15T19:31:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	everything package installed on my system were installed using apt-get
2010-06-15T19:32:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer?
2010-06-15T19:32:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	yes, including flashplugin-nonfree
2010-06-15T19:32:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	driver problem maybe?
2010-06-15T19:33:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	i don't think it's a driver problem
2010-06-15T19:35:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	hmm, I'm here on linux mint 9 (10.04 derivative) with mint-flashplugin-installer-x64, which is flash 10.0.42.2...
2010-06-15T19:35:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	what i have is 10.1.53.64ubuntu0.10.04.1
2010-06-15T19:35:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	the ubuntu version is 10.1.53
2010-06-15T19:36:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	maybe the new version is problematic?
2010-06-15T19:36:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	which is even newer
2010-06-15T19:36:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	10.1.53 newer than 10.0.45
2010-06-15T19:37:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	maybe.. but i need proof.. but, you're not encountering any problem on your flash, right? you will normally found it out when you execute "dmesg"
2010-06-15T19:37:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	smooth sailing here with 10.0
2010-06-15T19:38:00.000Z	furuno	bintut	isn't 10.1 use GPU to unload some of the workload from CPU
2010-06-15T19:39:00.000Z	bintut	furuno	i don't know.. actually, i'm a 3 days old ubuntu user and i finally decided to use it in an office network as ltsp x terminal server
