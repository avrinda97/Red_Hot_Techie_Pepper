2006-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	doofy		how do i install wine on dapper drake?
2006-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	sudo apt-get install wine
2006-04-20T11:43:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	do I need to have a certain repository?
2006-04-20T11:43:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	if you're already running dapper, then the repositories will be set to dapper's, and wine is in dapper's repo
2006-04-20T11:43:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	so basically, no
2006-04-20T11:43:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	Its not finding it in there
2006-04-20T11:44:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	Package wine is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-04-20T11:44:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	just open Synaptic and add Universe
2006-04-20T11:45:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	I already have universe, but I don't think it's in there. I'll try the wine repository
2006-04-20T11:45:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	it is in fact in universe.
2006-04-20T11:46:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	thats interesting. I'm not able to get it even with universe enabled
2006-04-20T11:46:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	you can try wine's own repository, but don't blame me if something breaks
2006-04-20T11:47:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	I'm not seeing it even when adding wine's repository
2006-04-20T11:48:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	you're remembering to run sudo apt-get update right?
2006-04-20T11:48:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	yes
2006-04-20T11:58:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	multiverse is a wider array of packages that contain either non-free software or other software not supported by ubuntu, but available from its official repositories
2006-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	would you reccomend using it?
2006-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	for example, java JRE is in multiverse
2006-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	eobanb	doofy	sure, if it has something that you need in it.
2006-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	okay that makes sense
2006-04-20T12:02:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	does apt look for a specific package to meet your architecture? For example if it does, can i make it use the 32 bit (assuming that tehre is no 64 bit and thats why i can not find it)
2006-04-20T12:06:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	I just downloaded the i386 .deb from the wine repositories and im going to try and force-architecture the install
2006-04-20T12:06:00.000Z	doofy	eobanb	it seemed to have worked fine
