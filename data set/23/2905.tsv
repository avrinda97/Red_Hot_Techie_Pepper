2011-06-29T12:55:00.000Z	cantor		anyone able to answer a tor question?
2011-06-29T12:56:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	good nick. i can try.
2011-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	1s..
2011-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	ls..??
2011-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	1s = one sec
2011-06-29T12:59:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	the answer is yes. first question: have you tried?
2011-06-29T13:00:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	yeah, I have tor and polipo installed at the moment, they both start.  I looked in the /etc/torrc and it looks like there is a config I set to do it, but nothing I have tried works.
2011-06-29T13:01:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	you'll want to configure tor on your one machine to accept connections incoming from other addresses on your LAN. to do this, you'll want to bind to your LAN address. does your tor server system have a static LAN IP?
2011-06-29T13:02:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	technically Im using dhcp, but i have tomato on my router and it fixes the local IP so that it does not change
2011-06-29T13:03:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	ok, easy solution then: set the SocksListenAddress to your LAN IP
2011-06-29T13:03:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	then /etc/init.d/tor restart
2011-06-29T13:03:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	yes, in the torrc of your tor proxy server
2011-06-29T13:04:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	then nmap -PN -sT -p 9050 lan.ip.addr.here
2011-06-29T13:06:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	should I comment out SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 and put SocksListenAddress lan.ip.addr?
2011-06-29T13:06:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	if you wish
2011-06-29T13:14:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	nmap says 9050/tcp open  tor-socks
2011-06-29T13:14:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	you seem golden then :)
2011-06-29T13:15:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	for a real test, open firefox network preferences on another system, and set ip.ad.dr.res:9050 as your HTTP proxy. go to any URL and you should get a page telling you that TOR is not an HTTP proxy
2011-06-29T13:15:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	so, I should be change firefox proxy on the laptop to proxy through tor?
2011-06-29T13:16:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	well, there's a little more effort possibly... i do not trust software to ensure my privacy without thoroughly checking it out. in my exploration of tor, i still have yet to see how DNS name lookups happen on Firefox when using TOR configured as a SOCKS proxy.
2011-06-29T13:17:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	so, cantor, i think your connections will all be encrypted over tor, but i think DNS requests will NOT be routed through TOR using the technique i described. is that a problem?
2011-06-29T13:20:00.000Z	hdon	cantor	if your ISP sends you fraudulent DNS responses, TOR will not protect you
2011-06-29T13:20:00.000Z	cantor	hdon	I agree
