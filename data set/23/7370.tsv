2005-08-28T12:13:00.000Z	dalamar		just installed gcc4, its not in my path, what gives?
2005-08-28T12:15:00.000Z	dalamar		gcc-4.0
2005-08-28T12:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	try 'dpkg -L gcc4' (or whatever the package is called)
2005-08-28T12:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	try 'make CC=gcc-4.0' ? (i think that's one way)
2005-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	I'll give it a try
2005-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	that worked, can I just add another link from gcc-4.0 to gcc to prevent from having to do the CC=gcc=4.0 bit?
2005-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	i'm not sure; i don't see why not
2005-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	k thanks much
2005-08-28T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	you might want to try out the bchunk package for bin files
2005-08-28T12:55:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	ive tried and still get errors about 'file too large' when trying to convert a dvd image?
2005-08-28T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	sorry, i don't know any more
2005-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	dpkg -L <package-name>
2005-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	there's a way to look inside .deb files too -- see 'man dpkg-deb' for that
2005-09-09T08:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	does 'glxinfo |grep direct' give 'Yes' ?
2005-09-09T08:13:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	checking one sec
2005-09-09T08:14:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	it says 'yes'?
2005-09-09T08:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	hmm. sounds like you have opengl rendering to me
2005-09-09T08:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	i get 845 fps from glxgears (but i guess above a certain point that becomes meaningless?)
2005-09-09T08:16:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	yeah, it says 'okay' on the cedega install anout open gl rendering, yet 'failed' on 3d acceleration? .. it is only a 32 meg card also
2005-09-09T08:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	hmm. sorry, i'm not sure. never used cedega
2005-09-09T08:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	tried #cedega ?
2005-09-09T08:18:00.000Z	dalamar	HappyFool	trying there as we speak, though its not very active ;/
2005-09-15T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	dalamar	i think it might already be out (?)
