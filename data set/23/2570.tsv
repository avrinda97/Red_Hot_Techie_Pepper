2009-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	gartral		anyone know why the ubuntu system monitor takes between 45 and 60% of my proc at all times that its running?
2009-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	Because it is programmed so that it takes so many ressources. It updates graphics too often.
2009-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	ahh, is that why the names all go blank when i scroll?
2009-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	I believe so, yes.
2009-03-21T10:33:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	ok, so how do i replace the tray's system "widget's" double click function to use gtop or such?

2009-03-21T11:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	I don't know. Sorry.
2009-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	depends on what sound system/server your running
2009-07-29T16:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	 The Integrated circuit  'Realtek ALC202' is described as an "AC'97 compatible audio codec having several stereo and mono inputs and outputs." Why does my laptop computer need an additional IC 'ALI 5451' (an ALSA mixer)?
2009-07-29T16:26:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	ahh, im not sure, but my cs46xx in my desktop is the same way, i think its partialy the way ALSA handels direct sound output vs buffered or piped output
2009-07-29T16:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	Thank you for your comment.
2010-06-18T10:15:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	where did Valkyrie post multiple lines?
2010-06-18T10:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	You can find that out most easily yourself.
2010-06-18T10:20:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	what the hell are you talking about?!?!?
2010-06-18T10:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	You put me a question, and I answered to it.
2010-06-18T10:22:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	i was defending Valkyrie, you told him not to use enter as a punctuation, which when i lastlog Valkyrie i dont see multiple lines of one long sentance, so i questioned your interpritationn wondering where exactly Valkyrie had used enter as a punct. mark
2010-06-18T10:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	It is trivial to scroll back in your IRC client's log to find out. I wil do it just once for you: "[07:11] <Valkyrie> Esat, Flash suchs =P; [07:11] <Valkyrie> Sucks; [07:11] <Valkyrie> Lemme correct this.; [07:11] <Valkyrie> Flash sucks ; SPECIALLY with Firefox."
2010-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	it's important to learn about /lastlog try this in your irc client /lastlog gartral
2011-05-01T07:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	That is a bad idea.
2011-05-01T07:40:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	why?
2011-05-01T07:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	Because KDE is a complicated program consisting of many components.
2011-05-01T07:46:00.000Z	gartral	bullgard4	ok, as long as I can switch back.. and it doesn't auto-replace gdm
2011-05-01T07:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	gartral	Instaling KDE will not automatically auto-replace gdm. But having installed KDE you cannot simply "switch" back to having no KDE. Because Ubuntu has made too many metapackages. This would mean rather much effort by hand.
