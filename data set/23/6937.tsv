2005-12-10T15:00:00.000Z	navarone		mbruemer> i left ubuntu approx 12 gb after setting up new hard drive and leaving freespace
2005-12-10T15:01:00.000Z	navarone		mbruemer>depends on if you are doing server install and do not plan on using a gui or desktop environment
2005-12-10T15:03:00.000Z	navarone		I think the larger numbers are for if you are going to be saving large files as well...I mean amany people use ubuntu and plain linux as entertainment jukeboxes...
2005-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	navarone		mbruemer> I have 256 w/Athlon 1.2ghz...and I'm thinking of getting more memory...however if you opt for xfce as desktop you would be ebtter off with lower ram
2005-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	I don't think you mean what you just said. Even with xfce, more memory is better.
2005-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	that's what I thought you meant... I concur with that.
2005-12-10T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	yes, it's called dyspraxia.
2006-02-26T07:29:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	you have a tractor?
2006-02-26T07:30:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	sold it. Was very nice, though, 800cc single cylinder, 16 hp... #ubuntu-offtopic?
2006-02-26T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	I bought it because of the label... Porsche.
2006-02-26T07:31:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	was it a Deerie?
2006-02-26T07:32:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	Porsche!
2006-02-26T07:32:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	yeah they started making farm equipment
2006-02-26T07:33:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	they had a factory by Lake Constance where they built these smart little machines.
2006-02-26T07:33:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	was it fullgrown or one of those lawntractor wannabes?
2006-02-26T07:34:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	it weighed 800kg, so I guess that's the first category up from a lawn tractor :)
2006-02-26T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	I enjoyed the read anyway ;)
2006-02-26T07:48:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	don't applaud...throw money...<s>
2006-03-08T17:18:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	you mean reinstall?
2006-03-08T17:18:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	no, first line is reboot ;)
2006-03-11T07:24:00.000Z	soundray	navarone	LSD abuse maybe. It was discovered at Hoffman Laroche.
2006-03-11T07:24:00.000Z	navarone	soundray	ahh...was a little tidbit I saw on Space TV today...you can't believe everything you see on tv I guess...lol
