2005-12-08T10:13:00.000Z	Tedd		Hmm
2005-12-08T10:13:00.000Z	Tedd		I think I found my problem
2005-12-08T10:13:00.000Z	Tedd		I need libusb 0.1.8
2005-12-08T10:13:00.000Z	Tedd		I only have 0.1.4 (it's theonly one on synaptic)
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	Tedd		OK
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	Tedd		I downloaded 1.0.11
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	Tedd		How do I install it
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	Tedd		Where do I put this thing
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	Tedd		Can anybody tell me how to install it
2005-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	What are you trying to install?
2005-12-08T10:16:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	libUSB, eh? Just run it through SYnaptics, that's a recent enough version I should think.
2005-12-08T10:16:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	Ah crap. >_< Hrm, try the Universe?
2005-12-08T10:17:00.000Z	Tedd	AesopFable	how would I do that
2005-12-08T10:17:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	Just a minute.
2005-12-08T10:18:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	Hmm, the most recent version is 1.10 0.o
2005-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	Tedd	AesopFable	Yessum.
2005-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	Grab it here: http://libusb.sourceforge.net/download.html#stable
2005-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	Tedd	AesopFable	I already have it- I just need to know where to put the folder.
2005-12-08T10:20:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	I can't get my Linux box up right now, so I can't check the tarball... But look for an INSTALL or a README file...
2005-12-08T10:20:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	The way Ubuntu does libs has always seemed odd to me, so I can't think of it off the top of my head.
2005-12-08T10:22:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	If your in the CLI, the best way to read those files is probably the 'more' command.
2005-12-08T10:25:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	Are you still there?
2005-12-08T10:25:00.000Z	AesopFable	Tedd	From what I can find, it seems that al youd need to do is just the /configure and a make, and it'll shove it where it needs to be.
