2008-03-03T19:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	its kinda like taking a healthy crap, after you're done and flushed, there's still a bad odor
2008-03-03T19:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	if you don't have a lot invested in your ubuntu install, its probably easiest to just re-install.
2008-03-03T19:39:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	thats too much trouble to go through cause i've installed ubuntu like 15 times
2008-03-03T19:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	then you should be good at it
2008-03-03T19:40:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	:s
2008-03-03T19:42:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	hey, but if i install the proprietary driver of my card will 3d be enabled?
2008-03-03T19:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	i would think so, but i'm not 100% sure, what card again?
2008-03-03T19:43:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	nvidia geforce4
2008-03-03T19:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	but after the reinstall, the prop driver, i would imagine, it would work fine
2008-03-03T19:44:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	but why is envy so bad cause the guys at #wine told me to use envy
2008-03-03T19:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	well, the guys at wine aren't very bright apparentl
2008-03-03T19:45:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	Jack_Sparrow: yeah i guess so
2008-03-03T19:47:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	yeah but then WoW would crash just before it opens giving me a fatal error, but after i installed the driver from envy it didnt give me the same error
2008-03-03T19:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	and what led you to believe this was a driver error, and not a Wine error?
2008-03-03T19:48:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	:S i dunno
2008-03-03T19:49:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	so if i install the driver from the repo it shopuld work after the clean install?
2008-03-03T19:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	again, one would think so.. what model geforce card is it
2008-03-03T19:49:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	geforce 4 mx something
2008-03-03T19:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	in a terminal, "lspci" no quotes, and see how it identifies your video card
2008-03-03T19:51:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	a lot of words showed up i dunno what they mean
2008-03-03T19:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	look through there, and see how it identifies your video card.
2008-03-03T19:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zackyramone	so yes, that card is fairly old, one would imagine that restricted driver should run it fine
2008-03-03T19:54:00.000Z	zackyramone	IndyGunFreak	Jack_Sparrow: thanks for the help guys im up for a new install :-/
