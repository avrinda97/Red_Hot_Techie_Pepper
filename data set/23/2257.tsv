2009-08-22T04:19:00.000Z	s0crates		hello everyone, I recently upgraded my ram from 512mg to 4 gig running 64 bit kubuntu and now suddently the window composition is slow-- I have an intel coryville motherboard using on board video with a dual core intel Pentium D chip at 2.8 ghz. Any other info that I can give to help, let me know
2009-08-22T04:19:00.000Z	s0crates		oh I'm running kubuntu 64 bit 9.04 jaunty
2009-08-22T04:21:00.000Z	s0crates		anywhere else I should ask my question to get help?
2009-08-22T04:21:00.000Z	s0crates		tried google, but did not find info
2009-08-22T04:23:00.000Z	s0crates		so any ideas why my windows composition is slow on an intel built in video card? it was running perfectly with 512 ram and now is too slow with 4 gigs ram. what gives?
2009-08-22T04:24:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	are you sure nothing else changed?
2009-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	absolutely, my bios setting and everything stayed the same. Unexplainable.
2009-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	kernel update maybe?
2009-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	I am running 28-15 now, I upgraded the kernel to see if it would help and nothing
2009-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	I mean that you could try an older kernel...
2009-08-22T04:25:00.000Z	s0crates		oh try an older kernel?
2009-08-22T04:26:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	actually I added the launchpad repo and then tried doing a dist-upgrade to see if it would help-- nothing
2009-08-22T04:26:00.000Z	Kalmi		s0crate, "the launchpad repo"?
2009-08-22T04:27:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=865741
2009-08-22T04:27:00.000Z	s0crates		it was a suggestion for someone else that was having issues with the windows composition with kubuntu
2009-08-22T04:29:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	are you sure that you didn't upgrade the kernel at that same you upgraded your RAM? does removing the newly added RAM help the performance?
2009-08-22T04:29:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	I tried putting my old ram in and the compositioning is fine again
2009-08-22T04:29:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	duh... interesting :)
2009-08-22T04:30:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	it works fine in vista, I'm wondering why. Another thing is I'm running 64 bit linux but it only recognizes 3.2 gigs of ram
2009-08-22T04:30:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	I did a memtest on the new ram and it's perfectly fine
2009-08-22T04:31:00.000Z	s0crates		I am completely baffled. lol
2009-08-22T04:33:00.000Z	s0crates	Kalmi	thanks for the help, I'm going to get back to work, have things to do, but I'll be posting on the ubuntu forums later to see if anyone out there has the slightest clue cause I have no idea why this would happen!
2009-08-22T04:33:00.000Z	Kalmi	s0crates	so am I :)
