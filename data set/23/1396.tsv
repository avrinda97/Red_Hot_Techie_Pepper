2010-04-23T07:51:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	how did you burn the disk?
2010-04-23T07:51:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	I have original cd from ubuntu
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	i'm assuming thts one they mailed to you... are you sure the CD is first in your bios boot sequence?
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	I checked the bios setting but theres no cd optionn :( only first hard drive option is there
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	well that's the problem, and a very unusual one.. is your cd drive working?
2010-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	yes
2010-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	make/model of the PC?
2010-04-23T07:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	make/model of the pc
2010-04-23T07:54:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	dont remember... frens pc. will check and come back
2010-04-23T07:55:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	but not now.. tell me some alternatives if any is there
2010-04-23T07:55:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	well i would go through the bios closer, there has to be a boot sequence option.
2010-04-23T07:55:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	if you don't want to wubi install, and you can't change the boot sequence, there is no alternative
2010-04-23T07:55:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	I spent more that a hour in bios.. couldnot get.. yet i ll do that agian
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	from wubi can i install it in separate partition?
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	sort of, it goes to a virtual drive
2010-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	will that be as fast as real one
2010-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	i'm personally not a fan of wubi, but i dont see any reason it would be any slower/faster than a normal install.. but I belive it is far more problematic.. i would not do it
2010-04-23T07:58:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	I am afraid so...
2010-04-23T07:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	you have to be missing something on the boot sequence... like others said, maybe you need to hit f12 or something like that, to call up the boot order
2010-04-23T07:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	can really only discover that though, w/ the make/model fo the pc
2010-04-23T07:59:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	I tried all.. its not coming
2010-04-23T07:59:00.000Z	Ken8521	candy_	delete or esc maybe
2010-04-23T07:59:00.000Z	candy_	Ken8521	will check that..wait a sec i ll ask the model of pc.. just a sec
