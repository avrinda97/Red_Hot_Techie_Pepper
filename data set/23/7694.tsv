2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	got it how to install - sorta-noob - use to running "sudo apt-get install smeg"
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	are Backports required to run the old command?
2005-07-26T14:13:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	i installed mine using the script
2005-07-26T14:13:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	i stay away from backports
2005-07-26T14:13:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	i agree where can I add this script
2005-07-26T14:14:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	here is a link to the latest smeg, you can use the installsmeg script   http://www.realistanew.com/projects/smeg/
2005-07-26T14:17:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	Thanks again - is the Starter Guide good to use?
2005-07-26T14:17:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	if you mean, ubuntuguide, i don't recommend it for new users
2005-07-26T14:18:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	wiki.ubuntu.com//UserDocumentation
2005-07-26T15:09:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	keep them disabled unless you are actively d/l something
2005-07-26T15:09:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	so they are oonly good for installing - otherwise have them disabled during regular updates
2005-07-26T15:10:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	correct
2005-07-26T15:10:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	backports are to become official, but it will take time after that for the software to sync
2005-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	andril	nalioth	cool - BTW that wasmy previous problem - solved
2005-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	nalioth	andril	great!
