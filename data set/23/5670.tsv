2006-10-13T07:24:00.000Z	blake6489		my computer froze, i shut it off w/ the power button, startup again, try to login,receved error, cant write to authorization file, could be that im out of space or that my home dir couldnt be opened. i tryed loging in failsafe gnome, and failsafe terminal, but neither worked, no error message or any thing.  now i rebooted in to recovery mode, so i have a root terminal, any ideas what i should do?
2006-10-13T07:25:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	df -h?
2006-10-13T07:26:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	sorry, dont understand
2006-10-13T07:26:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	check to see how much space is free on the drive. df -h
2006-10-13T07:27:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	says its full, but i had a few gigs left, so i need to find the new file taking up the space?
2006-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	define 'says its full'
2006-10-13T07:29:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	try just df with no -h
2006-10-13T07:31:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	23176192 out of 23265144
2006-10-13T07:32:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	delete some stuff. :)
2006-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	makes sense, thanks, ill be back if that dosnt do the trick ;)
2006-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	good luck :)
2006-10-13T07:34:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	note: du -h can show stuff like filesizes, and I think you can do something to limit to a specific size
2006-10-13T07:34:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	thx, that will help
2006-10-13T07:34:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	np.
2006-10-13T07:36:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	what is the command to delete?
2006-10-13T07:36:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	rm. be VERY careful with that
2006-10-13T07:37:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	it's kind of like an axe.  If you're not paying attention to where you swing it, you lop off a foot.
2006-10-13T07:37:00.000Z	blake6489	cycom	will do, good thing is i just copyed entire drive to external, so im safe...i hope
2006-10-13T07:38:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	try       du | sort -n -r | less
2006-10-13T07:39:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	that will show the filesizes in bytes with the largest files/folders on top

2006-10-13T07:49:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	Act like it was nuthin. :)
2006-10-13T07:51:00.000Z	cycom	blake6489	you are quite welcome.  I'd play with the console as much as possible, simply to learn how to use it more effectively.  I hadn't tried that sort trick before tonight, oddly enough.
