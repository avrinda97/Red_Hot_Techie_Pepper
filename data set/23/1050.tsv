2010-09-26T01:04:00.000Z	ruro_		HOW CAN I DISABLE BROADCAST? IFCONFIG ETH0 -BROADCAST WON'T WORK
2010-09-26T01:04:00.000Z	ruro_		Sorry
2010-09-26T01:05:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	you need an address after that, according to the manpage
2010-09-26T01:05:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	ip address?
2010-09-26T01:06:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	there's another address associated with a network interface?
2010-09-26T01:06:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	maybe my mailbox address? :D
2010-09-26T01:06:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	heh
2010-09-26T01:08:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	also hardware address
2010-09-26T01:08:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	pretty sure it's the ip address
2010-09-26T01:11:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	I still see the broadcast flag there
2010-09-26T01:11:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	why don't you want it there?
2010-09-26T01:12:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	I want to disable broadcasting
2010-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	my objective is to disable broadcasting
2010-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	yes, but WHY?
2010-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	because I fear for my security
2010-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	then:  sudo ifconfig eth0 down
2010-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	seriously.
2010-09-26T01:14:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	if you fear that much for your security, disconnect it from the network altogether.
2010-09-26T01:14:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	because BROADCAST is a basic, required function for network layers to operate.
2010-09-26T01:15:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	it only sends meaningless data, not personal data.
2010-09-26T01:15:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	all a broadcast is saying is "hi, I'm on the network" so that it is able to talk to other computers on a whim
2010-09-26T01:15:00.000Z	ruro_	Gnea	what about multicast
2010-09-26T01:16:00.000Z	Gnea	ruro_	multicast isn't required, you should be fine without it
