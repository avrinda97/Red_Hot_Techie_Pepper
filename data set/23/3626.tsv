2008-03-03T12:23:00.000Z	hellpme1		thanks guy i think i have to reinstall again
2008-03-03T12:23:00.000Z	hellpme1		recovery is useless then in ubuntu
2008-03-03T12:23:00.000Z	hellpme1		this is the big problem
2008-03-03T12:24:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	why'd you have to reinstall?
2008-03-03T12:26:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	my message above for hwilde is also for you,  and in addition im trying to recover the ubuntu since i cant just delete my files and reinstall winxp again
2008-03-03T12:26:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	why can't you just reinstall? did you create a seperate /home?
2008-03-03T12:27:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	reinstall ubuntu is what im planning but the partition part of installation didnt see the old partitions i have
2008-03-03T12:27:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	define "didn't see"
2008-03-03T12:27:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	it wasnt able to see the winxp partition i have
2008-03-03T12:28:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	it doesn't really matter if it doesn't see the xp part. If you install ubuntu and grub doesnt find the partition, you can still use supergrub to get it back
2008-03-03T12:29:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	can you boot xp atm?
2008-03-03T12:29:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	yes when turning on this pc,winxp boots automatically without prompting me to the grub
2008-03-03T12:30:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	do you have free space to install ubuntu on right now?
2008-03-03T12:30:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	nope im planning to overwrite it in my /dev/sda5 which is my old ubuntu
2008-03-03T12:31:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	right ... and what was the reason for reinstalling? because you can just use supergrub to get grub back
2008-03-03T12:31:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	i havent tried supergrub
2008-03-03T12:32:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	second link
2008-03-03T12:33:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	if you start supergrub (burn it, then boot it) it has an amazing onscreen help
2008-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	can i run supergrub even if im on livecd?
2008-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	hischild	hellpme1	it's a bootable cd of 3 meg
2008-03-03T12:36:00.000Z	hellpme1	hischild	big problem i dont have cd writer as of now
