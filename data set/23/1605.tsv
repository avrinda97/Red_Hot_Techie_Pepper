2010-01-28T08:53:00.000Z	ouyes	blakkheim	 i do not know what are you talking about, i want to use that old tool ADD/REMOVE
2010-01-28T08:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	ouyes	read the manual page of aptitude instead, it is far more useful

2010-01-28T08:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	ouyes	i'm saying learning to use aptitude to manage software is a better choice than some add/remove programs thing
2010-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	ouyes	blakkheim	 i know how to add and remove a software but i need an old tool make things simply
2010-01-28T08:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	ouyes	aptitude is simple
2010-01-28T08:58:00.000Z	ouyes	blakkheim	 if you know the name of the software you can use aptitude but if you do not ?
