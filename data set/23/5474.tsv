2012-08-23T21:05:00.000Z	EDinNY		Can any one compare sound setting with mine?
2012-08-23T21:06:00.000Z	EDinNY		12.10 is not out till year 12 month 10
2012-08-23T21:06:00.000Z	EDinNY		YES
2012-08-23T21:06:00.000Z	EDinNY		12.04 came out in April...
2012-08-23T21:07:00.000Z	EDinNY		ubuntu only releases twice a year.  They picked those months
2012-08-23T21:08:00.000Z	EDinNY		...but since 12.04 is long term support, I will keep using it for a few years. Unless they come out with something REALLY great
2012-08-23T21:09:00.000Z	EDinNY		every 2.5 years, I believe
2012-08-23T21:09:00.000Z	EDinNY		the last one was 10.10 I think
2012-08-23T21:09:00.000Z	EDinNY		Still running that on a server
2012-08-23T21:11:00.000Z	EDinNY		I just need you to type alsamixer in a command box and tell me what you see
2012-08-23T21:11:00.000Z	usr13	EDinNY	What is your issue?
2012-08-23T21:11:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	I was trying to get a mike to work and I killed my speaker output
2012-08-23T21:12:00.000Z	usr13	EDinNY	Is it a laptop or desktop?
2012-08-23T21:12:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	so I have no sound from the speakers
2012-08-23T21:12:00.000Z	EDinNY		desktop
2012-08-23T21:12:00.000Z	usr13		!sound | EDinNY
2012-08-23T21:13:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	every setting on alsamixer has a bar graph above it except "speaker"
2012-08-23T21:13:00.000Z	usr13	EDinNY	I think that is normal
2012-08-23T21:13:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	that is what I wanted to know.  I want to know what you have turned on
2012-08-23T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	EDinNY	It would only be the same if I had same PC, (same sound chip).
2012-08-23T21:15:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	I know that, but I might get an idea of what I am missing
2012-08-23T21:16:00.000Z	EDinNY	usr13	got it.  It seems that  pavucontrol gives me more control than what I was using!  Thanks
2012-08-23T21:16:00.000Z	usr13	EDinNY	Very good.
