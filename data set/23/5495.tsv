2006-11-18T17:46:00.000Z	matroblend		HI all
2006-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	matroblend		Is there a ISO that is small enough for a floppy?
2006-11-18T17:49:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	not an iso, because ISO is a format, but it's possible to create an image that can fit on a floppy
2006-11-18T17:49:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	iso here is short for ISO9660, which is an IEEE standard.
2006-11-18T17:51:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	How do I find a image that will fit on a floppy
2006-11-18T17:52:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	I don't know if they are available for ubuntu.  They are available for slackware, which tells us that it is possible to do.
2006-11-18T17:52:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	what are you trying to do?  there may be another way to get it done.
2006-11-18T17:53:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	really?
2006-11-18T17:53:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	possibly.  what are you trying to do, exactly?
2006-11-18T17:54:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	I have a old laptop I want linux on it but it does not have a cd drive
2006-11-18T17:54:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	so you need to install, once you've installed, then you no longer will care.
2006-11-18T17:55:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	true. I just want to use it as a linux laptop
2006-11-18T17:56:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	I'd probably use a different distro for that case.
2006-11-18T17:56:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	Ok which and where if you don't mind
2006-11-18T17:57:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	Debian or Slackware.
2006-11-18T17:57:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	debian is closer to ubuntu in administration.  slackware is a bit easier to install.
2006-11-18T17:58:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	easy is best in this matter I think
2006-11-18T17:59:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	slackware doesn't have a package manager (well, doesn't have an acceptable one, IMO) so in the long run Debian is probably easier.  But it's arguable
2006-11-18T06:00:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	OK so Debian it is now what?
2006-11-18T06:00:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	go to their site, read their install docs for a network install
2006-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	network install?
2006-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	sethk	matroblend	right, it installs almost everything from the network and therefore doesn't need a CD.
2006-11-18T06:02:00.000Z	matroblend	sethk	Ahh ok thankyou bye
