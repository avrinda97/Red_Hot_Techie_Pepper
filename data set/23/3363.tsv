2008-10-17T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	open gconf-editor, go to /apps/metacity/general and tick the box for "reduced resources"
2008-10-17T14:50:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	That appears to do more than just change resizing
2008-10-17T14:50:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	that's the best I can offer
2008-10-17T14:51:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	Is that change supposed to take effect immediately, or only after an X restart?
2008-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	should work after restarting metacity
2008-10-17T14:57:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	Didn't work
2008-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	no, didn't do anything here, either (only removed animations)
2008-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	are you actually using metacity?
2008-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	I'm using whatever Gnome uses
2008-10-17T14:59:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	gnome can use either metacity or compiz. Compiz gets enabled when you turn Visual Effects on.
2008-10-17T15:00:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	what's set in System-Preferences-Appearance-Visual effects?
2008-10-17T15:01:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	I'm not using Compiz
2008-10-17T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	okay
2008-10-17T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	it seems that metacity isn't configurable in this way. You can use another window manager, but it is a bit of an operation
2008-10-17T15:02:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	Yeah, nevermind then. I know Compiz can do it, but it's not worth its instability.
2008-10-17T15:03:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	you could try icewm, I think that's more configurable
2008-10-17T15:03:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	I like Gnome
2008-10-17T15:03:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	it works with gnome ^^
2008-10-17T15:03:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	That doesn't mean it IS Gnome
2008-10-17T15:04:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	it is *just* a window manager. You can use it to replace metacity, and you still have gnome.
2008-10-17T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	btw, if I remember correctly, it was you who was looking for help here, so don't come across so smartalecky now.
2008-10-17T15:06:00.000Z	xnv	soundray	You're implying that if I install WM, nothing will change except how windows are handled under the hood. I think that's the wrong impression to give, which is why I'm being "smartalecky"
2008-10-17T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	xnv	what I am implying is indeed correct. If you think that that is wrong, you should go and try it out before you second-guess me.
