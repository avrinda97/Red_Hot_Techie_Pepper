2012-11-16T03:35:00.000Z	sander_		Why does my desktop go into initramfs with the message ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid... does not exist.. WHen I push control-alt-tab on bootup, it works tho.
2012-11-16T03:36:00.000Z	sander_		I've checked the uuid number with blkid, and its there.
2012-11-16T03:36:00.000Z	escott	sander_	what does ctrl-alt-tab do? and when are you pressing it?
2012-11-16T03:37:00.000Z	sander_	escott	I just got told here earlier to press it.. not sure what it does really.. I'm pressing it right after the bios.
2012-11-16T03:37:00.000Z	escott	sander_	after the bios but before grub?
2012-11-16T03:38:00.000Z	escott	sander_	i guess im wondering why ctrl-alt-tab and not ctrl-alt-6 or shift-tab or any other random combination of keys
2012-11-16T03:38:00.000Z	sander_	escott	the ubuntu screen is there.. with the timebar.
2012-11-16T03:38:00.000Z	escott	sander_	so at plymouth
2012-11-16T03:39:00.000Z	sander_	escott	maybe it's tab+control. or tab+alt.. I don't remember.
2012-11-16T03:39:00.000Z	sander_	escott	I just pushed them all.. and I got back in, phew!.
2012-11-16T03:39:00.000Z	sander_	escott	but I want to get rid of that when it boots.
2012-11-16T03:40:00.000Z	escott	sander_	i cant imagine what that key would be doing. there really isnt anything in the early boot that listens for keypresses. im guessing the act of pressing the key is causing just enough delay to avoid some kind of race condition in device enumeration... but it sounds odd. I would try one of the kernel rootwait argumenet
2012-11-16T03:41:00.000Z	escott	sander_	so in /etc/default/grub on the CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT add "rootdelay=5"
2012-11-16T03:43:00.000Z	sander_	escott	correct?: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash rootdelay=5"
2012-11-16T03:43:00.000Z	escott	sander_	sure. then sudo update-grub
2012-11-16T03:44:00.000Z	sander_	escott	thanks, then i'll reboot and try it. :-)
2012-11-16T03:45:00.000Z	sander_	escott	thanks. it worked :-)
2012-11-16T03:46:00.000Z	escott	sander_	given how tight your race condition is you could probably drop to rootdelay=1 if those 4 seconds are important to you
2012-11-16T03:47:00.000Z	sander_	escott	pretty quick now. :-)
2012-11-16T03:48:00.000Z	escott	sander_	its just really strange.. you must have a race that is only a few microseconds... otherwise a keyboard interrupt isn't going to do anything useful
2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	sander_	escott	so you think I should just try for the curiosity of it.. to make it 1 second?
2012-11-16T03:50:00.000Z	escott	sander_	if you are really curious you can start building your own kernels and bisect back to the change that caused this. depends on how much you care and how much your time is worth.... when you spend days trying to figure out what happens in a millisecond... that makes you a kernel developer i guess
2012-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	sander_	escott	it's probably fixed in a newer version of ubuntu.
