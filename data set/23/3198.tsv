2008-06-19T21:08:00.000Z	hans-solo		why is this not mentioned in the apache documentation
2008-06-19T21:09:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Why is what not mentioned?
2008-06-19T21:10:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	The apache documentation is extremely good
2008-06-19T21:11:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	that's because that's not a part of Apache itself, that's a distro specific daemon thing
2008-06-27T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Are you on Ubuntu?
2008-06-27T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Are you on Ubuntu?
2008-06-27T12:05:00.000Z	hans-solo	Flannel	No I still havn't figured out how to get the network running on the laptop. I am now chatting on good ol' WInXP
2008-06-27T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	no, I mean, with that box.  If so, what does `lsb_release -d` give you?
2008-06-27T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Or even if not.  What does lsb_release -d give you?
2008-06-27T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Alright, and you're sure the package is xf86-video-i810?
2008-06-27T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	Right.  So you don't have xf86-video-i810 installed.  Which video driver do you have installed then?
2008-06-27T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	dpkg -l | grep xserver-xorg-video
2008-06-27T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	(thats an L)
2008-06-27T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	hans-solo	alright, lets try this one: dpkg -l | grep xserver-xorg-video-intel
