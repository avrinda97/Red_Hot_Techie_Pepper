2009-09-13T07:02:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy		even saw the program running
2009-09-13T07:04:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy		yes
2009-09-13T07:05:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy		moon@old:~$ cp /usr/share/idesk/default.lnk ~/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T07:05:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy		cp: cannot create regular file `/home/moon/.idesktop/default.lnk': Permission denied
2009-09-13T07:05:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	ls -ld ~/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T06:56:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	what are the permissions on the file ?
2009-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	well if you read the idesk documentation - they say that atleast one icon file must exist in ~/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	well, you can copy the default one.  cp  /usr/share/idesk/default.lnk ~/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	there are other sample config files in /usr/share/idesk/
2009-09-13T07:01:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	unop	it ran for 5 secs before exiting with this : Cannot load file: /home/moon/.idesktop/default.lnk!! Exiting.
2009-09-13T07:02:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	did you copy default.lnk from /usr/share/idesk/  ??
2009-09-13T07:03:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	ok, let's have a look at the permissions?  ls -ld ~/.idesktop/*
2009-09-13T07:04:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	unop	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 221 2009-09-12 21:00 /home/moon/.idesktop/default.lnk
2009-09-13T07:04:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	did you use sudo while copying the file across?
2009-09-13T07:04:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	well, you shouldn't have :)
2009-09-13T07:06:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	unop	drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2009-09-12 21:00 /home/moon/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T07:07:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	well heh - why is this folder owned by root?   sudo chown $USER.$USER -R ~/.idesktop/
2009-09-13T07:07:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	I'm guessing you used sudo while creating this directory too?
2009-09-13T07:09:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	well, as a rule of the thumb, any files/directories in your homedirectory need to be owned by you (98% of the time atleast)
2009-09-13T07:09:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	so in this case using sudo wasn't a good idea
2009-09-13T07:16:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	unop	how would i kill idesk
2009-09-13T07:16:00.000Z	unop	Moon_Doggy	 killall idesk  #??
