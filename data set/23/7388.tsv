2005-10-20T15:16:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	thanks again
2005-12-01T09:35:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	you'll need libquicktime1 for sure, but i dont know any video encoding programs
2005-12-01T09:36:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	you're always here to help! Thanks again!
2005-12-01T09:57:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	I tried kino but it wont let me add a quicktime movie to the storyboard to encode...
2005-12-01T09:58:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	i'm not much on video editing/authoring
2005-12-01T10:04:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	you dont install it, you build it
2005-12-01T10:05:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	how do I build it?
2005-12-01T10:05:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	yes, you should look to synaptic first
2005-12-01T10:05:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	I did, but it has an earlier version of kino
2005-12-01T10:06:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	then join #kubuntu-offtopic and i'll help you
2005-12-04T06:43:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	are you at your keyboard?
2005-12-04T06:44:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	i am.
2005-12-04T06:45:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	could you assist me with a problem I am having with my login screen? I have messed it. Now when Ubuntu boots up instead of getting a login screen I get a screen that is scanning for computers on my network AND no way at all to login to uncheck that option
2005-12-04T06:45:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	when it starts scanning for other boxen, hit ctrl-c and see if it continues
2005-12-04T06:45:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	I was playing around in the "Login Screen Setup"
2005-12-04T06:46:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	I will have to reboot to try that because I am on the Live CD right now. Should that not work do you have any other ideas. And I need it to let me login, not just stop scanning
2005-12-04T06:47:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	if it stops scanning, it should continue the login procedure, i would think
2005-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	I only say so b/c there is a cancel button. and when I click it, it stops scanning but stays at that window... The other button is refresh
2005-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	then i'm not sure what you've gotten into
2005-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	nalioth	logical_mark	ask crimsun or Seveas
2005-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	logical_mark	nalioth	will do thanks
