2006-07-04T05:18:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000		how hard is it to compile progs from source in ubuntu?
2006-07-04T05:19:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000		say for instance I wanted a few things to be a bit gentoo-like - tvtime, mplayer,etc would I have problems compiling these apps in ubuntu?
2006-07-04T05:20:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	though you probably don't need to compile
2006-07-04T05:20:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	most of these packages are in universe
2006-07-04T05:40:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	wine is pretty good for some things (blizzard & other openGL games) and most FPS's run native
2006-07-04T05:40:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	no, they DONT run native anymore. I am SO po'd about ArmyOps
2006-07-04T05:40:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	well, not knowing stuff can be fixed. The other part... well.. ;p
2006-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	so far the only native ones I can run are ut2004 and et
2006-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	all the ID ones work, as does Savage and Savage 2
2006-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	Ive been working on the other part for years. 5 years of therapy and im angrier than when I started. Yay therapy.
2006-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	and vendetta online is a pretty fun native space combat game
2006-07-04T05:42:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	what video card do you use?
2006-07-04T05:42:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	I have an nvidia 6800gs 512mb agp
2006-07-04T05:51:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	no
2006-07-04T05:51:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	yes.
2006-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	you're redefining (wrongly) the word emulator just to suit what you think it means
2006-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	on the contrary - the WINE developers redefine the word emulator
2006-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	I doubt the ndiswrapper would work because the drivers it's "wrapping" are x86
2006-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	well it worked REALLY bad w either gentoo or ubuntu with any kind of optimized kernel
2006-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	but it appears im nice and stable w 386
2006-07-09T12:26:00.000Z	polpak	Awesome-o2000	I know because the kernel is k7 (which is the 64 bit build afaik) but the drivers are build for x86
2006-07-09T12:27:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	IU just figured that out - but that doesnt explain why the ones I'd compile on gentoo would cause problems - which I will freely admit is my own fault
2006-07-09T12:27:00.000Z	Awesome-o2000	polpak	not only that but I suspect if I used the k7 kernel and compiled them myself i'd have problems as well
