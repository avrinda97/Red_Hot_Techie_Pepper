2008-07-05T11:59:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	thanks.
2008-07-05T12:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	what is wrong with the link i gave you
2008-07-05T12:09:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	installing on a remote server w/out gui interface.
2008-07-05T12:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	so edit sources.list to point to hardy, sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	thanks for the upgrade info awhile ago. i'm receiving the error sendmail: fatal: no login name found for user ID 1100 when i try to access /etc/passwd. this poses a problem because that's where i would edit the users. suggestions?
2008-07-05T14:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	what are you doing and why
2008-07-05T14:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	so use userdel
2008-07-05T14:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	you shouldn't be editing /etc/passwd manually unless you know what you are doing
2008-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	the user no longer exists. not possible to delete it with userdel. i had been adding users by editing /etc/passwd and it was working fine; then i installed webmin, and it started creating users with the same ids as the existing users. now cleaning up the mess.
2008-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	lol
2008-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	make sure you remove entries from /etc/shadow and /etc/group as well
2008-07-05T14:53:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	using sudo gives me http://pastie.org/228127
2008-07-05T14:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	so you can't sudo?
2008-07-05T14:54:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	nope
2008-07-05T14:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	you'll have to reboot into rescue mode then
2008-07-05T14:57:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	if the system is on a remote server how would i repair this?
2008-07-05T15:34:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	any suggestion on how to switch to root or edit /etc/shadow, etc/group without sudo?
2008-07-05T15:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	like i told you, you need to get into rescue mode, there is no way
2008-07-05T15:35:00.000Z	berkelep	Fryguy--	how do i do that if the system is on a remote server?
2008-07-05T15:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	you don't
2008-07-05T15:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	berkelep	you already asked this and i already answered it. my answer isn't going to change an hour later
