2006-09-23T12:50:00.000Z	Asc		Does it just not mount, or does it give you permissions trouble?
2006-09-23T12:51:00.000Z	Asc		Pun, weird.  Is it NTFS or FAT?
2006-09-23T12:52:00.000Z	Asc		Anybody know if the default kernel includes NTFS read right now?
2006-09-23T12:53:00.000Z	Asc		Eh, I'm pretty sure it does anyway or that volume wouldn't have worked.
2006-09-23T12:53:00.000Z	Asc		Pun: Are any of the other partitions NTFS?
2006-09-23T12:55:00.000Z	Asc		(this actually isn't why I don't use NTFS any more, but it's part of the reason I won't in the future)
2006-09-23T12:56:00.000Z	Asc		Pun: I assume it's because you want to access it ;p
2006-09-23T12:56:00.000Z	Asc		Troubleshooting is fun, I tell you!
2006-09-23T12:57:00.000Z	Asc		Pun: I suppose there's no chance you can copy everything off the partition, format it as FAT, and replace the files? :p
2006-09-23T12:58:00.000Z	Asc		In my experience, rebooting in windows is less painful than using wine, in most situations
2006-09-23T12:58:00.000Z	Skarr	Asc	I need to use it to be able to use my network adapter software on ubuntu ;)
2006-09-23T12:59:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	0_o
2006-09-23T13:00:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	You might try looking for a debian package on the internet
2006-09-23T13:04:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	some recent-ish-looking dpkgs are here: http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/index.html
2006-09-23T13:04:00.000Z	Skarr	Asc	Thanks but arren fixed it :)
2006-09-23T13:13:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	if it's as good as the speach recognition software, it'll take five hours to get working, and understand a word one time out of five.
2006-09-23T13:13:00.000Z	Skarr	Asc	Ha, remember that PS2 game where you controlled the girl with your voice?
2006-09-23T13:14:00.000Z	Skarr	Asc	Strip nude! I will not do that! Get naked! I will not do that! Shoot zombie! I'm sorry, I don't understand.
2006-09-23T13:14:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	I actually have never heard of it, but it sounds amusing
2006-09-23T13:15:00.000Z	Skarr	Asc	It's kind of funny, you can tell her "Dance" and she dances, she only recognizes dumb commands, not practical ones
2006-09-23T13:16:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	One wonders if something could be arranged with some text-to-speech software set on repeat
2006-09-23T14:30:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	I think if you use 'sudo bash' the terminal will start a terminal in which you are root
2006-09-23T14:31:00.000Z	Asc	Skarr	it's usually better to use 'sudo [command] ' on a per-command basis though.  If that's what you're asking.
