2011-03-27T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 where exactly are you seeing this sign?
2011-03-27T09:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 its best to not IM people. keep it in the channel
2011-03-27T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 theres no need to msg people.. clarify your problem to the channel.
2011-03-27T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 what archive are you refering to.
2011-03-27T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 give more details.  You are very lacking in specifics..
2011-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 You can upgrade..
2011-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 but i normally do clean installs.
2011-03-27T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 normally people 'upgrade' via their network connection. not a cd.. ( but you canupgrade with the alt-installer cd)
2011-03-27T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 so  i guess thats a yes.
2011-03-27T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 you can upgrade now to the 11.04 ALPHA3 if you wanted to
2011-03-27T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 so far its taken this pc like 5 hrs to upgrade....
2011-03-27T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 for the 100th time.. YES.. you dont need the cd.
2011-03-27T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 if you have to ask such questions.. then i dont think you really want to be upgrading to  alpha level software at this time.
2011-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 it was given just earlier.... by jiltdil
2011-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 expect it to take like 4+ hrs to finish...
2011-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 and  its possible it could fail and leave you with a unuseable system..
2011-03-27T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 its not out in beta yet..
2011-03-27T09:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	  You got it backwards. the version # IS the date...
2011-03-27T09:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 because the version # is the date..
2011-03-27T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 ubuntu is linux. so most all apply :)
2011-03-27T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 perhaps if you used my actial nick i may notice it....
2011-03-27T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mymeatinyourseat	 theres numerous secure deletion tools out there. it depends on how paranoid you are and the time you want to spend.
