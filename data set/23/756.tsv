2011-02-25T03:49:00.000Z	entityreborn		Having a bit of an issue on a strange setup.
2011-02-25T03:50:00.000Z	entityreborn		Laptop, internal LCD removed completely, using external monitor and the display is squished into the top left corner, an no options to change resolution
2011-02-25T03:50:00.000Z	entityreborn		squished meaning instead of being in the center of the screen, at a low res, it's starting at the first pixel
2011-02-25T03:51:00.000Z	entityreborn		Also, the display is "Unknown"
2011-02-25T03:53:00.000Z	entityreborn		any takers on my issue?
2011-02-25T03:55:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	no idea..have you rebooted with the external display connected?
2011-02-25T03:55:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	yes
2011-02-25T03:55:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	same issue in a livecd environment?
2011-02-25T03:57:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	what about the key combo, my laptop it's [fn]+F4
2011-02-25T03:59:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	you tried some different resolution modes?  e.g. "xrandr -s 1024x768"
2011-02-25T04:03:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	try  xrandr --output VGA1 --auto (assuming its a vga connection)
2011-02-25T04:04:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	I connected another monitor earlier with the same result.
2011-02-25T04:10:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	anyway, I have no clue.
2011-02-25T04:11:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	i'm tapped out too..when you removed the LCD, was it as simple as unplugging a connector?
2011-02-25T04:12:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	two, the main data interface and the ballast connection for the backlight
2011-02-25T04:19:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	sudo apt-get install pastebinit && pastebinit ~/.config/monitors.xml
2011-02-25T04:20:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	i'm tapped out, just throwing some darts at the board (so you can ignore me if you want)
2011-02-25T04:20:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	i'll get youy the pastebin :P

2011-02-25T04:23:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	change both clone and primary to "yes" then reboot..take it of leave it :)
2011-02-25T04:25:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	will try
2011-02-25T04:42:00.000Z	bc81	entityreborn	have you tried booting with the external both connected, and disconnected?  what about testing on an older/different distro liveCCD?
2011-02-25T04:43:00.000Z	entityreborn	bc81	I don't have another liveCD
