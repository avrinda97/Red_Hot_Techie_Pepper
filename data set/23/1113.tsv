2010-08-26T12:18:00.000Z	Rums		any thoughts on my completely blank boot?
2010-08-26T12:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	but it worked in try mode from the usb boot disk?
2010-08-26T12:19:00.000Z	Rums	sacarlson	yea, installed from the live USB
2010-08-26T12:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	try shut off and on again?  any sign that grub2 started?
2010-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	Rums	sacarlson	nope, just get the HP splash screen and it goes right to the blinking cursor
2010-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	well the splash screen means it got part way into grub
2010-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	did you unplug the usb disk yet?
2010-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	Rums		No, I mean the HP splash screen. For the laptop.
2010-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	Rums		Yea, USB is removed
2010-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	oh the bios screen
2010-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	Rums		Yea, sorry. No grub
2010-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	Rums		Is there another way to start it in safe mode?
2010-08-26T12:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	ok boot from usb boot again and mount the location you installed it to see if it installed.  if it's there then reinstall grub2
2010-08-26T12:23:00.000Z	Rums		Okay, I'll go back into the USB, one second.
2010-08-26T12:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	oh and did you change the bios to boot from a different location?  if so put it back to boot default for /def/sda
2010-08-26T12:26:00.000Z	Rums	sacarlson	only boot option is hard disc, I manutally selected it.
2010-08-26T12:26:00.000Z	Rums		Oh wow, third restart it booted in.
2010-08-26T12:27:00.000Z	Rums		i'm going to reinstall grub for the hell of it
2010-08-26T12:27:00.000Z	Rums		is it just sudo apt-get install grub2?
2010-08-26T12:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	if it's not installed yes
2010-08-26T12:28:00.000Z	Rums		No, I restarted it a third time and manually selected the hard drive, and it booted, but I know it was going this before because I did this on the first boot. Not sure what's going on.
2010-08-26T12:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	I think there is also sudo grub-install /dev/sdX  X being the disk number
2010-08-26T12:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	Rums	opps and that should have been sudo grub-install /dev/sda   a=the leter not number of drive you want to install mbr on
