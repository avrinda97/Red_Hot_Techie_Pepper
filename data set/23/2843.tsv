2010-06-14T14:51:00.000Z	kinglet		Hey guys, I have a big problem when I want to install apps or open synaptic pkg mng and ... error msg is: E: Could not open file /var/lib/dpkg/status - open (2: No such file or directory)
2010-06-14T14:52:00.000Z	cousteau	kinglet	do you have any other program that uses dpkg opened, such as another instance of synaptic, the upgrades...?
2010-06-14T14:53:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	no problem is not for opening other package manager! status directory missed!
2010-06-14T14:53:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	I tried to mv status-old but cannot do it!

2010-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	cousteau	kinglet	have you checked that the PC is plugged? XD ...no, really,   ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/
2010-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	I have not any status dir
2010-06-14T15:05:00.000Z	cousteau	kinglet	don't know much about dpkg, but I think that's waaay weird
2010-06-14T15:05:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	alternatives , info , parts , triggers and updates are the directories in here
2010-06-14T15:05:00.000Z	cousteau	kinglet	dunno in lucid, but at least in jaunty /var/lib/dpkg/status is a file, not a folder
2010-06-14T15:06:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	yup may be its a file, anyway no file and no directory what named status
2010-06-14T15:11:00.000Z	cousteau	kinglet	what were you doing before it disappeared? did you install something or did something weird?
2010-06-14T15:12:00.000Z	kinglet	cousteau	I think, I removed the status file :(
