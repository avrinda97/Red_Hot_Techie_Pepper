2007-09-09T15:57:00.000Z	Pingviller		so I'm trying to get guild wars to work with wine.. using this as reference: http://www.linuxlogin.com/games/guildwars.php          but how do I set up the registry keys at the bottom of the page? I can't find the direct3d registry with wine regedit
2007-09-09T15:58:00.000Z	scguy318	Pingviller	what Wine version, what Guild Wars version?
2007-09-09T16:00:00.000Z	scguy318	Pingviller	I think it's HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Direct3D, create if they dont exist
