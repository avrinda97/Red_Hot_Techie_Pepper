2011-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	julie		isn't it libxtst-dev?
2011-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	julie		good point danub
2011-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	braxton	julie	I'll try that, I guess.
2011-06-09T07:29:00.000Z	julie	braxton	continue
2011-06-09T07:32:00.000Z	julie	braxton	you could somehow generate mouse movements based on arrow keys (probably in raw terminal mode)
2011-06-09T07:34:00.000Z	julie	braxton	that sounds like a functional solution
2011-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	julie	braxton	but I would never encourage putting any efforts on such a complex setup which will certainly give worse results than using a 10$ mouse
2011-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	braxton	julie	I'm using an actual game controller. I'm trying to use it to play a game.
2011-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	julie	braxton	perhaps you should clarify how you want to use it, like in which game?
2011-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	julie	braxton	and does minecraft use joysticks or just the mouse?
2011-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	julie	braxton	sorry but what you're saying doesn't make sense...  do you want the joystick to do both joystick actions and mouse actions?
2011-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	braxton	julie	it's not a joystick, it's a game controller, similar to an xbox controller.
2011-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	julie	braxton	to me it's the same
2011-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	julie	braxton	do you want that game controller to do both game controller and mouse actions?
2011-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	braxton	julie	yes
2011-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	julie	braxton	that still doesn't answer why you wouldn't use a mouse to do mouse work
2011-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	julie	braxton	I already told you...  even if you hire a pro to do it for you for 2K$, it will be buggy as hell
2011-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	braxton	julie	what do you think I am doing?
2011-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	braxton	julie	I have a USB game controller I just bought.
2011-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	julie	braxton	the only way to do it properly would be to integrate it as a low level driver so it could at least manage the location on the screen
2011-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	julie	braxton	sorry I can't help you
2011-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	braxton	julie	would that include libxtst?
2011-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	julie	braxton	you're probably missing the one I mentionned, libxtst-dev
