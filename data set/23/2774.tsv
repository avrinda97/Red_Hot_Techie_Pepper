2009-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	iMatter		Ok i am back, i was the ubuntu guy
2009-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	iMatter		a restart fixed it not sure what damage i did by the force reboot..
2009-07-09T12:26:00.000Z	iMatter		well.. How would i go about installing Home to a separate partition than the OS
2009-07-09T12:26:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 while installation or afterwards?
2009-07-09T12:27:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	before, i already have ubuntu installed but im planning on upgrading to 9.04 so i thought i'd set it up now so i won't have to loose an arm and a leg to upgrade or if something goes wrong and i need a fresh install
2009-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 "sudo" before "find"? or also befor "cpio"?
2009-07-09T12:31:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 so you want to do it afterwards, although before the upgrade? log in as user, "cd /", "sudo -i", create a partition in free space, "mkfs....", "mount ... /mnt/newhome", "cp -ax /home/* /mnt/newhome/", edit fstab (new partition/fs -> /home), remove the contents of /home/ on the root fs, if you are sure, that everything was ok
2009-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	interesting was kinda lost after a certain point...How much space would i need for just ubuntu, is 10GB good?
2009-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	and instead could i do this from a Live CD
2009-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	the copying of home via all GUI...
2009-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 you can do that from a live cd. be sure to make a backup before, as mistakes can lead to a desaster
2009-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	ok thats why i wanted to do it all GUI...terminal is easiest way to make small mistakes that end in disater.
2009-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 gui hides the mistakes ;)
2009-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	easier to tell for me though..
2009-07-09T12:35:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	kinda lost just looking at the section where terminal goes..
2009-07-09T12:37:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 "cat /proc/partitions" or "blkid"; you should try to understand, what that is all about before doing it. upgrading normally does not need a separate home, so you should consider to do it later
2009-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	i know...i chose to do it now because i finnally got the guts and backups to kill windows and have enough space
2009-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	, Flannel, Permission Denied on This command " find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /new/ " for like everything it  tries...
2009-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	 have you run it with root privileges?
2009-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	its before find , mechdave apt-get nor update manager is running (On Live CD
2009-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	oskar-	iMatter	in a pipeline every command needs its own sudo in front
2009-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	its working now with the two sudos
2009-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	iMatter	oskar-	didn't know that never used anything that needed root priviledges more than once
