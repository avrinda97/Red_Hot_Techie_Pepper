2007-07-16T15:50:00.000Z	Ia2		hi everyone, does someone have any suggestions on the following? When I log out I get a blank screen.
2007-07-16T15:51:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	and the computer is frozen?
2007-07-16T15:52:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	do you have an ATI card with the ATI drivers?
2007-07-16T15:53:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	yes I have an ATI card, and had to enable the restricted driver
2007-07-16T15:53:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	aha, that could be the problem (I had the same one)
2007-07-16T15:54:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	do you use the accelerated 3D at all?
2007-07-16T15:55:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	Not sure if it's being used
2007-07-16T15:57:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	well, it's a bit of a hack, but I disable it by enabling the Composite extension in xorg.conf (this will cause the driver to disable fast 3D support though)
2007-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	ok I'll try that
2007-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	it's Composite "Enable" I think
2007-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	and you need to restart for it to take effect
2007-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	ok thanks
2007-07-17T16:09:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	Thanks that fixed my problem!
2007-07-17T16:10:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	great!
2007-07-17T16:10:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	hopefully it won't be necessary when ATI fix the problem
2007-07-17T16:12:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	do you by any chance know why I would not be able to set permissions on my Hard Drives?
2007-07-17T16:12:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	which hard drives? and what file system are they?
2007-07-17T16:14:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	External drive
2007-07-17T16:15:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	ah, external drives are often formatted FAT32, which doesn't support permissions
2007-07-17T16:16:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	so shall I format using what system?
2007-07-17T16:18:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	ext3 is what Linux/Ubuntu use, and supports all the features
2007-07-17T16:20:00.000Z	MattJ	Ia2	gparted should be able to show you the drive, and let you reformat it
2007-07-17T16:20:00.000Z	Ia2	MattJ	Thank you I'll try that.
