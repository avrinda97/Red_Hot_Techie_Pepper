2007-05-18T11:12:00.000Z	Lounge		ok now all the edgy backports are gone
2007-05-18T11:14:00.000Z	Lounge		you can actually play halo/halo-3 on linux?
2007-05-18T11:14:00.000Z	Lounge		i mean "2"
2007-05-18T11:15:00.000Z	Lounge		i still love "jedi academy" and "the sims 2" it'd be cool to get those to run in ubuntu
2007-05-18T11:15:00.000Z	Lounge		without wine
2007-05-18T11:16:00.000Z	Lounge		how you go about getting halo to run in ubuntu?
2007-05-18T11:17:00.000Z	Lounge		or any other dx9 game for that matter?
2007-05-18T11:17:00.000Z	Lounge		oh it does require wine, i understand
2007-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	Lounge		i suppose there's no profit game company in make a build for linux - it would give away the source code, right?
2007-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	Lounge		i didn't type that right
2007-05-18T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	You can make a Linux app without releasing the source
2007-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	WIth desktop effects, Yes
2007-05-21T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	TOR, ( but don't use it for large downloads or P2P please )
2010-10-23T02:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	You can use graphical themes with grub2,yes.
2012-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	I use network manager with another machine connected via crossover cable, and it's working fine for me.
2012-06-21T02:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	Could you recap your exact setup and what problems you're having?
2012-06-21T02:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	Could you pastebin the output of "nm-tool"?

2012-06-21T02:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	/etc/networking/interfaces is *not* a configuration file for network-manager. At least inn the past, an entry in /etc/networking/interfaces would indicate that you wanted ifupdown to manage that interface, and thus network-manager ignored it. My guess is that that is what is meant by unmanaged.
2012-06-21T02:12:00.000Z	Lounge	Jordan_U	I'd rather just use ifupdown instead
2012-06-21T02:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lounge	If you don't want to use it, yes.
2012-06-21T02:15:00.000Z	Lounge	Jordan_U	also it seems that allot of apps rely on network-manager to connect, i remember this being an issie with firefox wanted to check for a working network connection before connecting
