2012-09-09T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	what browsers have you tried
2012-09-09T18:05:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	Is it a common problem?
2012-09-09T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	can be
2012-09-17T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	what make and model system?
2012-09-17T02:20:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	asus k53 laptop
2012-09-17T02:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	why was that not in the initial question?
2012-09-17T02:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	do you have the latest BIOS?
2012-09-17T02:22:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	I might not, but how can I know if 12.04 will support that?
2012-09-17T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	you may need a windows OS to do it :(. Check to see what fixes the newer BIOS gives. You may not need it if you get no ACPI fixes
2012-09-17T02:23:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	no thanks :)
2012-09-17T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	so, why didn't you mention the make and model of the system in the initial question?
2012-09-17T02:25:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	does it matter, I want to have a broad audience
2012-09-17T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	yes because it uniquely identifys the components in the system and we can also search for bugs for the model
2012-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	does it have a dual video chip? Intel and nvidia for example?
2012-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	Ok but now you know it right
2012-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	no ati
2012-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	if you run:  sudo lshw -C display    do you see an intel GPU too?
2012-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	I believe this Asus' model is k53U
2012-09-17T02:27:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	let me check
2012-09-17T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	good, that makes life a tonne easier
2012-09-17T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ozette_	try the boot option: acpi_backlight=vendor
2012-09-17T02:35:00.000Z	ozette_	ActionParsnip	ok
