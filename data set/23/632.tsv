2011-05-01T08:36:00.000Z	dtulchin	nit-wit	when i boot from the cd, i get options: try ubuntu, and install ubuntu...nothing about repairing ubuntu
2011-05-01T08:37:00.000Z	nit-wit	dtulchin	I thought it was fixed

2011-05-01T08:38:00.000Z	nit-wit	dtulchin	there is no real repair for a whole system, you may need to just back it up or use the UBuntu Forums to be honest I wont really touch it to many outlires
2011-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	dtulchin	nit-wit	thats dissapointing
2011-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	dtulchin	nit-wit	so my only other option is to reinstall an entire os?
2011-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	dtulchin	reload or wait for help that may not appear the IRC is sort of specialized for specifics, the forums may be motr helpful
