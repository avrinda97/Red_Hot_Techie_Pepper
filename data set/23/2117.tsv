2010-08-02T11:29:00.000Z	fabio__	scriptwarlock	nope. i try to use it and it returns some errors related to 'cpu_init'. when i try normal it just goes to a black screen, like when the monitor is off... and the keyboard on both ways goes off.

2010-08-02T11:33:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	if you have an iso of lucid try it with unetbootin
2010-08-02T11:34:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	oh, http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2010-08-02T11:34:00.000Z	fabio__	scriptwarlock	so basically i run ubuntu from windows ?
2010-08-02T11:35:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	if you mean wubi
2010-08-02T11:35:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	yes
2010-08-02T11:36:00.000Z	fabio__	scriptwarlock	so what should i do when using ubuntu with unetbootin ?
2010-08-02T11:37:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	download the unetbootin to your windows box and run it then preapare your lucid iso to put inside your mp3 player as we call it
2010-08-02T11:39:00.000Z	fabio__	scriptwarlock	okay... what if i get the same error? if i dont, what can i do once ubuntu is loaded? it is not going to load the previous one i installed, correct ?
2010-08-02T11:41:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	fabio__	we check if the errors are really the hardware if possible describe the error on that machine so we can analyse if its a hardware failure or what
