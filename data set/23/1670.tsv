2009-12-06T02:10:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	you making website ?
2009-12-06T02:10:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	installing phpbb3
2009-12-06T02:10:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	I am thinking that do you need just forums, or want to get some other functionality as well
2009-12-06T02:11:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	i need a database for the forums, guntbert: php already working, as is apache
2009-12-06T02:14:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	installing to a server machine, but remotely - no i have not installed phpmyadmin
2009-12-06T02:16:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	database is created on my mysql server using the mysql prompt - not being recognized by phpbb install.php - now installing phpmyadmin to see if it helps
2009-12-06T02:17:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	basically MySQL server install few databases for ROOT user, which aren't usually visible for others, so for them there is no database available
2009-12-06T02:17:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	ok, give me a minute to test this out using phpmyadmin, i'll get back to you, thanks for everything :)
2009-12-06T02:18:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	np, been running own server for while so got used to these things...
2009-12-06T02:18:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	you were correct, we have a winner, thanks :D
2009-12-06T02:20:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	sorry is there a command to tell me what my mysql username is? i forgot lol
2009-12-06T02:21:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	or what you mean ?
2009-12-06T02:21:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	that i can use for anything - the phpbb install needs the admin username + pass and i've forgotten the username
2009-12-06T02:22:00.000Z	furythor	Y_Guy	but normally I wonder why any install tool would need to have an root access if they install them self into single database
2009-12-06T02:22:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	yes, it was root
2009-12-06T02:22:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	thanks once again
2009-12-06T02:24:00.000Z	Y_Guy	furythor	no, its just configuring the server myself thats been a problem - i know phpbb quite well and now i've got it going i shoudl be fine, thanks :)
