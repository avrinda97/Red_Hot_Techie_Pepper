2012-05-03T15:12:00.000Z	shape		Hello, I just installed Ubuntu and Windows Xp wouldn't load from Grub. I ran Boot-Repair after installing it from the Live CD and now I can't see my windows partition at all and it doesn't appear in Grub.
2012-05-03T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	if you run:  sudo update-grub   does it show the XP OS?
2012-05-03T15:15:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	it doesn't appear there, just  linux image and initrd
2012-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	Windows doest, it will ALWAYS show folders first
2012-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	isn't it the same method?
2012-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	It only displays no.# of items in the folder, under "Size". Not the actual size in MB.
2012-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	http://imagecdn.maketecheasier.com/2009/08/gchrome-nautilus2.jpg   yes, 9.8Mb in that example
2012-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	I am asking if there is a way to see the folder size in MB under "Size" without clicking on properties.
2012-05-15T09:43:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	So I could sort them and see which one is taking the most space.
2012-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	you'll need something like: du --max-depth=1 /home/ | sort -n -r
2012-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	Oh, in command line, yes. But I cannot understand how Windows Explorer does it so easily yet Nautilus can;t?
2012-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	obviously change /home/    for the folder you want to query. E.g:  du --max-depth=1 /home/$USER/Downloads/ | sort -n -r

2012-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	if you click on the folder size tab you can easily sort by the size of the folder
2012-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	I'm on XP right NOW. I clicked view -> arrange icons by size and the folders are the top, then the files
2012-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	I think there is some miscommunication going on. Let's say Folder 1 is 20 MB, and Folder 2 is 500MB. I want to see this in Nautilus without having to click properties. Like in this picture here: http://windows.iusethis.com/screenshot/windows/foldersize.png
2012-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	shape in windows XP, the folders are not part of the arrangement, so if you have a file of 80Gb and a folder totalling 2Gb, the folder will always be top, as it is a folder
2012-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	yes, I understand that. I am not asking about the files. I just want to see the folder size. Here is a different picture: http://www.megaleecher.net/uploads/folder-size.jpg

2012-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I read that, and they are saying it's not possible :(
2012-05-15T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	you can't use Mozilla, it's a company...
2012-05-15T10:13:00.000Z	shape	ActionParsnip	firefox... don't be so picky :p
2012-05-15T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shape	its a skill
