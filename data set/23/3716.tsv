2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	testic		I am a new Ubuntu user and I am having problems ejecting a CD. I have pressed the eject button on the drive, I have right-clicked the cd-rom desktop item and chosen "eject", I have run the "eject" command, all to no avail. any help?
2008-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	try sudo eject
2008-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	sudo eject does nothing
2008-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	any error messages?
2008-03-13T23:38:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	no error messages at all
2008-03-13T23:39:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	weird.. it might be faster to just reboot and take out the cd then, but that won't show you why it's not ejecting.
2008-03-13T23:39:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	this is true, however I am currently downloading a big Ubuntu update and I was hoping to get some stuff done while I wait :)
2008-03-13T23:40:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	run dmesg | tail and see if there's any errors in there
2008-03-13T23:41:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	type mount and see where it's mounted
2008-03-13T23:41:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	dmesg shows a few errors that may have something to do with it, would you like me to paste them?
2008-03-13T23:41:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	the run sudo umount /media/mountpoint and that should give you more feedback.
2008-03-13T23:42:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	sure - pastebin

2008-03-13T23:43:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	do you only have one hard drive?
2008-03-13T23:44:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	there are 2 hard drives, though I am not sure if the second is mounted
2008-03-13T23:44:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	just mount
2008-03-13T23:44:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	if you pipe it to grep you might miss it
2008-03-13T23:45:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	well I tried just mount, and it doesnt show anything that looks like a cd drive
2008-03-13T23:45:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	those errors from your pastebin is cdrom errors afaik
2008-03-13T23:47:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	Here is the output from mount, if its of any use: http://pastebin.com/dc45004b
2008-03-13T23:48:00.000Z	ScorpKing	testic	yeah it's not mounted and must be hdb then. i'm not sure if eject has a force option. seems like you will have to wait until you reboot
2008-03-13T23:48:00.000Z	testic	ScorpKing	well OK then, I have about 20 minutes to wait for this upgrade, I will get the CD out then, thanks anyway
