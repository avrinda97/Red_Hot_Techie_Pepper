2006-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	zim	jrib	ty how to i stop it ending the script at that point
2006-11-30T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	zim	write more stuff after it?  Not sure what you mean
2006-11-30T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	zim	you should be able to just write another command below it
2006-11-30T07:46:00.000Z	zim	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34882/
2006-11-30T07:48:00.000Z	zim	jrib	you there
2006-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	zim	yes, I'm not really sure why.  To me it seems like it should work.  A dedicated scripting channel like #bash might be able to help you better
2006-11-30T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	zim	k well, if you change "ftp $FTP_SERVER" to "cat" does it go all the way through?
2010-11-21T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	zim	does logrotate use ctime?
2010-11-21T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	zim	use "touch"
2010-11-21T17:10:00.000Z	zim	jrib	touch cant do cdate all the other just not cdate
2010-11-21T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	zim	so?
2010-11-21T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	zim	google offers one way: change system time, make a new hard link, remove it, change system time back
2010-11-21T17:16:00.000Z	zim	jrib	I saw that but its a production server so dont want to dick with the time :-(
2010-11-21T17:17:00.000Z	jrib	zim	I don't know how to change ctime, use a test system would be my suggestion
