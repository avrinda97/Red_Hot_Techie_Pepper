2006-03-23T06:49:00.000Z	captine		the connection is through inn-connections.com
2006-03-23T06:50:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	you running your distribution out of a hotel room?
2006-03-23T06:51:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	I've booted the live cd
2006-03-23T06:51:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	would love to buy a laptop and load it, but got no cash for that
2006-03-23T06:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	get an old clunker and stick it in a corner down cellar
2006-03-23T06:52:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	i don't understand.  Do you mean a second hand laptop?
2006-03-23T06:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	or old desktop, they're easier to find
2006-03-23T06:53:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	can't take an old desktop back to south africa with me.  Will take up too much space.  Would ubuntu install and run off an external hdd
2006-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	I believe so, you just would have to be able to boot it
2006-03-23T06:55:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	why not stick with the livecd?
2006-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	cos i cant download apps or update :)  Ideally, i think i will just d/l all the apps i want and install them on my desktop back home
2006-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	i.e. i want tv time etc
2006-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	remote control of your home desktop isn't an option?
2006-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	south africa is extremely expensive in terms of internet connectivity.  Dont have a connection at home
2006-03-23T06:58:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	would love to set that up eventually
2006-03-23T06:58:00.000Z	jimcooncat	captine	I'd think about a secondhand thinkpad then
2006-03-23T06:58:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	I'm in Detroit for 1 more week for work, then to Miami for a week.  Where would be the best place to get one?
2006-03-23T06:59:00.000Z	captine	jimcooncat	ebay?
