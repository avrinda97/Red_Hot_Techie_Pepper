2008-07-30T22:43:00.000Z	imbehind		Hello all, need help with owerwritten mbr by windows.
2008-07-30T22:44:00.000Z	imbehind		boot/grub/menu.lst is cofigured but grub is overwritten with ntloader
2008-07-30T22:44:00.000Z	imbehind		what is the quickes way to repair?
2008-07-30T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	follow the RecoveringUbuntu... instructions ^^
2008-07-30T22:47:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	my boot/grub/menu.lst is configured, i don't want to doit again, it seems to me that described solution overwrites it. or not?
2008-07-30T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	no
2008-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	do you know is the mbr overwritten if i restore image of 0,0? (Acronis true image)
2008-07-30T22:51:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	I'm not familiar with that software, but I wouldn't expect it to if you explicitly ask to restore only the partition
2008-07-30T23:34:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	i did it. tx
2008-07-30T23:35:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	well done
2008-07-30T23:36:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	i had one annomaly configurin grub. want to hear about it?
2008-07-30T23:37:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	please
2008-07-30T23:38:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	grub documentation asks for using map for remaping partition, and thats what during automatic install was done for me (i have 4 hdds)...
2008-07-30T23:39:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	root (hd2,0)
2008-07-30T23:39:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	thats where my other sys resides (winxp)
2008-07-30T23:40:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	but its not working that way
2008-07-30T23:40:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	yeah, multiple disks and BIOS/OS misunderstandings happen quite often
2008-07-30T23:40:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	must be set  to root (hd0,0), and it works then without remap
2008-07-30T23:41:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	bios playing smart eh?
2008-07-30T23:41:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	thanks alot (im in ubuntu right now)
2008-07-30T23:42:00.000Z	soundray	imbehind	well, I don't know whether any party can be blamed -- some BIOSes have an option you can set to influence the timing of drives starting up
2008-07-30T23:44:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	winxp is on hd2,0 btw i have 4hdds and 13 partitions and im glad that everithing is ok now
2008-07-30T23:45:00.000Z	imbehind	soundray	thanks again
