2010-04-29T05:26:00.000Z	Sp0t		that's a point
2010-04-29T05:26:00.000Z	Sp0t		but there are flies already
2010-04-29T05:27:00.000Z	Sp0t		don't know powertool08, will ask one
2010-04-29T05:27:00.000Z	Sp0t		in this country I see them eating big butterflies and even small birds
2010-04-29T05:28:00.000Z	Sp0t		I guess those are tastier than mosquitos
2010-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	powertool08: Can we keep #ubuntu clear for support questions? You can chat in #ubuntu-offtopic or #ubuntu-release-party .  Thanks :)
2010-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	This is freenode.
2010-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	yes I know but I am here now webbased..
2010-05-14T05:58:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	I have Xchat running, freenode is in the serverlist, connecting to it won't do
2010-05-14T05:59:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	What happens when you try?
2010-05-14T06:00:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	Connection failed. Error: Connection timed out
2010-05-14T06:01:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	Are there any errors in the server tab?
2010-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	not really, just connection timed out
2010-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	it says Cycling to next server in Freenode...
2010-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	Does it say what port you are trying to connect with?
2010-05-14T06:04:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	6667
2010-05-14T06:04:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	Can you connect to any other irc servers with xchat?
2010-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	You may want to ask in #freenode then.  I see your IP in a few blacklists, but I'm not sure which ones they use nor am I sure what error you will get when you try to connect with that sort of problem.
2010-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	Pici	Sp0t	http://www.robtex.com/ip/125.27.108.80.html#blacklists specifically.
2010-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	irc.spotchat.org is no problem, connects flawless for example
2010-05-14T06:07:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	thanks will ask there
2010-05-14T06:08:00.000Z	Sp0t	Pici	funny detail is that the smuxi client connects to freenode without troubles
