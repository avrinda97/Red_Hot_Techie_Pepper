2005-10-19T10:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	meepus	im having a hell of a time getting more than 40kB/s and im on 3mbps cable - even on the brezy torrent I only get 30-40
2005-10-19T10:08:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	meepus	got any advice for me to improve my BT download speed in azureus?
2005-10-19T10:09:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	meepus	it isnt, im throttling my upspeed but that shouldnt make any difference
2005-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	meepus	download is usually at 40, and will occasionally go as high as 60

2005-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	meepus	ColonelKernel	uncap your upspeed just to be safe, but also make sure you're the DMZ host
2005-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	meepus	ColonelKernel	go to http://192.168.1.1 then go to applications and gaming, and go to the DMZ submenu
2005-10-19T10:23:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	meepus	whats the apt command to upgrade - apt-get dist-upgrade?
