2009-06-29T01:58:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson		how do I install pppoeconf from a 9.04 cdrom?  I cannot access the internet at the moment
2009-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	you using Gnome or at a terminal?
2009-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	I can use either.  I tried sudo apt-cdrom add, and it said it could not find the cdrom
2009-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	it gnome ppp is installed already
2009-06-29T02:01:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	No, it will not connect to my dsl modem
2009-06-29T02:01:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	DLS modem does not use pppoe (that's the dialup program)
2009-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	double click on your network icon on the menu bar
2009-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	I cannot.  I am in Windows because I have no net access
2009-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	click "enable networking"
2009-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	I did all that.  I set my username and password.
2009-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	did you install ubuntu?
2009-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	yes, via wubi
2009-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	oh wubi!  wubi= BAD!
2009-06-29T02:06:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	so, never mind trying then, correct?
2009-06-29T02:06:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	wait
2009-06-29T02:07:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/56844 - part way down are instructions to disabling IPV6
2009-06-29T02:10:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	ok, but will I still need to install pppoeconf?
2009-06-29T02:23:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	that ipv6 solution did not work, so I rebooted from the live CD and all works just fine with the modem.  Even my keyboard was not working correctly under a Wubi install.  I guess that was not the way to go.  No I have to figure out how to uninstall the Wubi installation and dual boot with Vista
2009-06-29T02:23:00.000Z	mdg	JorgeJorgesson	I think you can uninstall wubi like a regular window program - control panel, remove software
2009-06-29T02:24:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	mdg	yeah, I thought so.  I'll give it a shot.  Hopefully it does not hurt my Vista installation.  I'm not ready to wipe it off quite yet.
