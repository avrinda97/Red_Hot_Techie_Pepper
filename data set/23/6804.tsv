2005-12-26T13:23:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	how odd, I have ethereal open right now!
2005-12-26T13:23:00.000Z	korhalf	Eleaf	for that, you can make netcat listen on port 22.
2005-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	how do you listen using ethereal so new packets show up in the window, so that you don't have to stop the capture to show the packets? = p
2005-12-26T13:29:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	.. lol
2005-12-26T13:30:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	what is troubling you with ethereal?

2005-12-26T13:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	are you capturing anything?
2005-12-26T13:34:00.000Z	korhalf	Eleaf	nope, 0
2005-12-26T13:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	are you pressing start new live capture?
2005-12-26T13:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	have you selected the device as eth0 ?
2005-12-26T13:36:00.000Z	korhalf	Eleaf	that only captures packets inbound and outbound on MY machine
2005-12-26T13:36:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	shouldn't it be picking up all packets on the network? I know you can do this..
2005-12-26T13:37:00.000Z	Eleaf	korhalf	I figured it out
2005-12-26T13:37:00.000Z	korhalf	Eleaf	okay

2005-12-26T13:39:00.000Z	korhalf	Eleaf	no, its too complex and retarded, i just want to know how to do this, i dont want to learn TCP/IP and socket programming
