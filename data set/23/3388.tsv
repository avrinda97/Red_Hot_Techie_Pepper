2008-06-02T20:16:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	does it work with 3d games
2008-06-02T20:18:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	so far as i have seen, a chipset of yours with 128 or 256M VRAM is the best for any linux, no matter what 3D in what setup you run
2008-06-02T20:18:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	How do I find how much ram on video card again?
2008-06-02T20:19:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	system->hardware Information
2008-06-02T20:20:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	you mean systems>> hardware testing?
2008-06-02T20:20:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	no.
2008-06-02T20:20:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	vlt, can u pls wait for a minute?
2008-06-02T20:21:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	sure my friend.  I have a well of infinite patience.  Thanks for your help! =)
2008-06-02T20:23:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	System->Admin->Hardware Drivers
2008-06-02T20:24:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	it shows no propreitary drivers on the system.
2008-06-02T20:25:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	Thats y i told you that intels driver is so far the best as far as i know
2008-06-02T20:26:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	is there no way to enable it without downloading the driver and recompiling the kernel.  Like with ATI/NVida drivers?
2008-06-02T20:26:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	the driver is already supplied by default, what problem did you find? you dont need to do that stuff.
2008-06-02T20:27:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	I will try again with a few games and let you know.  Thanx man
2008-06-02T20:28:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	you can also check your bios settings. in many cases, even though a card may have 128 mb only 64 may be enabled due to know reason that i know. that will also help you.
2008-06-02T20:28:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	I will do that too.
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	thanks man
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	It works fine now.  But I disabled Desktop Effects just in case bcuz it gave me problems in 7.x
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	sriramoman	sparkyy	i envy ur card.
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	sparkyy	sriramoman	don't it sux. lol
