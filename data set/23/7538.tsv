2005-07-03T14:12:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	what output do you expect mkinitrd to produce?
2005-07-03T14:13:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	man mkinitrd
2005-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	fuck a bitch
2005-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	i have red it many TIME
2005-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	then run the command correctly
2005-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	close, but not quite
2005-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	-o
2005-07-03T14:15:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	i have tried a lot of combinations, i have read many times on ubuntu forums MKINITRD IS BROKEN. YOU MUST USE K
2005-07-03T14:15:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	funny, it works fine for me, you must be the problem
2005-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	have you other kernel than 2.6.10-5-386?
2005-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	or do you have standart kernel?
2005-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	I use the nice working kernels that ubuntu provides, why would I do anything else?
2005-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	have you tried it with kernel 2.6.10 or 2.6.12.1?
2005-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	OMG
2005-07-03T14:17:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	I AM LKM DEVELOPER I NEED THE NEWEST KERNEL
2005-07-03T14:17:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	now that is a scary thought
2005-07-03T14:17:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	any other version than 2.6.10-5-386 is not WORKING
2005-07-03T14:18:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	maybe because ubuntu made that kernel, and not you?
2005-07-03T14:18:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	OMG
2005-07-03T14:19:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	i have used typicall scenario to creating kernel. its working on all other linux
2005-07-03T14:20:00.000Z	justin	korCZiz	because you don't know how to build a kernel properly?
2005-07-03T14:20:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	OMG
2005-07-03T14:21:00.000Z	korCZiz	justin	i have done it many time
