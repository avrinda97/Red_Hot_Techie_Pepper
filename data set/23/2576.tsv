2009-01-24T18:06:00.000Z	syockit		why won't you people c++  instead?
2009-01-24T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	topic for a different channel
2009-01-30T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	what is a "mime editor"?
2009-01-30T18:25:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	for editing applications used for certain MIME types
2009-01-30T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	it does
2009-01-30T18:26:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	no general one, to edit many at once?
2009-01-30T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	oh.  Not that I know of.  Though if you could highlight multiple files and use the nautilus procedure, that might be handy
2009-02-18T06:43:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	what about \/ ?
2009-02-18T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	no (i think)
2009-12-11T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	what *exactly* are you trying to accomplish?
2009-12-11T17:40:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	I have texlive installed in /usr/local/texlive, and since it's not in PATH of root, I can't just sudo it without typing the whole path
2009-12-11T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	1) isn't texlive in the repositories?  2) why would you want to sudo it anyway?
2009-12-11T17:42:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	I'm using texlive 2009. (2) because the texhash and mktexlsr cannot make changes to /usr/local dirs without su
2009-12-11T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	I'm pretty sure texlive 2009 is properly packaged for ubuntu somewhere (ppa or site page, don't remember)
2009-12-11T17:43:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	will look for it
2009-12-11T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	the answer to your question though is in « man sudoers », ubuntu uses secure_path with sudo
2009-12-11T17:45:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	oh thanks. but will try to look for other solutions, since you guys seem to think I'm probably doing it the wrong way. why do I have to sudo anyway...
2009-12-11T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	because you're putting files in /usr/local/ so only root can make changes there.  You could instead use ~/.texmf-config/ when adding a new class like I do
2009-12-11T17:48:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	but what is ~/texmf is for then? I just want to add custom packages
2009-12-11T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	I believe you can also use ~/texmf as well, there are several places tex looks
2009-12-11T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	it's usually next to PrintScreen
2009-12-11T17:58:00.000Z	syockit	jrib	it's got no pause/sysrq for that matter. The keycode for the magic thing is compiled in kernel, right?
2009-12-11T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	syockit	don't know
