2007-07-22T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	remove (with --purge) libapache2-mod-php5 and then reinstall it
2007-07-22T12:24:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	problem is that my sources.list aint working, I can't apt-get update - I only get errors, it has worked before
2007-07-22T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	Well, lets address that issue then.  What errors do you get?
2007-07-22T12:25:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	tons of errors - the links doesnt seem to work. I googled it up, and others seems to have the same problem
2007-07-22T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	pastebin the errors
2007-07-22T12:27:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30755/
2007-07-22T12:28:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	and this is my sources.list -- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30756/
2007-07-22T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	Ah.  You're using breezy.  Try switching back to the ubuntu repos, although I don't know if breezy repos are up anymore.  Breezy EOL was a few months ago
2007-07-22T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	you really ought to upgrade
2007-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	Erm, you also shouldn't have those hoary errors.  Especially since they're not in your sources.list, you must have those in some other place.
2007-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	but, that's the reason you can't upgrade any, because I don't think those repos are open anymore
2007-07-22T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	I'm not sure it's going to be possible.  Check your package cache (/var/cache/apt/ and see if libapache2-mod-php5 is in there.  Although, oddly enough, I can't figure out which package contains it (even though I have it on my system right now)
2007-07-22T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	check /usr/share/php5/ there might be a copy of it there
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	actually yes, I think that's where it comes from, which is why it's not in the dpkg cache.  That file should be what you're looking for
2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	You really should schedule some downtime and upgrade to dapper though.  I took the plunge in february, since I didn't want to cut it too close.
2007-07-22T12:38:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	It's just a dev server anyways, I'm gonna run debian sarge in the future -- and I cannot access this server if it crashes, I can but I don't want to (kinda hard to explain the situtation im in)
2007-07-22T10:59:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	You can't apt-get anything because the repos for 5.10 (which is breezy, hoary is 5.04) don't exist anymore.
2007-07-22T11:01:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	well, dapper isnt working well with game-servers.
2007-07-22T11:02:00.000Z	warlocky	Flannel	Mind joining a channel so we can chat for a sec? I'm geting confused by all the text in here
2007-07-22T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	warlocky	sure, join #ubuntu-classroom
