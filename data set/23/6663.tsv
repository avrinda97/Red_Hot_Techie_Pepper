2006-02-21T12:14:00.000Z	Christopher		is it a lengthy process to get a usb hd recognized so i can access the media on it?
2006-02-21T12:15:00.000Z	b1ind	Christopher	it got autodetected for me
2006-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	did something show you it was autodetected as soon as you plugged it in
2006-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	b1ind		don't remember, but if you're using gnome, check in the places menu for a XXgb volume
2006-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	nope using FLUX
2006-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	b1ind		check /media
2006-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	b1ind	Christopher	for me, its /media/usbdisk/
2006-02-21T12:19:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	i dont know how to check /media
2006-02-21T12:19:00.000Z	b1ind		ahh, hmm
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	Christopher		wait
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	nmd i do
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	b1ind		is it there?
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	but it doesnt list a usbdisk
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	b1ind		hmm, then i'm outta my league :(
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	Christopher		just cdrom and floppy
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	b1ind		sorry Christopher
2006-02-21T12:21:00.000Z	b1ind		iirc's lesser known sibling
2006-02-21T12:22:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	i know it shows up in GNOME no problem.. pops right up on the desktop
2006-02-21T12:23:00.000Z	b1ind	Christopher	might have to do w/ dbus and hal... maybe somewhere to look
2006-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	what are those?
2006-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	b1ind		they are some things for hardware abstraction and 'i think' hardware autodetection
2006-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	b1ind		like i said, im probably not the best person to help you
2006-02-21T12:27:00.000Z	Christopher	b1ind	 thanks anyways
