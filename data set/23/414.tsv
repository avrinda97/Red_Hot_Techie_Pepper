2011-09-28T12:41:00.000Z	conntrack-		why would IP be fragmenting between two machines?
2011-09-28T12:41:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	mtu problem? bad switch?
2011-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	IP, you mean tcp?
2011-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	Yes
2011-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	what do you mean be fragmenting?
2011-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	it is normal, that packages are fragmented and build up later
2011-09-28T12:43:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	The checksum is incorrect
2011-09-28T12:43:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	oha! meaning it gets broken?
2011-09-28T12:44:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	I guess so. I don't actually know :)
2011-09-28T12:44:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	what is your usecase? you are just copying files?
2011-09-28T12:44:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	Browsing
2011-09-28T12:44:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	A have set a ttl 255 though
2011-09-28T12:45:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	Could that be why?
2011-09-28T12:45:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	no, this just means 255 hobs between you and target
2011-09-28T12:45:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	why did you change that setting?
2011-09-28T12:45:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	do you have packet loss when doing ping?
2011-09-28T12:46:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	Not now :)
2011-09-28T12:46:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	sorry, cannot really get your problem
2011-09-28T12:46:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	The thing is that the fragmented packets appear to evidence the firewall
2011-09-28T12:47:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	you mangle them in your firewall?
2011-09-28T12:47:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	No
2011-09-28T12:47:00.000Z	fritsch	conntrack-	iptables -F and retry without
2011-09-28T12:53:00.000Z	conntrack-	fritsch	Didn't help. Thanks for taking the time to think about the issue :) I look into it later
