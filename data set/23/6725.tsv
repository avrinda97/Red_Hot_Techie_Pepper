2006-01-19T06:30:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		My god.. Totem truely really sucks! It won't even let me setup deinterlacing options for the xine engine? Egawds man! What happened to gnome?
2006-01-19T06:32:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	use whatever suits your needs. I use mplayer and beep-media-player
2006-01-19T06:33:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	Yeah. I know. I was just wanting to see where gnome has gone throughout the years I haven't used even Linux. And quite frankly, I'm very displeased with gnome.
2006-01-19T06:33:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	me and Linus too
2006-01-19T06:33:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	but we don'g wanna start that in here :)
2006-01-19T06:34:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	did you read this http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html ?
2006-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	Wow...
2006-01-19T06:37:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	I'm quite pleased to read those words, coming from Linus himself. "Please, just tell people to use KDE."
2006-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	He's always liked statements with an attitude though :|
2006-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	Heh. He's a very blunt man. Kinda makes me wonder if he's a Capricorn like myself. :)
2006-01-19T06:44:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	only if thing is using gstreamer
2006-01-19T06:45:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	Personally I gave up on gstreamer for now because it's not integrated very well with kde apps by now
2006-01-19T06:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	I despise gstreamer, so far. It's horrible. IMHO of course. :)
2006-01-19T06:46:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	Actually it looks like a very promising api. kde is going to switch to using it as well I read somewhere
2006-01-19T06:46:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	but it's annoying when it doen't work
2006-01-19T06:46:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	which is all the time for me
2006-01-19T06:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	Yeah. Heh.. Ditto for me, so far, too.
2006-01-19T06:47:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	kde?
2006-01-19T06:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mwe	Oh.. No, gstreamer. KDE works perfectly for me.
2006-01-19T06:47:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	yeah
2006-01-19T06:47:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	i mean are you using it in kde
2006-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	scary aint it? :)
2006-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	mwe	Psi-Jack	konversation is better. irssi beats them all though :)
