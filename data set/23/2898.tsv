2011-03-13T18:54:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne		Hey guys, is there any way to call a python script automatically when we log in?
2011-03-13T18:54:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	you can pretty much put anything in System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications
2011-03-13T18:54:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	It doesn't work like that.. I don't know why
2011-03-13T18:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	make sure you set +x (executable) on that script
2011-03-13T18:55:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	It is already
2011-03-13T18:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	does script has #!/usr/bin/env python as frist line?
2011-03-13T18:56:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	It's not my coding.. let me check for that Shebang
2011-03-13T18:56:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	ok,
2011-03-13T18:57:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	what should I write in the command section?
2011-03-13T18:58:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	python /path/to/script.py
2011-03-13T19:01:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	I'll be back after reboot.. I presume this will work..
2011-03-13T19:01:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	ok ;D
2011-03-13T19:09:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	Thanks.. :D It worked just fine..
2011-03-13T19:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	np
2011-03-13T19:13:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	how do you connect?
2011-03-13T19:14:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	By that network applet
2011-03-13T19:16:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	well, making a script is easy... problem is how to connect, pppoeconf does that but I have no idea how it works
2011-03-13T19:17:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	yeah.. that's the main problem
2011-03-13T19:17:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	disconnecting should be easy...
2011-03-13T19:19:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	how?
2011-03-13T19:20:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	check what Yoinx said, I didn't know of those commands
2011-03-13T19:20:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	MeanEYE	thanks.. :D
2011-03-13T19:20:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Bruce_Wayne	no problem... first step is creating script that will restart connection, then I'll help make cron job
