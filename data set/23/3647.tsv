2008-03-13T20:19:00.000Z	Scunizi		Weird Problem :/ ... ONLY Evolution has lost its window decorations and stretches itself to cover the top and bottom task bars. How do I fix or diagnose this problem?
2008-03-13T20:20:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	rightclick the bottom on evolution, then click resize, make it smaller, then rightclick again, and select move ...... you can use your arrow keys both time to resize/move it.
2008-03-13T20:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	the "bottom" of evo doesn't show anymore.. rightclicking doesn't give me those options
2008-03-13T20:22:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	even lower then that ... the taskbar ...
2008-03-13T20:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	the task bar is gone when evo has focus
2008-03-13T20:22:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	then unfocus evolution and then rightclick
2008-03-13T20:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	nope.. when focused on xchat task bar reappears but doesn't give control of evo's state.. the real issue is the window decorations are missing on evo..
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	you mean you can't just rightclick on the button thingy on the taskbar for evo?
2008-03-13T20:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	that's the point.. there is no normal bottom thingy because the window decorations (boarder) are missing.
2008-03-13T20:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	no maximize, minimize or close icons in the top right and same type of bar on the bottom
2008-03-13T20:27:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	i've had the issue before, but i forgot how i resolved that ....
2008-03-13T20:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	it's not compiz --replace as that effects the entire system.. must be something more specific.
2008-04-06T05:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	cool.. that just made using irssi much easier. :)
2008-04-06T05:15:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	it's mainly that i have a headache and could use some oversight :P
2008-04-06T05:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	must be contagious.. me too.. bad ear.. allergies.. etc..
2008-04-06T05:17:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	well standing about 4 meters from a speaker at a festival is a bad way to get it
2008-04-06T05:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	ouch
2008-04-06T05:21:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	alright thanks.
2008-04-06T05:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	how is pastbinit used from terminal? and does it default to the mentioned pastebin listed for this channel?
2008-04-06T05:28:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	the default pastebin is not this one unfortunately as for some reason it's incompatible so far. However it works by piping it info from a command. Try to cat a file and then add | pastebinit
2008-04-06T05:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	hischild	then how do you get a link?. I'll try.
2008-04-06T05:29:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	that's what it gives you.
2008-12-22T04:51:00.000Z	hischild	Scunizi	he can't login ... lol
