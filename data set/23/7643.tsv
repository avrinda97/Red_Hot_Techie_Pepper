2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	whyameye		confused about adding users and groups. I wanted to add user 'radio' to group 'audio'. How would I do this? What ended up happening is that I added user 'radio' to group 'radio.' How do I undo this?
2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	sudo adduser radio audio
2005-12-14T06:17:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	and "sudo deluser radio radio"
2005-12-14T06:17:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	I tried that first, and I got adduser: The user `radio' does not exist.
2005-12-14T06:17:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	does user 'radio' exist?
2005-12-14T06:18:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	I tried the deluser commmand and it is telling me I cannot remove the user from his/her primary group...
2005-12-14T06:18:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	ok.  user radio is in group radio by default.
2005-12-14T06:18:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	you don't need to remove it
2005-12-14T06:19:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	like user whyameye is in group whyameye by default, too
2005-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	I don't know either.  did you create the user first, then try to add them to the group?  if you didn't create the user first, that'll be whyt.
2005-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	yes I didn't create the user first. So how would I have done that, just so I know?
2005-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	just "sudo adduser radio"
2005-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	or use the gui, of course...
2005-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	so I should have typed "sudo adduser radio" then typed "sudo adduser radio audio"?
2005-12-14T06:24:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	that's about the size of it, yes.
2005-12-14T06:24:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	try it now with "radio2" instead of "radio" for practice :)
2005-12-14T06:25:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	thanks I just tried with radio2 and it worked great! Thanks!
2005-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	now you can "man deluser" to find out how to get rid of 'radio2' and his home directory in a single command...
2005-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	"sudo deluser radio2" will leave his home directory by default
2005-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	oops, I already did "sudo deluser radio2." I can just delete the home directory manually?
2005-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	sure
2005-12-14T06:28:00.000Z	whyameye	dooglus	done! Thanks!
2005-12-14T06:28:00.000Z	dooglus	whyameye	"deluser" has an option to make a backup on the home dir before deleting it too
