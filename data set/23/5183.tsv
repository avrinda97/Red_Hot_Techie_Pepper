2007-02-28T08:32:00.000Z	billy		how do you put a file browser launcher in the panel?
2007-02-28T08:33:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	you can just drag and drop from Places menu
2007-02-28T08:36:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	I think if you change the command in the launcher properties to "nautilus /" it will go there
2007-02-28T08:37:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	rbil_ :thanks.  works perfectly.
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	GPU means graphics processing unit, graphics adapter, graphics card, etc
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	foutrelis: thank u.
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	the things you might need drivers for are graphics card and wireless, most everthing else is supported on its own.  If your display is jerky or low resolution then you might need to install some different non-open source drivers
2007-03-05T11:31:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	does it not scale up?
2007-03-05T11:32:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	scales fine, it seems, but the 'range' seems a bit high.  2.4 GHz is lowest it'll go.
2007-03-05T11:33:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	i'm not sure how to change the stepping on that.
2007-03-05T11:34:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	 so long as wouldn't create a problem.  i was concerned that it may indicate some problem with the driver.
2007-03-07T13:48:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	yes
2007-03-07T13:49:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	Minibnz: thank you.  for some reason fstab didn't have this default.  wonder why.
2007-03-07T13:49:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	because the drive isnt mounted, the disks in it are mounted when you put them in
2007-03-10T15:33:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	hose the system if you want, i could use some entertainment
2007-03-10T15:39:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	: at least you acknowledge your comment was immature.  deal?
2007-03-10T15:40:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	: I just don't want my friend to have to chase down script that scattered across the internet everytime she wants to watch some movie on the internet or listen to some new music filetype.  That's all.
2007-03-10T15:41:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	: and any comment from a tree would be most mature.
2007-03-10T15:42:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	im immature like a fox.  I spent like 5 minutes installing codecs right after I installed and I haven't run into anything I couldnt play since.
2007-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	well, ive been using linux since the 90s, but it was my first time using ubuntu.
2007-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	: the person to whom I'm sending this installation CD doesn't even know what a command line is.  Are you beginning to see what I'm getting at?
2007-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	shatrat	billy	talk them through setting up a ssh access for you on the box :D
2007-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	billy	shatrat	: now there's a good idea.
