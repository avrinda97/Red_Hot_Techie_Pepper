2010-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	KE1HA		8.04 --> 10.04: Never seen a distro UPG go without a hitch. If 10.04 is the goal, better off doing a fresh install.
2010-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	i have. it depends how much 3rd party stuff you install though
2010-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	the default runlevel in ubuntu (and i think debian as well) is 2
2010-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	youre wrong
2010-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	2-5 are the same. 1 is single user
2010-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	was quoting from Debian Admin, so if it's wrong, I too and mistaken.
2010-07-29T08:54:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	check it out. type "runlevel" in a shell. you should be on 2
2010-07-29T08:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	not disputing it, jsut wanted to read about it, is this doc incorrect then? : http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-and-ubuntu-linux-run-levels.html
2010-08-12T07:55:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	annie using ssh to make a SOCKSv5 proxy
2010-08-22T21:38:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 here's a list of tools for testing just about anything on the box: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/tooltable.php
2010-08-26T13:26:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 IS THAT NOMODSET 1 OR 0  though I can't remember.
2010-08-26T13:26:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	1
2010-08-26T13:27:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	well actually....
2010-08-26T13:27:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	i think its i915.modeset=0  ... not nomodeset
2010-08-28T00:43:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 I just did a quick test. If you set no format on /home and for/root (/) /home is left in tack as was, and all fies on the root partition are new.
2010-08-28T00:44:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 so if he wants a new install basically, format /  and no format /home
2010-08-28T00:45:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	or from the live cd, manually delete /usr, /etc, and /var, then do a non-formatting reinstall
2010-08-28T00:45:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	the thing is that his /home isnt a separate partition
2010-08-28T00:46:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 Hmmmm, well now that's an issue. I'll have to test that to see how it reacts.
2010-08-28T00:47:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	non-formatting reinstall to save /home has been an option for a few years now, but i dont know if anything is left behind. when devs mention this on ubuntu-devel mailing list, they said it as "doesnt delete /home" but they didnt mention whether everything *else* is deleted... and so now thats the question
2010-08-28T00:48:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 yes, maybe that's something we should added to testing, will have a play in VM and see how things come out.
2010-08-28T00:49:00.000Z	maco	KE1HA	the lazier thing to do would be to read the installer's code
2010-08-28T00:49:00.000Z	KE1HA	maco	 Tthat hurt my head just thinking about it :-)
