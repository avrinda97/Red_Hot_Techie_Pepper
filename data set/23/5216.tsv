2007-04-29T16:06:00.000Z	SecrethX		I keep getting this xsession error, and when I press OK, my x will restart and reprocude the error. Someone knows a way out? :S (im now upgrading to gutsy, see if that fixes it)
2007-04-29T16:08:00.000Z	SecrethX		yea
2007-04-29T16:08:00.000Z	SecrethX		nvm

2007-04-29T16:08:00.000Z	SecrethX		bye
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	SecrethX		I have a problem with my Xorg. When I log in, it gives an error that the previous session lasted less than 10 seconds. When I press ok, it will restart, and give the same error. Any suggestions?

2007-04-29T14:44:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	gutsy doesn't have a new xorg yet, and it will break much more then just xorg if you don't watch out.
2007-04-29T14:45:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	I know
2007-04-29T14:45:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	when you log in? Are you having xorg problems, or gnome problems?
2007-04-29T14:46:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	only xorg problems. It produces an error report but I cant get wise out of that one, I checked every error, wait ill pastebin it
2007-04-29T14:47:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	here is the error report http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18280/
2007-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	sry, no idea at all.
2007-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	try the forums, has a larger user base.
2007-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	ok will do.
2007-04-29T14:51:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	doesn't seem like a xorg crash though, I think gnome is just acting up. renaming the gnome dirs in you home directory might straighten that out.
2007-04-29T14:51:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	its worth a try, how do I do that?
2007-04-29T14:52:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	log into a shell. cntr-alt-f5 or something. then rename .gnome and .gnome2 folders
2007-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	I say rename because it's the same as deleting them without actually losing the option to place it back when it has no effect.
2007-04-29T15:00:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	thanks a LOT man! :)
2007-04-29T15:00:00.000Z	finalbeta	SecrethX	yeah, I figured it was a gnome error and that usually works then. All gnome settings are lost though... I don't know what exactly caused the problem.
2007-04-29T15:01:00.000Z	SecrethX	finalbeta	I dont have any custom gnome settings or whatsoever, only my session is lost. And I think I know the problem; I sometimes use 'Inhibernate' as a shutdown option, but last time it failed, and then all this came ;)
