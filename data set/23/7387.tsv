2005-08-12T13:29:00.000Z	logical_mark		Hey guys. I just used Synaptic Package Manager to install Pure-FTP Server. I restarted gnome-panel but I still cant find the launcher for the program
2005-08-12T13:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	it may not have it
2005-08-12T13:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	some programs don't
2005-08-12T13:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	if it is a server, it is a probably a command-line thing
2005-08-12T13:31:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	you need an ftp server or client?
2005-08-12T13:31:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	most servers on linux do not have guis for very good reasons
2005-08-12T13:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	no idea, I have never set up a ftp server
2005-08-12T13:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	why not just use sharing?
2005-08-12T13:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	shouldn't be
2005-08-12T13:36:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	also why? I have heard a lot od people say not to reccomend it but dont knwo why
2005-08-12T13:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	see the above statement by ubotu
2005-08-12T13:37:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	that is true. I have found that I am always asking myself why it is having me do what i am doing
2005-08-12T13:38:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	should I use Samba or NFS to setup sharing?
2005-08-12T13:39:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	samba, if you have windows friends
2005-08-12T13:40:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	all my friends run windows. As a matter of fact the reasson I am trying to get into linux is b/c I want to get into network security and a lot of IT stuff. Everyone I talk to says Learn LInux and C
2005-08-12T13:40:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	you can do network security on windows, it is not pretty (I have an MCP, for the record)
2005-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	MCP?
2005-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	Microsoft Certified Professional (Windows 2000 server)
2005-08-12T13:42:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	knowledge of both is useful. You will get more money by doing linux stuff
2005-08-12T13:42:00.000Z	logical_mark	Burgundavia	I am still in high school guys so I have a lot of time to learn, but i like to be ahead
2005-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	Free Software Foundation. Basically started the whole Free Software/OSS thing
2005-08-12T13:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	logical_mark	to boil it down, the FSF don't like the term Open source
