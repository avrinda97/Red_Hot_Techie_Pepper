2011-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	Younder		In fact the  non-configurablebillity of 11.10 is annoying
2011-10-25T13:16:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 really???? like how , and what way?
2011-10-25T13:16:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	Like I would like to disable the guest account and can't
2011-10-25T13:17:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 im guessing do it like the 10.04 versions
2011-10-25T13:19:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	You would be wrong, This account is created in /tmp. so disabling guest has no effect
2011-10-25T13:21:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 i said its a guest,,, but if your working from a guest type account the how can you disable it?
2011-10-25T13:22:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	No, no. The system creates a guest account and I can't disable it.
2011-10-25T13:23:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	That entry manager gets in the way.
2011-10-25T13:24:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 then post/blog your topic, i bet your on to some bug or a faq
2011-10-25T13:24:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	True with vim I could rewrite it. But I was hoping for something a bit less taxing on my time
2011-10-25T13:27:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 if its a big problem i would see to it that you get a dotnation from me
2011-10-25T13:28:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	well it compromises security
2011-10-25T13:28:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	I found that I could break into my system in less that 5 minutes. Tat is well within a lunch break.
2011-10-25T13:32:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	untill you do a distribution upgrade that messes with you security.
2011-10-25T13:33:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 pm please
2011-10-25T13:34:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	Yes I am pissed off. Actually I am trying to be polite and avoid f.* words.
2011-10-25T13:35:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 i like to know more
2011-10-25T13:36:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	The new user manager is WAY underpowered
2011-10-25T13:37:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	serious downgrade from the old one. I would like a option to disable a guest account. Then some more fine grained account management.
2011-10-25T13:38:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 im i that source of anger?
2011-10-25T13:39:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	Of course not. The user manager is.
2011-10-25T13:41:00.000Z	htmlinprogress	Younder	 i  say lets give the dev a piece of our mines,
2011-10-25T13:51:00.000Z	Younder	htmlinprogress	do Find /usr/local -exec chmod o-rw \; and repeat for /var and /boot and /etc
