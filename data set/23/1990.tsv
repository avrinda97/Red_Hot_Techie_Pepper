2010-04-20T06:44:00.000Z	Wingless		Hello again. I have another question. I've installed Adobe Reader 9 by downloading the file AdbeRdr9.3.2-1_i386linux_enu.deb from Adobe and installing it using the GDebi Package Installer. Now I want to uninstall it. It seems to me that GDebi doesn't uninstall stuff, so how do I go about uninstalling this .deb package?
2010-04-20T06:45:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	gnome?
2010-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	i think most do as long as the fonts are installed
2010-04-20T07:01:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	that's a langauge support package. is xpdf installed?
2010-04-20T07:04:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	i think that maybe the default pdf viewer installed with Ubuntu.
2010-04-20T07:04:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	you can try that, or select xpdf from the list
2010-04-20T07:05:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	/usr/bin is equivalent to c:/program files
2010-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	what's the ext. for the file?
2010-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	download the file. then via terminal navigate to the directory it's in. run "chmod +x <filename>", then "./<Filename>"
2010-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	chmod +x <filename> set's the script to be an executable. and ./ runs it
2010-04-20T07:49:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	INSTALL is usually a file included with src packages on how to compile/install it
2010-04-20T07:50:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	it's a script file. there's no INSTALL file because it is an executable itself
2010-04-20T07:51:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	follow the instructions I said a couple of minutes ago on how to install it
2010-04-20T07:52:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	installable executables don't communicate with package manager
2010-04-20T07:52:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	install scripts are the same as on windows. they install separately and they have their own unistall file
2010-04-20T07:54:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	an install is just a bunch of files in a directory. If worse somes to worse you just remove the directory
2010-04-20T09:03:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	scite is good
2010-04-20T09:04:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	scite is nice and simple.
2010-04-20T09:10:00.000Z	Wingless	droid7	I just installed Scite and tried opening the tex file. Now, instead of boxes, I see little black boxes with ESC written inside them...  Going to File>Encoding brings up a number of UTF options, but not the Japanese encoding I need...
2010-04-20T09:11:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	you maybe missing some fonts
2010-04-20T09:13:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	try changing the font in scite first
2010-04-20T09:14:00.000Z	Wingless	droid7	do you happen to know offhand how to change fonts in scite? It doesn't seem to be in the menus.
2010-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	droid7	Wingless	 i think there's a menu option to open the config file (no gui). do a search for font and it should be in there somewhere. Or you can try with gedit instead
