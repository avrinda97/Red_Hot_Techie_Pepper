2009-11-01T06:56:00.000Z	aquachica		Ubuntu is coming close to making Microsoft mistakes.
2009-11-01T06:57:00.000Z	aquachica		Anyone out there having issues with their audio?
2009-11-01T06:57:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	hah!
2009-11-01T06:59:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	my humble impression is:  "lots and lots" with karmic
2009-11-01T06:59:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	Karmic is just bad karma for Ubuntu.
2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	it's not been apparently 'stellar', no
2009-11-01T07:01:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	All I wanted to do was get the newest version of Firefox. You would think that you could update particular software in the OS.
2009-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	well... some of us have being trying out firefox beta 3.5.5pre for some time.   but karmic did have some positive promise...
2009-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	When I upgraded from 8.10 to 9.04, I didn't have nearly this many issues.  I really dislike this new Network Manager.
2009-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	And now my audio is all messed up.
2009-11-01T07:05:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	yes indeed.  wait until you start to fight with pulseaudio and akonadi and the deprecation of hal and...
2009-11-01T07:06:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	I try reloading alsa audio, but it will not stick after reboot.
2009-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	you should be sure to purge all pulseaudio packages (except libpulse...) then install libsdl1.2debian-alsa (or whatever) then try rebooting.
2009-11-01T07:08:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	Are there instructions on how to do that?
2009-11-01T07:08:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	Right now, Sound Preferences does not see my auido device.
2009-11-01T07:08:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	none that i've found.  all hearsay and trial and error (mostly error)
2009-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	I am so considering reinstalling 9.04.
2009-11-01T07:10:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	there is an abiding need among true linux'ers never to move backward
2009-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	I guess the being a WinXP user instills the need to wanting to go back.  Hahaha.  ^_^
2009-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	given that, we will weep for the lost soul
2009-11-01T08:32:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	I tried it, but it didn't help me.  My computer still does not see my audio devices.
2009-11-01T08:37:00.000Z	trampel	aquachica	(grasping at straws) do you have an unusual sound card?
2009-11-01T08:38:00.000Z	aquachica	trampel	I shouldn't.  My card has been working since 8.10.  Though I have read in the forum it could be an issue with the upgrade through 9.04.
