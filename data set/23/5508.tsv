2006-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	luminousnerd		The Readme says to ./configure
2006-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	luminousnerd		But yet: luminousnerd@LumiPuter:~/e17/libs/eet$ ./configure
2006-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	luminousnerd		bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
2006-11-17T08:16:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Is that something funky with Ubuntu or is something wrong?
2006-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	luminousnerd		I am, and ls shows that the closest thing to configure is configure.in
2006-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 did you install build-essential first ?
2006-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	no, not that I know of
2006-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	  use synaptic ,  search and install build-essential  you need that to compile manualy
2006-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	  system > admin > synaptic package manager
2006-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 look in the application folder for a readme file or an install file  ,  open them as txt and read for instuctions
2006-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	There is both. but the readme said to ./configure
2006-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 you can also check to make sure there isn'T a package for that app in synaptic , might be easier
2006-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 read the install
2006-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	I doubt it, Ubuntu is all-Gnome all-the-time right?
2006-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 not necessaraly
2006-11-17T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 are you sure you can'T find a linux version of that engage thing ? what does it do ?
2006-11-17T08:24:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	answer was in INSTALL file
2006-11-17T08:24:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	  that's often where it is, in linux you need to learn to read
2006-11-17T08:24:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	Engage IS for linux...it's an app running on E17 an alternative WM...
2006-11-17T08:26:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 sounds linke aclocal is a dependency,  look for it in synaptic
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Pelo	and rasman, Not found in synaptic
2006-11-17T08:30:00.000Z	Pelo	luminousnerd	 google
