2011-03-18T14:41:00.000Z	neurochrome		Is anyone else getting weird screen artefacts in Ubuntu.  If I have an app open in the foreground I always see either youtube videos or adverts for amazon come through from the background, even when a browser is minimised or closed altogether
2011-03-18T14:41:00.000Z	neurochrome		the only way to get rid of it is to restart
2011-03-18T14:41:00.000Z	neurochrome		this is a new problem, started at 10.10
2011-03-18T14:41:00.000Z	neurochrome		any ideas?
2011-03-18T14:42:00.000Z	neurochrome		strange
2011-03-18T14:42:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	have you tried disabling hardware accel for flash
2011-03-18T14:44:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	try disabling hardware accel for flash first :D right click flash vid -> settings -> uncheck box for accel
2011-03-18T14:44:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	cheers 2sec, I thought there was a cfg file somewhere to switch it on/off
2011-03-18T14:54:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	the settings is greyed out, and global settings takes me to adobe.com
2011-03-18T14:55:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	try it on a youtube vid?
2011-03-18T14:55:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	well thats grayed for me too... hold on
2011-03-18T14:56:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	k
2011-03-18T14:56:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	think I found the text file to edit /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
2011-03-18T14:57:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	:O
2011-03-18T14:57:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	but it doesn't exist, does flash have hw accel on by default?
2011-03-18T14:57:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	go there, right click, settings :D
2011-03-18T14:58:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	nice one!
2011-03-18T14:59:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	the artefacts are still there, but I'll restart to see if it's fixed.... or is there another way to kill the programs running w/o restarting?
2011-03-18T14:59:00.000Z	Ben64	neurochrome	logging out would work, but if it didn't fix it, then that probably won't with a restart either
2011-03-18T15:00:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	brb
2011-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	that did the trick! ;)
2011-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	cheers
2011-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	Ben64	I'd like to know whether there is a key to edit using gconf to make such an alteration
