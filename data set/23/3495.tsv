2008-05-05T09:38:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	I'm looking now, but I'm having a heck of a time searching and getting it to actually give me results. Which packages do I need?
2008-05-05T09:39:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	you will need the package which says kernel-2.6.24-11-image
2008-05-05T09:39:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	I think you would need to check with synaptics what packages you have installed
2008-05-05T09:40:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	ok, I'll try to find those. Not terribly familiar w/ the launchpad site.
2008-05-05T09:40:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	let me give you some pointers...
2008-05-05T09:42:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	you start here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu
2008-05-05T09:47:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	I can find files for the current version, but not the old one :( I did find linux-image-2.6.24-11-generic_2.6.24-11.17_i386.deb, but I can'd find the matching linux-ubuntu-modules :( I can onlhy find 1=6
2008-05-05T09:48:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	this is really strange...
2008-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	I think I found it!
2008-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	check it out: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+publishinghistory
2008-05-05T09:51:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	from there you get this page: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/2.6.24-11.17/+build/527730

2008-05-05T09:54:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	Can't seem to find the .deb though? :/
2008-05-05T09:55:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	should be those resulting binaries links.
2008-05-05T09:55:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	but I also don't find the ubuntu-modules you were looking for :(
2008-05-05T09:55:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	Yeah /
2008-05-05T09:59:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	Sorry, had to reboot. Dont suppose you found anything? I still haven't

2008-05-05T10:00:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	Great! I'm glad we can find it! good luck!
2008-05-05T10:01:00.000Z	lmosher	fxjr	Yeah, hopefully this kernel will fix some of the issues. 2.6.24-16 won't boot, but 2.6.20 has some bugs that affect me :(
2008-05-05T10:02:00.000Z	fxjr	lmosher	:( It's sad -26 isn't working for you
