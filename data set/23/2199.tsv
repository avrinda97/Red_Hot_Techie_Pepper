2009-06-23T06:11:00.000Z	Apollo2366		hey guys, I'm trying to transfer files from a windows machine to my Jaunty machine on a crossover ethernet cable. I open network, Windows Network, WORKGROUP, and it gives an error message "Unable to retrieve share list from server" Am I doing it wrong?
2009-06-23T06:12:00.000Z	Apollo2366		Nope, Synaptic?
2009-06-23T06:12:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	yes, and after installing "sudo /etc/init.d/samba start"
2009-07-17T04:22:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	what do you use for sound? alsa? pulseaudio?
2009-07-17T04:22:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	pulseaudio
2009-07-17T04:27:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	mickster04, also when I attempt to test sound in Preferences > Sound Preferences It gives an error message: "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Failed to connect stream: Invalid Argument."
2009-07-17T04:30:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	is pulse running? run "ps -ef | grep [p]ulse" in terminal to check
2009-07-17T04:33:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	http://pastebin.com/d73e8a7b9
2009-07-17T04:46:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	ok...
2009-07-17T04:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	you could read the syslog to see if something useful is mentioned; I'm checking on the command for pulse to restart, like with alsa-utils
2009-07-17T04:35:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	where's the syslog?
2009-07-17T04:35:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	in /var/log but you can use log reader in system > administration if you're on Jaunty
2009-07-17T04:39:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	appendix A here may be useful for at least troubleshooting and maybe solve

2009-07-17T04:39:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	theres some stuff from syslog that I'm putting into my pastebin. http://pastebin.com/m3607207 Does any of it mean anything to you?
2009-07-17T04:40:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	and thanks for the link
2009-07-17T04:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	if you run "sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart" does that fix sound?
2009-07-17T04:43:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	no
2009-07-17T04:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	 too bad, would have been nice. ok, try the appendix link
2009-07-17T05:04:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	You still there?
2009-07-17T05:04:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	yeah, found anything?
2009-07-17T05:04:00.000Z	Apollo2366	VCoolio	Nope, nothing in Appendix A worked.
2009-07-17T05:05:00.000Z	VCoolio	Apollo2366	nothing in the playback tab
