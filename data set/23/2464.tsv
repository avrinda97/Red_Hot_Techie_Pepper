2010-12-30T02:05:00.000Z	vincent_		where can I find the 'regular java 6 from sun/oracle'? it's not in my synaptic packet manager :(
2010-12-30T02:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	add the partner repo!
2010-12-30T02:13:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	I added the partner repo
2010-12-30T02:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	"sudo apt-get update"
2010-12-30T02:16:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	the warning about duplicate sources.list entry is that important?
2010-12-30T02:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	not really, it will work with them being there.  You probably added partner twice (or something else)?  It's not critical at all.
2010-12-30T02:17:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	what about the suggestion to run apt-get update?
2010-12-30T02:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	it's not going to fix the problem unfortunately, kinda a misleading message.  "gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and remove the duplicate if you wish.
2010-12-30T02:20:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	thx
2010-12-30T02:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	glad to help.
2010-12-30T02:22:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	anyway, there still is no sun java 6 in the list after runnign the apt-get update command
2010-12-30T02:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	from a terminal try "apt-cache search sun-java" to show all Sun Java packages
2010-12-30T02:23:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	why are those packages not in the synaptic list?
2010-12-30T02:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	are you looking for the web plugin?  or the jre / jdk?
2010-12-30T02:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	don't know about the synaptic issue... sorry.
2010-12-30T02:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	jre = runtime environment, while jdk = development files
2010-12-30T02:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	what are you trying to do?
2010-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	"client of a server" i don't understand?  is this for a web browser (if so install the plugin)?  is this to run java (if so install the jre)?  is this to develop using java (install the jdk)?
2010-12-30T02:28:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	what is the "regular" java 6?
2010-12-30T02:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	sorry you'd need to be more specific.  they are all "regular"
2010-12-30T02:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	? that doesn't help - i'm not sure if you need jre or jdk - you could try both i guess.
2010-12-30T02:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vincent_	then start with the sun-java6-jre (or if you need it in a web browser, also install sun-java6-plugin)
2010-12-30T02:36:00.000Z	vincent_	ZykoticK9	thanks I think I got it really well fixed now
