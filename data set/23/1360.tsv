2010-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	taroven		Anyone aware of a way to lock a devices volume in Pulseaudio/ALSA? Having some annoying overdrive issues, and my volume gets reset on user switches.
2010-11-20T09:05:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	you mean you have to lower the volume on current music, and switch user means have to lower it all over again?
2010-11-20T09:06:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	For example, I use two sound devices (one USB, one internal) - The USB device is set to 100% volume, internal needs to be set to 63% to prevent overdrive. Switching users puts the USB device to 11% and the internal to 89% every time.
2010-11-20T09:06:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	even though you have set the volume also in the other user?
2010-11-20T09:07:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Correct. Bit odd if you ask me.
2010-11-20T09:07:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Gimme 20 seconds and I'll doublecheck.
2010-11-20T09:07:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	agreed, odd ... each user has its volume state which has issues ... but it shouldn't require repeating that on every switch
2010-11-20T09:10:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Correction, volume on the other user was completely screwed. Still very confused as to why the second user would be able to force my volume levels while mine have no effect on it.
2010-11-20T09:11:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	each user has its own volume level ... logout one and login other, it will change to the other's volume ... direct user switch I believe would do exactly the same
2010-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	it makes sense in cases where each user is a different real person playing different stuff ... but it's annoying when one user is crossing up multiple stuff at different levels AND multiple userids that have to keep changing
2010-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	*shrug* It's not a big deal either way. I've got the second user's login details if I need to reset it again. I'm a lot more curious about the second part of the original question, preventing overdrive by either locking ALSA PCM volume or setting a custom max level to the pulseaudio volume controls.
2010-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	what you need is basically single-state volume levels so a user switch OR logout/login doesn't change it
2010-11-20T09:16:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	but ... that seems to not be considered the "friendly way" by certain people
2010-11-20T09:16:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	similar to the "I want my wireless connection to stay up across user switch"
2010-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Not a big enough deal to bother with, honestly. I can always just readjust if needed. I still do want volume sliders that make sense though - ie, 100% volume not sounding like I just blew out my speakers.
2010-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	there is separate volume and master volume settings at the driver/device level ... and maybe 100%+100% is in fact overdriving ... and maybe setting master to 50% might at least limit the peaking issues
2010-11-20T09:21:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	a full mixer app might be able to make all the settings ... dunno if they will "stick" though
2010-11-20T09:21:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	over on my slackware box I use alsamixer for that ... settings stay across users ... but go back to defaults on reboot
2010-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Yeah, aware of using alsamixer for that. I've had a bit of success setting master down a bit (since pulse seems to go by PCM for the most part), but like you said it doesn't seem to stick across boots.
2010-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Would absolutely love a sticky solution.
2010-11-20T09:24:00.000Z	Skapare	taroven	my solution on slackware was yet another app that lets me hard set the audio levels from an init script ... haven't needed to do that in Ubuntu, though
2010-11-20T09:25:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Hm. Good idea. I'll hit up Google for the commands. Thanks for the help.
2010-11-20T09:47:00.000Z	taroven	Skapare	Turns out that setting "flat-volumes = no" in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf at least makes PA levels less annoying to deal with. I can live with that. Ended up just killing the Gnome volume controls on the second user, there's a volume wheel on the speakers for that anyway. =P
