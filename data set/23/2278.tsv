2009-05-31T03:25:00.000Z	ed_debian		run sudo apt-get install top
2009-05-31T03:26:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	it says it couldnt find package top
2009-05-31T03:26:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	is that the correct package name?
2009-05-31T03:22:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	Do you mean that the video plays poorly or that the audio / video doesn't sync up (people talk after they've spoken)
2009-05-31T03:23:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	it seems im getting a low frame rate. the sound is fine however.
2009-05-31T03:23:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	What flash player are you using?  Free or non-free?
2009-05-31T03:24:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	i have flashplugin-nonfree installed
2009-05-31T03:24:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	Do you know what top is?
2009-05-31T03:25:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	im not sure what you mean
2009-05-31T03:25:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	top is a program for linux that monitors your system
2009-05-31T03:27:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	just run top (since it is installed)
2009-05-31T03:29:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	ok, im in htop right now
2009-05-31T03:33:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	htop or top?
2009-05-31T03:34:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	htop
2009-05-31T03:34:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	Ok well htop ought to work (I'm more familiar with top)
2009-05-31T03:36:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	What kind of system specs are we talking here?
2009-05-31T03:37:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	asus eeepc 1000he
2009-05-31T03:37:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	could be the fact that its only an intel atom 1.66 Ghz
2009-05-31T03:38:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	Yeah that is exactly the problem.  Adobe's proprietary flash player (the one you're using) is poorly written for linux and is a resource hog.
2009-05-31T03:39:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	which flash player should i use instead?
2009-05-31T03:40:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	There isn't really a good answer to that.  There is an open source player (swfdec or something) but it doesn't work with all flash media you might encounter.
2009-05-31T03:40:00.000Z	ed_debian	libtech	It's in the flash-plugin-free package
2009-05-31T03:40:00.000Z	libtech	ed_debian	ill check it out, thanks
