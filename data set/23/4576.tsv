2007-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	leo_rockw	g0dd3ss	locate gtkrc-2.0
2007-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	leo_rockw	g0dd3ss	you may need to updatedb before doing that
2007-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	g0dd3ss	leo_rockw	will that work if it is a .hidden file
2007-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	leo_rockw	g0dd3ss	not sure.
2007-10-02T13:09:00.000Z	g0dd3ss	leo_rockw	okey thanks
2007-10-02T13:09:00.000Z	leo_rockw	g0dd3ss	why would the file be hidden anyway?
2007-10-02T13:10:00.000Z	g0dd3ss	leo_rockw	hummm idk, because it has important settings and they don't want the (L)users to screw it up :D
