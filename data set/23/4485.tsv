2007-08-05T11:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	sometimes, or used to be, a symlink was not created in /dev linking a dvd to the block device...  do written dvd's work? a blank cd/dvd won't show much... cat the block device
2007-08-05T11:08:00.000Z	jinxed-	jetscreamer	yeah I just created and iso from a written dvd
2007-08-05T11:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	define 'nothing happens'  what do you expect to happen when you put in a blank
2007-08-05T11:09:00.000Z	jinxed-	jetscreamer	I see that there is a disk on the desktop that is blank
2007-08-05T11:09:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	ok that's gnome... but does your burning app see it
2007-08-05T11:10:00.000Z	jinxed-	jetscreamer	no
2007-08-05T11:10:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	not sure.
2007-08-05T11:11:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	does cat /dev/dvd (or whatever the dvd is) return anything?
2007-08-05T11:13:00.000Z	jinxed-	jetscreamer	nope it says there is no medium in there
2007-08-05T11:14:00.000Z	jetscreamer	jinxed-	i take it you tried >1 blank ... do written dvd's function as expected?
2007-08-05T11:15:00.000Z	jinxed-	jetscreamer	yeah blank cds work for burning and written dvds/cds work and I tried more than one blank dvd
