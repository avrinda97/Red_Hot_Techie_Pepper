2010-11-15T09:21:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: okay, the 8 character hex id would be memmory:ff6ffc00-ff6ffc7f
2010-11-15T09:23:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: sorry about that, got it now, it is 0cf3-1002
2010-11-15T09:25:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: it gives me currently none but that is b/c even though my usb wireless adapter is plugged into back of usb port on desktop it has suddenly stopped
2010-11-15T09:25:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: will plug it out and back in then run the scan
2010-11-15T09:27:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: got the results from iwlist scan
2010-11-15T09:29:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: yeah but I had already selected it to connect to my router
2010-11-15T09:30:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: yeah, just pinged it
2010-11-15T09:32:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: yeah i get web access
2010-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	ghostnik11		actionparsnip: it suddenly stops, lets say after a couple of minutes it will just stop even while it is loading a youtube page the wireless usb adapter will just stop working and i think it is b/c the regular driver in ubuntu isn't fully compatable with the wireless usb adapter
2010-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	have you tried wicd
2010-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	thats what i was going to try but wanted to know if wicd would interfer with nm or network manager
2010-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	it should auto uninstall nm
2010-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	wicd is much better than NM IMO
2010-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	in terminal type  sudo app-get install wicd
2010-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	i read someone got this sam usb wireless adapter to work and that person used wicd but it was through debian but that is the only thing, will it work for ubuntu
2010-11-15T09:37:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	its worth a try
2010-11-15T09:37:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	thanks will attempt right now
2010-11-15T09:38:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	let me know if it works
2010-11-15T09:45:00.000Z	needhelp1	ghostnik11	did it work?
2010-11-15T09:46:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	i have to get source code and compile
2010-11-15T10:09:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	okay it works, just finished restarting it and it works after following steps from this link http://wiki.debian.org/ar9170usb
2010-11-15T10:09:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	i will still test it to see if it cuts off again but thanks for the help
2010-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	ghostnik11	needhelp1	disregard my earlier confirmation, as it just stopped working again
