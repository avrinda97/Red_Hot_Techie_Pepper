2006-01-16T11:40:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		BSD is a great OS.. I use BSD for servers.
2006-01-16T11:40:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Anyway, guys.. What's the main differences between Debian and Ubuntu?
2006-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		I'm currently downloading Ubuntu's DVD ISO. And I'm just curious, about Ubuntu vs Debian.
2006-01-16T11:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		How about this. Does Ubunto 5.10 have X.org or XFree86?
2006-01-16T11:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Good start.. :)
2006-01-16T11:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		What filesystems does Ubuntu's installation have available?
2006-01-16T11:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		But, what else does it offer during installation?
2006-01-16T11:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Is XFS available?
2006-01-16T11:46:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	i use xfs
2006-01-16T11:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	So it is included in the base kernel during install?
2006-01-16T11:47:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	 but you end up with lilo insted of grub
2006-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	I can put up with LILO. Or I could just make a /boot partition and have it use Grub. No? :)
2006-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	i gues you can, but your /boot can't be xfs
2006-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	/boot wouldn't need to be more than about 10-20mb, at most, and ext3 suffices for that.
2006-01-16T11:50:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	what have you worked with?
2006-01-16T11:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	I've used Linux, minus the past few years, since before 1.0.0 was FINALLY released. :)
2006-01-16T11:51:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	ooook, so I gues you know way more of linux then me :P
2006-01-16T11:51:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	It's possible. :)
2006-01-16T11:55:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	well, you'll need Kubuntu
2006-01-16T11:55:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	Heh, Kubuntu, eh?
2006-01-16T11:56:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	that's why you need Kubuntu
2006-01-16T11:57:00.000Z	BxL	Psi-Jack	that would work too
2006-01-16T11:57:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	BxL	But, would it be as well interfaced, if there is any "interfacing" to it?
