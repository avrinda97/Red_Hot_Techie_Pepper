2008-12-14T22:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	you need to be exact, and use the pastebin to show examples
2008-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	lo is the loop back address
2008-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	put the black list back how it was
2008-12-14T22:07:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	are u there...
2008-12-14T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	yes I am
2008-12-14T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	yes, I said earlier
2008-12-14T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	no
2008-12-14T22:13:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	So is there a howto for setting up eth0 i can look at
2008-12-14T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	eth0 is setup, you've broke it
2008-12-14T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	you need to roll back what you changed
2008-12-18T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	700
2008-12-18T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	or 750 - your call
2008-12-18T03:28:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	i changed home directory to "chmod 777 ." and after that i get a warning in ubuntu about home directory permissions
2008-12-18T03:29:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	will 740 fix it
2008-12-18T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_405	700 is pretty tight, 750 is also acceptable
2008-12-18T03:29:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	 i have changed to 750 will see on next reboot
2008-12-18T03:29:00.000Z	kevin_405	ikonia	 thx
