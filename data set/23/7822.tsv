2005-05-26T12:50:00.000Z	neighborlee		what part of my system do I edit to make 'umount' work via the drives eject button ?
2005-05-26T12:52:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	what are u trying to do, eject your cd rom?
2005-05-26T12:52:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	with the button?
2005-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	yes like suse , mandriva and several other distros do
2005-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	I have eject mapped to a button on my keyboard, the button on the drive doesnt work sometimes
2005-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	how is this accomplished ?
2005-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	in gnome, goto keyboard shortcuts and look for eject.  my keyboard has some extra multimedia keys I have volume and etc mapped out
2005-05-26T13:03:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	did it work for you
2005-05-26T13:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	sorry got busy with PM
2005-05-26T13:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	checking
2005-05-26T13:06:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	under sound > eject ???? ( I see no other eject mentioned)
2005-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	yes
2005-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	alright ..trying then
2005-05-26T13:10:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	ok that worked although its a weird workaround and in 'sound' makes no sense...they need to move that elsewhere to make the option more visible maybe...but anyway I dont see why 'eject' can't be assigned to the 'button' on drive like some of the other distros do as its very user friendly and afterall that is market we are after...unless the devs feel somehow its bad design???
2005-05-26T13:12:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	I dont understand it either - its in sound because of CDs - sometimes my button works, sometimes not.  I think it has something to do with ow the drive is mounted
2005-05-26T13:13:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	drag the icon to the panel
2005-05-26T13:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	how now that is a bit better and I did not realize that could be done..
2005-05-26T13:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	not working
2005-05-26T13:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	the only desktop icon I have atm..which is contents of cdrom
2005-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	its not just the distro
2005-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	you can make a launcher to eject the drive and put it on your panel.  the command is eject
2005-05-26T13:22:00.000Z	concept10	neighborlee	youre making tooooooooooo much fuss about the eject button my friend
2005-05-26T13:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	concept10	no i'm just discussing the merits as others are with me..if they ask I have the freedom to respond I believe
