2010-04-16T09:47:00.000Z	drtomdanger		quick question - it's been a long time - does undernet register nicks?
2010-04-16T09:47:00.000Z	drtomdanger		haha, i just realized.
2010-04-16T09:47:00.000Z	drtomdanger		sorry.
2010-04-16T09:48:00.000Z	drtomdanger		running gnome in 9.1 i'm using xchat with the uber script - better alternatives?
2010-04-16T09:49:00.000Z	drtomdanger		i saw irssi - customizable but still console.  i like the mirc feel of xchat.  hard to find scripts for it though.
2010-04-16T09:50:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	there are a ton of scrips for irssi..
2010-04-16T09:50:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	themes too..
2010-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	drtomdanger	switch10_	i have libpod4 and libpod installed via synaptic - did it take much else in terms of dependencies?
2010-04-16T10:36:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	you need those and much more.  have a look at the article..  its quite easy to follow..
2010-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	so you added the repository  and did sudo apt-get update?
2010-04-16T10:41:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	they may have changed the repository...  ill check, one sec.
2010-04-16T10:42:00.000Z	drtomdanger	switch10_	 i have libmobiledevice0 installed...
2010-04-16T10:42:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	ohh ok. were there any that didn't install?

2010-04-16T20:44:00.000Z	drtomdanger	switch10_	stayed up all night updating my ipod finally. ; )
2010-04-16T20:45:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	right on man.
2010-04-16T20:46:00.000Z	switch10_	drtomdanger	yeah im sure you noticed, it takes a little longer to sync...
2010-04-16T20:48:00.000Z	drtomdanger	switch10_	I originally just had the libpod packages installed.  when I went through and finally got libimobile and ran the config with fuse (had to find and install ifuse), I'm just happy to have it recognize - now I can start patching on functionality.
