2012-05-30T15:23:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	I like that last one!
2012-05-30T15:26:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	What menu is that you're using in http://i.imgur.com/PnEup.png
2012-05-30T15:26:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Is that Cinnamon?
2012-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	that was LMGE (Linux Mint Gnome Extension) and a shell theme
2012-05-30T15:29:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Do you know if that extension still works on GNOME3.4? A lot of common extensions got borked in the update.

2012-05-30T15:32:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Nice screenshot. I've had issues with Ubuntu GNOME3 recently. Lots of extensions are not working, even those in the gnome-extensions-common package.
2012-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	I couldn't get half of the common extensions to run on 3.4!
2012-05-30T15:35:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	you have to go at: https://extensions.gnome.org/
2012-05-30T15:36:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	this is the extension for setting up the panel: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/208/panel-settings/
2012-05-30T15:39:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Oh! So don't install the extensions from the repositories? Just do it one by one from extensions.gnome.org?
2012-05-30T15:40:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	i have some PPA for that, i have webupd8 PPA and i pick up some from the ofcial webpage
2012-05-30T15:42:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	I guess I just didn't look hard enough. ;p
2012-05-30T15:50:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Is this the PPA you used? http://goo.gl/X4Dyp
2012-05-30T15:51:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	ye, and i'll show ya one more thing
2012-05-30T15:52:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	That would be the one PPA I missed. I'll have to go back and try again. :)
2012-05-30T15:54:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	cypher-neo	https://github.com/manateelazycat/DGSE
2012-05-30T15:55:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	That page 404'd on me.
2012-05-30T15:55:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Very funny 404 picture though!
2012-05-30T15:56:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	It's okay. I know who to find later once I get the initial extensions working.
2012-05-30T15:57:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	Let me work on just getting GNOME3.4 to accept and use extensions. lol
2012-05-30T15:57:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Chuck_Norris	I will definitely come hunt you down on IRC later and ask you questions if I have any issues. :)
