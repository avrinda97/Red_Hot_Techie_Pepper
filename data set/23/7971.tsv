2008-06-01T00:20:00.000Z	DanaG		It can't handle roaming!
2008-06-01T00:20:00.000Z	DanaG		It can't comprehend the idea of different access points with the same SSID.
2008-06-01T00:20:00.000Z	DanaG		I roam.... and it still thinks I'm connected to the old SSID.
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	DanaG		They're different access points, but it doesn't realize it's gone out of range of one and into the range of another.
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	DanaG		One complication: the different APs are on different subnets, even though they have the same SSID.
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	DanaG		That's not all that uncommon of a setup, I'd think..... but it doesn't WORK!
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	DanaG		So... if I walk around on campus, my connection randomly breaks.
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	DanaG		And it thinks it's still working... but it's not.
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	DanaG		I have to manually re-select the network in nm-applet each time I move around!
2008-06-01T00:26:00.000Z	DanaG		Anybody know how to FIX networkmanager?
2008-06-01T00:26:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	what is ur problem?
2008-06-01T00:27:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	ok
2008-06-01T00:28:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	yeah i have also experienced that
2008-06-01T00:29:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	basically, when I change the name of my wireless network on my router, then it takes Network-Manager some time to readjust
2008-06-01T00:29:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	try "wifi-radar" utility, its really neet
2008-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	the response time is a little slow, but you can always go to the command line and issue "iwlist wlan0 scanning"
2008-06-01T00:33:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	you can always run dhclient
2008-06-01T00:34:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	but it doesn't.
2008-06-01T00:36:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	if an application doesn't work EXACTLY like you want it to....you have 2 options...a) fix code urself .......b) get another application!
2008-06-01T00:36:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	u should try wifi-radar
2008-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	its not a tray app, but it can be configured to work automatically
2008-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	it need not be a tray app, as u can put shortcuts anywhere
2008-06-01T00:39:00.000Z	nano_	DanaG	u can try searching for other applications... there are prolly 100's of applications for wifi scanning type stuff...feel free to experiment
