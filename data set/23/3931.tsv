2008-01-12T19:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	so what do you get on screen exactly and what did you do to mess it up
2008-01-12T19:57:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	Composite Extention Not avalible
2008-01-12T19:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	have you tried googling it and i asked what did you do to mess it up that is im guessing it was working before
2008-01-12T19:58:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	(SECOND INSTALL)
2008-01-12T20:00:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	all i need to know is how to Install X-server and apply it to my bootup.... Well im guessing because the last time i had to do trhat and it worked fine
2008-01-12T20:01:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	second install txt or the graphical install I dont see how that could happen unless the download was corrupted - x is installed automatically by default
2008-01-12T20:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	see i dont get what you get on screen, can you see icons or is it like dos?
2008-01-12T20:02:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	Graphical....  I know xorg is installed by default but u need x-server running to get it to work...
2008-01-12T20:05:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	i dont think you understand x-server is already installed, if it is a clean install the graphics should show unless there was somethign wrong with your download and if it is not showing what is the message? how does your ubuntu show at the moment?
2008-01-12T20:06:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	U need to enabled x-server at boot and make a small script and then make it excutable...
2008-01-12T20:06:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	are you using ubuntu if so what version?
2008-01-12T20:07:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	Pirate_Hunter	7.10
2008-01-12T20:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Darkmystere_	than thats wrong please verify cause youre the first trying to do that - here is a link from google http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241254
