2011-10-11T03:11:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	check the character map
2011-10-11T03:20:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	im not really sureabout this but try [compose key]+1+2...i think the compose key is alt...but im not sure...people correct me if im wrong
2011-10-11T03:23:00.000Z	rapage	frank1234	no it didn't work
2011-10-11T03:23:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	what character does it give you?
2011-10-11T03:28:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	ok so i went into keyboard settings, layouts, options, compose key position and set one
2011-10-11T03:44:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	did my way work?
2011-10-11T03:45:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	but you set up the compose key right?
2011-10-11T03:46:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GtkComposeTable
2011-10-11T03:49:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	is that what you need? or am i not getting you?
2011-10-11T03:51:00.000Z	rapage	frank1234	I wanted to find the preinstalled key combination
2011-10-11T03:52:00.000Z	rapage	frank1234	but composing one is as good I guess
2011-10-11T03:59:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	i found it in the character map...the script is "common", but im not sure which one is the key combination
2011-10-11T04:04:00.000Z	frank1234	rapage	i see it, i scrolled down a tiny bit...hmm...well i can't magically fly it to your computer
