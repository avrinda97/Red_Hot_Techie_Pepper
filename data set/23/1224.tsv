2011-04-30T23:48:00.000Z	cntrational		my resolution is set to 1024x768, when it's supposed to be set to 1368x768. what do I do?
2011-04-30T23:49:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	go to the monitor preferences and change it
2011-04-30T23:49:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	it's not there, that's the problem
2011-04-30T23:49:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	Ubuntu isn't detecting the proper resolution
2011-04-30T23:50:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	on the old times you could edit xorg.conf. But I think ubuntu doesn't use X anymore so I don't know how to fix it
2011-04-30T23:50:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	that's on 11.10, afaik
2011-04-30T23:51:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	rgr, oh! I thought they were going to change now on 11.04. Can you say I haven't upgraded yet? :p
2011-04-30T23:52:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	can you look into /etc/X11/xorg.conf then?
2011-04-30T23:53:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	as ohsix said, it isn't there
2011-04-30T23:54:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	then run sudo Xorg --configure
2011-04-30T23:55:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	already tried that, it fails with the error "Number of created screens does not match number of detected devices"
2011-04-30T23:56:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	are you using only 1 monitor?
2011-04-30T23:56:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	yes
2011-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	I googled a bit and some people say you need to stop X before running that. That means you'd have to go to a tty, and stop the GUI for some time
2011-05-01T00:01:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	I did do that; alt-ctrl-F2, sudo stop service gdm
2011-05-01T00:02:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	ok. Could you pastebin the X log then?
2011-05-01T00:03:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	pastebin the contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-05-01T00:04:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	http://pastebin.com/YbK35Uy1
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	well, I can't find any error there
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	what resolution should it be?
2011-05-01T00:08:00.000Z	cntrational	carandraug	1368x768, a 16:9 resolution
2011-05-01T00:10:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	I have to go now. But take a look at this, it might be of help https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding%20undetected%20resolutions
2011-05-01T00:11:00.000Z	carandraug	cntrational	and good luck fixing it
