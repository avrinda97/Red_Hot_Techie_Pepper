2010-02-09T08:35:00.000Z	q0_0p		anyone know why pid cli is running going to this ip address? 75.119.207.211:80?
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	we couldn't knwo.  But it looks like an HTTP outbound/inbound connection
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	firefox?
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	only happens when i start internet
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	it only happens once
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	it stops after the first time
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	loading of the firefox start screen
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	thats my guess
2010-02-09T08:36:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	i c
2010-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	but if it was using firefox it would've showd up in the pid name
2010-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	in netstat
2010-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	it shows up as pid program cli
2010-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	that might mean CommandLineInterface
2010-02-09T08:39:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	u think something bad is going on?
2010-02-09T08:39:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	that the destination IP?
2010-02-09T08:39:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	one sec
2010-02-09T08:39:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	yes
2010-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	not sure, its not a site that responds to HTTP requests
2010-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	i went to the site nothing strangely to say
2010-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	so i am confused
2010-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	Trek		it hits errors, it could be a security threat could be nothing
2010-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	q0_0p	Trek	i guess best just block the IP
2010-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	Trek	q0_0p	yeah, and if an error/issue arises from that, then its easily reversible
