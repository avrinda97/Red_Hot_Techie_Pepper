2012-06-13T09:40:00.000Z	Viking667		What application can record an audio stream both from my microphone and the audio from a program such as minecraft?
2012-06-13T09:41:00.000Z	Viking667		so, his user doesn't have permission to shut down, but does have permission to reboot? I don't get that.
2012-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	Viking667		I'm trying to use "gnome-sound-recorder", but I can't balance the stereo mix against the microphone. Either I get just the application at normal volume, or I get seriously suppressed volume (i.e. 5%) on application, and too much volume on microphone.
2012-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	audio-recorder is very nice
2012-06-13T09:43:00.000Z	Viking667		thank you. I'll look at that. Is that just the package name, or the name of the binary to execute?
2012-06-13T09:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	both :)
2012-06-13T09:43:00.000Z	Viking667	glitsj16	weird. I don't see it in apt-cache's search output
2012-06-13T09:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	i might have gotten it from a PPA, please hold, i'll check
2012-06-13T09:45:00.000Z	Viking667		sigh. Figures.
2012-06-13T09:48:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	https://launchpad.net/~osmoma/+archive/audio-recorder
2012-06-13T09:50:00.000Z	Viking667		ah. I'll add that and see what packages he has.
2012-06-13T09:50:00.000Z	Viking667		thank you.
2012-06-13T09:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	np
2012-06-13T09:51:00.000Z	Viking667		meh. "apt-add-repository thaturl" gets me .... yeah. I'll check the sources.d/ out.
2012-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	Viking667		how do I ACTUALLY add that repo so that it imports the keys for me?
2012-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	Viking667		this silly thing doesn't have a man page for the apt-add-repository command. Sigh.
2012-06-13T09:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:osmoma/audio-recorder
2012-06-13T09:53:00.000Z	Viking667		heh. thank you.
2012-06-13T10:32:00.000Z	Viking667		gnome-mag
2012-06-13T10:33:00.000Z	Viking667		... install that package. Not sure if the binary name matches the package name.
2012-06-13T10:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	regarding the audio-recorder package ... just wondering if you tried it and if so, what are your experiences? I'm preparing a review and all feedback is welcome, so feel free to pm me
2012-06-13T10:37:00.000Z	Viking667		heh. I haven't even managed to try it out yet, give me a chance. I've been hammering keys non-stop since I got here.
2012-06-13T10:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	Viking667	no problem :) i hang out here often enough
