2011-03-22T02:42:00.000Z	skxx		hey gang... so i'm trying to print out my resume but openoffice is totally ignoring the top margin, so the first line is printed flush against the top of the page... i've even tried putting leading spaces before the document but they're being totally ignored by the printer.  any idea what i'm doing wrong?
2011-03-22T02:44:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	long shot here but you could try google docs and see if its openoffice related or your printer drivers
2011-03-22T02:44:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	good call, i'll give it a shot
2011-03-22T02:44:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	openoffice is kind of iffy with ms office docs, least with my experience
2011-03-22T02:48:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	i started my resume in openoffice so it's not a compatibility issue
2011-03-22T02:48:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	sounds like printer drivers
2011-03-22T02:49:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	i was just thinking that
2011-03-22T02:49:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	i had to use a driver that wasn't for my printer model to get the bastard to prind
2011-03-22T02:49:00.000Z	skxx		print*
2011-03-22T02:49:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	i could never get the gui printer options to work in System menu, i just went right to cups http://localhost:631/
2011-03-22T02:50:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	yeah printing in ubuntu is a joke
2011-03-22T02:50:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	i have winxp in VM when I need to do odd ball printing
2011-03-22T02:51:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	yeah i dual boot winxp for weird occurances like this bit it's on a busted hard drive that likes to give me migranes
2011-03-22T02:52:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	yeah dont get me wrong i like ubuntu but its nowhere near perfect
2011-03-22T02:52:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	i have to use winxp in virualbox because of quickbooks :P
2011-03-22T02:52:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	despite it's flaws it's still less of a headache than winblows
2011-03-22T02:53:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	they both have flaws =D
2011-03-22T02:53:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	i've never really tried to mess with a vm, i'm running kind of a low-spec box
2011-03-22T02:53:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	i dunno im running on amd64 3200+ x2 which is damn old
2011-03-22T02:54:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	any tips on a good vm prog?
2011-03-22T02:54:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	virtualbox runs great for me, get the one directly from Sun not the VB that is in Ubuntu Software Center
2011-03-22T02:55:00.000Z	skxx	specialmoose	easy to find on google?
2011-03-22T02:55:00.000Z	specialmoose	skxx	yeah the one from Sun adds USB support and other things
