2010-03-10T03:53:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	read that, thx  still totally confoozled
2010-03-10T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	what did you read ?
2010-03-10T03:54:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	the ubuntu help files for both ssh and vnc and using vnc over ssh.  problem is i really have no basic framework ofunderstandng and none of that makes sense to me
2010-03-10T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	which links did you read ?
2010-03-10T03:56:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	i read these: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC?action=show&redirect=VNCOverSSH             https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH              http://www.openssh.org/manual.html
2010-03-10T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	ok so what do you want to do and what part is not clear ?
2010-03-10T04:00:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	what i want to do is be able to access my ubuntu pc that is behind a router from external computers in a secure way.  ssh totally confused the ssh1t out of me and i have no idea what all these keys mean, tunnels, etc.  clueless but usually a quick learner
2010-03-10T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	control your language please, if you can't speak without swearing, don't say it
2010-03-10T04:00:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	righto
2010-03-10T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	why are you not just vnc'ing directly to the machine, why are you ssh tunneling
2010-03-10T04:16:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	now, apparently i need to install putty on any pc from which i want to connect, yes?
2010-03-10T04:04:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	i used to do that... and had my router forward to my ubuntu pc so i could access from outside.  then one day while i was sitting in front of my pc (which is password protected), some dude from Romania took over my computer and started controlling it.  I got him to chat with me in a text file and he told me vnc is absolutely not secure and that my ip address was listed on a site with hundreds of thousands of vulnerable v

2010-03-10T04:11:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	that is interesting but still confusing to me.
2010-03-10T04:12:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	it's got a step by step guide in it
2010-03-10T04:13:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	thank you.  yes, but what i dont understand is the very first step which says "set up an open SSH server" with no more info than that.... how do i do THAT part?
2010-03-10T04:14:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	install the package openssh-server - that's it
2010-03-10T04:14:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	all i do is install the package, and then it is set up?
2010-03-10T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	correct
2010-03-10T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	jon5001	if that's what the guide says.....
2010-03-10T04:17:00.000Z	jon5001	ikonia	ok.  this helps.  I now feel optimistic, whereas before i was in a whole weed forest of tunnels and keys etc.
