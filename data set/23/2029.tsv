2010-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	Purpley		Hey guys Ubuntu is starting to get extremely slow and lag and I think its time for a fresh install, right now im backing everything up to a seperate partition but I just want to know, are there any distro's that are really customizable and a little more advanced than ubuntu?
2010-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	there are many
2010-01-26T00:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	for ultimate customization, try gentoo.
2010-01-26T00:32:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	is it more of a terminal line distro or does it have graphics?
2010-01-26T00:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	terminal of course
2010-01-26T00:41:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	does the name not give it away?
2010-03-04T06:13:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	someone already answered you
2010-03-04T06:13:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	I dont notice unless someone actually mentions my name
2010-03-12T03:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	man rsync
2010-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	rm
2010-04-03T00:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	what do you mean what type
2010-04-03T00:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	what cpu is it
2010-04-03T00:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	grep name /proc/cpuinfo
2010-04-03T00:20:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	 you might want to check out abcde, it's a very nice ripper
2010-04-03T00:21:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	Can it rip automatically when cds are inserted? and can it go online and give the tracks metadata?
2010-04-03T00:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	it can automatically rip and grab track tags from the internet and tag them
2010-04-03T00:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	you can configure nautilus to run it when a cd is inserted
2010-04-03T00:22:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	Oh alright so it doesnt require any user interaction? im making a htpc
2010-04-03T00:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	you can set it to not require any, yes, but i would check to make sure the tags are correct (through ssh maybe since it's a htpc)
2010-04-03T00:24:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	Ill check on it once in awhile
2010-04-03T01:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	32bit
2010-04-03T01:30:00.000Z	Purpley	blakkheim	what type though?like architecture
2010-04-03T01:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Purpley	i386
