2007-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	matkix		So what would it be named? / how can I access it?
2007-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/xxxx /mount/point
2007-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	sudo fdisk -l    will give you the /dev/xxxx name, and just mount it whereever you want, making sure there is a directory there
2007-12-10T11:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	first, yes make sure there is a folder where you plan to mount it
2007-12-10T11:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	next, you can mount it by: sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /backup       (it was ntfs right?)
2007-12-10T11:43:00.000Z	matkix	MasterShrek	yeah yeah :) office max special, need a 500 gig backup drive.
2007-12-10T11:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	also, you can put this line at the end of your /etc/fstab: /dev/sdb1    /backup    ntfs-3g      defaults       0     0
2007-12-10T11:44:00.000Z	matkix	MasterShrek	Ooops, its fat32.... what do you think I should do?
2007-12-10T11:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	use vfat instead of ntfs-3g
2007-12-10T11:45:00.000Z	matkix	MasterShrek	So then just add this to the /etc/fstab?
2007-12-10T11:45:00.000Z	MasterShrek	matkix	yes, that last one i sent you, except use vfat instead of ntfs-3g obviously
2007-12-10T11:47:00.000Z	matkix	MasterShrek	Thanks! Now I just want to know what you think would be better for large web to server file transfers? FTP, or NFS?
