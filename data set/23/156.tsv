2012-05-16T03:03:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	is gnome-screensaver running? what is your screensaver/power manager
2012-05-16T03:04:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	Those settings are disabled
2012-05-16T03:05:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	blackbox doesn't have any kind of screensaver. blackbox may not be notifying the screensaver that the cursor is active.
2012-05-16T03:06:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	Those settings are definately disabled.
2012-05-16T03:33:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	i would first figure out what screensaver is running. It could be dpms but its more likely that a screensaver just isnt realizing you are using the system because of your non-standard WM
2012-05-16T03:36:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	How do I find it?
2012-05-16T03:36:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	ps aux | grep saver
2012-05-16T03:36:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	hmm
2012-05-16T03:41:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	How do I read PS's output?
2012-05-16T03:42:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	the important bit is the last column. do you see any screensaver command there?
2012-05-16T03:42:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	I see grep --color=au to saver
2012-05-16T03:44:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	if thats the only one then no process with "saver" in the name is running so its unlikely a screensaver is running. maybe it is dpms. you could try xset -dpms
2012-05-16T03:45:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	I just need to execute that or what?
2012-05-16T03:46:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	that should disable dpms. xset +dpms would reenable it
2012-05-16T04:28:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	That didn't fix it.
2012-05-16T04:28:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	hmmm. maybe some screensaver is running that is not named "*saver*"
2012-05-16T04:33:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/989910/
2012-05-16T04:36:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	i have no idea what could be blanking your screen
2012-05-16T04:37:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	Could my netbook have a hardware screensaver?
2012-05-16T04:37:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	never heard of such a thing. but maybe
2012-05-16T04:40:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	is it dimming going to full black, or just a dimming backlight?
2012-05-16T04:40:00.000Z	HelenTheMelon	escott	Going to full black. lol
2012-05-16T04:41:00.000Z	escott	HelenTheMelon	you could dig around in /sys maybe there is some acpi setting that is causing the display to turn off (or the backlight to go to zero)
