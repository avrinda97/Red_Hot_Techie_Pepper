2011-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	MrFricks	mkanyicy	everything.. i don't want to have to enter a password for anything... not to logon not to install not to anything
2011-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	if you login automatically, you might get keyring prompts
2011-02-06T04:30:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	you can disable password prompts when using 'sudo'
2011-02-06T04:30:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	open terminal
2011-02-06T04:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	then run 'sudo visudo' and search for the line that starts with '%admin' and then make sure it is now like '%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
2011-02-06T04:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	save and quit
2011-02-06T04:37:00.000Z	MrFricks	mkanyicy	admin is all but don't see the password thing. do i need to add that?
2011-02-06T04:37:00.000Z	mkanyicy	MrFricks	yes of course
