2005-04-06T13:23:00.000Z	Roey	e_machinist	 having problems compiling the 0.6.6 wacom module for kernel 2.6.10
2005-04-06T13:24:00.000Z	Roey	e_machinist	 not wacom, but there is this guide on how to build it.  Of course, it doesn't address the error I linked to in there.
2005-04-06T13:25:00.000Z	Roey	e_machinist	zenrox:  http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/howto/morehid
2005-04-06T13:26:00.000Z	Roey	e_machinist	zenrox:  the wacom module provides replacements for hid/mousedev/evdev/usbmouse that are essential if you use a usb mouse.
2005-04-06T13:26:00.000Z	Roey	e_machinist	zenrox:  I get errors when I specify that the wacom hid replacement driver be built.
