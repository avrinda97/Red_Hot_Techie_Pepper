2005-04-09T09:03:00.000Z	elcu	osity	it's up to you.  the error messages are harmless (http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#booterrors)
2005-04-09T09:04:00.000Z	osity	elcu	....i also am still waiting for the system to boot up this is the first boot.  It giving a bunch of ambiguous redirects...
2005-04-09T09:04:00.000Z	osity		and taking forever
2005-04-09T09:05:00.000Z	elcu	osity	are u sure it isn't just the packages being set up?
2005-04-09T09:06:00.000Z	osity	elcu	dont know
2005-04-09T09:07:00.000Z	elcu		yep, ubuntu works with .deb files rather than .rpms
2005-04-09T09:07:00.000Z	osity	elcu	the last line says "id 1 respawning too fast. diables for 5 minutes.
2005-04-09T09:07:00.000Z	osity	elcu	and its just sitting there
2005-04-09T09:09:00.000Z	elcu	osity	what is your system?
2005-04-09T09:11:00.000Z	osity	elcu	do you mean hardware?
2005-04-09T09:13:00.000Z	osity	elcu	 its an old P3 800 w/ soyo mobo that is identifying the chip as 774MHZ  with a new samsung 80GB 7200
2005-04-09T09:14:00.000Z	elcu	osity	ah, don't worry.  i did a google and it came up with a mac thread.  so this is your very first boot after install?
2005-04-09T09:14:00.000Z	osity	elcu	ya...first boot
2005-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	osity	elcu	it still stuck on that screen....
2005-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	osity	elcu	maybe bad mobo?
2005-04-09T09:16:00.000Z	elcu	osity	i think it might be a problem with mingetty
2005-04-09T09:16:00.000Z	elcu		see http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/8/2005/02/2/278287
2005-04-09T09:16:00.000Z	elcu		and this https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2005-February/msg00540.html
2005-04-09T09:17:00.000Z	elcu	osity	but if it's your first boot, i don't see why anything would be corrupted
2005-04-09T09:18:00.000Z	osity	elcu	well unless it doesnt like the mobo....its the weakest link
2005-04-09T09:18:00.000Z	osity		it wont id the CPU right..
2005-04-09T09:24:00.000Z	elcu	osity	i'm not sure.  sorry.  try googling and asking again here.
