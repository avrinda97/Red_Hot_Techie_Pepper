2006-11-12T12:54:00.000Z	c0re^		hey, is there a ubuntu with the 2.6.1.8 kernel already compiled and useable?
2006-11-12T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	if you mean 2.6.18, no.
2006-11-12T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	and there is no Ubuntu release with 2.6.1.
2006-11-12T12:55:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	i thought someone said the nightly worked for the jmicron sata controller
2006-11-12T12:55:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	meaning a snap of 2.6.19?
2006-11-12T12:55:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	meaning something that will work with my stat controller
2006-11-12T12:56:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	sata*
2006-11-12T12:56:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	I need specifics.
2006-11-12T12:56:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	like my sata controller?
2006-11-12T12:56:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	no, like the kernel you're referring to
2006-11-12T12:57:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	the kernel im referring to is 2.6.18 which has support for my sata controller
2006-11-12T12:57:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	we don't -- at all -- ship 2.6.18.
2006-11-12T12:57:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	someone said some nightly had it
2006-11-12T12:58:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	then either point me to this mysterious nightly, or give me a reference to whom
2006-11-12T12:59:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	im looking for the nightly myself. it was on some random forum i found on google. two other distributions ive tried that has 2.6.18 run, but wont install due to not finding disks or my harddrive isnt seen.
2006-11-12T13:00:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	i use the asus p5b deluxe wifi ap ed
2006-11-12T13:00:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	for my mobo
2006-11-12T13:01:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	there seems to be a communication breakdown. We don't ship a 2.6.18 at all. There's 6.10's 2.6.17 or 7.04's 2.6.19.
2006-11-12T13:02:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	oh, i understand, well i just want any kernel that supports my sata controller or allows me to install, im assuming 2.8.19 will?
2006-11-12T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	c0re^	you're free to compile your own 2.6.19-rc
2006-11-12T13:02:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	thats the thing, i cant get linux on my system
2006-11-12T13:03:00.000Z	c0re^	crimsun	thats why i need a linux installer that runs 2.6.18+ so my hardware is detected
