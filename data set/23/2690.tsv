2008-12-12T00:03:00.000Z	sunny		Hey peeps, I'm an experienced windows user who is running my first ubuntu machine. and I've got a problem
2008-12-12T00:04:00.000Z	sunny		When I run youtube videos in FF, the program hangs.
2008-12-12T00:04:00.000Z	sunny		The same things happens in epiphany
2008-12-12T00:04:00.000Z	sunny		I've installed all the flash plugins for FF, but it still happens.
2008-12-12T00:05:00.000Z	sunny		I haven't been prompted to install plugins for epiphany, and the flash did load, it just made the prog hang
2008-12-12T00:07:00.000Z	sunny		Drowned: Showave Flash 9.0.r999 and same gnash
2008-12-12T00:07:00.000Z	drowned	sunny	you can only have 1 plugin installed at a time
2008-12-12T00:07:00.000Z	drowned		if you have nonfree flash installed then you can't have nash installed
2008-12-12T00:08:00.000Z	sunny		I don't know what to say, I'm looking in the Add-ons window --> plugins, and that's what I read, 2 entries.
2008-12-12T00:08:00.000Z	drowned		oh i understand sunny
2008-12-12T00:08:00.000Z	drowned		goto synaptics
2008-12-12T00:09:00.000Z	sunny		k
2008-12-12T00:09:00.000Z	sunny		what am I looking for?
2008-12-12T00:09:00.000Z	drowned		now just type gnash into the quick search
2008-12-12T00:09:00.000Z	drowned		i assume its installed with a green box next to its name
2008-12-12T00:10:00.000Z	sunny		yes, I've got gnash, gnash-common, and mozilla-plugin-gnash
2008-12-12T00:10:00.000Z	drowned		ok click the main gnash one and say mark for removal
2008-12-12T00:10:00.000Z	drowned		it should also remove the other ones you mentioned then
2008-12-12T00:11:00.000Z	sunny		It didn't mark gnash-common
2008-12-12T00:11:00.000Z	sunny		but the other 2 are now marked for removal
2008-12-12T00:11:00.000Z	drowned		ok now search nonfree
2008-12-12T00:11:00.000Z	drowned		it should pull up the flash one
2008-12-12T00:12:00.000Z	sunny	drowned	ok, removed
