2011-12-08T10:56:00.000Z	polardude1983	maum	im not sure what to say to help you get your HDMI sound working.
2011-12-08T10:57:00.000Z	maum	polardude1983	there is two output device ( internal audio analog stereo, hdmi stereo) but hdmi sound is not working
2011-12-08T10:59:00.000Z	polardude1983	maum	sorry I do not know the answer. All I can say is it might have something to do with PulseAudio or maybe try installing Alsa and uninstall Pulseaudio.
