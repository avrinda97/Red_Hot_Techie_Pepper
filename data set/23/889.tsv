2011-05-14T00:05:00.000Z	pietr101		Hello, i'm looking for someone to consult the booting process of ubuntu. msg me pls
2011-05-14T00:05:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	ask in the channel
2011-05-14T00:05:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	no one will pm you.
2011-05-14T00:09:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	that is the default behavior
2011-05-14T00:09:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	yea, but sometimes it just wont boot
2011-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	usually after kernel upgrade
2011-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	nor do I. But that is not the default behavior. Grub boots the latest kernel. It only pauses if you press a button in person.
2011-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	what laptop do you recommend that is fully hardware supported in ubuntu out of the box?
2011-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	I use a Pavilion dv6 according to the text on my computer :-P
2011-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	I have also used dell laptops and another hp pavilion
2011-05-14T00:16:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	be more specific
2011-05-14T00:16:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	what needs to be "redundant"?
2011-05-14T00:17:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	I have multiple harddrives and the data need to be redundant, because of disk failures
2011-05-14T00:17:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	I keep my important documents in dropbox...
2011-05-14T00:17:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	works perfectly :-)
2011-05-14T00:18:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	I have 8 TB of documents ^^
2011-05-14T00:18:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	in that case, you need raid
2011-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	http://www.crashplan.com/
2011-05-14T00:20:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	you may need to pay them money so you can mail them the data on drives... but I am told they are a great backup service
2011-05-14T00:20:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	I don't go over my free plan in dropbox (I have invited many people), so I don't use it.
2011-05-14T00:20:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	but my friends tell me crashplan.com is great
2011-05-14T00:21:00.000Z	pietr101	smw	I rather stick to raid, and i'm more comfortable with software raid
2011-05-14T00:21:00.000Z	smw	pietr101	more comfortable with software raid?! lol
