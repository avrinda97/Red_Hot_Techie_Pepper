2009-12-05T19:07:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	what do you mean "refresh your ip". you mean dynamic ip? you neeed to update a domain name?
2009-12-05T19:08:00.000Z	rek	jonzbcc	 yeah like mydns
2009-12-05T19:09:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	if you're using a service for that dns, like dyndns.com they will provide you with a daemon you can run on your machine. which service is it?
2009-12-05T19:10:00.000Z	rek	jonzbcc	i need to do that to manage a ftp server on my machine
2009-12-05T19:11:00.000Z	rek	jonzbcc	i like filezilla server... can i find the sources i need or...which program could i use for that purpose?
2009-12-05T19:11:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	go to synaptic: type "dyndns"
2009-12-05T19:12:00.000Z	rek	jonzbcc	which program could i use ? can i find filezilla server Dr_Willis?
2009-12-05T19:12:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	you know it can be dangerous running services like that on the web, right? i'm not sure about filezilla, you'd be better off looking it up. i use vsftpd
2009-12-05T19:13:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	vsftpd is just a different program. i think you should read up on security first though, if you're not aware of the dangfers of the nakey-web
2009-12-05T19:14:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	its as safe as you make it. i can use vsftpd and make a nasty swarm hole of attraction at my house with it
2009-12-05T19:15:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	 swarm=just not good
2009-12-05T19:15:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	what dr_willis said, its very very much worth learning first
2009-12-05T19:16:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	any protection for what exactly?
2009-12-05T19:17:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	yes there is, which comes with learning.
2009-12-05T19:18:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	ftp = just like anything else. ftp is just one method of getting files.
2009-12-05T19:18:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	erusual++
2009-12-05T19:19:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	you can create anything you want.
2009-12-05T19:19:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	yes
2009-12-05T19:20:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	read the links that were printed out ^ above
2009-12-05T19:40:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	yes?
2009-12-05T19:42:00.000Z	jonzbcc	rek	do you know how to get to the terminal?
2009-12-05T19:56:00.000Z	rek	jonzbcc	this server is anonymus only
