2009-02-12T07:16:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	didn't see you hanging out here
2009-02-12T07:17:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	heh, I usually don't, it's not like I use ubuntu. My mother has an ubuntu install, I was hoping someone could help out with that. So far no luck with that.
2009-02-12T07:17:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	whats the fuss about?
2009-02-12T07:19:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=653305 is this you?
2009-02-12T07:20:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	question to that: Is right click possible on the desktop?
2009-02-12T07:20:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	nope, that context menu is gone too
2009-02-12T07:20:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	(at least it was the one time this happened while I was around...)
2009-02-12T07:23:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	this seems related bug wise. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/128077 It says "Fix released", but no idea what fix
2009-02-12T07:24:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	I'm pretty sure that bug report is too old (this is an up-to-date heron install)
2009-02-12T07:25:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	even with proposed updates?
2009-02-12T07:26:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	I don't follow (remember I'm not usually an ubuntu user...)
2009-02-12T07:27:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	in synaptic => repositories is "proposed updates" and such
2009-02-12T07:27:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	those are off iirc
2009-02-12T07:28:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	there might be a fix in proposed (and maybe not)
2009-02-12T07:28:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	I'll have a look (I should be able to find the ChangeLog for whatever's in proposed)
2009-02-12T07:30:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	http://rafb.net/p/VAwHjn87.html is her .xsession-errors, fwiw
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	that "unable to add monitor" thing is suspicious, but that was also added after I restarted nautilus (and it was drawing icons by then)
2009-02-12T07:36:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	This seems like a better guess at what is wrong: ** ERROR:(nautilus-desktop-directory.c:162):directory_ready_callback: assertion failed: (g_list_find (merged_callback->non_ready_directories, directory) != NULL)
2009-02-12T07:37:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	hmm, must've missed the -desktop-directory part of that message
2009-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	What is the nautilus version?
2009-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	I can't check currently, I'm not at the affected system. Should be latest in hardy though, so that's, um
2009-02-12T07:44:00.000Z	mzz	JesperHansen	1:2.22.5.1-0ubuntu1 but I'll check if that's what she actually has later
2009-02-12T07:53:00.000Z	JesperHansen	mzz	well, nothing changed from 2.22.5.1 to 2.24.1 in directory_ready_callback.. must be somewhere else things have been fixed.
