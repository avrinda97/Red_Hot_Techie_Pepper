2008-09-28T01:23:00.000Z	hardcore		would a pentium 4 processor be 64 bit?
2008-09-28T01:23:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	not necessarily
2008-09-28T01:24:00.000Z	hardcore		it said no such file or directory

2008-09-28T01:28:00.000Z	hardcore		Linux robert-laptop 2.6.24-19-generic #1 SMP Wed Aug 20 22:56:21 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux is what it said
2008-09-28T01:28:00.000Z	hardcore		does that mean 32 or 64?
2008-09-28T01:29:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	i686 is 32bit
2008-09-28T01:29:00.000Z	hardcore		oh ok, thanks
2008-09-28T01:29:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	but that's the system. it doesn't mean your p4 isn't 64capable
2008-09-28T01:29:00.000Z	hardcore		whats the difference between i386 and i686?
2008-09-28T01:30:00.000Z	hardcore	saschahl	how do i know if it is 64 bit acceptable?
2008-09-28T01:30:00.000Z	hardcore		i mean capable?
2008-09-28T01:30:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	i386 will run on an 386 processor, i686 probably won't, it's more optimized
2008-09-28T01:32:00.000Z	hardcore		clf flush size is 64
2008-09-28T01:32:00.000Z	hardcore		what am i looking for exactly?
2008-09-28T01:33:00.000Z	hardcore		i did the cat /proc/cpuinfo what am i looking for?
2008-09-28T01:33:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	what's model, cpu family, model name and stepping?
2008-09-28T01:33:00.000Z	saschahl	hardcore	what's flags? that's important.
