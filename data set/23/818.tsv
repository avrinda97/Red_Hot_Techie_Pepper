2012-07-01T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 also seems to be some built in icons...
2012-07-01T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	notify-send -i face-cool "I'm cool."
2012-07-01T13:47:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : cool
2012-07-01T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 seems you can use any of the default gnome themes icons without needing to use the full path.
2012-07-01T13:50:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	: yup !    and thanks you man ... You are great
2012-07-01T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 its the alert alias that you are using - that seems to be causing the issue. due to how bash is parseing the alias
2012-07-01T13:51:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	:  i need one more help
2012-07-01T13:52:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	 : how to add password in your bash Script when you working on same machine
2012-07-01T13:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 not sure what you mean by adding a password.
2012-07-01T13:53:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : i want to password for my sudo
2012-07-01T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 if the script needs sudo rights, then it should ask for the password as part of the script. or you should run  the script with sudo. you do NOT put a password IN a script. thats security 101 basics. ;)
2012-07-01T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 if the script is running specific commands that need sudo rights. you can set up the sudoers file where sudo's password is not needed for specific commands.
2012-07-01T13:55:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : ok !
2012-07-01T13:57:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : hey is there any system file which can i edit to connect with net setter (USB internet )
2012-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : i don't want to connect my net setter using ubuntu API "network Connection"
2012-07-01T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 never heard of 'net setter' so no idea. I just use the normal network manager stuff on my home lans.
2012-07-01T14:00:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : net setter is like mobile broadband
2012-07-01T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kav	 never used it. Other then basic phone teathering, I only use my home network.
2012-07-01T14:01:00.000Z	kav	Dr_Willis	  : Ok !  thanks you very much .... you saved my day .....and bye bye
