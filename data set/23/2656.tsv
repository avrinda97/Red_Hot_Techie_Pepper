2008-12-26T10:48:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	http://paste.ubuntu.com/93051/
2008-12-26T10:59:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	great... so its executing although it doesn't seem to be working right...
2008-12-26T10:49:00.000Z	terli	gbear14275	: the script you have shown me appears to simply execute the xfce4-terminal command, and then once it finishes execute the ones below it.
2008-12-26T10:50:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	yes, I organized it line by line for easier understanding... i'm trying to setup a desktop terminal but for some reason when trying to run that script it isn't executing right
2008-12-26T10:51:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	I apologize ahead of time... this is my first script attempt
2008-12-26T10:51:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	ok will do
2008-12-26T10:51:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	brb
2008-12-26T11:00:00.000Z	terli	gbear14275	is it ever ending?
2008-12-26T11:03:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	When I use Ctrl-C it closes the opened terminal... although I think thats ok
2008-12-26T11:03:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	are you familiar with the wmctrl program at all?
2008-12-26T11:11:00.000Z	terli	gbear14275	I strongly recommend introducing your issue in #xfce and #bash(#bash first).
2008-12-26T11:12:00.000Z	gbear14275	terli	alright... will do, thanks for the pointers
