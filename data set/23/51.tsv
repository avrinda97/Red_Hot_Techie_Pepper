2012-09-24T06:14:00.000Z	Zachster1996		i am having trouble with ubuntu
2012-09-24T06:15:00.000Z	toafan	Zachster1996	of course, or you wouldn't be here.  What's up?
2012-09-24T06:17:00.000Z	toafan	Zachster1996	I've never used Ubuntu server.  What kind of stats?
2012-09-24T06:18:00.000Z	toafan	Zachster1996	and importantly, do they only show up along the bottom line, or do they scroll up the terminal?
2012-09-24T06:19:00.000Z	toafan	Zachster1996	I've got Byobu terminal manager, and it has a stats line along the bottom, but if that's what's going on they should _stay_ at the bottom
2012-09-24T06:20:00.000Z	Zachster1996	toafan	they are supposed to stay at bottom but they scroll

2012-09-24T06:21:00.000Z	Zachster1996	toafan	^
2012-09-24T06:22:00.000Z	toafan	Zachster1996	yeah, that's not supposed to happen.  Is that a actual windows box, and if so have you tried from anothe linux machine?
