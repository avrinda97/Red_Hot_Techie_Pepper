2008-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	huncybunch What does the --phigh parameter do?
2008-01-08T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	it limits the questions asked. without any -p option, it goes through every possible question
2008-01-08T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	from keyboard to bus id to refresh rates to driver
2008-01-08T11:31:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	That sounds useful!
2008-01-08T11:32:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	Will it leave the previous settings intact for questions you skip?
2008-01-08T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	-pcritical will ask no questions, I usually suggest it for someone who has res problems as the first troubleshooting step
2008-01-08T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	no, it's fresh
2008-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	I like working from a known base myself
2008-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	and it creates a backup based on time and date
2008-01-08T11:35:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	Good info. Thanks.
2008-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	dpkg-reconfigure is the general configuration tool for debian/ubuntu, if you install configure-debian you can see it all
2008-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	Thank you for the pointer.
2008-01-11T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	you would set up file in /etc/modprobe.d/ with the option line, see the options file for examples
2008-01-11T10:06:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	Just to make sure I understand: I add a line that says 'options snd-sb16 isapnp=0' at the end?
2008-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	And this will be automatically picked up if I add 'snd-sb16' to the end of /etc/modules?
2008-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	you should create a new file in that directory containing that line. One of the blessings of ubuntu is if you modify a conffile in /etc , ubuntu won't overwrite it. Downside is you might lose a needed update. So they have a mechanism that will load any custom files in a conf.d directory
2008-01-11T10:10:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	I don't think I understand. So I create a file in /etc/modprobe.d -- does it have to have any particular filename, or are all files scanned?
2008-01-11T10:11:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	I see modprobe.d has a man page... Iet me read that before you answer.
2008-01-11T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	np, man pages are very useful.
2008-01-11T10:19:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	OK, so I created a file (/etc/modprobe.d/sb16-20080110) with the 'options snd-sb16 isapnp=0' line in it. I will still need to update /etc/modules to call for the snd-sb16 module, though, right?
2008-01-11T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	yep, that will do the trick.
2008-01-11T10:20:00.000Z	FactTech	nickrud	OK, thanks. I think I'm finally starting to understand the whole modules subsystem.
2008-01-11T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	FactTech	when the module gets loaded, the loader looks in your file for the options
