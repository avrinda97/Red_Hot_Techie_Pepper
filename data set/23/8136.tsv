2005-01-12T09:57:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	check this out: http://www.linuxquestions.org/hcl/showproduct.php?product=939
2005-01-12T10:00:00.000Z	kuckus	scoon	yep, been there already - my problem was that I wasn't sure how to set the mode to PTP
2005-01-12T10:00:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	did you get that part of it figured out.
2005-01-12T10:01:00.000Z	kuckus	scoon	not yet, no - it was suggested I'd try mounting it directly first
2005-01-12T10:02:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	according to gphoto the only way your camera will work is in PTP mode.  I'd figure out what that is first.
2005-01-12T10:02:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	once you do, you will prolly mount it w/ /dev/sda1 or sda2 or sdb1 or sdb2 depending on what else is mounted.
2005-01-12T10:02:00.000Z	kuckus	scoon	should pphoto be detecting the camera automatically as a PTP model, do you know if I have to set anything manually for that to happen?
2005-01-12T10:03:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	no.  I have a sony cybershot and it just works.
2005-01-12T10:03:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	try here: http://www.google.com/linux
2005-01-12T10:03:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	or here http://www.gphoto.org/
2005-01-12T10:06:00.000Z	kuckus	scoon	ok thanks.  It seems the Nikon should be showing up as a generic PTP camera when you call gphoto2 with --auto-detect, but it doesn't for me
2005-01-12T10:08:00.000Z	scoon	kuckus	hmmm.  when you plug it in, does anything get logged ?
2005-01-12T10:09:00.000Z	kuckus	scoon	yep, vendor and model are listed correctly and it looks as though it should be at /dev/sda
