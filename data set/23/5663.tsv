2008-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	messiah	ubuntu has gui alternatives for a lot of stuff, it's usually easier/faster to just do things in terminal though
2008-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	messiah	sort of
2008-07-02T07:30:00.000Z	Fryguy--	messiah	the terminal in linux is a lot more flexible and robust for doing things
