2009-10-10T03:26:00.000Z	kilo		is anyone familiar with installing world of warcraft via wine? I just did so and it installed fine, but when I open it, I can hear everything but see no visuals and my desktop looks as if nothing happened... however there are dragons and choirs blairing out at me from the opening sequence... so it's definitely running... I just can't find it anywhere.... any ideas?
2009-10-10T03:26:00.000Z	kilo		from terminal?
2009-10-10T03:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	if you have compiz enabled right now try turning it off and trying again -- other then that you might want to ask in the wine channel.
2009-10-10T04:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	option 1) use nvidia setting to disable one monitor then start the game 2) config you xorg.conf with a NULL setting to automatically disable one monitor when an app asks for 1680x1050.  Good luck.

2009-10-10T05:09:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	Thank you. I thought about that, but I'm wanting to run Wow in windowed mode. it's not requesting 1680x1050, ubuntu is saying that 3360x1050 is the only resolution available to it... make sense?
2009-10-10T05:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	can you get into the game and set a resolution?  can you temporarily turn off one monitor with nvidia-settings and get into the game?  you need to know what resolution WoW wants before we can configure your xorg to match the settings.
2009-10-10T05:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	or turn turn this Windows mode on!
2009-10-10T05:13:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	Sorry, I thought I mentioned it: the game is not requesting resolutions. It asks the OS what resolutions are available. Unbuntu is returning that only the resolution 3360x1050 is available (which is way too wide). That's the resolution of both my monitors. I need to find a way to provide 1680x1050 as a resolution to the game, seeing as it's the one requesting from the OS what resolutions are available.
2009-10-10T05:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	then you have no choice but to use nvidia-settings, disable one monitor then start the game!
2009-10-10T05:15:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	are you sure there's no way to modify xorg.conf to reflect a different resolution?
2009-10-10T05:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	yes - but you'd have to switch to that resolution prior to starting the game each time (so you might as well just use nvidia-settings gui)  -- if this was a "normal" game with a resolution that could be selected, then there is a way to use xorg to automajically turn off one monitor when a game calls that resolution -- but if the game relies on what xorg's resolution is -> you gotta use nvidia-settings...  sorry to break bad news.
2009-10-10T05:19:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	I see... insteresting. I think I'm just going to try to create a second X Screen then, without having Compiz scream at me   :P
2009-10-10T08:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	you do know that you can switch between twinview and single monitor in the same session using nvidia-settings and the Apply button right?
2009-10-10T08:56:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	yes, you mentioned that before, but I'd really like to be able to browse the web, or otherwise use that second monitor.
2009-10-10T08:58:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	it is easy to get it to run in a window. that's not the problem. the problem is the resolution. unlike normal games, wow asks the OS for the available resolutions and Ubuntu is only kicking back the total resolution of both twinview monitors.
2009-10-10T08:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	AHHH Light comes on.  No - I still gots nothing for ya.
2009-10-10T08:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	actually could you add additional resolutions to your xorg.conf file?
2009-10-10T08:59:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	hehehe   ;)    you see my dilema   ;)
2009-10-10T09:00:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	that's what I was thinking!  but I can't find any example syntax anywhere....
2009-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	        Modes      "1400x900" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
2009-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	kilo	ZykoticK9	where do I add those? at the end?
2009-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kilo	no!  - could you pastebin your xorg.conf?
