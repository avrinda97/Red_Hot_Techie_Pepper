2008-12-12T05:01:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	the internal IP address *is* the "real" IP. that's how routing works.
2008-12-12T05:01:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	you're looking for the external IP assigned to your router.
2008-12-12T05:02:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	you could use w3m to access the router's interface. if it will let you.
2008-12-12T05:02:00.000Z	\slash	mneptok	in ifconfig only shows 198.0.0.*
2008-12-12T05:02:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	and that's your IP address.
2008-12-12T05:02:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	correct. the external IP is assigned to the *router*
2008-12-12T05:03:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	so what you're asking is "is there a way for Linux to go across a network and query another device and get its interface information?" and i hope not. not easily.
2008-12-12T05:04:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	you what dynamic DNS.
2008-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	what does "java -version" return?
2008-12-12T09:08:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	got a JRE?
2008-12-12T09:08:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	that command i gave you should tell you
2008-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	you don;t have Sun's Java
2008-12-12T09:10:00.000Z	mneptok	\slash	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2008-12-12T09:11:00.000Z	\slash	mneptok	i got sun java
