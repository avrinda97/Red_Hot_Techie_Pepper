2008-04-26T03:29:00.000Z	fxfitz		My parents all of a sudden lost their internet on their ubuntu computer. When they do 'sudo /etc/init.d/network restart' It says "Ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0" Does anyone know what this means?
2008-04-26T03:30:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	check the /etc/network/interfaces file
2008-04-26T03:31:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	What exactly should I be looking for?
2008-04-26T03:31:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	you should be looking for iface eth0=eth0 and it should just say   iface eth0
2008-04-26T03:32:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	if your interfaces are swapping names check /etc/iftab
2008-04-26T03:39:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Okay, I just called them and they have the same /etc/nework/interfaces file as I do, it says "auto eth0" and "#iface eth0 inet dhcp"
2008-04-26T03:39:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Any ideas?
2008-04-26T03:40:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	that line should not start with a pound symbol - it's commented out
2008-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	tell them to type   "sudo ifconfig eth0 up"   "sudo dhclient eth0"
2008-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	So, take out the # and save the file. And then: sudo ifconfig eth0 up and sudo dhclient eth0??
2008-04-26T03:42:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	they should fix the file yes, but if they just type   "sudo ifconfig eth0 up"  that will bring up the interface, and "sudo dhclient eth0"  that will grab dhcp, then you can ssh in and fix it yourself?
2008-04-26T03:42:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Oh okay, that sounds like a good idea.
2008-04-26T03:52:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Alright, well, the dhclient gave them six different "dhcpdiscover eth0 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval" and at the end it said "no dhcpoffers received"
2008-04-26T03:53:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	lan cable is unplugged, dsl modem needs rebooted, etc etc
2008-04-26T03:53:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Okay, and you're sure that would be it? Because the modem is really hard to get to and I don't want them going into the attic if they don't have to (I already had them check the ethernet cable in the back of the computer)
2008-04-26T03:54:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	are there more than one network cards?  like eth1 ?
2008-04-26T03:54:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Nope
2008-04-26T03:54:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	dhclient eth0   should get a dhcp address from whatever it's plugged into
2008-04-26T03:54:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Alright, well it sounds good. Thanks a lot1
2008-04-26T03:54:00.000Z	hwilde	fxfitz	have them do "sudo ifconfig eth0 down"  "sudo ifconfig eth0 up"  "sudo dhclient eth0"
2008-04-26T03:55:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Okay will do
2008-04-26T04:06:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	Yeah they're going to go into the attic tomorrow and check the router. Thanks for all of your help!
2008-04-26T04:06:00.000Z	fxfitz	hwilde	See they had people working on the roof today. They didn't go inside, but maybe they nocked something loose some how. I dunno. Anyway, thanks!
