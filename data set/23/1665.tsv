2009-12-11T02:49:00.000Z	lzrdking	jayce	 you won't
2009-12-11T02:49:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- why not? :( the other laptop does...
2009-12-11T02:50:00.000Z	lzrdking	jayce	you'd need to put it in a config file somewhere, but i don;t know where
2009-12-11T02:50:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- youre right, I didnt
2009-12-11T02:50:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- what do you think is diff between these machines?
2009-12-11T02:50:00.000Z	lzrdking	jayce	but if its just to image, why does it need to be permanent?
2009-12-11T02:51:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- I understand, its just the fact that it bothers me, to be honest. I just dont understand why. you know?
2009-12-11T02:51:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- I like tou nderstand what the problem was...
2009-12-11T02:51:00.000Z	lzrdking	jayce	bad sector on the HD maybe?
2009-12-11T02:52:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- you think? Brand new laptops. Although possible, very unlikely. They imaged fine (they had XP on them previously)
2009-12-11T02:53:00.000Z	lzrdking	jayce	 no clue, try imaging again?
2009-12-11T02:54:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- I hate to fix linux the same way I fix windows machines. To fix windows machines, you reboot, otherwise, reimage. To fix linux machines, its.. different. :( Id rather not resort to that
2009-12-11T02:54:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- I think I found a solution, osrta, through network manager
2009-12-11T02:54:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- as long as I have a connection to the switch, I can grab the proper static IP through the switch
2009-12-11T02:54:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- if Im not plugged in at all, I wont grab it. No idea why the other one does, but its late, eff it
2009-12-11T02:55:00.000Z	jayce	lzrdking	- thanks for your help bor
