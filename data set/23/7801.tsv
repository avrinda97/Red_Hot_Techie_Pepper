2005-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	cfh_dev		Is there an ubuntu package for the zaptel kernel module?
2005-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	I see a package named zaptel-source
2005-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	yeah but you have to compile it and that's a bitch
2005-09-27T09:46:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	can you help me through it?  I'm stuck with a compile error.
2005-09-27T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	not at the moment, sorry
2005-09-27T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	what's the error?
2005-09-27T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	did you unpack the source package?
2005-09-27T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	I think it's only a tar.gz in /usr/src
2005-09-27T09:49:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	it's already unpacked in /usr/src/modules/zaptel
2005-09-27T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	if you're sure...
2005-09-27T09:49:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	yep.  lot's of .c and .h files
2005-09-27T09:50:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	someone on the * channel suggested I compile from cvs
2005-09-27T09:50:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	zaptel-source with module-assistant would be much easier, I would think.  Are you using module-assistant?
2005-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	I don't think so.  What would I do to use it?
2005-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	best bet is to read the docs in /usr/share/doc/module-assistant
2005-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	also, /usr/share/doc/zaptel-source should have info on how to compile it using module-assistant (it's a dependency)
2005-09-27T09:52:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	I'll check it out, thanks
2005-09-27T09:55:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	module-assistant worked great but 'modprobe zaptel' still doesn't find the module.  Any thoughts?
2005-09-27T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	did you install the .deb that was created?
2005-09-27T09:56:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	mod-ass asked to install so I said yes.  let me check dpkg
2005-09-27T09:57:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	it's installed but no love from modprobe
2005-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	cfh_dev	tritium	I needed to do depmod -a first.  Thanks for all the help
2005-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	tritium	cfh_dev	no problem
