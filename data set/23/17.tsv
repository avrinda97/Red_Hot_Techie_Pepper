2004-11-12T06:27:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	expose is not possible in any sane way with X as is
2004-11-12T06:29:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	ah ?
2004-11-18T07:22:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	i bet your kernel believed it first :)
2004-11-18T07:22:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	load your sound card's module in /etc/modules
2004-11-30T16:12:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	cool :)
2004-11-30T16:12:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	whn will be out the next release ?
2004-11-30T16:13:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	?
2004-11-30T16:13:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	I don't ask kde support
2004-11-30T16:14:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	yes thanks
2004-11-30T16:15:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	well I manage to have kde apps appearing by tweaking the .desktop files in /usr/sahere/applications, but maybe there is hack to do somwhere to have them always in good format or accepted in gnome menu
2004-11-30T16:17:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	are you a programmer ?
2004-11-30T16:18:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	I code, maybe you could indicate me where to search if I want to try fixing that before nect release ?
2004-11-30T16:19:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	ok, I will check that I am curious
2005-03-31T16:22:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	where you see nautilus crashes, please click the 'report to developers' button in the crash dialogue
2005-03-31T16:25:00.000Z	mirak	jdub	it crashes so many times I can't even tell what is the common behavior that produce a bug
2005-03-31T16:27:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	that's fine; whenever it happens, click on the report to developers button. that sends a backtrace.
2005-03-31T16:28:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	it's doubly useful if you install nautilus-dbg
2005-03-31T16:29:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	that provides more information for the backtrace
2005-03-31T16:29:00.000Z	jdub	mirak	if nautilus crashes that regularly for you, then perhaps you use it very differently to most other people, so providing that feedback will help greatly
