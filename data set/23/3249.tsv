2008-06-13T06:53:00.000Z	matthew		now that I've figured how to do everything I want to do, I'm ready to give ubuntu the majority of my harddrive, what's the safest way to do this (a link with instructions would work just as well)
2008-06-13T06:54:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	so you're trying to say you want the move the free space from your windows partition to the ubuntu?
2008-06-13T06:55:00.000Z	matthew	neurobuntu	I'd like to move the music files (which take up the most space) as well.
2008-06-13T06:55:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	but you do want to resize the partitions which have files on them?
2008-06-13T06:56:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	you can resize the partitions while preserving the data, but it takes a REALLY long time, a couple hours
2008-06-13T06:56:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	I've done it many times
2008-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	matthew	neurobuntu	do I have to be present for those "couple hours"
2008-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	no
2008-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	I would BACKUP! BACKUP! BACKUP! any information you cannot afford to lose
2008-06-13T06:58:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	then boot into the live cd. Under System->Administration-->Partition Manager you can resize your current partitions.
2008-06-13T06:58:00.000Z	matthew	neurobuntu	the first time I tried ubuntu half a year ago, I lost 180 gigs of info cause I "thought I knew what I was doing" (aka: being retarded)...so yeah I back up now
2008-06-13T07:00:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	yes
2008-06-13T07:02:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	I would recommend (Unless you want to preserver your current installs), reformat the entire drive, make 4 partitions, 1 NTFS (10 gb) for windows, 2 EXT3 (10gb) for linux install, 3 EXT3 (20-100gb depends on space) for /home, 4 linuxswap (512mb - 3 gb == equal to your ram).  Then install XP on the NTFS, then install ubuntu on the 2nd partition while setting the mount point of the 3rd partition as /home
2008-06-13T07:03:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	then repeat the above instructions but with visat
2008-06-13T07:04:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	When I was dual booting I setup my install like I specified above, and I've been very happy that I have a /home partition
2008-06-13T07:04:00.000Z	matthew	neurobuntu	I feel something just flew bye me, what is the advantage to that as opposed to resizing with the live cd?
2008-06-13T07:05:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	resizing works fine (for the most part) but I;m a big believer in doing things cleanly. You're less likely to have problems and things will generally work better
2008-06-13T07:05:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	Resizing will work, I've done it plenty of times
2008-06-13T07:06:00.000Z	matthew	neurobuntu	also...I don't have a vista cd. I got my laptop through my IBM discount, and it came with Vista installed.
2008-06-13T07:06:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	then definately don't do a clean wipe.   Does vista have a built in partition manager>
2008-06-13T07:07:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	then use that to SHRINK the windows partition, (Can vista handle EXT3?). Then use the live cd to grow your linux partition
2008-06-13T07:08:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	I would say let vista resize the linux partition but I'm not sure how well the Vista partitioner will work with EXT3, MS doesn't have a lot of incentive to make things work with linux
2008-06-13T07:08:00.000Z	neurobuntu	matthew	so let the linux utility work on the linux partition
