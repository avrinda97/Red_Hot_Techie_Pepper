2007-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	LunatikBunnie		my modem doesnt have a model #.
2007-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	LunatikBunnie		it just says ARTNET , Accessrunner DSL

2007-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	stefg	LunatikBunnie	you have to be a lot more precise before you can expect an answer
2007-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	LunatikBunnie		well. i tried sudo pppoeconf, it doesnt detect my modem (i've already mentioned this more than five times here)
2007-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	LunatikBunnie		no-one answers.
2007-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	stefg	LunatikBunnie	probably because you need some driver or firmware for your modem.... follow the guide in /topic and raise your chances to be not ignored :-)
