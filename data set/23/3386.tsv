2011-02-25T20:18:00.000Z	jonalv		guys help, I thikn I am crazy. 'sudo apt-get install biblatex' says: 'biblatex is already the newest version.' but when I write biblatex I get: 'biblatex: command not found'. What am I doing wrong?
2011-02-25T20:19:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	dpkg -L biblatex|grep "/usr/bin/"
2011-02-25T20:20:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	wow thanks, was that missing in the install script or soemthing?
2011-02-25T20:20:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	whats the output of that command? it actually changes nothing
2011-02-25T20:21:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	from what i read, that is only a library, nothing you can run directly
2011-02-25T20:22:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	ah yea you are right, (I might be goign crazy), no output
2011-02-25T20:22:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	but where is the executable with that name hiding then?
2011-02-25T20:23:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	it has no binary, i don't know how to use it, i guess you have to include it into your tex-projects
2011-02-25T20:24:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	check http://www.hep.man.ac.uk/u/jenny/jcwdocs/latex/bibtexbasics.html
2011-02-25T20:24:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	there shuold be a standalone binary which you run. At least that's how it works on my mac. And bibtex is not the same as biblatex
2011-02-25T20:24:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	oh sry
2011-02-25T20:25:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	oh that's no problem, perhaps you are good with apt though and can help me find the executable?
2011-02-25T20:25:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	only thing with related is: biblatex-dw - Biblatex styles for humanities
2011-02-25T20:26:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	lacks a binary too.
2011-02-25T20:26:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	hm, I guess I should try some biblatex page on the intertubes then...
2011-02-25T20:27:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	http://www.charlietanksley.net/pdf/latex-footnote-citations.pdf   just an addon to be referenced in your latex-files
2011-02-25T20:32:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	I am sorry, I didn't wuite follow, are you still thinking there is no executable?
2011-02-25T20:33:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	yes, without deeper research. for me that is just a library you can use in your latex-files
2011-02-25T20:34:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	I am sorry you do not trust me. I have used the program on my Mac, it is both a latex package and a standalone program. It's a bibliography generator. The standalone program generates files with the bibliographeis which the package then includes in the document. At least that is how it works on my other computer... :)
2011-02-25T20:35:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	mac == os x? this is linux
2011-02-25T20:35:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	yea I run it on os x, but it hsould work the same on Ubuntu linux
2011-02-25T20:36:00.000Z	llutz	jonalv	there might be a package doing what you want, but none of those two in the apt-repos will do
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	jonalv	llutz	yea, thanks for your help anyway
