2012-04-26T07:38:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	drivers for what?
2012-04-26T07:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	what have you used to test it so far? (ex: cheese, vlc, etc)
2012-04-26T07:42:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	i've used Cheese, it says No device found
2012-04-26T07:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	can you pastebin the output of dmesg?
2012-04-26T07:43:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	Yes, one moment
2012-04-26T07:44:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	http://pastebin.com/pjYZCY7q
2012-04-26T07:48:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	No worries, it's USB
2012-04-26T08:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	could you run dmesg, then unplug and replug the webcam, then run demsg again?
2012-04-26T08:01:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	 Just a moment
2012-04-26T08:03:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	http://pastebin.com/SPDsX8hu
2012-04-26T08:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	I'm not seeing any fatal errors, but there appears to be something ELSE on your system that ubuntu doesn't like...
2012-04-26T08:09:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	What would that be? Any idea?
2012-04-26T08:10:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	ok, is there anything else connected to the usb ports?
2012-04-26T08:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	anything else (keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, camera, external usb, flash drive, etc)?
2012-04-26T08:12:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	keyboard, mouse, webcam at the moment. I unplugged my SD cardreader to plug in the webcam
2012-04-26T08:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	ok, leave that unplugged, wait a minute, run dmesg (pastebin it), plug in webcam, run dmesg (pastebin it), lsusb (pastebin it), unplug webcam (pastebin it)
2012-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	I got the webcam to work also..I think i'm good to go. :D
2012-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	what did you do to get it working?
2012-04-26T08:19:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	It was interfering with the mouse, since it's all plugged into a USB hub. Thanks for your help :D
2012-04-26T08:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	ah, cheap hubs can do that :P
2012-04-26T08:20:00.000Z	ApocGoD	DarwinSurvivor	Mhm, now to just plug it in normally, haha. Thanks
2012-04-26T08:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ApocGoD	no problem
