2007-05-06T13:56:00.000Z	Bradf0rd		Hey, I'm trying to enable my Wifi card can someone help me figure this out? I'm reading this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2596312 and I've done the three steps, the last one doesn't follow through though.... it gives me this: sudo apt-get remove ndiswrapper-utils
2007-05-06T13:56:00.000Z	Bradf0rd		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2007-05-06T13:56:00.000Z	Bradf0rd		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?

2007-05-06T14:05:00.000Z	|ericsson|	Bradf0rd	have you tried running lshw, ifconfig or lspci to see if it detects the card?
