2004-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	Chibi		Not at the moment. We're trying to get that in as a console option before the 4.2 release.
2004-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	Chibi		We added in the compositor after the translation lock
2004-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	Chibi		So no UI config tools. :/
2004-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	Slackman	Chibi	are you one of the XFCE devels?
2004-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	Chibi		Not officially, I'm on the dev lists though. :P
2004-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	Slackman		bur[n] er konq rocks, i love fish://
2004-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	Chibi		XFFM is getting better, no icon view yet, but it's much more usable than it was in 4.
2004-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	Slackman		xfce is fast
2004-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	Slackman		=)
2004-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	Chibi		XFCE is the best :D
2004-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	Chibi		It's the middleground between full desktop and simple window manager.
2004-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	Slackman		bur[n] er i just love that you can use fish,ftp,http,smb,nfs countless other protocols from within any app
2004-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	Slackman		its just so handy
2004-11-20T13:14:00.000Z	Chibi		I love konqueror. But I hate Qt. :/
2004-11-20T13:14:00.000Z	Slackman	Chibi	heh, i love xfce but not partial to gtk :)
2004-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	Chibi		GTK feels better. Qt looks like I'm looking into ouch. :/
2004-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	Chibi		It doesn't matter the theme, it just always hurts my eyes.
2004-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	Slackman		hmm see i think GTK looks better but qt feels more responsive
2004-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	Chibi		Yes, qt feels more responsive, but it looks fugly. :o
2004-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	Chibi	|progenic|	Don't. hehe.
2004-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	Slackman	Chibi	i use gtk on my ibook, but i can't work with it...its so much easier to have fish & other protocols accessable to each app
2004-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	Chibi		What's fish, may I ask. :o
2004-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	Slackman	Chibi	its just ssh/scp
