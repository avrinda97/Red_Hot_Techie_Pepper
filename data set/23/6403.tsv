2006-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	gharz		what's hdc? is it the cd-rom?
2006-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	it's the master drive on your second IDE.  so, depends ;)
2006-06-08T14:42:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	coz i'm getting a hdc: media error when i run dmesg.
2006-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	so, whats your problem?
2006-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	after running 'sudo ./vmware-install.pl' a message says A previous installation of VMware software has been detected.
2006-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	i've already removed vmware-player from synaptic.
2006-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	complete removal?
2006-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	yes.
2006-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	is it advisable to re-install vmware-player and remove it again completely?
2006-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	you shouldnt need to.  You already removed it completely
2006-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	Warbo, you might try that link
2006-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	Warbo : this is the best vmware howto i found in the forum... others experienced the same problem but they didn't mentioned how they were able to fix it.
2006-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	check out that link to the wiki though
2006-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	that wiki says he bought the software. i'm installing a free version. :(
2006-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183209 this is the good link. but maybe bec my eyes are tired of searching for an answer, i don't see any msgs that states the solution.
2006-06-11T14:05:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	i still can't install vmware... i've reinstalled vmware-player from synaptic and completely remove it...
2006-06-11T14:05:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	it's still doesn't work.
2008-05-30T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	Without package management, it's difficult.  Hope the package put all its files in /usr/local/ or in /opt/ and then delete them.
2008-05-30T05:07:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	should i delete the folder? thanks
2008-05-30T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	Yeah.  And you got lucky it seems if there is one.  It's safer to stick with stuff under package management.  java is in the repos.
2008-05-30T05:09:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	now i'm facing a problem... i can't find the folder which it was installed
2008-05-30T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	gharz	Right.  It probably isn't installed in one particular folder, most unix apps arent.  Is it in /usr/local? (/usr/local/bin would have some of it) if not, is it in /opt/?
2008-05-30T05:12:00.000Z	gharz	Flannel	found it... it was extracted in the same folder where .bin was located
