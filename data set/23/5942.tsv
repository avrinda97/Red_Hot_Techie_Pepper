2009-05-26T22:23:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	I need a screenshot of a cursor hovering over the secondary partition in the places menu
2009-05-26T22:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	:) showing them Linux recovery, where as the others wil probably do something that involves Windows
2009-05-26T22:27:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	The reason why my instructions involve ubuntu is that the prof has no idea that there are more than 2 operating systems
2009-05-26T22:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	clients suffering from Microsoft :d   well some people are better off with Windows really
2009-05-26T22:27:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	yes, the sheeple
2009-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	yeah
2009-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	,but also some people have apps  that  they must run that are only  made for Windows, and that won't work in a virtual machine
2009-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	will you be able to give me a screenshot?
2009-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	no
2009-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	sort your own screenshots out :)   the Live CD idea  the other guy gave was good
2009-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	Quite true. That is why God made computers able to have more than one os
2009-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	I would but, the PrtSc button wont work.
2009-05-26T22:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	someone else can maybe help you,  since I don't feel like taking screenshots right now.   infact I usaully don't bother taking them of my computer
2009-05-26T22:32:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	Gah! I suppose I will just have to get up and go find a keyboard with a working screenshot button!
2009-05-26T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	and you should get your printscreen button fixed or something,  since it can be useful
2009-05-26T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	yes I was about to suggest that
2009-05-26T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	yeah I hate that as well, how it's all Windows on those courses,  going back to  your teacher apparnatly not knowing that other OS's existed.   last one I did had a very tiny bit of Linux and opensource in it, but yes  Windows otherwise
2009-05-26T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	and DOS for partitining after all these years on such a course geez
2009-05-26T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	corey_	well in the lab,  not networking lab. anyway off topic
2009-05-26T22:36:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	in this case I can forgive her because she is a technical writting proffessor
2009-05-26T22:42:00.000Z	corey_	sebsebseb	I have finished the paper without the screen shot. Would you mind glancing over it to see if there are any glaring inaccuracies except for spelling?
