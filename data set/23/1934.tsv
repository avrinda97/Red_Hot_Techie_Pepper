2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		HEllo
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		friends
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		I got ubuntu
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		a little while ago
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		but I chose in the installation
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	StrangePaint		install side by side
2009-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	ease up on the enter key, you can use long lines on irc
2009-09-02T14:05:00.000Z	StrangePaint		Install side by side, so it worked and I could choose between ubuntu and vista. Now, it made the partiton that Ubuntu is installed on a little small; So I deleted it in vista, and will reinstall. I have made a new 10GB partition for ubuntu, how do I choose for ubuntu to install in this partition in the installation? Also, do you recommend I have a partition just for ubuntu, but save my stuff on the other partitions, or should I make a big 
2009-09-02T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	you can write data to ntfs quite well in linux
2009-09-02T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	you need to tell the installer to use the largest contiguous free space, read the screen very VERY carefully
2009-09-02T14:07:00.000Z	StrangePaint		Hmm, but that will install it on something else, I want it to install SPECIFICALLY to this new partition
2009-09-02T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	you could even go for an advanced install and create 2 partitions. one of about 2Gb for swap and one for /
2009-09-02T14:08:00.000Z	StrangePaint	ActionParsnip	I don't know the names of my HDD's, I mean, I do, but Ubuntu has a weird way of saying what they are; I have some very important data on my two HDD's, I can't lose it.
2009-09-02T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	do you not have a backup?
2009-09-02T14:09:00.000Z	StrangePaint	ActionParsnip	No, I don't.
2009-09-02T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	then the dta is disposble
2009-09-02T14:09:00.000Z	StrangePaint		No, I can't afford a new 1TB hdd to backup all my stuff.
2009-09-02T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	you will need to use the advanced partitioner to create 2 partitions in the unpartitioned space
2009-09-02T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	no backup == dont care if my hard drive suddenly fails
2009-09-02T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	can you afford to lose your data, is your data worth the price of a 1Tb hdd for backup?
2009-09-02T14:11:00.000Z	StrangePaint	ActionParsnip	Okay, but I went into that once and I didn't understand anything, everything was in weird names.
2009-09-02T14:11:00.000Z	StrangePaint		Also, yes, okay I will buy a 1TB HDD for backup.
2009-09-02T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StrangePaint	if you see 10Gb of unpartitioned space you are there
