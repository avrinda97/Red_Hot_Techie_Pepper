2007-03-30T14:24:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	ctl-alt-backspace
2007-03-30T14:24:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	nothing happened
2007-03-30T14:25:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	X is hung. alt-f2
2007-03-30T14:26:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	what do i do after alt-f2 fails?
2007-03-30T14:27:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	power off
2007-03-30T14:29:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	- i broke it good.  It told me it couldnt start x and dumped me at a terminal, telling me to start x when it was configured correctly
2007-03-30T14:30:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-30T14:35:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	I don't know most of these options... is there a way to make it run the autodetect it did on install?
2007-03-30T14:35:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	nope
2007-03-30T14:35:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	this is mhy if you don't know how soething works you *don't take it apart*
2007-03-30T14:38:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	Ubuntu has a package system. until you learn more, do not try to install and run anything outside the package system.
2007-03-30T14:40:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	am i going to have to reinstall the whole system now?  i ran the config as best i could, tried startx and got Fatal server error: no screens found
2007-03-30T14:41:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	yup. sounds like your X cofig is totally FUBAR. it could be fixed, but it's prolly faster for you to just reinstall. and while you do it, repeat the mantra "i will only use software from official repositories."
2007-03-30T14:42:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	Lol.  If the official repository ddr-clone worked instead of dying instantly, i wouldnt have had to.
2007-03-30T14:42:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	you *had* to install a DDR clone? lives hung in the balance?
2007-03-30T14:43:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	There wouldnt be much point in changing OS's to one that doesn't run what i need to run, would there be?
2007-03-30T14:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Zyn	i din't tell you to change OSes.
2007-03-30T14:45:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	 That's completely accurate.  I chose to attempt to migrate from windows to have cleaner teeth, perfect hair, and to be a better human being.  You're the individual in this channel who's been supplying me with some help on the subject, for which i am grateful.
2007-03-30T16:05:00.000Z	Zyn	mneptok	Are you still here?
