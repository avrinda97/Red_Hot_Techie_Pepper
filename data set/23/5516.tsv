2006-12-09T14:05:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	I've had that issue once.
2006-12-09T14:10:00.000Z	neobyte420	javaJake	how did u fix that nat error?
2006-12-09T14:11:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	it's going to be your router, probably.
2006-12-09T14:11:00.000Z	neobyte420	javaJake	im connected to the modenm
2006-12-09T14:12:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	ah, ok. it could be your ISP... they sometimes block/slow down this stuff.
2006-12-09T14:12:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	or your firewall
2006-12-09T14:13:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	anything that could block port 6667 (that is the port set, right?) needs to be checked.
2006-12-09T14:17:00.000Z	neobyte420	javaJake	i have turned off my firestarter firewall
2006-12-09T14:17:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	ah, that was probably doing it.
2006-12-09T14:18:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	um, wait, turning off Firestarter doesn't turn off the firewall. Firestarter itself isn't the firewall - it merely lets you control the firewall built into Linux.
2006-12-09T14:18:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	you need to run Firestarter, and click the "Stop" button
2006-12-09T14:18:00.000Z	neobyte420	javaJake	how do i turn off the linux firewall then
2006-12-09T14:19:00.000Z	javaJake	neobyte420	you need to run Firestarter, and click the "Stop" button
