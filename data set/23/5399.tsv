2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		it's probably an easy thing too
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		i'mj ust trying to figure out what scsi device /dev/sdc matches to
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		which raw scsi device
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		it is attached to
2010-08-28T23:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
2010-08-28T23:25:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: thanks
2010-08-28T23:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	To determine what drive (i.e. serial number) "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/"
2010-08-28T23:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	You're welcome.
2010-08-28T23:28:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: can you check out the following link -- http://pastebin.com/NTFct3nw
2010-08-28T23:29:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: any thoughts?
2010-08-28T23:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	It seems that the scsi device matches the device name from the /dev/disk/by-path/ output, i.e. sda is the first, sdb the second, and sdc the third.
2010-08-28T23:38:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: so SDA matches the raw scsi device /dev/sg0 ?
2010-08-28T23:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	Is /dev/sdg0 an actual physical device?
2010-08-28T23:39:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: /dev/sg* are the physical devices
2010-08-28T23:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	Then I don't think you can tell for sure within the guest, you'd have to look at how vmware is mapping them and I'm not familiar with that.
2010-08-28T23:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	You could I guess run "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdg0" and confirm that it matches /dev/sda in the guest (and that it doesn't match anything else).
2010-08-28T23:43:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: i'm in the phtysical host operating system
2010-08-28T23:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	And you can't run "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" in the guest?
2010-08-28T23:45:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: i'm not in a guest OS,
2010-08-28T23:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	If not, then you'll have to check your VMware settings. Try ##vmware for that.
2010-08-28T23:45:00.000Z	xibalba	Jordan_U	: just working on a server with Vmware server
2010-08-28T23:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xibalba	Sorry, I don't know then.
