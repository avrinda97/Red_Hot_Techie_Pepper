2012-08-12T03:58:00.000Z	goth		somehow my flash is extremely buggy
2012-08-12T03:58:00.000Z	goth		iirc I changed those settings a long time ago to fix an issue with colors
2012-08-12T03:58:00.000Z	goth		but flash is extremely buggy now
2012-08-12T03:59:00.000Z	goth		it regularly forces me to reboot the computer
2012-08-12T03:59:00.000Z	goth		is there no replacement for flash?
2012-08-12T03:59:00.000Z	goth		in any case: how do I enable hw acceleration?
2012-08-12T03:59:00.000Z	goth		it loads all just fine
2012-08-12T03:59:00.000Z	goth		you have a different issue
2012-08-12T04:00:00.000Z	goth		precise
2012-08-12T04:01:00.000Z	goth		for the moment I just try to permanentely enable hw acceleration again
2012-08-12T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	can you give a pastebin of the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'             Thanks

2012-08-12T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	sudo apt-get --purge remove gnash gnash-common
2012-08-12T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	then:   sudo apt-get --reinstall install adobe-flashplugin
2012-08-12T04:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	not sure, could try it, its free
2012-08-12T04:20:00.000Z	goth	ActionParsnip	ok, your procedure didn't help
2012-08-12T04:20:00.000Z	goth	ActionParsnip	still the same behaviour, still hw accel deactivated
2012-08-12T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	remove all the packages you got in the output and then install the adobe-flashplugin package
2012-08-12T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	yes remove them all so you have zero flash
2012-08-12T04:25:00.000Z	goth	ActionParsnip	that's what I did
2012-08-12T04:25:00.000Z	goth	ActionParsnip	I think it is some setting in firefox
2012-08-12T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	then no idea, your OS is 64bit and the adobe-flashplugin package will install 64bit flash, you could play with /etc/adobe/mms.cfg file
2012-08-12T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	goth	yes it will continue flash, firefox will probably do something similar
