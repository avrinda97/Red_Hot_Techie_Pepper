2007-10-04T10:50:00.000Z	alexbobp		How do I figure out which package has a given file?
2007-10-04T10:50:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	in Synaptic, look at the package's properties
2007-10-04T10:50:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	I think there's a listing of what files the package installs
2007-11-30T14:29:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	testdisk comes to mind
2007-11-30T14:32:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	thanks, I'll try that
2007-11-30T14:35:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	I just deleted some files.  It looks like testdisk is for recovering partitions.
2007-11-30T14:36:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	it can also perform file recovery too I believe
2007-11-30T14:36:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	hold a sec
2007-11-30T14:38:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	Photorec perhaps
2007-11-30T14:39:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	or something in Ubuntu Rescue Remix
2007-11-30T14:41:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	I'm trying photorec now.  It looks like it's what I'm looking for,
2007-12-27T04:43:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	you need to modprobe ndiswrapper
2007-12-27T04:43:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	and blacklist any alternate modules that would prevent ndiswrapper from working
2007-12-27T04:43:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	if you want ndiswrapper to load on startup, you need to add ndiswrapper to your /etc/modules
2007-12-27T04:44:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	the modprobe didn't work.  what modules conflict with ndiswrapper?
2007-12-27T04:44:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	it would show as alternate drivers or something when you do ndiswrapper -l
2007-12-27T04:45:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	how do I disable prism2_usb?
2007-12-27T04:46:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-12-27T04:46:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	then add blacklist prism2_usb on a new line at the bottom, then save
2007-12-27T04:46:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	then sudo modprobe -r ndiswrapper, then sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
2007-12-27T04:46:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	then gksudo gedit /etc/modules, add ndiswrapper to a new line at the bottom, save
2007-12-27T04:47:00.000Z	scguy318	alexbobp	if net connectivity still does not work, reboot
2007-12-27T04:48:00.000Z	alexbobp	scguy318	thanks, unloading and reloading it worked.  I didn't even have to reboot.
