2011-09-03T06:04:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	do you have working driver for wireless adapter?
2011-09-03T06:04:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	yes, I have an XP driver installed and verified by ndiswrapper
2011-09-03T06:14:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	is wg311 the name of your driver?
2011-09-03T06:14:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	yes
2011-09-03T06:15:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	are you sure the module is loaded? does it turn up when you do lsmod?

2011-09-03T06:18:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	dude lsmod output has no wg311 listed. that probably means you don't have the driver installed

2011-09-03T06:21:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	sorry i'm not familiar with ndiswrapper
2011-09-03T06:21:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	that's ok thanks though
2011-09-03T06:21:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	stupid netgear!
2011-09-03T06:21:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	maybe you need to load the driver...?
2011-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	thought that's what I did already....maybe I am doing something wrong?
2011-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	ok.....
2011-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	i thought ubuntu would set up wireless automatically? no?
2011-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	this was an upgrade from 8.04 to 10.04.....guess not
2011-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	maybe try a different driver?
2011-09-03T06:24:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	maybe
2011-09-03T06:25:00.000Z	penos	NeedWirelessHelp	or try ubuntu 11.4
2011-09-03T06:25:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	heh, that's an option.
2011-09-03T06:26:00.000Z	NeedWirelessHelp	penos	thanks again
