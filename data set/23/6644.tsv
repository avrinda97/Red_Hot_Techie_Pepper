2006-09-29T06:51:00.000Z	TheMafia		does crossover office make itunes 7 work?
2006-09-29T06:51:00.000Z	TheMafia		I can't seem to get itunes working with my ipod and vmware server
2006-09-29T06:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	doubtful
2006-09-29T06:52:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	ok, how disapopointing.
2006-09-29T06:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	You probably have to upgrade to edgy to get support for your iPod if you've every used it with iTunes 7 and/or just bought it in the last two weeks.
2006-09-29T07:02:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	I thought dapper was the latest?  Can I upgrade dapper to edgy or do I have to do a reinstall?
2006-09-29T07:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	edgy is beta
2006-09-29T07:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	sudo "update-manager -c -d"
2006-09-29T07:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	That should offer to upgrade you to edgy
2006-09-29T07:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	gksu "update-manager -c -d"
2006-09-29T07:05:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	how beta is edgy?  I am a redhat guy that has recently switched to ubuntu, is edgy real unstable
2006-09-29T07:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	Remember, before you do that, edgy is still beta and about a month away from release.
2006-09-29T07:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	Works great for me, not so great for others.
2006-09-29T07:07:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	when it is officially released, will the beta version upgrade?
2006-09-29T07:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	yep
2006-09-29T07:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	It'll actually offer to update once a day from today on so you'll get to 6.10 final a bit at a time without one massive upgrade later.
2007-12-09T18:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	Only if you have an Intel Core or Core 2 processor
2007-12-09T18:05:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	do you think qemu is a better choice?
2007-12-09T18:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	Not really
2007-12-09T18:06:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	centrino duo work for xen
2007-12-09T18:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	If you want to run Windows on Linux with the least amount of pain vmware is the way to go. It's faster, easier, and has more features.
2007-12-09T18:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	TheMafia	Centrino Duo is Core 2 Duo
2007-12-09T18:07:00.000Z	TheMafia	Amaranth	ok
