2009-03-12T21:36:00.000Z	JensenDied	tombom62	do you have fbsetbg installed? (i know there was an app that wasnt installed with fluxbox that i needed to get it to work)
2009-03-12T21:36:00.000Z	tombom62		jensendied: yep, that's ow i do it
2009-03-12T21:36:00.000Z	tombom62		it just doesnt stay
2009-03-12T21:37:00.000Z	tombom62		's ok.
2009-03-12T21:39:00.000Z	tombom62		jensendied: It's not a big prbolem, what i have is something like (in xterm) fbsetbg /home/owner/relientk1.png
2009-03-12T21:39:00.000Z	JensenDied	tombom62	i think Esetroot is the one that it tries to invoke at startup
2009-03-12T21:40:00.000Z	tombom62		jensendied: what is that? ive seen it before
2009-03-12T21:40:00.000Z	JensenDied	tombom62	worst case add a line to your .flux/startup file
