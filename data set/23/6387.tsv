2006-05-27T13:49:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	It depends what it involves
2006-05-27T13:50:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	i have phpgroupware setup... and when i try to access it thru another machine it doesn;t allow me to get in... but when i flush the tables it allows me
2006-05-27T13:50:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	i awnna add port 80
2006-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	You want to allow port 80 from a specific place or from anywhere ?
2006-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	Or do you need to forward that port ?
2006-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	anywhere
2006-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	i need it to allow stuff comin from anywhere thats trying to get thru port 80
2006-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	port 80 is what is fwding my phpgw and when the tables are flushed i can acces it but now i realize i gotta add a line to my script that will allow it
2006-05-27T13:54:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	Pastebin the script (and tell me the interfaces you are using) and I will give you the iptables lines (I still don't understand the thru part are you doing portforwarding or do you want to accept connections on a firewalled interface on port 80 ?)
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	u want my script i am already running?
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	Do you already have iptables rules setup ? If you have it would be easiest if I could see them
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	freezey		i alreayd have them
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	freezey		i need to add that line
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	h3sp4wn		!flood
2006-05-27T13:56:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	ok let me try this in a better way..... ok i have phpgroupware running on my system and i had to configure it... in order to access it from an remote site its http://myip/phpgroupware and its fwd'd thru port 80 on my router
2006-05-27T13:56:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	but when my iptables are not flushed it can;t access the server because it doesn;t have the permission...... when i flush them i can access it from any machine with no problem
2006-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	i have to add traffic thru port 80 and allow it from anywhere
2006-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	h3sp4wn		freezey:Have you set iptables up yourself manually ?
2006-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	yes
2006-05-27T13:58:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	freezey	pastebin the script and i will give you the lines you need
2006-05-27T14:00:00.000Z	freezey	h3sp4wn	you get that pm?
