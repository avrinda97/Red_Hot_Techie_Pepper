2005-03-23T11:09:00.000Z	djtansey		this is non-ubuntu specific (but necessary for an ubuntu install). i need a small linux image that can be loaded into memory from grub (vmlinuz/initrd.gz pair). i need it to split a windows fat32 partition i have (so i can mount a ubuntu install CD image as a loopback device) and then i need an ubuntu install cd that has support for the module loop. help?
2005-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i recommend splitting the partition first before anything else.  google for "system rescue cd" and use qtparted
2005-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	yeah -- but i have no CDrom... so it has to be a rescue CD i can boot the image from grub (which i have working alongside windows)
2005-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	i will be wiping windows when i do hte install. old laptop -- i have nothing. and ubuntu doesn't support my stupid wifi card so  ican't install from the network
2005-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i didn't know grub could boot an iso image copied to a partition... there's a weird trick in bsd installers to do that, but i dont know anything more about it
2005-03-23T11:13:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	it can't. it can boot ubuntu's installer (vmlinuz/initrd.gz) from the partition and then the installer can loopback an ISO. but grub can load a virtual floppy image -- trying to find one with parted that is only one disk
2005-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i suspect you'll need multiple steps.  if you have hardware access, it might be better to steal another machine's cdrom and drop it in
2005-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	it's a laptop, and i don't have a usb CDROM. or a pcmcia ethernet card. i pretty much am forced to install it from the harddrive
2005-03-23T11:16:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	maybe i could just mirror some linux distribution that is already laid-out (doesn't require an installer) and then work from there.
2005-03-23T11:17:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	hm, no cd and no net.  challenging ...  how are you going to transfer the iso image over?
2005-03-23T11:17:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	built-in ethernet or just some winmodem?
2005-03-23T11:18:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	ancient (1998?) ultralight. one usb. audio in/out. pcmcia. nothing else.
2005-03-23T11:19:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i'm curious how you'll get the iso image onto it then.  anyway, you can get ntfsresize on a floppy, then format the new partition as fat in windows
2005-03-23T11:21:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i suspect you'll need a full-blown partition editor.  google for parted floppy,  or partman floppy
2005-03-23T11:21:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	this is the plan -- split the partition. make a 550mb one. put the ISO of ubuntu (hopefully) onto that partition. configure grub to use that ISO's vmlinuz/initrd.gz pair and then mount the iso as a loopback device from a shell in the installer. then it will install from the ISO. then i wipe the ISO and merge it back into the / partition
2005-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	trying. parted has one. but when i booted from it, it seemed to indicate i needed another floppy. researching that.
2005-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	yah it's probably a multi-floppy thing.  you just stick the other floppy in and hit a key
2005-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	i have no floppy drive :) -- i'm using virtual floppies from images on windows through grub
2005-03-23T11:23:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	no floppy, no cdrom, no network.  you have yourself a real big challenge
2005-03-23T11:24:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	yeah -- but i have network when in windows (the linksys i use card isn't supported in linux)
2005-03-23T11:24:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	i hesitate to ask how you're going to install anything on linux
2005-03-23T11:24:00.000Z	sproingie	djtansey	you sure?  most linksys hardware is decently supported.  it's probably a dec/intel tulip driver.  use a 2.6 kernel, should work fine
2005-03-23T11:25:00.000Z	djtansey	sproingie	i am going to get the thing to work with ndiswrapper once i have ubuntu installed. it's a 802.11g linksys card that google says isn't supported.
