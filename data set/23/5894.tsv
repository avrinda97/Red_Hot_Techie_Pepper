2006-09-21T06:16:00.000Z	JackONeill	_mason	don't watch firefly.... I don't want to see the furlings, gotta leave some things for another spin off... also we need to bring back the Aschen
2006-09-21T06:16:00.000Z	JackONeill	_mason	SG-1 should concentrate on the mild annoyances of the Trust/Lucian Alliance and just 'majoritively' kill off the Ori... then end SG-1
