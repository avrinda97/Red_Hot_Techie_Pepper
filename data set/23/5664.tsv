2008-06-29T23:27:00.000Z	user_	Fryguy--	make clean maybe?
2008-06-29T23:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	make clean removes intermediate compiled object files by convention, it won't remove installed files
2008-07-06T01:25:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	pptp-client is a nice package, and network-manager has pptp support built in
2008-07-06T01:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	sudo apt-get install package name
2008-07-06T01:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	if you are in ubuntu, just right click on the network icon on top right and set up a vpn there
2008-07-06T01:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	sudo apt-get install pptp-client, and like i said, just right click on the network icon on the top right of your screen and set up the vpn that way
2008-07-06T01:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	ssh can be very secure, what is the problem
2008-07-06T01:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	there is no ssh v3
2008-07-06T01:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	no it doesn't
2008-07-06T01:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	and certainly not any more or less than any other piece of security-relevant software

2008-07-06T01:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	sudo apt-get install pptpd
2008-07-06T01:49:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	if you like source, then you probably shouldn't be using ubuntu, and you should use a distribution more suitable for source compilations
2008-07-06T01:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	in ubuntu, the ubuntu way is to use the precompiled binary packages in it's repository for as much as possible.  you are defeating a large point of the purpse of ubuntu
2008-07-06T01:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	sudo apt-get install pptpclient i think, or apt-cache search pptp and check out the results

2008-07-06T02:06:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	so then switch back to whatever you were using before
2008-07-06T02:08:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	compiling in ubuntu is just as hard as compiling in centos
2008-07-06T02:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	right, it's not the way you should be installing software in most distributions of linux
2008-07-06T02:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	distributions pre-package software for you for a reason (centos included)
2008-07-06T02:12:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	i don't you earlier to enable multiverse and universe repositories in synaptic, in the system menu
2008-07-06T02:16:00.000Z	Fryguy--	user_	this isn't the correct place to be asking about conducting security audits on corporate  networks
