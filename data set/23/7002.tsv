2005-12-11T16:20:00.000Z	ubuntu2		that happens when you mount -t WRONG_FS
2005-12-11T16:20:00.000Z	ubuntu2		if its FAT32, use -t vfat
2005-12-11T16:20:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	nothing if WRONG_FS isn't any filesystem name in /proc/filesystems
2005-12-11T17:15:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	old one. I think we now have 8.xmt
2005-12-11T17:16:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	why would we need a newer version?
2005-12-11T17:17:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	older? why?
2005-12-11T17:23:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	 from within windows?
2005-12-11T17:24:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	so you need a dos first to run ghost right? so why not have a CD that has dos and ghost and networking
2005-12-11T17:24:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	I know a thing or two about legacy systems, no news to me ;-)
2005-12-11T17:24:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	doesn't help
2005-12-11T17:30:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	your needs some loving IMHO :-)
2005-12-11T17:31:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	the reason why I want to use linux is that I can go full network boot - install over network way
2005-12-11T17:34:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	that's ok. most of my projects are trying to do something that hasn't been done before, so I'm quite used to finding out and testing myself ;-)
2005-12-11T17:41:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	you know anything about older ghosts?
2005-12-11T06:12:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	hmm?
2005-12-11T06:13:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	oh no. got back to my other project. writing curses software ;-)
2005-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	related to the ghost stuff though
2005-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	it's a large project, ghost is only one small part of it
2005-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	that'd be cool, thanks
2005-12-11T07:27:00.000Z	ubuntu2	czr	these are from Ghost 2001 Personal (not business ed.)
2005-12-11T07:36:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	that's supposed to help me? :-)
2005-12-11T07:41:00.000Z	ubuntu2	czr	Ill still be able to see what you say about me ;P so no badmouthing
2005-12-11T07:41:00.000Z	czr	ubuntu2	say about you? hmm?
