2008-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	scientes		anyway tp turn off al the compiz animations
2008-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	scientes		i like the functionality and have a fast macine but animations are honestly uite useless and nauseating
2008-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	scientes		most things you can only make really fast but cant turn off transition animation on
2008-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	scientes		oi am using that
2008-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 i disable most stuff. and just enable what i like
2009-01-13T21:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 i edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file to change mine
2009-01-13T21:23:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	hmm looks good there wonder why every other linux comp shows up in windows but not this one
2009-01-13T21:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 ive had so many weird quirks with Vista and XP and samba lately.. its scary.
2009-01-13T21:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 so the linux box is only NOT showing up to one windows pc eh?
2009-01-13T21:24:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	xp works great but vista is a pain
2009-01-13T21:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 i have an issue where XP and vista machines are not seeing each other.. but they both see the linux box ihage.. and it can see both of them
2009-01-13T21:25:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	its funny thats the type i see, windows sucks linux rues :)
2012-03-17T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 never really heard of much wasted space. perhaps backed up conffigs
2012-03-17T09:58:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	no i'm talking with the squashfs?
2012-03-17T10:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 you mean a persistant save file setup on a live-flash setup
2012-03-17T10:00:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	yeah
2012-03-17T10:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 i normally people to not 'update/upgrade' such a setup. but to do a full normal install
2012-03-17T10:01:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	i'm not talking about "normal" im talking about a hypothetical
2012-03-17T10:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 no idea then. im all about what ive done for 'real'
2012-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	is it possible to install the liveCD installer on a normal system, then burn it to a CD, and use it as an install CD?
2012-03-17T10:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 you mean make a custome instller cd that way?
2012-03-17T10:15:00.000Z	scientes	dr_willis	yeah
2012-03-17T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	scientes	 it will do a normal install. your persistant file changes will not get moved over
