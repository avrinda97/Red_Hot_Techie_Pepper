2012-05-28T17:37:00.000Z	burek		seriously? :)
2012-05-28T17:38:00.000Z	burek		well, mainainer(s) of a ffmpeg's fork, named libav/avconv (whatever), decided to put a message like this in his build of ffmpeg
2012-05-28T17:38:00.000Z	burek		for ubuntu
2012-05-28T17:38:00.000Z	burek		http://paste.ubuntu.com/1011264/
2012-05-28T17:38:00.000Z	burek		"This program is not developed anymore and is only provided for compatibility. Use avconv instead (see Changelog for the list of incompatible changes)."
2012-05-28T17:39:00.000Z	burek		ffmpeg is fairly alive and active
2012-05-28T17:39:00.000Z	burek		and that kind of putting misleading messages, from the point of a maintainer is really not helping anyone
2012-05-28T17:39:00.000Z	burek		this is cmd line ffmpeg
2012-05-28T17:40:00.000Z	burek		the maintainer(s) purposefully put that message in the source code of ffmpeg, to display such a message
2012-05-28T17:40:00.000Z	burek		which is hardly to say rude
2012-05-28T17:40:00.000Z	popey	burek	file a bug
2012-05-28T17:40:00.000Z	popey	burek	if you want to talk to the developer, yes
2012-05-28T17:41:00.000Z	popey	burek	and you believe it's misleading or wrong. talking to the air in here won't fix it

2012-05-28T17:51:00.000Z	burek	popey	jrib: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1005536
2012-05-28T17:52:00.000Z	popey	burek	you know libav added that, not us?
2012-05-28T17:52:00.000Z	burek	popey	in that case you should freeze libav from ubuntu distribution
2012-05-28T17:54:00.000Z	popey	burek	are you going to file a bug against debian too?
2012-05-28T17:56:00.000Z	popey	burek	i investigated it and gave you the name of the person who made the commit â˜¹
2012-05-28T17:56:00.000Z	popey	burek	you could talk to them rather than rant at us
2012-05-28T17:57:00.000Z	popey	burek	ask Reinhard Tartler, he maintains it for Ubuntu
