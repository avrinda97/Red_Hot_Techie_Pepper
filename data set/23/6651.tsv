2006-05-01T07:17:00.000Z	GoDawgs		wanna know how to add programs to the applications menu once their installed through synaptic
2006-05-01T07:18:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	applications > system tools > applications menu editor
2006-05-01T07:18:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	ok... let me give that a shot... thanks
2006-05-01T07:19:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	I don't have that open... even when I go into alacarte menu editor
2006-05-01T07:19:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	you don't have what open?
2006-05-01T07:20:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-05-01T07:21:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	well applications menu editor is alacarte
2006-05-01T07:22:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	ok, then I'm confused... why aren't the programs I downloaded there?  could they be somewhere else?
2006-05-01T07:22:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	what program in particular?  (not all programs get a menu item, although if it is a gui program it should and you should file a bug0
2006-05-01T07:22:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	it's a gmail notifier
2006-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	let me see what the specific name of it is
2006-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	I thought it was a panel insert though
2006-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	try 'killall gnome-panel' and then check your internet menu again
2006-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	ok
2006-05-01T07:24:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	it's the mail watcher plugin for the Xfce4 panel
2006-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	maybe that's my problem... it's for xfce4... what's xfce4?  is that another name for gnome?
2006-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	no it's a different desktop environment
2006-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	oh... so it's not compatible with gnome?
2006-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	is the package, gmail-notify ?
2006-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	no... it's mail watcher plugin for the Xfce4 panel
2006-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	_jason	GoDawgs	ok, not sure about that then.  And I'm not familiar with xfce to tell you how to add a shortcut in the menu
2006-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	GoDawgs	_jason	no problem... thanks for trying though...
