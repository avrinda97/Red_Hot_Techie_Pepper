2007-11-30T11:14:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		can someone help me? i spent hours organizing my contacts in pidgin the way i wanted them, but it keeps forgetting them and i have to redo everything over and over again.. how do i make it stay?
2007-11-30T11:14:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	it may be a bug
2007-11-30T11:15:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	thanks
2007-11-30T11:21:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	what exactly happens in pidgin
2007-11-30T11:22:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	 well it defaulty has like 15 groups.. and i only want 2... so i dragged them all into the appropriate groups .... then when i restart it... it ungroups them where i had them and readds the old deleted groups
2007-11-30T11:23:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	mine did that once and i moved them again and it hasnt messed up lately
2007-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	if your googling you can also just post the link here
2007-11-30T11:42:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	well i'm finding forum posts so instead of having him or her read thru the whole thing i was just gunna post the command
2007-11-30T11:43:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	yes thats a really nice thing to do
2007-11-30T11:44:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	but instead of rushing from page to page to get info may not be the best route for others sometimes they need to read it themselfes
2007-11-30T11:44:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	 okee dokee
2007-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	i didnt mean to be a jerk but i like to enforce the lurk more method because learning how things work rather than just commands is a lot more helpful in the long run
2007-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	explain further??
2007-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	a lot of times on forums people give good hints as to why certain commands act the way tey do and learning about a certain distro and its install methods will help in the future if problems arise
2007-11-30T11:50:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	as in knowing how apt-get works and where the downloads come from
2007-11-30T11:51:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	allrighty!  yah i've only sorta figured those out
2007-11-30T11:51:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	but i forget everytime i go to put in a new repository.. and have to look it up again.. one day i will memorize it LOL
2007-11-30T12:07:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	its a nice look congrats
2007-11-30T12:08:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	thanks it took me FOREVER to find the icons i wanted but i'm really happy with it... i can't fully do it up the way i want unless i learn to make them myself.. but i'm happy with my current result
2007-11-30T12:09:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	you can make your own icons using "the gimp"
2007-11-30T12:10:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	soldats	i like my icons.. but i wanna make the mouse pointers.. but me and gimp will be about as effective as me with a paper and pencil... 4 yr old adhd child on crack with a broken crayon
2007-11-30T12:10:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	lol
2007-11-30T12:34:00.000Z	soldats	jayde_drag0n	you should be able to use any .png
