2005-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	eskilo		how can i find out which version of a given library or app i have installed, or is available with apt-search?
2005-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	eskilo		apt-cache search..
2005-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	eskilo		[NikO] :  are you from France?
2005-02-23T11:58:00.000Z	eskilo		[NikO] :  You need to sleep the boo _for_ five seconds.
2005-02-23T11:58:00.000Z	eskilo		say "for" instead of "during".
2005-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	eskilo		"for" means during the whole time.  "during" just means at some point or points, but not continuously through.  if i talked "during" a movie, that could mean that i just said a few things during the movie, not for the ENTIRE movie. :)
2005-02-23T12:00:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	are you German :)
2005-02-23T12:04:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 oh..i tried that earlier only i didn't use a * at the end..now i see i.
2005-02-23T12:05:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 does that only check for system-installed libraries?
2005-02-23T12:05:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 because i'm trying to compile from source.  do i need to copy those libs to /usr/local/lib?
2005-02-23T12:06:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	chances are you need -dev versions of the libraries
2005-02-23T12:06:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 okay.  but a local compile can see libs in both /usr/lib/ and /usr/local/lib right?
2005-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	kernel patches, mdk shut this thing down ubuntu doesn't nor does my custom
2005-02-23T12:29:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	probably not worth th time acpi=force is one I have heard work, but who knows ...
2005-02-28T09:23:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	XFCE$ is what you want hten, it is *the* best, I ysed gnome for a week, thought it was nice, started XFCE again today, and that is it :)
2005-02-28T09:35:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	xfce have already done that for you
2005-02-28T09:36:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	practically yes
2005-02-28T09:37:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 interesting.  when i last used it, it didn't seem to do anything better than gnome.
2005-02-28T09:40:00.000Z	eskilo	bascule	 good point about balanced.
2005-02-28T09:41:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	yeah it was what I really wanted, and xfce does that for mew
2005-02-28T09:41:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	err, I dunno, i chroot ubuntu most of the time
2005-02-28T10:12:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	you didn't like it :(
2005-02-28T10:13:00.000Z	bascule	eskilo	compared to Gnome you thought that ... ????
