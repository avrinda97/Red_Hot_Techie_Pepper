2008-01-18T20:15:00.000Z	partypants		I have an hp530 notebook, the wireless card is an Intel 3945ABG, and I am pretty sure I have downloaded the correct driver. I am new to this and the readme says something about editing the kernal, but it isn't step-by-step on how to do that. If anyone could help get me started I would very much appreciate it.
2008-01-18T20:15:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	using gutsy?
2008-01-18T20:16:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	yes
2008-01-18T20:26:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	that is the best supported card around today
2008-01-18T20:27:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	Well perhaps I'm stupid or something, and it isn't a driver issue.
2008-01-18T20:27:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	not at all; getting wireless going can be a challenge at first
2008-01-18T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	you can sudo dhclient if your card sees the AP
2008-01-18T20:43:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	this is via the gui? wpa I'm guessing
2008-01-18T20:46:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	Yeah in the gui, I am using 64bit hex encryption
2008-01-18T20:47:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	this is wep, wpa, wpa2 which one
2008-01-18T20:48:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	may as well leave it open then; wep is very insecure--a better bet would be wpa2
2008-01-18T20:49:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	i'm not to worried about hackers, just blocking the casual user
2008-01-18T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	can you set the router?
2008-01-18T20:52:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	set to what?
2008-01-18T20:53:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	can you set the router ie a home router, or is this roaming like at a starbucks etc
2008-01-18T20:53:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	yes it is my router
2008-01-18T20:54:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	but I would rather leave it encrypted
2008-01-18T20:55:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	I always had an easier time with wpa2 using passphrase; though as that is offtopic and it is wep then perhaps you should set the ap via ifconfig/iwconfig
2008-01-18T20:56:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	ok I will try setting it with iwconfig
2008-01-18T20:56:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	once you have set it via the cli it should acquire it automatically on boot
2008-01-18T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	command line is cli
2008-01-18T20:59:00.000Z	bazhang	partypants	in the terminal
2008-01-18T20:59:00.000Z	partypants	bazhang	ok
