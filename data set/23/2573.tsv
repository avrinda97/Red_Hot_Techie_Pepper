2009-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	jimmyj		Hi, can anyone help me with some graphics driver issues please
2009-01-20T16:28:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	join the club :)
2009-01-20T16:28:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	lol, spent all day yesterday and got nowhere
2009-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	whatever you do DO NOT install the driver from the nvidia site.  totally screwed my xserver and had to reinstall the os
2009-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	ok, already did that, will i need to reinstall ?
2009-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	well, if you can get gdm and x to start, then you're ahead of where i was
2009-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	yeah they start but only in low-graphics mode
2009-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	after i installed the driver from the site, i couldn't get of of command line.  that's why i started over again
2009-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	think i'm just gonna re-install os anyway - i'm sure in all my tinkering i may have messed something up
2009-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	you will still be stuck in low res mode though... that's why i'm here
2009-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	you had any progress at all ?
2009-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	nope, just watching zamba's progress.  after asking the question for an hour zamba finally got someone to answer
2009-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	apparently zamba had luck with getting rid of xorg.conf - go figure
2009-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	yeh i have tried restoring xorg.conf to original ver - no luck
2009-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	remove it all together ?
2009-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	yeah
2009-01-20T16:41:00.000Z	jimmyj	bill-nz	& koopee: will try that now
2009-01-20T16:54:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	same
2009-01-20T16:56:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	out of curiosity, what brand monitor are you using?
2009-01-20T16:58:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	i just found out by looking at the x log that the EDID (the plug & play for the monitor) info is being rejected
2009-01-20T17:00:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	yeah, that's what I thought, but 8.10 doesn't seem to populate the xorg.conf file like it used to
2009-01-20T17:08:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	try turning your monitor off and on - sometimes this helps
2009-01-20T17:10:00.000Z	bill-nz	jimmyj	are your hsync  and vsync set correctly?
