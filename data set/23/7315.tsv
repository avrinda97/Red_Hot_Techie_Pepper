2005-09-07T16:00:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	because this is an Apache support channel?
2005-09-07T16:00:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	because the apache channel inst responsive right now :)
2005-09-07T16:00:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	however read http://tinyurl.com/2rfwr on the subject of mass virtual hosts
2005-09-07T16:01:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	your fucking funny, but next time ask me if i already tried google
2005-09-07T16:02:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	I just did that search and I got quite a few URLs to documents that explain it in detail.
2005-09-07T16:02:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	not specifically on my question
2005-09-07T16:03:00.000Z	opman		if you look into them
2005-09-07T16:03:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	specifically on your question...
2005-09-07T16:03:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	..
2005-09-07T16:04:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/mass.html
2005-09-07T16:04:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	ive looked at that, it doesnt even mention subdomains
2005-09-07T16:04:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	it does not make a difference.
2005-09-07T16:05:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	i want it automatically to map subdomains, so i would have to use some mod_Rewrite or something to grab the subdomain name and change the url path
2005-09-07T16:05:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	note that Apache is not a DNS server, the domains or subdomains must already exist.
2005-09-07T16:06:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	i have already setup bind9 to catch all subdomains
2005-09-07T16:06:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	so the section "Simple dynamic virtual hosts" shows how to do the mapping.
2005-09-07T16:07:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	not for "sub" domains,   mapping /htdocs/www.test.com/abc to abc.test.com
2005-09-07T16:07:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	I'd like to point out that the mapping goes the other way...
2005-09-07T16:08:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	that doesnt matter
2005-09-07T16:08:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	and ir works as in '/htdocs/abs.test.com/' whats wrong with that.
2005-09-07T16:08:00.000Z	opman	Blissex	becasue thats not the way i want it?,
2005-09-07T16:09:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	then use 'mod_rewrite' or write your own version of the 'mod_vhost_alias' module.
2005-09-07T16:09:00.000Z	Blissex	opman	but consider http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html and the '%N.M' syntax
