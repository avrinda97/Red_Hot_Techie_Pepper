2008-08-05T10:36:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco: what kind of video card do you have ?
2008-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	nvidia gforce 6800gts
2008-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  try this in terminal > sudo displayconfig-gtk
2008-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	ok.. wait
2008-08-05T10:38:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  configure your monitor, you dont have to go with defaults, find the specs of your montir in terminal > sudo ddcprobe
2008-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	im look this... the max size is 800x600
2008-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	binasco		=/
2008-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  dont go past the limits of your monitor, as it can have some bad effects, check in terminal > sudo ddcprobe
2008-08-05T10:40:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco: click on model, and choose the size that best matches your montor
2008-08-05T10:41:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	ddcprobe .. command not found
2008-08-05T10:41:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  if you have LCD choose LCD models, if you have CRT choose CRT models
2008-08-05T10:42:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	binasco	:  sudo ddcprobe     not found ? ok
2008-08-05T10:42:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  how old is the monitor and what kind is it CRT or LCD ?
2008-08-05T10:43:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco: ﻿sorin-mihai:  has the right idea, but it still comes down to monitor and not neccesarily graphics card. the card can function fine, just needs to know what the monitor limits are, alot of times, Plug and Pray mis-identifies them
2008-08-05T10:43:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	now instaled....
2008-08-05T10:44:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	next?
2008-08-05T10:44:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  you chos e amonitor that is matching the one you have ?
2008-08-05T10:45:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  nvidia-settings should allow you to change it to the correct settigns, if it doesnt then gksu displayconfig-gtk   is the only way to go, as the other workarounds are not supported
2008-08-05T10:45:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	WOOOWWW... nice
2008-08-05T10:45:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿binasco:  do you have it ?
2008-08-05T10:45:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	im fix in nvidia-settings
2008-08-05T10:46:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿sorin-mihai:  yes , some cards are a little funny, it is more of the steps taken in certain order rather than the right commands.
2008-08-05T10:46:00.000Z	binasco	DozedOnLinux	VERY THANKS
