2009-02-19T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	press ctrl + minus key
2009-02-19T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	also try: View > Zoom > Zoom text only
2009-02-19T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	what version of firefox?

2009-02-19T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	good its the stable release
2009-02-19T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	ok try: killall firefox; mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla_old; firefox $
2009-02-19T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	this will rename your firefox profile just to test
2009-02-19T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	we can rename it back
2009-02-19T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	i assume nothing in here
2009-02-19T14:29:00.000Z	ZeZu	ActionParsnip	doesn't help
2009-02-19T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	ok, delete the newly created profile folder and rename back so you have your original profile folder
2009-02-19T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	so we know its not profile related
2009-02-19T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get --reinstall install firefox
2009-02-19T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	is firfox ok now?
2009-02-19T14:37:00.000Z	ZeZu	ActionParsnip	no that didn't change anything either
2009-02-19T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	you could completely uninstall (and purge) firefox and all its dependancies, then reinstall it
2009-02-19T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get install firefox
2009-04-07T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeZu	you may want to use   -t ntfs-3g
2009-04-07T00:40:00.000Z	ZeZu	ActionParsnip	that is detected pretty easily these days
