2006-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	Twohead		has anyone an idea?
2006-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	Are you getting to the main menu?
2006-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	Where you choose what you want to do?
2006-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	OK
2006-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	try it again, but this time select "check cd for defects"
2006-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	you have enough memory?
2006-11-04T10:25:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	When was your computer made?
2006-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	If you're talking to me, start your line off with a "Lone:" so that it's highlighted for me and so other people know you aren't talking to them.
2006-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	o.k.
2006-11-04T10:27:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	my hardware is o.k...
2006-11-04T10:28:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	hmmm
2006-11-04T10:28:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	i think that is a problem with the ata/sdata controller an the HD
2006-11-04T10:29:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	What BIOS do you have?
2006-11-04T10:30:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	OK, go into Setup and check to see if your drives are being identified
2006-11-04T10:30:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	yes, they are identified
2006-11-04T10:31:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	Well, this is where my limited suggestions end... my only other thought would be to open your computer and check to see if all the cables are fully inserted into your CD/DVD drive
2006-11-04T10:32:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	that was my problem
2006-11-04T10:32:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	i checked it also...
2006-11-04T10:33:00.000Z	Twohead	Lone	so i habe no idea, what i can do....that the reason to come here#
2006-11-04T10:34:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	Ask the question again, maybe somebody with more knowledge can help you.
2006-11-04T10:34:00.000Z	Lone	Twohead	No problem.
