2006-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat		without the quotes
2006-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	I was wondering if you could help me with two hardware troubles.
2006-03-12T06:52:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	what seems to be your problem?
2006-03-12T06:54:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	My second problem involves attempting to mount my floppy drive
2006-03-12T06:54:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	how ar eyou trying to mount it
2006-03-12T06:55:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	I type "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/floppy0" in the console
2006-03-12T06:56:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	very strange.  try going to /dev and typing ls ?
2006-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	I typed ls
2006-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	did it reveal and fd tpe devices?
2006-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	what is it (exactly?)
2006-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	try mounting it with your previous command
2006-03-12T07:00:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	I get "/dev/fb0 is not a block device"
2006-03-12T07:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	oooh, fb.  I thought you said fd.
2006-03-12T07:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	does it show anything called fd*?  maybe just fd?  try mounting that (not fb, sorry)
2006-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	ok.  Then I guess your floppy drive isn't showing up on the system at all
2006-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	hmm...  which is strange
2006-03-12T07:03:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	It shows up in the file manager
2006-03-12T07:04:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	right click it and see what the device name is under properties?
2006-03-12T07:06:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	device name is "Floppy 1"
2006-03-12T07:06:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Munchkinguy	wow, what in the world.
2006-03-12T07:07:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	FunnyLookinHat	Forget it. I'm going to eat supper.
