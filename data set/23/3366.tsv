2008-11-07T01:40:00.000Z	glacius		hey guys
2008-11-07T01:40:00.000Z	glacius		quick question
2008-11-07T01:40:00.000Z	glacius		I am not getting any sound out of my headphones
2008-11-07T01:41:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	are you on a desktop and using the front connector?
2008-11-07T01:42:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	no I am using notebook and a connector on the side
2008-11-07T01:42:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	is the sound coming out the laptops speakers
2008-11-07T01:43:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	yes
2008-11-07T01:44:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	seems like the sound card treats both as separate connections.. check the audio mixer (double click on the speaker on the top right of the screen) take a look at volume levels
2008-11-07T01:46:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	everything is fine line in and front mic muted
2008-11-07T01:48:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	do you see headphone?
2008-11-07T01:49:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	under switches there is a headphone option that is checked
2008-11-07T01:54:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	under switches there is a headphone option that is checked
2008-11-07T02:05:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	in playback.. if you dont see headphones click on edit->preferences and look for headphones and select it
2008-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	ignore that
2008-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	ok
2008-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	its checked already
2008-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	actually.. do that.. forget about switches.. in the playback tab.. make sure there is a headphone column
2008-11-07T02:07:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	its checked but it is only in switches tab
2008-11-07T02:08:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	there might be something that is not proper.. mess around with mixer settings.. and see if something will cause sound to come out of the headphones.. (unless ofcourse the issue is in the headphones being broken :-P)
2008-11-07T02:09:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	nothe hp isfine works with mp3 player
2008-11-07T02:12:00.000Z	djhash	glacius	yeah.. the only thing is to check the mixer settings.. maybe something ended up not being labelled properly.. its possible that the port is not headphones.. but rather aux or line out etc..
2008-11-07T02:12:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	ok
2008-11-07T02:18:00.000Z	glacius	djhash	thanks i will continue to search
