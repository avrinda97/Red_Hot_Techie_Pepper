2004-12-03T08:11:00.000Z	robertj		I support a sizable number of OS X users, and the Computer menu is never touched
2004-12-03T08:12:00.000Z	robertj		Sudo is definately great
2004-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	robertj		Gnome places in general need lots of loving
2004-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	robertj		OS 10.3 has their favorite menus done right
2004-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	robertj		like on the GtkFileChooser
2004-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	robertj		you have your bookmarks
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	robertj		and anything you bookmark there shows up in Finder and you can drag stuff to it
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	robertj		also you can click it and open your bookmarked place
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	robertj		yeah
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	mass	robertj	you can also drag files there
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	robertj	mass	indeed
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	mass	robertj	if you _really_ open that file alot ;-)
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	robertj	mass	network resources, anything
2004-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	mass		I just like the consolidation of all the icons into the dock - status notifications and all right there. Of course, system tools are slowly leaking upward into the menubar
2004-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	mass		but apple has promised to break that every major OS release, if you read between the lines
2004-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	mass		'don't do this with non-system code'
2004-12-03T08:16:00.000Z	mass		mmm.. cookies
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	mass		wrong order
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	mass		hoary, then hell, then sarge ;-)
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	robertj	mass	I really like it because it doesn't prompt at all
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	robertj	mass	it's really a scratch space area
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	robertj		no "Are you sure you want to create a shortcut"
2004-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	mass	robertj	prompts are overused. I like the UI design philosophy of 'assume the user isn't a moron, so only prompt them if something they are trying to do is genuinely destructive, like deleting a folder'
