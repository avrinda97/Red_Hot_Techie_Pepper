2007-06-10T09:25:00.000Z	SirKeats		"archive type not supported" is the error i get when trying to open the .deb file
2007-06-10T09:25:00.000Z	SirKeats		(i'm new to linux so am no doubt doing something wrong)
2007-06-10T09:27:00.000Z	SirKeats		that's what i was doing.  well... i said to open
2007-06-10T09:27:00.000Z	SirKeats		is that different than run in linux?

2007-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	SirKeats		k
2007-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	sudo apt-get install gdebi
2007-06-10T09:23:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	check the pidgin website for a deb file
2007-06-10T09:23:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	what error ?
2007-06-10T09:26:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	 don'T try to unpack it ,  deb files are debian installer files, just run it
2007-06-10T09:27:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	I was assuming you were trying to unpack it ,  open should have run it ,
2007-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	just dbl click on it
2007-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	sudo apt-get instal gdebi
2007-06-10T09:41:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	no problem
2007-06-11T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	try typing laptop-mode in the terminal , just a guess
2007-06-11T05:43:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	 you can start gui applications by typing their name inthe terminal
2007-06-26T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	follow the link at the bottom of  the screensaver dialog , that's the best I can do for you, or check in the forum
2007-06-26T07:40:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	 if you do not see it  , assume it is not available for your system
2007-06-26T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	SirKeats	  stanby/suspend/hibernate is tricky in linux anyway, and not wholy reliable
