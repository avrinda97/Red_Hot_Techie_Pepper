2005-09-16T16:32:00.000Z	rainmaker		is there an app to select wich services to run at startup?
2005-09-16T16:34:00.000Z	rainmaker		is it safe to have the same root password as user passwd?
2005-09-16T16:34:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	as long as you don't allow remote root logins, maybe
2005-09-16T16:36:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	how do i disallow remote root logins?
2005-09-16T16:36:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	they're already off by default in sshd and gdm
2005-09-16T16:37:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	by hand you do it with update-rc.d
2005-09-16T16:37:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	no, it's a tool that messes with the symlinks in /etc/rc*
2005-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	update-rc.d -f yourservicename remove
2005-09-16T16:40:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	there are tools that do what you want, I'm searching for one as we speak
2005-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	a-ha! apt-get install sysvconfig
2005-09-16T16:45:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	you think i can disable apmd?
2005-09-16T16:46:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	probably
2005-09-16T05:02:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	you can have it show the number of unread messages in the titlebar
2005-09-16T05:02:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	take a look at the installed plugins.. there's one about message notification
2005-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	how did you say you could make gaim display the amount of unread messeges?
2005-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	Preferences -> Plugins -> Message Notification
2005-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	weird... thats what I tried and it didnt work for some reason
2005-09-16T05:09:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	after you enable it take a look at Plugins -> Mesage Notification
2005-09-16T05:09:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	 it has all the settings i want there
2005-09-16T05:14:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	still no luck with the messege notifacation
2005-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	tga	rainmaker	what exactly did you enable?
2005-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	rainmaker	tga	i figured it out :)
