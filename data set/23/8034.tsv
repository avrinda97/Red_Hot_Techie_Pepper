2008-10-23T10:02:00.000Z	nano404		Karsten: wired
2008-10-23T10:03:00.000Z	nano404		Karsten: i had ubuntu on a laptop before, and it wasn't working, my teacher kept saying something about confuiguring the modem to work with linux, but never elaborated
2008-10-23T10:04:00.000Z	nano404		Karsten: LAN, router
2008-10-23T10:04:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	^^
2008-10-23T10:02:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	How are you trying to get on the Internet?
2008-10-23T10:03:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Do you have local LAN access?  What's your gateway?  Are you using some sort of hardware cable modem / DSL modem / Linksys-type router?
2008-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	OK:  can yo ping the router?
2008-10-23T10:08:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	ping <router IP>
2008-10-23T10:11:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	OK, that means your local networking is set up.
2008-10-23T10:12:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Run the following commands and pastebin output:  /sbin/ifconfig -a; /sbin/route -n
2008-10-23T10:13:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Then write it down and type it back in, or transfer it on a floppy / flash drive / clay tablet.  You're a bright guy, sort it out.
2008-10-23T10:33:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Still here?
2008-10-23T10:33:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	How goes?
2008-10-23T10:37:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	OK, so you've got network and routing.  I'm assuming your router is at 192.168.1.1?
2008-10-23T10:38:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Can you ping 74.125.19.99 (that's one of Google's IPs).
2008-10-23T10:39:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	??
2008-10-23T10:39:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Your *own* IP is 192.168.1.2.  Your router is at 192.168.1.1, which is your gateway.
2008-10-23T10:41:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	Can you resolve it?  "host www.google.com"
2008-10-23T10:45:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	??
2008-10-23T10:45:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	OK.  So what doesn't work about connecting to "the internet"?  All the basics seem to be working.
2008-10-23T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	.. and what's the current situation?
2008-10-23T10:54:00.000Z	karsten	nano404	OK.  Not sure.
