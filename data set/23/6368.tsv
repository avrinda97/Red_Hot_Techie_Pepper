2007-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	no one what?
2007-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	you asked something about singing?
2007-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	no .. about iptables log web based
2007-02-04T07:32:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	You can use many things to make your iptables logs to be viewable throught http. What are your requirements for it?
2007-02-04T07:33:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	i installed iptables_logger_v0.4.tar.gz
2007-02-04T07:33:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	works fine but when i browser to it doesnt shows me any logs ... but if i browser myself to /var/log/firewall are plenty of logs in :)
2007-02-04T07:34:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	Did you check with the people who made the software? as it not being .deb makes it sound it is not packaged for Ubuntu
2007-02-04T07:36:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	there are a lot of packages out there that are not .deb .. but there all are for linux .. isnt ubuntu linux ?
2007-02-04T07:36:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	it should work ... as long as the depends are ok ... it says on the main page of that package
2007-02-04T07:38:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	yes, but would you call Microsoft for Eudora support? :) That is, people here cannot know details on everything that runs on Linux. But if you point me to their website, I can take a look and see if I could see what is wrong. Permissions seem likely problem
2007-02-04T07:41:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	hmm shouldnt be
2007-02-04T07:42:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	If it is http://www.gege.org/iptables, have you configured it following http://www.gege.org/iptables/doc/faq.html#id2716868 ?
2007-02-04T07:43:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	have a look here please  http://www.iptablesrocks.org/guide/analyze.php
2007-02-04T07:46:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	looks like it doesnt read the /var/log/firewall :(
2007-02-04T07:47:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	See the url I gave you. It might be your firewall rules are not logging
2007-02-04T07:48:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	to me looks pretty same
2007-02-04T07:49:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	Are you on dapper or edgy?
2007-02-04T07:49:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	edy
2007-02-04T07:50:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	And you did do sudo /etc/init.d/iptablelog start ?
2007-02-04T07:50:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	Lynoure	sure
2007-02-04T07:51:00.000Z	Lynoure	Thug-N-Me	I think my pro-bono support ends here. Good luck.
