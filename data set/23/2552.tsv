2009-02-25T21:27:00.000Z	Huufarted		Question about Gnome menus.  I've installed a few programs, gparted and tightvnc, but they haven't created icons in the Applications menu.  Anybody know why this would happen?
2009-02-25T21:29:00.000Z	Huufarted		Anybody know why gparted did not install an icon when I installed it through Synaptic?
2009-02-25T21:29:00.000Z	Huufarted		c em?
2009-02-25T21:30:00.000Z	Huufarted		ah, there we go.

2009-02-25T21:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	_VIM_	hehe, I think I found it on accident.
2009-02-25T21:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	_VIM_	but it is useful
2009-02-25T21:33:00.000Z	Huufarted	_VIM_	just kinda bugs me sometimes when an answer that simple doesn't get googled first.  'install flash plugin in Ubuntu' would have found that answer in about 1 minute.
2009-02-25T21:35:00.000Z	_VIM_	Huufarted	yeah I hear ya. In fact I think there's even a google site just for that very thing http://letmegooglethatforyou.com or http://lmgtfy.com/
