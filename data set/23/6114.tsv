2010-04-08T04:07:00.000Z	xiven		I need help
2010-04-08T04:07:00.000Z	xiven		With Apache2 and PHP5
2010-04-08T04:07:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2010-04-08T04:07:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	follow the troubleshooting steps for that issue on the link ubottu gave you
2010-04-08T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	did you read the link ubottu gave you?
2010-04-08T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	and the results?
2010-04-08T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	see if your php works without the virtualhost you created then
2010-04-08T04:18:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	I can guarantee you that if you follow the steps on the wiki with a default LAMP install as described there, your php will work
2010-04-08T04:18:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	if you confirm that and it doesn't work for your vhost, then it's something with your vhost's configuration
2010-04-08T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	then you did not follow the steps on the wiki
2010-04-08T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	no, but you don't have to run tasksel.  Just read the troubleshooting steps and make sure you have the packages it says you need
2010-04-08T04:39:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	you are using the default vhost?
2010-04-08T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	pastebin: apt-cache policy libapache2-mod-php5 php5; ls -l /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2010-04-08T04:46:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	now go to your browser and clear your browser's cache
2010-04-08T04:46:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	sude service apache2 restart.  Then check the default vhost in your browser
2010-04-08T04:47:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	sudo, not sude
2010-04-08T04:48:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	how are you testing?
2010-04-08T04:49:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	disable your other vhost
2010-04-08T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	after disabling your vhost, restart apache and clear your cache.  You probably hit some compiz key, no idea
2010-04-08T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	grep...
2010-04-08T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	you need to start over because following the wiki's instructions will set up php for you properly.  At this point I suspect you made some changes you didn't understand
2010-04-08T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	yes
2010-04-08T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	xiven	ok
