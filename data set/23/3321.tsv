2009-01-17T04:01:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	it's in applications, accessories now
2009-01-17T04:01:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	I wouldn't go so far.. we've only just met.. =)
2009-01-17T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	yes.. I think it was moved for 8.10
2009-01-17T04:09:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	hmm.. ok.. have you installed the kernel module for it?
2009-01-17T04:09:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	try running it from a terminal.. see what kind of error messages you get
2009-01-17T04:11:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	what did you run to start it?
2009-01-17T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	did you reboot after you installed virtualbox?
2009-01-17T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	I think you need to reboot to make the kernel module load properly
2009-01-29T03:45:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	its a printer with a usb 'dongle' for bluetooth
2009-01-29T03:46:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	what is CUPS?
2009-01-29T03:47:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	THANKS!  gtg

2009-01-30T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	not a lot.. trying to wind down before going to bed.. don't know if irc is winding me down though.. =)
2009-01-30T03:20:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	run whilst you still can
2009-01-30T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	hehe
2009-01-30T03:21:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	before you go, i installed an hp printer yesterday...and the directory for it is on the desktop.  how can i move it?
2009-01-30T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	"the directory for it" ?? your printer has a directory? I don't quite understand
2009-01-30T03:23:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	well its a folder on the desktop called hplip-2.8.12 which contains many, MANY files and folders.  (its like program files in windows)
2009-01-30T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	oh.. you've compiled something?
2009-01-30T03:25:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	i followed this.. http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install/install/index.html
2009-01-30T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	linux_guy	I think it might have copied the needed files to other places in your system when you used the make install command.. try changing the name of the folder and see if you still can use the printer
2009-01-30T03:28:00.000Z	linux_guy	Slart	ok thanks
