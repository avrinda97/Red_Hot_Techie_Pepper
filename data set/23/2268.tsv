2009-09-08T06:18:00.000Z	fccf	IXI	see link from IdleOne
2009-09-08T06:21:00.000Z	fccf	IXI	the other option is ndiswrapper ... using the windows driver
2009-09-08T06:21:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	I'm using ndiswrapper with the 1.4 windows driver
2009-09-08T06:21:00.000Z	fccf	IXI	follow this instruction https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2009-09-08T06:22:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	that's actually the last thing I did, ended up uninstallnig ndiswrapper and compiling it manually, and still no luck
2009-09-08T06:22:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	yes*
2009-09-08T06:23:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	b43, b43legacy, and ssb .. using rmmod they werent in /proc/modules so i added them to the blacklist and rebooted
2009-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	fccf	IXI	b43 is for broadcom ... not D-link
2009-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	yes but most threads said to disable it, so I did anyway
2009-09-08T06:25:00.000Z	fccf	IXI	b43 won't load if there isn't hardware for it ... .. sorry I have to go it is getting hot in here
2009-09-08T06:25:00.000Z	IXI	fccf	well thanks for trying
