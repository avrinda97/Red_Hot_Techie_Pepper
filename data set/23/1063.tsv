2010-09-21T22:08:00.000Z	theparadox		Hey all
2010-09-21T22:08:00.000Z	theparadox		I compiled some drivers for a broadcom wireless card and im having some issues with it.
2010-09-21T22:08:00.000Z	theparadox		Im sure one of you will know what this means
2010-09-21T22:09:00.000Z	theparadox		theparadox@paradoxlaptop:~$ sudo sh: for i in `find /lib /var -name wl\.ko`; do mv $i ${i}.orig; done
2010-09-21T22:09:00.000Z	theparadox		bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'
2010-09-21T22:09:00.000Z	theparadox		Any idea what I did wrong?
2010-09-21T22:09:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	of course you do. You compiled the STA driver, right?
2010-09-21T22:09:00.000Z	theparadox	andycc	Um not I compiled the ones from the broadcom site.....
2010-09-21T22:10:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	I recommend using either Jockey or module-assistant to compile it automatically. I never succeeded in doing that manually.
2010-09-21T22:11:00.000Z	theparadox	andycc	I compiled them fine because they work, I just can not get them to start right on reboot lol
2010-09-21T22:17:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	yes, Ubuntu terminal is bash. BUT...
2010-09-21T22:18:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	scripts usually contain #!/bin/sh at the top
2010-09-21T22:18:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	and on Ubuntu, /bin/sh is DASH, not BASH.
2010-09-21T22:19:00.000Z	theparadox	andycc	how do I get into bash then
2010-09-21T22:20:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	replace #!/bin/sh with #!/bin/bash at the top of the script. That might work, although it shouldn't be important if you use "bash ./script.sh" to run it instead of just "./script.sh".
2010-09-21T22:26:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	OH
2010-09-21T22:26:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	I GOT IT
2010-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	do not use sudo in scripts
2010-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	remove that sudo  and run the script with "sudo bash ..."
2010-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	for is a shell builtin. sudo can't run it.
2010-09-21T22:28:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	yes. Yes, it is.
2010-09-21T22:31:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	sudo !!
2010-09-21T22:32:00.000Z	andycc	theparadox	if sudo !! doesn't work, maybe wl.ko really isn't there :D
