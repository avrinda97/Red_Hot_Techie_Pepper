2006-08-01T08:51:00.000Z	sktx		ronz: just your average everyday laptop, i386 arch.. it's a pavillion zt3000
2006-08-01T08:51:00.000Z	sktx		haha
2006-08-01T08:52:00.000Z	sktx		yeah i got the server iso from ubuntu.com not 15 minutes ago
2006-08-01T08:52:00.000Z	sktx		i couldn't find a way to install the server version from my shipit cds
2006-08-01T08:54:00.000Z	sktx		so anyway
2006-08-01T08:55:00.000Z	sktx		does anyone have a solution to the problem i've got? the damned thing hangs as soon as it tries to load the kernel after a fresh server install
2006-08-01T08:56:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	does it spit an error?
2006-08-01T08:56:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	hmm. can you boot to recovery mode?
2006-08-01T08:56:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	nope, i tried that, i get a solid hang with that too
2006-08-01T08:57:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	maybe it's broken. what's your arch?
2006-08-01T08:57:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	hmm.
2006-08-01T08:58:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	it sounds to me like the kernel image could be damaged
2006-08-01T08:59:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	well it could have gone wrong when it was copied to the hdd
2006-08-01T09:00:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	that's what i figured, so i tried installing it two more times
2006-08-01T09:00:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	oh
2006-08-01T09:00:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	not likely then I guess
2006-08-01T09:01:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	what do you think about installing from the breezy server disc and doing a dist-upgrade?
2006-08-01T09:01:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	and it's just after it's uncompressing the image?
2006-08-01T09:01:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	yep
2006-08-01T09:02:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	just cold hangs and does nothing after that
2006-08-01T09:02:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	well in theory it would work but I'm worried you'd get problems again if the kernel is causing it
2006-08-01T09:03:00.000Z	sktx	mwe	yeah but.. what i'm thinking is, it's not the latest version of the ubuntu-patched kernel
2006-08-01T09:03:00.000Z	mwe	sktx	well if you could boot the cd and get to mount the partition you could remove the "quiet" option from the kernel boot line so you could see what's going on when it dies
