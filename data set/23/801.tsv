2012-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	riz0n		OK, so when I try to do the do-release-upgrade, I get this error: Your system contains broken packages that couldn't be fixed with this software. Please fix them first using synaptic or apt-get before proceeding.
2012-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	sudo apt-get install -f
2012-08-25T22:18:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	have you added any repos?
2012-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	try to stick to the repos next time
2012-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	 I did...
2012-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	you didn't add anything?
2012-08-25T22:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	try removing it and then sudo apt-get install -f
2012-08-25T22:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	you'll probably want to sudo apt-get update before the install -f
2012-08-25T22:34:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	thanks, even after doing an update, and then doing install -f, it still says its unable to correct dependencies.
2012-08-25T22:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	haven't pinned any packages?
2012-08-25T22:34:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	No I don't think I have.
2012-08-25T22:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	normally dependency issues are caused by software outside the official repos or purposefully holding back (pinning) packages, i can't think what else could be at fault
2012-08-25T22:39:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	where would I go about checking which repo's are being referred to?
2012-08-25T22:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	post your sources.list
2012-08-25T22:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	if you are running lucid then only lucid should be there
2012-08-25T22:45:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	It is running lucid (10.04) I guess it changed the file on its own trying to go to 12.04.
2012-08-25T22:49:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	After changing that file, and doing an apt-get update, when I process apt-get -f install, I get 0 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 796 to remove and 0 not upgraded... should I go ahead and proceed? It looks like its trying to pretty much remove all the software.
2012-08-25T22:50:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	wow, when you previously tried to upgrade did it partially go through with it or did you get the warning straight off?
2012-08-25T22:51:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	When I tried to do the do-upgrade-install (or whatever the command is) it got part of the way through installation and then failed.
2012-08-25T22:51:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	ah, no wonder you had precise in your sources.list then
2012-08-25T22:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	you should have removed any non-repo software before attempting to upgrade
2012-08-25T22:53:00.000Z	riz0n	ThinkT510	Yeah, it screwed this system up pretty good! I had an interesting time just getting back into it and getting the / remounted to where I could actually do something with it...
2012-08-25T22:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	riz0n	at least now you know for next time
