2008-06-11T05:35:00.000Z	Skyline969		It's been 50 minutes and my desktop STILL hasn't started from the Live CD.
2008-06-11T05:36:00.000Z	Skyline969		Actually, I think I'm gonna bring my laptop into the room here. Can someone Direct Chat me and walk me through as to how I can start the Live CD and get it to work?
2008-06-11T05:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
2008-06-11T05:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	It will stop at the error.. making it easier, or it will flag it red
2008-06-11T05:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	some errors like fd0 are not a big deal
2008-06-11T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	be patient there will be two fd0 errors then it will continue
2008-06-11T05:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	give it a couple miutes there just to be sure then try those other tow additions to the command line
2008-06-11T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	livecd doesnt do what shutdown on a hd install can do
2008-06-11T05:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	those two adds are quite common changes
2008-06-11T05:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	try with those command changes I gave you
2008-06-11T05:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	Progress is progress
2008-06-11T06:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	You may still end up using the alternate cd
2008-06-11T06:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	text based install, no live gui
2008-06-11T06:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	It is available for free..  it takes awhile.. but they mail it to you
2008-06-11T06:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	no...   how much ram is in that box
2008-06-11T06:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	Might as well stop there...
2008-06-11T06:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	You are probably sharing video ram off that 128
2008-06-11T06:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	Was it the same version of ubuntu?  and how much ram is being diverted from that 128 to be used for video.  Did the other machine have onboard video or dedicated card
2008-06-11T06:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	with only 128 minimize how much ram is diverted
2008-06-11T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	Something you should investigate
2008-06-11T06:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	best to keep it in channel as I am trying to do some other work as well
2008-06-11T06:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	cool..
2008-06-11T06:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Skyline969	Im off to make dinner...
