2007-04-07T13:25:00.000Z	typedestereo		if I'm running ubuntu, how would I go about installing kde without using an install cd?
2007-04-07T13:26:00.000Z	typedestereo		thanks etalli
2007-04-07T13:27:00.000Z	typedestereo		hm
2007-04-07T13:27:00.000Z	typedestereo		"Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "kubuntu-desktop""-this just means I won't be getting the package suppository?
2007-04-07T13:28:00.000Z	typedestereo		or will I have to slog through enabling multiverse?
2007-04-07T13:28:00.000Z	typedestereo		ok
2007-04-07T13:28:00.000Z	typedestereo		now I just need to run the other command again?
2007-04-07T13:29:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	don't put quotes around "kubuntu-desktop" if you are, can't really tell from the error message, but it looks like you might be
2007-04-07T13:39:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	what are you doing exactly?
2007-04-07T13:40:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	ok, what does this do "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" (close synaptic or any other package manger before doing this)
2007-04-07T13:41:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	ok do "cat /etc/apt/sources.list" and pastebin the output
2007-04-07T13:44:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	whatever, pastebin that stuff
2007-04-07T13:45:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	pastebin.
2007-04-07T13:52:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	not that this should matter but try "sudo sed 's/^ //g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"
2007-04-07T14:02:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	did that work?
2007-04-07T14:02:00.000Z	typedestereo	bruenig	it's prompting me for the breezy badger installcd
2007-04-07T14:02:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	you can remove that line from the sources.list and it wont' prompt you
2007-04-07T14:04:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	sudo sed '/deb cdrom/d' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-04-07T14:05:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	don't worry about it, ok so sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get instlal kubuntu-desktop
2007-04-07T14:05:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	it didn't prompt because you have used sudo in the last 15 min
2007-04-07T14:08:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	good
2007-04-07T14:36:00.000Z	bruenig	typedestereo	that isn't really necessary, just log out and then change session
