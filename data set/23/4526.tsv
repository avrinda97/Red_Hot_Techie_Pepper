2009-01-08T20:46:00.000Z	fasta		Is there a way to boost the volume in some way? It's already at maximum and it's still very soft.
2009-01-08T20:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	how can I increase the power level?
2009-01-08T20:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	how is that?
2009-01-08T20:50:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	I'm using linux, I am suppossed to be able to do that
2009-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	is that a question?
2009-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	not at all, I am a programmer and can get the kernel driver sources
2009-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	the kernel driver sources are not enough
2009-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	there is a blob _even_ in the kernel sources.
2009-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	this blob is platform independent, but it's still there.
2009-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	you really need to reverse engineer it.
2009-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	what do you mean by blob?
2009-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	the bin firmware?
2009-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	I think so, yes. I haven't investigated it.
2009-01-08T20:53:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	but please tell me when you find something :)
2009-01-08T20:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	well, I don't even know where to start
2009-01-08T20:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	I need something easier to start with
2009-01-08T20:55:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	haha, I thought you were a programmer ;)
2009-01-08T20:56:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	can that be re reason why on w****s my wifi card has a better performance?
2009-01-08T20:57:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	could be, but the Linux drivers are not that good. The regulations do not help anyway, especially not for Linux.
2009-01-08T20:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	where can I read more about this?
2009-01-08T20:58:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	google for madwifi, read everything on the wiki and you know more than me.
2009-01-08T21:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_	fasta	how can it be that I get a connection via dhcp very quickly and then I can not ping even the router?
2009-01-08T21:03:00.000Z	fasta	ubuntu_	ask the channel, not me.
