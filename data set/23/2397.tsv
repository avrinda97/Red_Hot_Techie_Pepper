2009-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	yes, some people use avant
2009-03-27T01:18:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	right-click another panel and click New Panel
2009-03-27T01:19:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	thanks
2009-03-27T01:20:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	how do I make the new panel show my current windows? like a task bar
2009-03-27T01:21:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	right-click it, click add to panel, then click the relevant applet. I think it's called "Window List" or something.
2009-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	are you there?
2009-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	hi
2009-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	Is there a way to align-left or align-right my applet? Its centered
2009-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	there's a little handle at the left side of it. right-click it, click Move, and put it where you want it
2009-03-27T01:35:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	Depending on your theme, it might be difficult to see. Try right-clicking just to the left of the applet.
2009-03-27T01:39:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	Workspace something or other, I think?
2009-03-27T01:39:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	Can you tell me the name of the applet that shows boxes for each of my desktops?
2009-03-27T01:40:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	thanks
2009-03-27T01:44:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	I cant find the handle for the workspace switchbar :(
2009-03-27T01:44:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	it doesn't have one. Just right-click the applet itself.
2009-03-27T01:45:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	I wasn't sighing at you ;)
2009-03-27T01:56:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	Is there a way to upgrade network drivers or something? Im losing 1mb/s in download speed, compared to windows
2009-03-27T01:56:00.000Z	rww	bluenzo^nix	no idea, mine worked fine so I never looked into it.
2009-03-27T01:57:00.000Z	bluenzo^nix	rww	k thx
