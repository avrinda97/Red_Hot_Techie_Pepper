2008-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	norty	insmod	i keep getting the same error when i tried that command
2008-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	norty	insmod	it seems to error when its trying to start up, how might i get it from trying to start right away?
2008-03-10T13:37:00.000Z	norty	insmod	ok that installed a new version of postgres..
2008-03-10T13:37:00.000Z	norty	insmod	now what? should i try to purge everything now?
2008-03-10T13:38:00.000Z	norty	insmod	it is not fixed, same error exists
2008-03-10T13:42:00.000Z	norty	insmod	nope that didn't fix it, the error is still the same
2008-03-10T13:42:00.000Z	norty	insmod	do you know where i might edit the config file so that it doesn't try to start up, that seems to be where it errors
2008-03-10T13:43:00.000Z	norty	insmod	what is rc?
2008-03-10T13:45:00.000Z	norty	insmod	rc.local?
2008-03-10T13:46:00.000Z	norty	insmod	ok im in the rc file i dont know what to change.. any ideas?
2008-03-10T13:53:00.000Z	norty	insmod	i got it to stop trying to start automatically, it was a file in /etc/postgresql
2008-03-10T13:55:00.000Z	norty	insmod	but everytime i try to use apt-get it tries to setup the postgres installation that isn't complete
2008-03-10T13:55:00.000Z	norty	insmod	i want to get rid of that incomplete installation
2008-03-10T13:55:00.000Z	norty	insmod	sudo apt-get remove postgresql-8.1 ?
2008-03-10T13:56:00.000Z	norty	insmod	but its only the 8.1 version i want to remove, not the 8.3 version, what will postgresql do? remove them both?
