2011-03-04T07:07:00.000Z	acetoline		hi guys, I know this is an extremely stupid question, but I installed maverick and now whenever I want to execute something from the command line it says 'no such file or directory'
2011-03-04T07:07:00.000Z	acetoline		I'm %100 sure, because chmod +x <filename> works
2011-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	if the file you are trying to run is in the same directory and executable, make sure you put ./ before it
2011-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	yes I know
2011-03-04T07:09:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	ok, so any command does that?  if so, check your path.
2011-03-04T07:11:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	trust me, that file is there ($chmod +x NetAccountS works)
2011-03-04T07:12:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	I'm typing from my laptop right now so I can't post a ls -l
2011-03-04T07:12:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	yes, i believe you.  I think sougata was just wanting us to see everything for ourselves
2011-03-04T07:14:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	do you have any problems executing other files in your home directory?
2011-03-04T07:15:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	yes, but when I copy stuff from /usr/bin into the home directory and then do ./blabla it executes fine
2011-03-04T07:16:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	 could this possibly be some sort of security issue?
2011-03-04T07:17:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	I don't know enough to say on that.  Just for kicks, what do you get when you execute the file with a parameter like --help or --version?
2011-03-04T07:18:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	same.
2011-03-04T07:18:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	ok, just going out on a limb there, sorry :(
2011-03-04T07:26:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	do you have ia32-libs package installed?  I don't know if it applied, but read of a similar prob with someone elses 64-bit install
2011-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	no, but I just found something interesting
2011-03-04T07:33:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	I'm installing ia32-libs now, fingers crossed
2011-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	whew, I installed 16 dependencies, and finally ia32-libs
2011-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	IT WORKS
2011-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	you are a genius
2011-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	nice job! :)
2011-03-04T07:59:00.000Z	[segfault]	acetoline	not me...google-fu!
2011-03-04T07:59:00.000Z	acetoline	[segfault]	I have to log off now; thanks a billioin
