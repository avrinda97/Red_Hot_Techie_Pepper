2007-06-06T13:21:00.000Z	ceil420		do you have to do something special to use a microphone in Ubuntu?
2007-06-06T13:21:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	not really; It just needs to be setup
2007-06-06T13:22:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	Skype is bad like that. It uses an old audio driver.
2007-06-06T13:24:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	try double clicking your audio icon in the gnome panel and set itup from there
2007-06-06T13:24:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	i don't have a gnome panel :x
2007-06-06T13:24:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	:/
2007-06-06T13:24:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	alsamixer in console
2007-06-06T13:25:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	It took a bit of fiddling before I got mine working, but I did eventually
2007-07-04T06:06:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	Nowt is.
2007-07-04T06:05:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	what's wrong with GStreamer? :o
2007-07-04T06:06:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	so why wouldn't it be legal? :o
2007-07-04T06:06:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	Because Intellectual Property is valid in the US (and the US only)
2007-07-04T06:07:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	isn't it just a media player? :o
2007-07-04T06:07:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	gstreamer? No.
2007-07-04T06:08:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	that's the impression i get from http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org :o
2007-07-04T06:08:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	gstreamer is a set of plugins
2007-07-04T06:08:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	Which allows you to play various types of restricted media
2007-07-04T06:08:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	oh, i see
2007-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	yeah, the MPAA probably wouldn't like that :x
2007-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	Again; as long as you acquire your music legally, there's no problem with it
2007-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	The EU has rejected all suggestions about Intellectual Property so far for this very reason
2007-07-04T06:10:00.000Z	ceil420	MenZa	lucky EU :x
2007-07-04T06:10:00.000Z	MenZa	ceil420	I know we are :)
