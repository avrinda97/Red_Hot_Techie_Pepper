2006-01-08T17:39:00.000Z	Manifold		Adios.
2006-01-08T11:43:00.000Z	Manifold		How do I install a .jar file, guys?
2006-01-08T11:43:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	java -jar filename.jar
2006-01-08T11:44:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	that assumes a properly installed java vm
2006-01-21T10:43:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	it's not a bad idea
2006-01-21T10:43:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	I like ipkungfu, but that might be because I wrote it :)
2006-01-21T10:45:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	ipkungfu is pretty newbie friendly.  firestarter has a gui, but takes a little more work to make it work right
2006-01-21T10:46:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	not if you don't use ipv6
2006-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	when you get an ipv6 address and an ipv6 isp or tunnel
2006-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	you're not using ipv6
2006-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	because it takes a lot of work to use ipv6 - if you were using it, you'd know
2006-01-21T10:51:00.000Z	Manifold	trappist	does ipkungfu come with a GUI? I loaded it with ipkungfu in a terminal, and just got text.
2006-01-21T10:51:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	no gui, but the config files in /etc/ipkungfu are pretty understandable - if all you need is a firewall (no port forwarding etc.) then you don't need to edit them at all.
2006-01-21T10:58:00.000Z	Manifold	trappist	it says to consult the README and the FAQ when I got to /etc/ipkungfu
2006-01-21T10:59:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	how did you install ipkungfu - with apt-get?
2006-01-21T10:59:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	look in /usr/share/doc/ipkungfu
2006-01-21T11:07:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	cool
2006-01-21T11:15:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	it's a lot like checkpoint
2006-01-21T11:21:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	I don't know... I haven't used firestarter in like 5 years
2006-01-21T11:22:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	they don't work like that.  packet filtering happens in the kernel.  both these apps just give the kernel a list of rules.
2006-01-21T11:25:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	definitely not
2006-01-21T11:27:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	it's very hard for viruses to infect linux.  very few have ever existed, and none have ever worked against up-to-date, reasonably well-secured systems
2006-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	trappist	Manifold	the REASON it's hard for a virus to be successful on linux is because unlike on windows, people don't run around as root all the time
