2012-02-16T19:09:00.000Z	Wargasm		how do I change my autostart options?
2012-02-16T19:10:00.000Z	Wargasm		when I boot my netbook it keeps running Tor, without my firewall I wouldn't even know it
2012-02-16T19:12:00.000Z	Wargasm		checking now
2012-02-16T19:12:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	I guess you'd use update-rc.d
2012-02-16T19:14:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	how do I use that?
2012-02-16T19:15:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	nm I got it, thanks
2012-02-16T19:15:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	Something like "sudo update-rc.d tor disable" read "man update-rc.d" for full usage
2012-02-16T19:16:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	it was update-rc.d -f tor remove
2012-02-16T19:16:00.000Z	Wargasm		is there a way to see whats starting up?
2012-02-16T19:17:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	Well, you can either remove or disable it, I guess it's hard to start it post-boot if it's removed.
2012-02-16T19:19:00.000Z	Wargasm		eh, its ok... I actually don't even know how it got there
2012-02-16T19:20:00.000Z	Wargasm		I don't like things running unless I run them myself
2012-02-16T19:20:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	YOu could always check why using "aptitude why tor" (provided you have tor installed)
2012-02-16T19:21:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	And maybe even uninstall it if you don't need it..
2012-02-16T19:21:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	I have the stand alone tor browser installed
2012-02-16T19:22:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	tor seems to have been working without my knowledge for a while now
2012-02-16T19:24:00.000Z	arand		RIght.
2012-02-16T19:24:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	So you will probably need to have the service running for that browser to work.
2012-02-16T19:24:00.000Z	arand	Wargasm	Well, as long as nothing connects to the tor service it doesn't actually do stuff, I guess.
2012-02-16T19:27:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	only one way to know... I'm going to test it out
2012-02-16T19:28:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	it explains an error I was getting with tor before... it kept saying tor was already running... but thats before I knew about the killall command
2012-02-16T19:31:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	it works fine, so it looks like this was a different standalone process
2012-02-16T19:33:00.000Z	Wargasm	arand	thanks for the help
