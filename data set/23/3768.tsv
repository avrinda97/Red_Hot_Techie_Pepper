2010-08-22T00:14:00.000Z	RenatoSilva		Update manager doesn't show 10.04.1. My 10.04 is up-to-date. How to upgrade?
2010-08-22T00:15:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	It won't. If you have all the normal lucid-updates and lucid-security updates, you have 10.04.1
2010-08-22T00:15:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	so 10.04.1 is just p√°ckaging? an up-to-date iso?
2010-08-22T00:16:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	I thought my system monitor would show .1 up then
2010-08-22T00:17:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	correct
2010-08-22T00:17:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	try "lsb_release -a" in the terminal, it'll say 10.04.1 if you're fully updated
2010-08-22T00:18:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	yeah, 10.04.1, thanks
2011-07-18T06:02:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	the systemwide bash configuration file
2011-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	doesn't serve as replacement for lost /root/.bashrc, right?
2011-07-18T06:09:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	just use /etc/skel/.bashrc. They're not different in any way that matters.
2011-07-18T06:10:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	ok checcking in natty, it seems root just removes an alert alias and comments some /etc/bash_completion related 'if'
2011-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	I'm about to replace with one from another buddy which is just like I described. Thanks!
2011-07-18T06:14:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	It doesn't really matter. If you want a suggestion anyway, owner root, group root, permissions 600
2011-07-18T06:14:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	ok thanks
2011-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	As I attempted to hint above, #ubuntu does not support unlocked root accounts or offer help with them. It appears you have one. Have fun with that.
2011-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	I have no idea what is unlocked root accounts, I'm those idiots you know. Besides, I've never touched /root's permissions, so if something is wrong with them, it's because of bug[s] in upgrade processes
2011-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	It doesn't matter, given that if /root can't be accessed by other, then nothing inside of /root can.
2011-07-18T06:45:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	celthunder: that's why I want to touch only /root, being less intrusive, since everything under it will also be inaccessible as rww said
2011-08-16T12:06:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	Ubuntu oneiric uses GNOME 3. Ubuntu 11.04's official repositories are sticking with GNOME 2, per our stable update policy.
2011-08-16T12:17:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	what's unity exactly, a gnome 2 app, a gnome 2 patch, a gnome 2 fork?
2011-08-16T12:18:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	Unity in 11.04 is a plugin for Compiz that provides a shell as an alternative to GNOME Panel, GNOME Shell, etc.
2011-08-16T12:19:00.000Z	rww	RenatoSilva	11.04 runs it on top of GNOME 2. Oneiric runs it on top of GNOME 3.
2011-08-16T12:20:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	rww	so it's a *compiz plugin*! and it just runs on top of gnome 2/3 as any regular gnome app. Ok, thanks for the info!
