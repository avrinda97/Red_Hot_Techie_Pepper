2006-11-29T12:41:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	make sure libapache2-mod-php5 installed, and php5.conf and php5.load is enabled
2006-11-29T12:42:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	libapache2-mod-php5 is already installed according to apt-get
2006-11-29T12:42:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	check mods-enable and make sure they are there
2006-11-29T12:44:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	you need to manually link them if they are not there
2006-11-29T12:46:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	yes
2006-11-29T12:47:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	if you take a look the apache2.conf file you will see the Include directives
2006-11-29T12:48:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	I see it.
2006-11-29T12:48:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	once you've done, reload the config and you should good to go
2006-11-29T12:52:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	hmm.. that's weird
2006-11-29T12:53:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	What should I check next?
2006-11-29T12:53:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	you linked php5.conf and php5.load both?
2006-11-29T12:55:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	check the log then
2006-11-29T12:55:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	Where is the log?
2006-11-29T12:55:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	cause that's all you need to do. there might have something else missing
2006-11-29T12:56:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	/var/log/apache2
2006-11-29T12:57:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	No other errors than not being able to figure the server name.
2006-11-29T12:58:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	you can try tail -f the access.log and error.log and then click the php file and see if there is anything generated
2006-11-29T13:00:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	It just started to parse it...  Without even a restart since I last restarted it.  Weird...
2006-11-29T13:01:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	huh ok.. :)
2006-11-29T13:01:00.000Z	Azmodan	i3d	No wait, it parses infophp.php but won't load phpmyadmin (it offers to download it).
2006-11-29T13:02:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	that's probably some different stories
2006-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	as long as apache parses php files, the func should be setup correctly.
2006-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	i3d	Azmodan	ok
