2007-02-03T12:58:00.000Z	cinnix		The following packages have been kept back: python-soappy
2007-02-03T12:59:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	where did you look, locally, or online?
2007-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	where did you look, locally, or online?
2007-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	im relatively new to linux, i just done a reinstall of edgy with alt cd
2007-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2007-02-03T13:01:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	hmmm, how about apt-get install build-essentials?
2007-02-03T13:01:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	heh, yea turns out i got it
2007-02-03T13:02:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	im trying to compile alltray, its saying there are no makefile where im looking at it right now
2007-02-03T13:03:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	build-essentials isn't in the default repos, you need to enable the alternate ones, do you have X running?
2007-02-03T13:04:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	yea i just fixed build essential, its present and installed
2007-02-03T13:05:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	ok, try building again, and see if you get a make file?
2007-02-03T13:06:00.000Z	n2diy		! owa
2007-02-03T13:07:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	nope, same again. this is weird
2007-02-03T13:09:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	I've only compiled twice, and it wasn't your s/w, so I'm at a loss, if autoconf and automake don't give you a make file, I can't help.
2007-02-03T13:09:00.000Z	cinnix	n2diy	no worries. thanks for your time anyhow
2007-02-03T13:09:00.000Z	n2diy	cinnix	nada, gl.
