2011-05-31T14:15:00.000Z	zl0y		hi all
2011-05-31T14:16:00.000Z	zl0y		can any body help me to mount smb without sudo or root? whitch group I should append user to?
2011-05-31T14:16:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	you can add conmands for users to be allowd to do them with sudo also
2011-05-31T14:17:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	without sudo
2011-05-31T14:18:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	setuid/setgid script that does the job...but thats really not for security
2011-05-31T14:18:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	could you please describe more detailed about setuid/setgid script?
2011-05-31T14:19:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	read the chmod manual and search for setuid bit
2011-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	but use sudo....sudo is not for giving root access only...read its manual too
2011-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	I know what is the chmod and setuid bit
2011-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	so wheres the problem then?
2011-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	what the script? where I should change bit?
2011-05-31T14:23:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	you said you know what it is.....so why not read the manuals for detailed information?
2011-05-31T14:23:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	I have already read it
2011-05-31T14:24:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	You told about script
2011-05-31T14:24:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	what script was you talking about?
2011-05-31T14:25:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	yes...create a script/binary/whatever that does the job you want......put it into a public ENV path, give it the user/group and special setuid/setgid perms you want it to have....and have your users run it ;)
2011-05-31T14:25:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	 and again.....use sudo features.......read the manual...its all in there
2011-05-31T14:26:00.000Z	zl0y		I can't use sudo
2011-05-31T14:26:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	do not use setgid/setgid if there is really no other possibility
2011-05-31T14:26:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	why not?
2011-05-31T14:27:00.000Z	zl0y		because the program will perform all actions automatically, but it cannot enter password
2011-05-31T14:28:00.000Z	beli	zl0y	open your mind and trust me and read the sudo manuals! you can do it with NOPASSWD option
2011-05-31T14:29:00.000Z	zl0y	beli	ok, thank you very much
