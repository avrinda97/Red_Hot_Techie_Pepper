2010-12-17T12:16:00.000Z	rigved		how do i find out the uuid of any partition?
2010-12-17T12:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	In /etc/fstab
2010-12-17T12:17:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	i need the uuid of a partition which not present in fstab, so that i can add it to fstab
2010-12-17T12:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	Try to find it out using GParted.
2010-12-17T12:19:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	ok. let me try that
2010-12-17T12:21:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	gparted is different from the existing disk utility in ubuntu 10.04?
2010-12-17T12:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	I do not understand your question. What is different from what? Say it in other words, please.
2010-12-17T12:24:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	there is already a Disk Utility in my System > Administration menu. is that Gparted or do i need to install it seperately?
2010-12-17T12:24:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	never mind. i found out via software center that i need to install gparted
2010-12-17T12:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	Ubuntu knows several disk utilities. The "Disk Utility" which you can call by clicking on System > Administration > Disk Utility is only one of several disk utilities. Please install GParted separately.
2010-12-17T12:28:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	ok. i have it installed. will check it now
2010-12-17T12:29:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	got it from gparted. thanx
2010-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	Enjoy Ubuntu!
2010-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	i already have been since Lucid was released :)
2010-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	sacarlson: ok. i have added the new partition. now do i need to restart to see the changes?
2010-12-17T12:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	Yes.
2010-12-17T12:49:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	sacarlson: i needed to follow these instructions also - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq. now i have increased by swap space. thanx
2011-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	info mysql
2011-05-17T12:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	Why do you mention 'info mysql'? It makes the same ambiguous statement.
2011-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	maybe in /usr/share/doc/
2011-05-17T12:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	I cannot find it in /usr/share/doc. There are only a few files in it starting with mysql. So I am fairly sure that it is not there.
2011-05-17T12:51:00.000Z	rigved	bullgard4	even i searched in software center, there is no mysql-doc package available. maybe you should visit the website that is mentioned
2011-05-17T12:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	rigved	I am reading this website since days. --  Thank you.
