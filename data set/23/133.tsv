2012-06-07T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 what sort of device is it?
2012-06-07T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 then you plug it in, check dmesg output.
2012-06-07T17:54:00.000Z	Bentheplantguy	Dr_Willis	what is check dmesg command?
2012-06-07T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 run 'dmesg' look for errors a few moments after plugging in the drive
2012-06-07T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 you waited a few moments? then ran it? try again a few secconds later
2012-06-07T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 if dmesg is showing NOTHING about that device.. then you got somthng very weird going on.
2012-06-07T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 at the end, it should mention some* devices
2012-06-07T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 similer to -->  [45781.487869] usb 2-1.1: new high-speed USB device number 11 using ehci_hcd
2012-06-07T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 notice the 'sdg' - thats the device in my case.
2012-06-07T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 whens the last time you ever used that external hard drive? in any OS.
2012-06-07T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 if its disconnecting automatically. that points to some issue - perhaps in the hardware/cable/power/ports
2012-06-07T18:07:00.000Z	Bentheplantguy	Dr_Willis	fist used a year ago, haven't been able to connect since.
2012-06-07T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 untill the os gives the hd a proper /dev/sdXX  you are not going to be doing much of anything with it.
2012-06-07T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 that ##### is a timestamp of the kernel logging  i belive
2012-06-07T18:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 if the os is not giveing it a  /dev/sdXX name.you cant do much of anything with it...
2012-06-07T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	  id check the cables and listen to the hd and be sure its even spinning up
2012-06-07T18:37:00.000Z	Bentheplantguy	Dr_Willis	HD recognized on mac.... ?
2012-06-07T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	you are asking a question?
2012-06-07T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 what filesystem is on that hard drive?
2012-06-07T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 Why do you need it to be fat?
2012-06-07T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bentheplantguy	 you could just delete the paritons. and then plug it back in and see if linux sees it.
2012-06-07T21:21:00.000Z	Bentheplantguy	Dr_Willis	opened external in disk utility (Mac OSX).  ran test, then repair.  auto mounted in /media when i plugged it back into ubuntu.  ~Thank you for your patience and helping me out
