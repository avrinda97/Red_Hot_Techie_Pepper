2012-07-14T22:08:00.000Z	dagroves		Can someone please help me get my Wireless working?
2012-07-14T22:09:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	you need to be a more specific in what you're asking, there's wifi howtos available for ubuntu
2012-07-14T22:10:00.000Z	dagroves	perlmonkey	I have a TP-LINK TL-WN727N Wireless Adapter and I am trying to get it to work. Here is 'lsusb': http://paste.ubuntu.com/1091899/ and I have also tried this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1902715 and this worked one time, but after a reboot my wireless was off again. What do I do?
2012-07-14T22:10:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ok
2012-07-14T22:12:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	have you checked the chipset is supported in your version of ubuntu by the kernel? this link may prove helpful: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1800178
2012-07-14T22:12:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	you may need to install a driver
2012-07-14T22:13:00.000Z	dagroves		okay let me check out the link first then I will get back to you
2012-07-14T22:14:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	ok seems others have had issues with that chipset, so it probably wont work "out of the box" without driver installing
2012-07-14T22:15:00.000Z	dagroves	perlmonkey	I have no idea how to install the driver though, I found the Ralink driver for it, but it is in a bz2 file and I have no idea what that is
2012-07-14T22:15:00.000Z	perlmonkey		wifi can be a nightmare to setup, i had probs getting my built-in wifi to work on my toshiba laptop, had to mess around a bit to get it working and install a driver
2012-07-14T22:16:00.000Z	perlmonkey		bz2 is a compressed file, you would need to uncompress it, what i would suggest first is check to see if any package exists for your hardware/chipset as sometimes you might get lucky
2012-07-14T22:16:00.000Z	perlmonkey		start ubuntu software center and do a search
2012-07-14T22:17:00.000Z	dagroves		pearlmonkey: what would I search for? My device?
2012-07-14T22:17:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	try the device name and the chipset if that doesn't work
2012-07-14T22:17:00.000Z	dagroves		okay
2012-07-14T22:18:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	there is a page somewhere for ubuntu which lists all wifi hardware and status/drivers needed/supported etc, see if you can find that too
2012-07-14T22:19:00.000Z	perlmonkey		if all else fails, try installing that driver you downloaded, then do a modprobe (drivername) to load it
2012-07-14T22:19:00.000Z	dagroves		pearlmonkey: There is nothing in the software center. I have the driver but I have no idea how to install it, I have it extracted, but no idea what to do
2012-07-14T22:19:00.000Z	perlmonkey		check dmesg and see the devices does
2012-07-14T22:19:00.000Z	perlmonkey		*see what
2012-07-14T22:20:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	that link i posted explains how to install it
2012-07-14T22:20:00.000Z	dagroves		pearlmonkey: okay I will check it out
2012-07-14T22:21:00.000Z	perlmonkey	dagroves	if you save it into a folder, then open your file manager, click on it, it should automatically ask you if you want to uncompress/extract files somewhere
