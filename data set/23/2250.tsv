2009-05-21T15:50:00.000Z	bluepencil		Is the ftp port 21 service off by default?
2009-05-21T15:50:00.000Z	bluepencil		because im trying to ftp localhost 21 and it states connection refused.
2009-05-21T15:51:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	I think all services are off by default
2009-05-21T15:51:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	ah ok, how would i turn ftp on for instance?
2009-05-21T15:51:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	Administration -> Services, I think
2009-05-21T15:53:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	might have to apt-get install an FTP server first.  never done it.  file transfer is more secure over SSH these days, a lot of people just use that.
2009-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	hey man, if you were 10.0.0.1 and wanted a file called Bob.txt from /home/bob on 10.0.0.2, what commands would you use to retrieve it? (via ssh)?
2009-05-21T15:56:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	scp bob@10.0.0.2:Bob.txt .
2009-05-21T15:56:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	lol, thats it?
2009-05-21T15:56:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	yup
2009-05-21T15:56:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	lol, k thanks dude. thanks a million.
2009-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	except Ubuntu has SSH server disabled by default, so you'll have to enable that (on 10.0.0.2)
2009-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	ah ok, in Admin > Services?
2009-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2009-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	sweet dude, thanks
2009-05-21T16:01:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	ok dude, so can i go... scp bob@10.0.0.2:/home/bob/bob.txt ?
2009-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	no need for the "/home/bob/" bit if you're already logging in as bob@
2009-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	and remember the " . " at the end of the command
2009-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	where . is the current directory
2009-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	aaah ok, thanks
2009-05-21T16:03:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	oh you mean thats the destination?
2009-05-21T16:03:00.000Z	bluepencil	ozzmosis	makes sense, thanks again.
2009-05-21T16:03:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bluepencil	yes, the syntax is similar to cp
