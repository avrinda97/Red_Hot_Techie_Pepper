2009-08-27T15:22:00.000Z	cowiecow		Hi hi, does anyone know of a way to get Rhythmbox to repeat a track instead of repeating the whole playlist? Some of my songs have the same names, but one might be a remix, so I can't just use the search tool to do it all.
2009-08-27T15:23:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	repeat button?
2009-08-27T15:24:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	Well, the repeat button is a Repeat Playlist, not a Repeat Track/Repeat One Song.
2009-08-27T15:31:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	How would I get Rhythmbox to Repeat Track?
2009-08-27T15:32:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	there is a repeat button in it
2009-08-27T15:32:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	I know, but it repeats the whole playlist, doesn't it? Not one song.
2009-08-27T15:32:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	but u already seen it iam sure'
2009-08-27T15:32:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	no move it to playqueue
2009-08-27T15:32:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	then repeat
2009-08-27T15:33:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	I guess. So it won't work like iTunes or Banshee.
2009-08-27T15:33:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	in banshee how does it work?
2009-08-27T15:33:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	banshee is better anyways
2009-08-27T15:33:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	You have three options: Repeat One, Repeat All, and No Repeat. I think it's better, but it lags on me at times... Have you used Exaile?
2009-08-27T15:34:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	once i did but didnt stick to it much
2009-08-27T15:37:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	exaile looks sleek doesnt it?
2009-08-27T15:37:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	but mostly i use default apps
2009-08-27T15:38:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	if u move a song to play queue doesnt it repeat?
2009-08-27T15:38:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	Typically, I try to keep close to default apps, and particularly ones that are pointed out to by GNOME... But Rhythmbox sucks and for me, Firefox > Epiphany. x_x For some reason, Amarok doesn't work with me.
2009-08-27T15:43:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	i find ekiga to be the most hopeless of all defaults
2009-08-27T15:45:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	I noticed that when I played with it earlier... T_T
2009-08-27T15:57:00.000Z	indus	cowiecow	should i try exaile or banshee?
2009-08-27T15:58:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	Try them both, I'd say. But for the record... exaile runs like Amarok, GTK edition. Banshee is very very iTunes-like in interface, although I prefer it over iTunes in some ways (aside from how iTunes CAN convert music and I don't know if Banshee can).
2009-08-27T15:59:00.000Z	cowiecow	indus	My preferences is Banshee. My main gripe is the lag involved sometimes with the poor redrawing abilities of Banshee since it does its interface a LITTLE differently.
