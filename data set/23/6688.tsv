2006-01-28T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 you set up the non-free ati drivers yet?
2006-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 you installed the actual ati drivers (flgrx) for full 3d support yet?
2006-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	Azunai	Dr_Willis	i just did apt-get install flgrz-driver and apt-get install fglrx-conrol? if thats what u mena?
2006-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 followign that "!ati" wiki page the bot just posted. i mean.
2006-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	Azunai	Dr_Willis	im a complete noob lol u make no sense
2006-01-28T06:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 go read at  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI   - you MUST have the actual ATI drivers up and going right - for full 3d support.
2006-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	Azunai	Dr_Willis	doing it now i think lol
2006-01-28T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 i followed that wiki. and it took me all of 2 min to get the ati drivers working right. If you cant get 3d support working with them. then you can write off playing 3d games.
2006-01-28T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 heh ..
2006-01-28T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 you do NOT need to get stuff from the ati site - follow that wiki is what you need to do.
2006-01-28T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 dident follow the wiki then eh?
2006-01-28T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 my guess is - either you missed a step.. or that card is not supported.
2006-01-28T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Azunai	 that leaves you Missing a step then
