2009-07-05T20:51:00.000Z	path1		Ok, it looks as if the system found my hard disk. Which file system shoul i use to format it?
2009-07-05T20:51:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	what OS's need to be able to read it?
2009-07-05T20:52:00.000Z	path1		ubuntu
2009-07-05T20:52:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	ubuntu
2009-07-05T20:52:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	then ext3 (for stability) or ext4 (for speed)
2009-07-05T20:53:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	thx :) so i think i stick to ext3
2009-07-05T20:53:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	although the ubuntu ext4 is pretty stable too (I'm using it no probs)
2009-07-05T20:53:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	or maybe ext4? i think i'll roll a die
2009-07-05T20:54:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	ext4 (the official one) has an issue where if it suddenly loses power, the data is not guarunteed to be written/indexed
2009-07-05T20:55:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	but the ubuntu one uses the old writing system to prevent that issue (which means it's not as fast as 'real' ext4, but is faster than ext3)...
2009-07-05T20:55:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	oh, thats a bad issue, because that what has happened to my system some time ago
2009-07-05T20:55:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	also, aethelrick, says KDE doesn't like ext4
2009-07-05T20:55:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	you can't go wrong with ext3
2009-07-05T20:55:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	i use gnome
2009-07-05T20:56:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	how many partitions should i create? my hard disk is 1 TB
2009-07-05T20:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	for the whole OS? or just data?
2009-07-05T20:56:00.000Z	path1	boss_mc	everything
2009-07-05T20:57:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	my standard install is a little ext2 /boot partition, a larger ext3/4 root partition and the rest in /home
2009-07-05T20:57:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	and swap!
2009-07-05T20:58:00.000Z	path1		maybe i just use a single partition? what are the disadvantages?
2009-07-05T20:58:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	with a seperate home partition, you can reinstall the OS without losing your personal data/settings
2009-07-05T20:59:00.000Z	path1		sounds good
2009-07-05T20:59:00.000Z	boss_mc	path1	a separate /boot partition is useful for having multiple OS's (and early grub versions don't like booting from ext4...)
