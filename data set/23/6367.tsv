2006-09-08T12:01:00.000Z	jshriver		aye.. but holycow offers more

2006-09-08T12:02:00.000Z	jshriver		then why can't I apt-get install pose?
2006-09-08T12:03:00.000Z	jshriver		anyway.. want to get pose installed "Palm Emulator"
2006-09-08T12:03:00.000Z	jshriver		and it's not in my cache
2006-09-08T12:03:00.000Z	jshriver		I dont mind being "dumb" but if you teach me I'll learn
2006-09-08T12:04:00.000Z	jshriver		Ubuntu, at least from what I've seen, isn't as anal as debian
2006-09-08T12:04:00.000Z	jshriver		Debian is 100% pure GPL..
2006-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	jshriver		Ubuntu is 100% whatever works under linux, and is freely available.. w/o having to buy
2006-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	jshriver		am I wrong in that sense?
2006-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Incorrect.
2006-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Debian Etch.
2006-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Debian Etch uses xorg.
2006-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Bullshit, are you LISTENING?
2006-09-08T12:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Such as randomly assuming that all of debian's software is GPL, or even GPL compatible.
2006-09-08T12:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Debian is also widely recognized for being the largest distro in terms of number of software programs in their repos.
2006-09-08T12:09:00.000Z	jshriver	Arafangion	I wont argue with that.. I still run Debian on 14 computers... and ran it as my main desktop for nearly 5 years...
2006-09-08T12:10:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Yet you display a surprising lack of knowledge about Debian.
2006-09-08T12:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Why are you using --host=Linux?
2006-09-08T12:17:00.000Z	jshriver	Arafangion	when I tried ./configure it said it couldnt determine my system and I had to specify
2006-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	Indeed.
2006-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	No.
2006-09-08T12:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	jshriver	They considered it once, but decided that it would require too many changes to both mono and wine, and would be easier to just do their own implementation.
