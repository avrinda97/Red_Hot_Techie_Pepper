2008-03-20T13:40:00.000Z	kraut		is there a method to debug what debconf-frontend is doing? everytime i install a new package, the postinst fails because there is an error 1.
2008-03-20T13:40:00.000Z	kraut		for example: http://pastebin.com/m657d38f2
2008-03-20T13:41:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	you get the post-inst script to be verbose -- usually you edit the post-inst script and add "set +x" (i think)
2008-03-20T13:44:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	that looks like the postfix preinst script failing -- is that the script you modified?
2008-03-20T13:47:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	every preinst script fails ?
2008-03-20T13:48:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	can you post a more elaborate output -- that maybe contains many of these errors?
2008-03-20T13:51:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	i'm not sure, i've never tried -- but i think it's crucial to try and debug the script and get to the source of the problem -- if i understand this german right -- does the error say there was an error unpacking the .deb file?
2008-03-20T13:53:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	- this is the same error right - http://translate.google.com/translate_t?langpair=de|en
2008-03-20T13:53:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	ohh crap --sorry
2008-03-20T13:54:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	this one - http://pastebin.com/m657d38f2
2008-03-20T14:07:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	you weren't prompted for anything at all?
2008-03-20T14:07:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	nope
2008-03-20T13:58:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	very strange -- have you tried adding "set -x" to  /var/lib/dpkg/info/tzdata.postinst ?
2008-03-20T13:59:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	sure
2008-03-20T13:59:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	but at the point frontend starts with $1 on that script, i see nothing
2008-03-20T14:00:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	if you are making reference to "set -x" -- it can be added anywhere in the script -- preferably at line #2 just after the shebang
2008-03-20T14:03:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	nothing usefull
2008-03-20T14:04:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	you could try the guys in #debian -- they helped me through something similar once -- i'm lost with this one
2008-03-20T14:04:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	http://pastebin.com/m6aca4351
2008-03-20T14:05:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	i think it's more painless to reinstall then to hang around with debian-guys.
2008-03-20T14:05:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	actually you could try this -- sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf   (and select the ncurses interface)
2008-03-20T14:06:00.000Z	kraut	unop__	root@kaya:~# sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf
2008-03-20T14:08:00.000Z	unop__	kraut	sheesh, sounds like a debconf problem -- try reinstalling it -- I have a feeling it might solve the problem, it certainly looks to be it now -- sudo apt-get install --reinstall debconf
