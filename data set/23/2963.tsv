2010-01-18T09:58:00.000Z	zetheroo		can someone help me figure out how to implement the fix mentioned towards the bottom of this page? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/istanbul/+bug/63996?comments=all
2010-01-18T09:59:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	What post#?
2010-01-18T10:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	 #54 I think ...?
2010-01-18T10:01:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	You'll have to download the source and the diff file, and patch the original file with the diff; then compile.
2010-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	ok ... so should I remove the version i have currently installed?
2010-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	Yes; you'll have to recompile a new version from source.
2010-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	oh I see ...
2010-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	I found the website for Istanbul ... there is a tar.bz2 download and the Ubuntu .deb downloads
2010-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	You'll want the tar file.
2010-01-18T10:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	ok I got it .. and extracted it ... do I just find that screencast.py file and copy paste the info in the fix?
2010-01-18T10:09:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	Actually, I'm sorry, download the deb instead.
2010-01-18T10:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	oh really?
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	Follow these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuPackagingGuide/BuildFromDebdiff?highlight=%28debdiff%29
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	ok
2010-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	Follow the instructions, it says to "cd PACKAGE-* && patch -pl < ../DEBDIFF"
2010-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	You need to change the PACKAGE with the name of the package and DEBDIFF with the .debdiff file
2010-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	what is the debdiff? It says to download the debdiff ...
2010-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	This file: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/36229421/istanbul_0.2.2-5ubuntu1.debdiff
2010-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	ok thanks
2010-01-18T10:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	so I paste that text into gedit and save it as .debdiff
2010-01-18T10:23:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	Yup
2010-01-18T10:57:00.000Z	keepsake	zetheroo	That's great =). Patching is a pretty useful skill, I'm glad you managed to learn it yourself =D
2010-01-18T10:56:00.000Z	zetheroo	keepsake	hey thanks ... I completed that and now the application is working 100%
