2007-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	buddy7999		how fast is vmware as an emulator?
2007-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	buddy7999		usually?
2007-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	buddy7999		50% as if it were natively installede?
2007-03-03T14:53:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	i think it depends what os you are emulating, and what kind of app you are running
2007-03-03T14:53:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	in my experience (on a server) it is better than 50%
2007-03-03T15:02:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	the ubuntu keyring?
2007-03-03T15:02:00.000Z	buddy7999	eck	yup
2007-03-03T15:02:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	install libpam-keyring and look at this: http://www.hekanetworks.com/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/25/staticId/31/
2007-03-03T15:08:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	i highly doubt you can do that in gnome
2007-03-03T15:13:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	well when i cick a window it gets focus immediately
2007-03-03T15:15:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	fluxbox can't paint windows any more quickly, that's all i'm trying to say
2007-03-03T15:23:00.000Z	buddy7999	eck	whats the difference between a restart
2007-03-03T15:23:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	well, restarting will restart all of the programs on your computer obviously, logging out will only end the ones associated with your login session
2007-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	tbh, i wouldn't be using beryl. if you really want stable, use metacity, and if you want the eye candy compiz is much more stable (and performant)
2007-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	well, that's a packaging issue, not a compiz issue, although i guess on the user end of things there isn't much difference
2007-03-03T15:30:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	normally you would only compile if you need a newer version, or you want to apply a patch (or the package is not in the repos)
2007-03-03T15:32:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	the desktop icons are painted by nautilus
2007-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	ctrl alt backspace restarts X, it doesn't really do a clean logout
2007-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	you should only use it if X is broken or you are not logged in
2007-03-05T17:57:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	the kernel is the stuff in /boot/vmlinuz*, everything else is not the kernel
2007-03-05T17:59:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	try looking at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computer_science%29
2007-03-05T06:02:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	it will probably work, but since the kernel in ubuntu/fedora core is 99% the same there isn't a good reason to
2007-03-05T06:03:00.000Z	eck	buddy7999	they are all based on the kernel known as "Linux"!
