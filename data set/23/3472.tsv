2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		hello
2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		could someone please help me with installing ubuntu?
2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		i want to intall it on my laptop
2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		which has xp on it
2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		using live usb stick
2009-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	Iderik		first
2009-01-05T04:57:00.000Z	Iderik		ohh, sorry :-)
2009-01-05T04:58:00.000Z	Iderik		either i want to use usb live stick or install using windows, i want xunbuntu because my usb stick only got 1bg of space
2009-01-05T04:58:00.000Z	Iderik		my problem is, first i tried xubuntu, normal iso. but it didn't work, because i needed internet access, which my laptop don't have
2009-01-05T04:59:00.000Z	Iderik		so i tried the alternative one, which didn't work either, because i can't find any install file to start
2009-01-05T04:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	A live USB install is compressed so even plain Ubuntu is under 700 meg
2009-01-05T05:00:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	oh, i thought i had to unpack the iso and then copy it to the usb stick
2009-01-05T05:01:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	is it possible to just copy the iso file in to the usb, and then stick it in to my laptop and reboot? ofcourse i set the boot setup to start usb sticks first
2009-01-05T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	You do* but you don't unpack the squashfs     *You can also just use the Flash Drive installer on the LiveCD
2009-01-05T05:02:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	wait a minute, thsi is totally new to me, and you're using a lot of hard words for me to understand, my english ain't the greatest too, sorry :-)
2009-01-05T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	The important thing to know is that you don't need to manually install to a flash drive, there are utilities to do it automatically for windows and there is even one available from the system menu when you are booted from the liveCD. You don't need to know this but you don't "unpack" the part of the CD that is actually compressed, which is called the squashfs
2009-01-05T05:16:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	oh my god, when i'm trying to instal flash drive installer, it says me to download .NET 1.1 (but i already have .NET 3.5), so i press Yes, and it takes me to a link for .NET 3.5 -.-
2009-01-05T05:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	Using unetbootin?
2009-01-05T05:20:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	nope, is it something for me to make live usb sticks with iso?
2009-01-05T05:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	Yes http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2009-01-05T05:21:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	thank you so much, i'll try that right away
2009-01-05T05:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Iderik	np
2009-01-05T05:52:00.000Z	Iderik	Jordan_U	i still can't get it working, i did as you said. it works to open the installer when i'm in windows, but it won't boot in BIOS (in the beginning, before xp starts)
