2008-06-26T22:46:00.000Z	fredmv		Not to be annoying, but does anyone have a clue what's going on with my situation?     I just don't understand why enabling 3rd party sources would cause such a trainreck.
2008-06-26T22:46:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	a poorly written third party deb
2008-06-26T22:47:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	evidently.   The question is how to get out of this mess?    It seems to have seriouslty corrupted the system.
2008-06-26T22:47:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	in what way?
2008-06-26T22:48:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	wireless doesn't work, the 'human' theme doesn't load and it doesn't allow me to open Nautilis _at all_ (it flashes the window for a second and closes), USB devices (e.g. jump drive) don't work ...
2008-06-26T22:49:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	what 3d party repo?
2008-06-26T22:50:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	under the 3rd party tab, I checked the first two.  I can't even access it right now to check out what I did.   (Yes, somewhat of a newb.)
2008-06-26T22:52:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	figuring this stuff out is fun and all, but I really just want to wipe the drive and install a fresh Hardy.   Problem is, it doesn't see USB devices, so I can't back some stuff up... ;\
2008-06-26T22:53:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	do   tail -f /var/log/syslog   in a terminal, then plug in the usb backup device . See what kind of message you get
2008-06-26T22:54:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	and if the canonical ones are the ones you selected, it's very unlikely that's the actual source of the problem.
2008-06-26T22:56:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	the output of the log seems to indiate that it's been seeing the usb all along.  I plugged in the usb drive and I got 'New device added (hal udi is '/org/freedesktop...'   Still, it doesn't really 'see' it when I plug it in.
2008-06-26T22:56:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	and I'm getting a ton of pulseaudio erros.
2008-06-26T22:57:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	did it say anything about assigning it a device, like /dev/sdbX or sdbaX or anything of the like?
2008-06-26T23:00:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	doesn't appear to...
2008-06-26T23:00:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	ok, there's a way to set up your install without wiping all the data on the disk.
2008-06-26T23:01:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	do you have the alternate install cd? I know for sure that the alternate supports this method, not positive about the live
2008-06-26T23:01:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	that'd be ideal.    Thanks for all the help thus far by the way.
2008-06-26T23:01:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	I'm downloading hardy right now, which I believe is the live disk (699MB).
2008-06-26T23:03:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	you should cancel the livecd download, and switch to the alternate (or get both, having a live desktop cd can be useful)
2008-06-26T23:05:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	the idea behind all this is creating a directory   /data   on the partition, moving all the stuff you want to keep there, then deleting all the other stuff on the partition. Then, during your install, use the manual partitioning and do everything normally, except _not_ reformatting the partition
2008-06-26T23:06:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	that sounds like a solid plan.    I'll get back to you in a sec.   Thanks a lot.
2008-06-26T23:06:00.000Z	nickrud	fredmv	I'm at work, so I'll be popping in and out.
2008-06-26T23:07:00.000Z	fredmv	nickrud	yup-- brb.
