2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	BigMao		Hi there, is there a difference between GDM and the X server?
2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 GDM handles the login. its running on top of X.
2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	I want to restart the X server on a remote machine since I edited the xorg.conf.  (Specifically, I need to turn off direct rendering)
2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 so  they are radically different things.
2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	that's also what I thought, thanks.. Do you know how to restart the X server?
2010-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 'sudo service gdm restart'  should restart X
2010-07-13T21:21:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	thanks. :)
2010-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	"service gdm restart" seems to have restarted GDM, I don't know if it restarted X.. My problem still remains, it's still doing direct rendering
2010-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	do you know how to turn off direct rendering?  I'm trying to run a program remotely that opens an OpenGL window
2010-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 do ' sudo service gdm stop       ' and  X should stop. :)
2010-07-13T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 never noticed or needed to.
2010-07-13T21:24:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	I can still open X windows even after "sudo service gdm stop"
2010-07-13T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 Hmm. somthing is odd there.. that should log you out back to the GDm login screen
2010-07-13T21:25:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	I'm logging into the machine remotely.  I can't see its desktop
2010-07-13T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	  so  err.. what does this have to do with xorg.conf then?
2010-07-13T21:26:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	my problem is that the OpenGL windows are rendering on the remote machine, whereas I need them to render on the local machine.  I'm not sure if this can be accomplished by editing xorg.conf
2010-07-13T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 you did 'ssh -X remotebox'  ?
2010-07-13T21:27:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	I did "ssh -Y remotebox"
2010-07-13T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 i dont think xorg.conf has any thing to do with that.. I wonder what would happen if  you just shut down gdm, on the remote box. :) then there would be no display fior it to go to.
2010-07-13T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 what program is this anyway>?
2010-07-13T21:28:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	when I type in "glxgears -info", the first line is: GL_RENDERER   = Mesa X11.  What I would like it to say is: GL_RENDERER   = GeForce 9500 GT/PCI/SSE2 (the gfx card on my local box .. it isn't on the remote box)
2010-07-13T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BigMao	 one normally dosent run  programs that use 3d graphics over the network like that.
2010-07-13T21:29:00.000Z	BigMao	Dr_Willis	I know, but for my application, that's what I'd like to do
