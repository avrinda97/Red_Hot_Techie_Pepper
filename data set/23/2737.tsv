2008-12-20T03:44:00.000Z	fryguy		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a Intel Core2 Machine, P35 motherboard, nvidia card that works with nvidia binary drivers (6800GT).  All 4 current live cds (8.04, 8.10, 32-bit and 64-bit) freeze as soon as I get to the desktop, so I was forced to install using the alternative installer.  Now the installed system exemplifies the same problems as the LiveCDs.  I've done all of the obvious things (and lots of non-obvious), and can not resolve the issue.  Anybod
2008-12-20T03:46:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	you try booting into rescue mode?
2008-12-20T03:46:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	and do what with it. i have no problems getting a command line even from a normal boot
2008-12-20T03:46:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	rerun Xorg conf from there and see if that'll help
2008-12-20T03:46:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	it doesn't
2008-12-20T03:47:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	k
2008-12-20T03:47:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	i've used 5 different drivers, drivers that are known to work with my card in my specific hardware configuration
2008-12-20T03:50:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	that is weird, Ubuntu should detect that card
2008-12-20T03:50:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	yes, i know
2008-12-20T03:50:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	and several other operating systems DO detect the card
2008-12-20T03:51:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	mem is OK?
2008-12-20T03:51:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	memtests for 48+ hours, other linuxes have been installed on this machine for years. it's not a hardware problem
2008-12-20T03:51:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	Ok...just running through the obvious :)
2008-12-20T03:52:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	like i mentioned in the original statement, i've done everything obvious
2008-12-20T03:52:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	i've gone as far as using a linuxfromscratch install with an ubuntu patched kernel and the same drivers that ubuntu provides (all 5 of them)
2008-12-20T03:53:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	have your tried booting with a previous kernel?
2008-12-20T03:53:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	there is only 1 kernel
2008-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	well theres 2 now because I updated, but they are both yielding the same behavior
2008-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	ahh...this is a fresh install?
2008-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	fryguy	mrwes	yes
2008-12-20T03:55:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	and the 5 pound sledge hammer doesn't work :)
2008-12-20T05:51:00.000Z	mrwes	fryguy	you ever fix that video card?
