2011-05-03T23:41:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man		I'm all for whatever will give Ubuntu a broader user base.  Then more commercial apps will show up on it.  I can't ditch windows at home because I'm a gamer.  I can't ditch windows at work because of outlook and Active Directory.
2011-05-03T23:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	actually, you can ditch outlook and AD.  there's evolution, or thunderbird with davmail, and for ad, look at http://www.likewise.com/products/likewise_open/
2011-05-03T23:44:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	the problem is that I have to be able to manage AD
2011-05-03T23:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	you cannot manage it from the AD server itself ... via remote desktop?
2011-05-03T23:45:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	That would be my only option.  Our main company apps already run in citrix, which works great in Ubuntu.
2011-05-03T23:47:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	The other thing stopping me at work, I can't quite figure out.  Ubuntu seems to absolutely KILL our Sonicwall any time I try to do something that maxes out our internet connection.  Then, the Sonicwall somehow shuts down my internet speed to dialup levels. I've googled the mess out of the issues, but with no luck.
2011-05-03T23:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	define "maxes out internet" ... like a bit torrent?
2011-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	Sort of.  All of our pings will go to hell while it's happening.  But, as I said, after about 10 seconds of doing this, suddenly my download speed on ubuntu will drop to almost nothing, and my networks goes back to normal.  I can reproduce this on any hardware, as long as it's running Ubuntu.
2011-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	but what are you doing on the ubuntu machine to trigger it?  Simply running ubuntu by itself won't cause that behaviour...
2011-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	what I mean by max out, is anything that can fill our pipe, like a MS service pack download, or something like that.
2011-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	all i'm doing on the ubuntu machine to trigger it is downloading something from the internet.
2011-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man		hell, even a youtube video will do it
2011-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	webpages download just fine.  Only larger, single file downloads.
2011-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	ubuntu software updates will usually do it too
2011-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	http download... hm.  that is extremely odd.  who administers the sonic wall and the network?  Are there policies set that the windows machines honour but your ubuntu machines don't (like dhcp hostname registration or something)?
2011-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	the network and sonicwall admin would be me.
2011-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	I've looked in every nook and cranny of that sonicwall, and I can't find anything that might do what it does.
2011-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	even bypassing the sonicwall with a content filter bypass doesn't help.
2011-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	somehow it just doesn't like something Ubuntu does.
2011-05-03T23:54:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	you /could/ set a traffic shaping policy on the ubuntu box that restricts downloads to 80% of the known bandwidth... look up wondershaper... http://lartc.org/wondershaper/
2011-05-03T23:55:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	I'm glad you brought that up.  I've got wondershaper on the machine, but either I'm doing something wrong, or I just can't speed up what wondershaper is letting me do.  The command I'm using is "sudo wondershaper eth4 9999 9999".  Supposedly that will give me approx 10 megabit up/down.  But i'm only averaging 16kB/s
2011-05-03T23:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cajun_Lan_Man	and without wondershaper, do you get more than 16kB?
2011-05-03T23:59:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	mbeierl	I do for about 10 seconds, then the sonicwall shuts me down to nothing.
