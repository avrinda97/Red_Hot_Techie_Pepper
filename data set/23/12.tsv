2004-09-30T05:15:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	the evolution bug you had me report upstream, is there a way to doc that somewhere so other ubuntu users will know upstream is taking care of it and it's a known prob?
2004-09-30T05:15:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	not yet, but there will be :)
2004-09-30T05:16:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	fyi, contacts and evolution-alarm is broken on amd64 platform and according to upstream it's most likely a libdb threading problem
2004-09-30T05:22:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	excellent, that's the best response we get :-) thanks
2004-09-30T05:23:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	it took a little longer to install all the development tools I use, but it was still pretty easy once I uncommented universal and restricted in apt sources.list ;)
2004-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	what did I need from universe?
2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	i needed anjuta, allegro, and a few other things from universe/restricted
2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	most distributions include allegro in their base already along with sdl
2004-09-30T06:42:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	'****house properietary drivers' are better than none, and in some cases are the only option, you know that as well as I do if you do commercial software development
2004-09-30T06:43:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	they are, but if companies persist with binary drivers, they will lose in the market.
2004-09-30T06:43:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	i'm not so sure, 3d graphics are an area where I doub't well ever see good 3d hardware with drivers :|
2004-09-30T06:43:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	even ati went closed source :|
2004-09-30T06:45:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	dude, it will happen. it is inevitable. :-)
2004-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	when linux has 20% market share, do you think the dells, hps and ibms of this world are going to choose hardware/chipsets that require binary drivers? no. :-)
2004-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	the pie in the sky idea of one day properietary drives won't be necessary because we'll own the market sounds great, but in the meantime binary 3d is the only way to get workstation class 3d so it'd be great if that were easier :)
2004-09-30T07:06:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	that's a *good* thing :-)
2004-09-30T07:07:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	not from a programming perspective
2004-09-30T07:07:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	if the Qt or Gtk apis changed as often as the kernel driver API there would be a mutiny :)
2004-09-30T07:07:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	even for open source drivers it's very difficult to keep up with kernel changes sometimes
2004-09-30T07:07:00.000Z	jdub	Adonijah	sure, that's why they should be in the kernel
2004-09-30T07:07:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	that sounds great in theory, but what about when there's 20,000 drivers to be maintained
2004-09-30T07:08:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	pretend for a moment that binary drivers couldn't exist
2004-09-30T07:09:00.000Z	Adonijah	jdub	would you then suddenly want  a stable API?
