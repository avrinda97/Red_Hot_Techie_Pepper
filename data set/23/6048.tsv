2006-06-23T16:20:00.000Z	kr4z		does anybody know of any good documentation for using dual monitors with fglrx? I can get it half working but it breaks whenever I logout and login as a different user
2006-06-23T05:18:00.000Z	kr4z		anybody have any experience with fglrx "big desktop" mode?
2006-06-23T05:20:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 what's up?
2006-06-23T05:22:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	I'm trying to use my laptop's LCD and an external VGA monitor with one desktop across them, and I got it half working, but there seems to be an invisible part where my mouse can go that's off the edge of my laptop's LCD (it's a smaller resolution)
2006-06-23T05:22:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 if the screens are different resolutions, it will
2006-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	ah
2006-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 the desktop is essentially one BIG rectangle, and your two monitors are little squares looking into it.
2006-06-23T05:24:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	is there no way to stop the mouse from going there?
2006-06-23T05:24:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 as you can imagine, if you have a smaller and a bigger sitting next to each other there will be dead space.
2006-06-23T05:24:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 no, but the mouse only knows about the big rectangle, not the little ones :)
2006-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	hmm, ok. There's another problem I'm having though, whenever I log out and log in as a different user the dual monitors stop working
2006-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	in very strange ways
2006-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	in that the mouse can go off the edge of the screen, but it's not the side where the other monitor used to be
2006-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	any ideas about the second problem?
2006-06-23T05:29:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 I was looking because I didn't off the top of my head :)
2006-06-23T05:29:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	I suspect it has something to do with gnome
2006-06-23T05:30:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 assuming your configuration of xorg is good, there shouldn't be any change there.
2006-06-23T05:30:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	I used the "Screen Resolution" thing to change the resolution to 1024x768 when I took off the second monitor one time, and then when I changed it back dual monitors stopped working on that user
2006-06-23T05:30:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 tbh, don't know much about the x environment much.  but spent the last couple of weeks twiddling with fglrx and radeon drivers :)
2006-06-23T05:31:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	I've been trying to figure this out for like a week :S
2006-06-23T05:31:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	fglrx doesn't seem to have much documentation
2006-06-23T05:32:00.000Z	neotard	kr4z	 doesn't talk about all the incompatibilies you'll come in contact with once you have it running :
2006-06-23T05:34:00.000Z	kr4z	neotard	incompatibilities?
