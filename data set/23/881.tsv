2012-10-25T16:51:00.000Z	subz3r0	bindi	nic-teaming or bonding doesnt work? mhh?
2012-10-25T16:51:00.000Z	bindi	subz3r0	what do you mean?
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	subz3r0		like i said
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	subz3r0		bundle two nics to one
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	bindi	subz3r0	you can't get twice the speed with teaming
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	bindi		per tcp connection
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	subz3r0		thats right, but you can bundle them
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	bindi		no but he asked if it's possible to pull 200 Mbps
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	subz3r0		maybe i missunderstood your answer. but its ofc faster than 100mbit with 2x 100mbut
2012-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	bindi		how come?
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	bindi		 again, if you do a file transfer with two machines that have 2x100 Mbps  bonded connections, you get 100 Mbps
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	bindi		unless the file transfer protocol/program whatever supports something like iscsi multipathing i guess
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	subz3r0		two machines? thought its about 2 nics in one machine... anyway..
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	subz3r0		teaming or bonding works
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	bindi		sure, it works, but it doesnt give him what he wants
2012-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	bindi	subz3r0	ideally you'd want to use bonding on two machines
2012-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	bindi		unless you're looking for redundancy
2012-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	subz3r0		indeed. but its faster than 100mbit... overhead here and there etc.. bla... but more faster than just one nic... and more redundant...
2012-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	bindi		how is it faster than one nic?
2012-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	subz3r0		its more offtopic.. but give ifenslave-2.6 a shot
2012-10-25T16:56:00.000Z	subz3r0		give the same mac to both nics and just give it a shot... it is faster
2012-10-25T16:56:00.000Z	subz3r0		actualy i get 15mb/s with 2nics
2012-10-25T16:59:00.000Z	subz3r0	bindi	well 15-17,5mb/s
