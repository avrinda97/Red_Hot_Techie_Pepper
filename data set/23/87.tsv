2012-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		Kartagis:try a reboot after switching a value
2012-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	so the solution with gconf-editor isn't gonna working in 12.04, neither any other tool can make top bar position changed, can it?
2012-07-30T11:43:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	no its a unity thing now, top bar is needed for windows (like a mac) only left bar can be hiding
2012-07-30T11:44:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	alternatives are installing gnome-shell
2012-07-30T11:46:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	ikno, thx, but I really like Unity, it's so great in the latest Ubuntu distributives. It's just that the top bar as also the left bar are glitching when I screencast my x11grabbed desktop via ffmpeg having some motion picture (like mediaplayer) fullscreened =.
2012-07-30T11:47:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	u mean your screen is flickering with the bars?
2012-07-30T11:49:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	exactly. Undetermined behavior of the output picture. With some players/applications it seems to be fine, but the majority of them are just not working as I want them to, and these bars are showed up through my full sreen player/application once per several seconds
2012-07-30T11:49:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	i think flickering is not caused by the bars mate, you got same issue with lets say vlc?
2012-07-30T11:52:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	well, if I screencast my Totem on full screen - bars are flickering. Twitch.tv, Cybergame.tv, Youtube fullscreen players - flickering. Own3d however don't =/
2012-07-30T11:52:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	are you sure your grafix driver is installed correclty?
2012-07-30T11:53:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	pretty much, since I've already tried a recommended one and the latest update.
2012-07-30T11:55:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	the pc and the graphic card itself are modern as well as the Ubuntu 12.04 distributive was downloaded just a month ago. Or I missed the point? How can I switch to the Unity 2D?
2012-07-30T11:56:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	you can logout and after typing username you can swith unity3D to unity2d
2012-07-30T11:56:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	I'll try. Hold on
2012-07-30T11:56:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	we gotta findout what causes this flickering
2012-07-30T11:59:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	ok, I'm here. Testing out my broadcast
2012-07-30T11:59:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	ok im curious
2012-07-30T12:03:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	wow, it's working just fine. Now I wonder how I can get it work in 3D :curious:
2012-07-30T12:04:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	maybe its a compiz thing, or a grafix driver thing
2012-07-30T13:24:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	checking/uncheking some options in compiz have finally led my Unity 3D to complete death. The full reset/restart of both unity and compiz to the original fabric settings with some magical drum-dances around the fire have finally revived the Unity 2D/3D, but the problem with flickering stuff is yet unresolved. Screw this) I literally crapped my pents, when I saw waves across the sreen and some mystical overlaps, while being playing with compi
2012-07-30T13:27:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	vitrums	some values in compiz need a restart of course
2012-07-30T13:36:00.000Z	vitrums	lotuspsychje	I got probably the most unwanted behaviour when the screen resolution was 1920x1080, however it was only the top-left corner of arguably 640x480 available, whilst the rest of the screen was filled with some artifacts. None of compiz options toggles would have return the working configuration. That's kinda scary and it works pretty much like PulseAudio - ridiculously unstable ;(
