2009-02-08T06:03:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	I'm looking for something tiny that can serve as a web server and is real cheap.
2009-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	is this part of KDE?
2009-02-08T06:47:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	no.
2009-02-08T06:47:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	I'm currently on Debian and its old.  I'm going to build a new install shortly and I'm going to use Ubuntu - virtual is something I'm very interested in.
2009-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	in order to use KVM, your hardware needs to support virtualization.  That URL tells you how to determine whether or not your hardware does.
2009-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	this is starting to look like we are moving from the stone ages.
2009-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	?
2009-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	IBM did it right a long time ago.
2009-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	cases can be reused
2009-02-08T07:29:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	you're missing out.  There's an entire ubuntu derivative distro called mythbuntu specifically for mythtv.
2009-02-08T07:29:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	but I don't yet know what mythtc is.
2009-02-08T07:29:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	shocking
2009-02-08T07:30:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	I live in a cave and plug my computers into rocks
2009-02-08T07:30:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	that sounds VERY interesting for something I want to do
2009-02-08T07:31:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	good deal
2009-02-08T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	DVI and HDMI (also DisplayPort)
2009-02-08T07:47:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	thanks
2009-02-08T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	they are
2009-02-08T07:51:00.000Z	tritium	terr_	it shouldn't require any config changes.  It should run "out of the box."
2009-02-08T07:51:00.000Z	terr_	tritium	I forget... servers have been up for years... also my servers are openBSD... desktops are linux
