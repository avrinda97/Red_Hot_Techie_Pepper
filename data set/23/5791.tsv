2006-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	TheDude		can I set Remote Desktop on my ubuntu, and access it from another computer ?
2006-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	Yes, you can
2006-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	10x. how can I do that?
2006-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	You should see configuration under System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
2006-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	if you don't, then there's just a small package you need to install called 'vino'
2006-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	10q very much
2006-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	Ubuntu uses a protocol called VNC for remote desktop. It's not supported by the Windows Remote Desktop application, but it's very well supported otherwise; there are dozens of clients for it
2006-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	yeah I know vnc
2006-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	but I wanted to know if it's possible to do it with rdp as well
2006-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	btw, if we're talking about it already, do you know what's the diff between rdp and rdp v5 ?
2006-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	Not from a feature-level, no
2006-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	oh wait, does it mean that if I use the ubuntu Remote Desktop feature, then I can't connect to it using windows Remote Desktop?
2006-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	That's what I said, yes
2006-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	RDP is a proprietary protocol; I *have* seen a linux server for it, but it's a very, very long way from ready to release
2006-09-08T05:36:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	got it. 10x
2006-09-08T05:36:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	can you help in another question I have ?
2006-09-08T05:37:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	I don't know yet...
2006-09-08T05:37:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	:-)
2006-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	how can I set a share on my ubuntu, that will be accessable from other computers on my network?
2006-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	System -> Admninistration -> Shared Folders :-)
2006-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	hmm.. right, forgot that one. but I do want to learn how to do it, the terminal way.. :-) which means, configuring the samba manually
2006-09-08T05:42:00.000Z	ccooke	TheDude	Google is your friend, there. It would take me a *long* time to explain that here
2006-09-08T05:42:00.000Z	TheDude	ccooke	thought so. no easy shortcuts there :-)  10x again man
