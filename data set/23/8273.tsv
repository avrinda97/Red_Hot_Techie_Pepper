2004-12-10T13:10:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	ok perhaps empty your trash
2004-12-10T13:10:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	kill gdm and log into the console
2004-12-10T13:11:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	press ctrl alt F1
2004-12-10T13:11:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	then log in and do "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2004-12-10T13:12:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	then do "rm ~/.Trash/*
2004-12-10T13:14:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	how ya getting on
2004-12-10T13:16:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	be careful with rm -rf, you don't wanna remove something important ;)
2004-12-10T13:16:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	you killed gnome right?
2004-12-10T13:17:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	ok don't get distracted
2004-12-10T13:17:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	"rm -rf ~/.Trash/*" will remove all of it
2004-12-10T13:17:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	but BE CAREFUL
2004-12-10T13:18:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	just do the commands which we have said and it will be fine
2004-12-10T13:18:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	cancel that with CTRL C
2004-12-10T13:18:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	then do that command
2004-12-10T13:23:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	it is a full stop not a comma, and a star not an 8
2004-12-10T13:24:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	omg
2004-12-10T13:24:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	ls -a to see your home directory
2004-12-10T13:25:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	you may have lost some vital stuff in your home directory
2004-12-10T13:25:00.000Z	Matt|	newtolinux	but i doubt you've deleted the whole thing surely
