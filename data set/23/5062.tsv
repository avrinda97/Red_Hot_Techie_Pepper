2007-02-28T12:05:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	what's your question?
2007-02-28T12:05:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	I want to take whatever is being fed into Line In and pipe it straight to the speakers.
2007-02-28T12:05:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	feedback basically?
2007-02-28T12:06:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	I guess you could say that. The issue is my TV Speaker wire ports don't work, but the AV out does, I don't have anything but computer speakers to use, I have the cables to take it from av to comuter input, I just need it to link straight to audio out
2007-02-28T12:07:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	ahh gotcha
2007-02-28T12:07:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	certainly possible by all means (i know how to do it in windows but not linux).  all that would have to happen would be for something to read line-in and write the same thing out
2007-02-28T12:07:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	in fact i used to use it for TV
2007-02-28T12:08:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	Okay, good to know it's possible.
2007-02-28T12:08:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	i believe it's called loopback or feedback.  as for actually getting it to work, try screwing with the alsa mixer.  i'm pretty sure i got my tv working with alsa
2007-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	i am pretty sure what you want to do is to raise the volume of "line in" on the playback section of the mixer (dont forget to unmute it).  cant confirm it atm.  i'd tend to think i'd hear a little noise even if nothing was connected.
2007-02-28T12:15:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	okay I'm reinstalling edgy now, I'll try that first and go from there. Playback section as in the audio controls?
2007-02-28T12:15:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	type "alsamixer" and Playback should be selected at the top (it is until you press tab to switch to the "Recording" or "All" mixing sections)
2007-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	it's also in "gnome-volume-control".  gnome-volume-control gives you access to switches that the ncurses-based alsamixer doesn't seem to, as a matter of fact
2007-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	what sound card?
2007-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	onboard, but I have a SoundBlaster card that I can plug in if need be.
2007-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	and also, does the sound pass through during computer bootup when drivers for the board aren't loaded?  i am pretty sure mine did.  just like my video card outputs to component out before drivers are even loaded
2007-02-28T12:17:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	wait, what was that last part?
2007-02-28T12:17:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	most pc devices have a mode where 'everything' works during computer POST (for debug purposes).  i was just curious if your sound card happened to output line-in during startup
2007-02-28T12:18:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	I have no idea, I havn't tried.
2007-02-28T12:18:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	I'll give it a try.
2007-02-28T13:41:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	I got it working. I just went to asla mixer and put line in all up and unmuted!
2007-02-28T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	MarcoCeppi	cool
2007-02-28T13:41:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	xtknight	thanks for your help
