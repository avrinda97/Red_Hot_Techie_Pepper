2007-06-10T05:24:00.000Z	bulio|		I used a live CD to edit my partition table, now when I am trying to boot grub gives me an error 15
2007-06-10T05:24:00.000Z	bulio|		how can I fix the partition table to reflect the changes?
2007-06-10T05:25:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	because grub is still looking for the /boot in the same place it used to be... its not there anymore
2007-06-10T05:25:00.000Z	bulio|	TaJMoX	how can I fix this?
2007-06-10T05:26:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	i suggest you start reading the existing grub conversations
2007-06-10T05:26:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	it depends on where your partitions are at now.    try the grub docs
2007-06-10T05:26:00.000Z	bulio|	TaJMoX	but what file do I edit to add in the new changes
2007-06-10T05:27:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	try 'grub'
2007-06-10T05:27:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	and man grub
2007-06-10T05:27:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	you might have to edit that too

2007-06-10T05:31:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	you have two Linux partitions - which one contains /boot ?
2007-06-10T05:31:00.000Z	bulio|	TaJMoX	I'm not sure
2007-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	that'd be the first step - figure out where your linux is
2007-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	look at the thing u sent me - it says its windows on hda2
2007-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	bulio|	TaJMoX	which is weird, I don't have windows installed
2007-06-10T05:34:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	mount /dev/hda6 /mnt
2007-06-10T05:35:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	mount (device) (destination)     also i suggest a linux beginner guide
2007-06-10T05:35:00.000Z	bulio|	TaJMoX	I'm familiar with Linux commands
2007-06-10T05:35:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	try mounting hda7
2007-06-10T05:38:00.000Z	TaJMoX	bulio|	you are familiar with linux - find your partition that contains your operating system and /boot - then get back to me
