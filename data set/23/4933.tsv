2007-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	brunoUT		ok people....im trying to do something simple......how do u install from a dvd?
2007-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	brunoUT		what is the correct commands?
2007-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	same way you do it with a cd
2007-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	you put the dvd in the drive, and boot
2007-04-09T15:09:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	there is no dvd's that will allow that, you will need to get an alternate or server cd
2007-04-10T16:12:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	it controls the gui
2007-04-10T05:02:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	shouldn't he be helping you then
2007-04-10T05:03:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	maybe you just have a hosed install or something
2007-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	should see the contents of your home folder
2007-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	ls Desktop
2007-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	or cd Desktop && ls
2007-04-10T06:17:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	the file isn't gzipped
2007-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	tar xf
2007-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	why are you installing that
2007-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	sudo apt-get install hplip
2007-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	you should also be able, assuming you have gui, to go to system>administration>printing
2007-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	did you go to system>administration>printing
2007-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	brunoUT	bruenig	when i click printers
2007-04-10T06:24:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	putting my name and only my name on one line, is an abuse of !enter
2007-04-10T06:25:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	collect your thoughts, and then ask a coherent question, don't put "I clicked printers" on a line
2007-04-12T16:39:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	no, I don't know matlab
2007-04-16T16:36:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	k3b probably
2007-04-16T16:37:00.000Z	bruenig	brunoUT	yes, burning isos is the easiest thing to do pretty much, you could do that on any of the burning programs
