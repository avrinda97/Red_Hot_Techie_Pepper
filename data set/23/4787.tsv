2009-02-14T09:31:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	you can remove the beep all together from all apps with sudo rmmod pcspkr
2009-02-14T09:32:00.000Z	owen1	ziroday	interesting, but i would like only from FF.
2009-02-14T09:33:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	hmm for me doing ctrl+down changes tab
2009-02-14T09:33:00.000Z	owen1	ziroday	i meant page-down..sorry
2009-02-14T09:34:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	page down doesn't do it either

2009-05-23T18:14:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	you need the alternative :)
2009-05-28T14:17:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	try killall -9 firefox

2009-06-06T14:36:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	head over to 2015?
2009-06-06T14:37:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	and it probably is working, just not mapped to anything
2009-06-06T14:37:00.000Z	ziroday	owen1	you can test it by doing xev in a terminal and pressing the key
2009-06-06T14:38:00.000Z	owen1	ziroday	ok
