2007-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	ikonia		that should only be a few seconds at worst
2007-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	ikonia		even on a slow computer
2007-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	ikonia		and if the computer is THAT slow that just booting is a problem then to be honest, nothing you can do will change that
2007-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	ikonia		if you see what I mean
2007-01-04T06:48:00.000Z	ikonia		if loading a module takes that long - then you've got no chance of doing anything with it
2007-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	ikonia		insmod is super light
2007-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	ikonia		and if thats taking ages, that machine is pretty unusable (trying to make it clearer)
2007-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	ikonia		add a rule in udev
2007-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	ikonia		so it doesn't need to be done every time
2007-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	ikonia		dsp is his onboard sound card, thats why his usb one is dsp1
2007-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	why is an udev rule better? just asking...
2007-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	ty for the info :D now i understand
2007-01-05T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	nikin	the problem is he doesn't have smaba installed
2007-01-05T17:32:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	i understand. Just i ame folowing this conversation for a while now.. and i just cant understand why he did, what he did. thats all.
2007-01-06T07:25:00.000Z	ikonia	nikin	screen is a good call, but its a bit advanced for him
2007-01-06T07:26:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	screen is a breeze to get used to it, and has several pretty nice features like freeing a process from a session
2007-01-06T07:26:00.000Z	ikonia	nikin	I know this
2007-01-06T07:27:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	i know you know it...
2007-04-13T12:35:00.000Z	ikonia	nikin	your xinitrc or your .gnome file
2007-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	is there a locla file from that? or that is global for any user?
2007-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	nikin	each user in his ome dir
2007-04-13T12:38:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	i just have xsession-errors file...
2010-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	nikin	ikonia	isnt there a solution for it in the new partitiner to span one partitin throught more disks using LVM?
