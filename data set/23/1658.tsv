2009-12-16T15:23:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	is it on your taskbar?
2009-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	as an icon?
2009-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	i did a search in add/rmove for network and saw it there. but, there is a "manual network configuration" icon near the clock..
2009-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	but opening that only shows ethernet and dialup modem devices
2009-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	if it is checked then its already installed
2009-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	how about right click?
2009-12-16T15:28:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	the ethernet is ticked.. that works all good.. using laptop on ethernet now.. hmm... right click gives me option to "edit wireless network"... no option to search or roam for a nearby one though.. i tihnk it'll only let me manually setup..
2009-12-16T15:29:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	it's all greyed out in wireless options
2009-12-16T15:29:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	is there a box to 'enable networking' or 'enable wireless'?
2009-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	yes, there's an 'enable networking' box, it's currently ticked
2009-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	riverbird	Newbie-Widget	but nothing for wireless?  ok
2009-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	riverbird	nope, nothing :S
