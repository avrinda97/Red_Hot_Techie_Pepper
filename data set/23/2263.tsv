2009-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	JmZ		i've spent all day and night trying to resolve this problem
2009-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	JmZ		and im getting no where
2009-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	JmZ		i did ask the question

2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	JmZ		i installed the nvidia drivers and then did a "partial" (why partial) update and the kernel updated
2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	JmZ		then all my graphics died
2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	JmZ		ok just try help me
2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	Gho	JmZ	When you ask one question over many many many lines, it gets broken up and hard to read as other text is interspersed throughout your question. That is why we ask you to put your complete question/problem on one line.
2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	JmZ		yes i know flannel but i dont want them
2009-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	JmZ		i want the original ubuntu nvidia ones i had
2009-05-11T01:07:00.000Z	JmZ		the hardware drivers shows nothing in it
2009-05-11T01:07:00.000Z	JmZ		its blank
2009-05-11T01:07:00.000Z	Gho	JmZ	at the console, use dpkg-query -l | grep ii | grep nvidia to see which nvidia drivers you have installed, then use sudo apt-get remove <package> to remove then
2009-05-11T01:08:00.000Z	JmZ	Gho	i did that already and the only remaining things required hardware drivers to be removed too (dependencies)
2009-05-11T01:08:00.000Z	JmZ		now i reinstalled nvidia "new" driver and no luck still even after choosing it in the x conf
2009-05-11T01:09:00.000Z	Gho	JmZ	try perhaps sudo dpkg-reconfuigure xserver-xorg ?
2009-05-11T01:10:00.000Z	JmZ	Gho	i did that many times no luck
2009-05-11T01:11:00.000Z	Gho	JmZ	perhaps something more extreme: sudo apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg
2009-05-11T01:11:00.000Z	JmZ	Gho	is there no other less extreme way
2009-05-11T01:11:00.000Z	JmZ	Gho	i doubt its an xserver problem
