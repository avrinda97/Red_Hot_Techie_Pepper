2006-07-26T11:30:00.000Z	TiG4		*-- Whenever I ran the Dapper graphical installer, the x server would not start, it did the same thing and went to a black screen. What could the problem be? --*
2006-07-26T11:32:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	how are you installing? install CD during boot?
2006-07-26T11:34:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	Im just using the install cd, and booting from the cd
2006-07-26T11:37:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	is there any option not to use the graphical installer?
2006-07-26T11:38:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	I got it installed with the not graphical installer, but now xserver wont start on bootup
2006-07-26T11:38:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	this seems like a video problem.
2006-07-26T11:38:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	I think thats what it isalso
2006-07-26T11:39:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	what card are you using?
2006-07-26T11:40:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	yep
2006-07-26T11:40:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	I've reconfigured xorg
2006-07-26T11:40:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	but I didn't really know which vid driver to select, I used the default i810
2006-07-26T11:41:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	hmm. i was going to mention changing that. have you googled for what other people have done with that card?
2006-07-26T11:42:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	btw, have you installed any linux on that machine and got x11 to work?
2006-07-26T11:44:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	yeah
2006-07-26T11:44:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	debian
2006-07-26T11:45:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	why not just use the video card data from that install?
2006-07-26T11:46:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	in xorg i mean
2006-07-26T11:52:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	what do you mean
2006-07-26T11:53:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	copy the xorg.conf (or whatever its called) to some place you can get to it again, and then apply those values to the new xorg.
2006-07-26T11:54:00.000Z	teimu	TiG4	unless you've already overwritten the Debian install...
2006-07-26T11:54:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	yeah i did
2006-07-26T11:54:00.000Z	TiG4	teimu	Unfortunately
