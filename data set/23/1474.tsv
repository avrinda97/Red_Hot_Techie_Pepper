2010-03-22T21:43:00.000Z	Mathuin		I posted a more detailed version of my question to the forums.  In case anyone's curious, it was about a device using a Silicon Labs CP2102 chip for USB->serial functionality and disabling the default assertion of DTR and RTS when open()'ing the device.  If you have an answer or suggestion, please comment on the forum post.  Thanks again for all your help!
2010-03-22T21:44:00.000Z	Mathuin		I would like to say that it rocks that Ubuntu actually *supports* the device I'm using, and FreeBSD has yet to include the patch I wrote to add the device to the supported Silicon Labs devices like a year ago.  Sigh.  Anyway, bye!
2010-03-22T21:44:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	maybe using an udev-rule, calling setserial?
2011-04-03T01:54:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	msmtp/ssmtp + mail-utils
2011-04-03T01:54:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	I'll give those a try.  I'd heard that ssmtp was no longer actively maintained -- is that true?
2011-04-03T01:54:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	no idea, i prefer mstmp
2011-04-03T01:55:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	besides that: theres not much maintenance needed for such a simple tool/task  ;)
2011-04-03T01:56:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	heh.  hmm.  mailutils won't install without me playing ncurses games, which isn't acceptable for this purpose.  I'll try heirloom-mailx next.
2011-04-03T02:03:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	msmtp requires a lot of configuration. :-(  I'm ---> <--- this close to simply telnetting to port 25 on the destination server.  It shouldn't be this hard just to send a single email.
2011-04-03T02:04:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	mstmp needs exact one config-file
2011-04-03T02:05:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	I need a .mailrc that points at msmtp and an msmtprc file which appears to need to be pointed at a mail server.
2011-04-03T02:08:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	mutt >1-5.14 should be able to send mail
2011-04-03T02:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	*without* installing postfix or sendmail or any of that?
2011-04-03T02:09:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	http://wiki.mutt.org/?MuttGuide/Send
2011-04-03T02:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/mutt#Installation *sigh*
2011-04-03T02:10:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	i guess mutt.org should know better about mutt
2011-04-03T02:11:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	yeah, but it's Ubuntu I'm using.
2011-04-03T02:12:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	sudo aptitude -R install mutt
2011-04-03T02:14:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	installed, but doesn't send mail.

2011-04-03T02:16:00.000Z	llutz	Mathuin	"How do I configure Mutt to use a remote SMTP server to send mail?"
2011-04-03T02:18:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	That is very cool.  It won't work for me, because I don't have a username and password to give it.
2011-04-03T02:18:00.000Z	Mathuin	llutz	thank you for finding it.  I will be able to use it in other situations.
