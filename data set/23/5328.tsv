2009-05-13T07:53:00.000Z	darrellsmith		can someone help me
2009-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	doy ou mean you can't install it, or you can't get it to run?
2009-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	go to system/admin/synaptic package manager
2009-05-13T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	no kidding...
2009-05-13T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	do you have a frostwire in appliations/internet?
2009-05-13T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	how did you try to install it?
2009-05-13T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	did you double click it to run it?
2009-05-13T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	open a terminal (application/accessories/terminal) and type frostwire , then hit enter and see what it says
2009-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	so it didn't install
2009-05-13T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	go back to frostwire.com and download the .deb, and double click it
2009-05-13T08:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	well, that explains that.. you're not downloading the file.
2009-05-13T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	do you see the .deb file on the desktop or in your home folder?
2009-05-13T08:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	is it in your home folder?.. or perhaps in /home/username/Documents
2009-05-13T08:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	i dunno, doesn't make any sense.... in firefox.. click edit/preferences.. and where it says "Save Files To".. where does it say its saving files to?
2009-05-13T08:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	wellt hatm akes absolutely zero since, if you're sure you downloaded it.
2009-05-13T08:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	well you did something that doesn't make sense because if it downloaded, it should be there
2009-05-13T08:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	ok, double click it to install it
2009-05-13T08:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	so go to applications/internet/frostwire
2009-05-13T08:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	well, i thought when i told you to "download it".. you'd understand that
2009-05-13T08:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	i only use my router, but theres software firewalls available
2009-05-13T08:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	if its properly set up, iw ould consider that adequate protection under linu
2009-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	darrellsmith	i would certainly hope so.
