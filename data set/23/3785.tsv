2008-01-21T09:52:00.000Z	htns		to the login screen
2008-01-21T09:53:00.000Z	htns		but after i login, it's really fast
2008-01-21T09:53:00.000Z	htns		does anybody know why?
2008-01-21T09:55:00.000Z	htns		^_^
2008-01-21T09:57:00.000Z	htns		Usually, I just get up, do my stuff (about 10-15 minutes) and get back, and there's the login screen
2008-01-21T09:57:00.000Z	htns		I mean, srsly, Windows 95 boots up faster than that, what's up dude?
2008-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	htns		tribaldata: ubuntu works, it's just that, it takes forever to get from the boot menu to login screen
2008-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	htns		From there on, it's great
2008-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	htns		It seems to respond though
2008-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	htns		If I do ctrl-alt-del, then it just reboots after a while, like 40 seconds....
2008-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	does usplash show up?
2008-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	I dunno, when I get back, usually the login screen is just sitting there
2008-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	so nothing shows up while booting from grub to gsm?
2008-01-21T10:01:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	that would be my best guess, it's just a blank screen
2008-01-21T10:02:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	if ctl-alt-f1 makes boot faster it seems you have the usplash resolution bug.
2008-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	so should I go ahead and do ctrl-alt-f1 then during boot?
2008-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	yes, that would confirm that you are affected by the bug. If so, you should change the contents of /etc/usplash.conf to your screen resolution and then perform "sudo update-initramfs  'uname
2008-01-21T10:08:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	sorry hit enter, "sudo update-initramfs 'uname -r'l
2008-01-21T10:08:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	okay
2008-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	ethan961	htns	I apologize for poor typing, trying to type this on my iphone
2008-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	lol o wow
2008-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	I know how hard that is, my brother owns one too
2008-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	htns	ethan961	i think you're right though, usplash.conf was set to the wrong resolution, it was too high for me
