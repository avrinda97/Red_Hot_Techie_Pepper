2011-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	Timvde		I'm having troubles with my internet lately, and I noticed I got an update for dhcp3-client and dhcp3-common on August 16. Is it possible that is related? Problem is: if I try to force the version of dhcp3-common down to the previous one, Synaptic forces me to remove dhcp3-client and ubuntu-minimal. How can I solve this?
2011-09-04T12:59:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	What problems exactly?
2011-09-04T12:59:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	Random disconnects my sister doesn't have on her Windows laptop
2011-09-04T13:03:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	I really suspect those dhcp-* packages to be the culprit, I really want to downgrade them and see if it solves my problem.
2011-09-04T13:03:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	You'll probably have to build from source to downgrade
2011-09-04T13:04:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	Can you assure me I won't break anything if I remove those packages and install them again later?
2011-09-04T13:05:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	Because when packages get upgraded it's because their candidacy has been replaced in the repos. I don't know if old packages remain and you could perhaps get them if you knew the exact package name
2011-09-04T13:05:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	I can make no guarantees, no. If it goes wrong you'd probably have to recreate your network interfaces and routes
2011-09-04T13:05:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	Synaptic gives me the option to downgrade.
2011-09-04T13:06:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	Oh really? I haven't seen that
2011-09-04T13:07:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	It would be nice to have a way to downgrade them without uninstalling those other packages, or otherwise just to have an assurance nothing will break when I remove them (and reinstall them later manually)
2011-09-04T13:07:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	Install isc-dhcp-client and isc-dhcp-common
2011-09-04T13:08:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	They're not in Synaptic. I should mention that I'm still on Maverick, maybe.
2011-09-04T13:08:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	isc-dhcp-client and common are the packages, dhcp3-client and common are transitional, they're the same packages though it seems. Exact same version
2011-09-04T13:08:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	Ah, perhaps isc-dhcp is only on 11.04 and the transitionals are only on maverick
2011-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	I see maverick packages for them.
2011-09-04T13:12:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	They don't appear in Synaptic
2011-09-04T13:14:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	 Are you running 64-bit?
2011-09-04T13:14:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	Yes, I am
2011-09-04T13:16:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	That's explain it, I only see 32-bit packages for it
2011-09-04T13:21:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	So, do you think I can uninstall those packages safely for a while?
2011-09-04T13:26:00.000Z	Polah	Timvde	I can't guarantee internet functionality after reinstalling
2011-09-04T13:27:00.000Z	Timvde	Polah	Damn. But I think I am going to take the risk, just got another disconnect and I'm really fed up with it
