2009-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	I've run into real-world queries which are fully optimized and take a good 15 minutes to run
2009-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	ahah, i'm talking about a website with about a hundred tables, the bigger having 4 millions rows, you know it's not that big for a DB and i'm sure that's cause the DB was not originally well designed, not because there is too much data to process (as it would be for requests about 15 minutes long ;) )
2009-05-24T11:11:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	Ryan Air apparently doesn't have any problem with that
2009-05-24T11:11:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	ryan air?
2009-05-24T11:12:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	a low coast airline company, they are thinking about charging really fat people with 2 tickets instead of one ;)
2009-05-24T11:22:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	you still around?
2009-05-24T11:24:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	yep ??
2009-05-24T11:25:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	COMMIT has nothing to do with the data being stored properly on disk does it?
2009-05-24T11:26:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	not at all
2009-05-24T11:26:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	sorry i didn't read, i assume you mean SVN commit ?
2009-05-24T11:26:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	no, SQL transactions
2009-05-24T11:27:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	i'll need a little more explanations to answer then, what was the question already ?
2009-05-24T11:29:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	I'm just trying to remember if ACID compliance means that once a transaction is COMMITted, it is safe on the disk
2009-05-24T11:29:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	i.e. if the system were to hardlock immediately after a COMMIT, if that transaction would be safe
2009-05-24T11:29:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	oh ok
2009-05-24T11:30:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	i'm not sure of that
2009-05-24T11:31:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	your'e a professinal data modeller and work iwth DBs on a far more initmate level than me, so I didn't want to say "for sure" unless I knew... AFAIK the durability part of ACID just meant that the DB was in a consistent state as far as the DB was concerned, not necessarily the system
2009-05-24T11:31:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	IMO if a transaction is transmitted it's like the query was written, but like any query if the system crash the table data might be compromised aren't they ?
2009-05-24T11:31:00.000Z	tzanger	dSlaM	the wikipedia page seems to suggest that the transaction log will be flushed after every commit, but that seems like an awful performance impact
2009-05-24T11:32:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	yep that's my thounght, the DB is in a consistant state ("ACID" view") but if the system was to crach, i'm not sure of the result
2009-05-24T11:33:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	really ? that's a pretty good question actually,
2009-05-24T11:39:00.000Z	dSlaM	tzanger	as telexicon says, innodb "should" be acid compliant ;)
