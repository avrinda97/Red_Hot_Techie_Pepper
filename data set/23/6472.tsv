2006-04-12T09:00:00.000Z	freakabcd		ok someone tell me why the hell does aynaptic/apt need up remove any extra options specified on some kernels ?
2006-04-12T09:00:00.000Z	freakabcd		i have vga=773 and it goes and removes it
2006-04-12T09:00:00.000Z	freakabcd		from all entries when i removed an older kernel. does the same when i get a newer kernel via update
2006-04-12T09:01:00.000Z	freakabcd		shouldn't it be preserving the file as is and just modify whatever it needs to? i.e. add new entry witrh default settings on new kernel and remove entry of older kernel
2006-04-12T09:01:00.000Z	freakabcd		the rest of the file should be untoughed.
2006-04-12T09:02:00.000Z	freakabcd		everytime i have to go back and add my stuff in
2006-04-12T09:03:00.000Z	freakabcd		and irad what error does it give? have you setup k3b properly by running it as root for the first time?
