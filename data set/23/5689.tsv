2006-12-04T16:25:00.000Z	xzk	BeanBag	-  theres 2 good tutorials on the ubuntu forums for getting broadcom wireless drivers to work, thats how i got mine working
2006-12-04T16:25:00.000Z	xzk		1 tutorials tells you how to do it step by step.. and the other one does it for you basically
2006-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	i tried the one with ndisswrapper, but im not that good with ubuntu yet and it does more harm than good
2006-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	xzk		more harm?
2006-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	xzk		did you try the one that has you download a deb file i think.. and it basically does everything for you
2006-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	xzk		is kismet the best ?
2006-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	it disabled by ethernet, or i think i did, not sure. point is it did not work properly for me, is there an easier way?
2006-12-04T16:28:00.000Z	xzk		see the network icon in the top right, you can click on that and choose which connection you want. eth1 or eth0    ethernet or wifi
2006-12-04T16:28:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	i tried this:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4311_rev_01_%28ndiswrapper%29?highlight=%284311%29%7C%28broadcom%29
2006-12-04T16:29:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	but it did not work
2006-12-04T16:29:00.000Z	xzk		no theres a better one on the forum
2006-12-04T16:30:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	at top right there is only eth0 and lo
2006-12-04T16:30:00.000Z	xzk		click on the eth0 and put in a 1 and it switches for you
2006-12-04T16:31:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	do you have the link to the better one on the forum?

2006-12-04T16:35:00.000Z	BeanBag	xzk	one last thing, wil it work for the broadcom 4311 as well?
2006-12-04T16:36:00.000Z	xzk		all the broadcom chips suck equally so its definitly worth a shot
