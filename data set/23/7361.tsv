2008-01-27T10:23:00.000Z	speedy		uboy no its not
2008-01-27T10:23:00.000Z	speedy		the flash plugin is not broken
2008-01-27T10:23:00.000Z	speedy		it works just fine
2008-01-27T10:23:00.000Z	speedy		as proven today
2008-01-27T10:24:00.000Z	speedy		his probelm is nothing to do with something not working, its to do with him not knowing what he is doing
2008-01-27T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	it has been broken for some time
2008-01-27T10:24:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	 theni dont understand how it just works
2008-01-27T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	then perhaps it has been fixed
2008-01-27T10:25:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	to be honest, i checked out the claims that it was broken, and i couldnt replicate the error accross several machines
2008-01-27T10:25:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	nevertheless, it was broken (no quotes necessary)
2008-01-27T10:29:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	no, that's what this channel is for as well
2008-01-27T10:30:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	i would of assumed you would prefer people to consult the well documented forums regarding things such as basic installation of drivers rather then come here and ask questions trailed with lols ?
2008-01-27T10:30:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	the forums haven't always even been official.  This channel always has.
2008-01-27T10:31:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	 that hatdly makes a difference to what i just said
2008-01-27T10:31:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	you would *have* assumed, eh?
2008-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	way to ignore my point -_-
2008-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	I'm not, it's just not worth debating, as it's offtopic
2008-01-27T10:33:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	 is there a channel that is on-topic but not support?
2008-01-27T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	#ubuntu-offtopic, please
2008-01-27T10:34:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	 does that channel do what i just asked for?
2008-01-27T10:35:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	no
2008-01-27T10:35:00.000Z	speedy	tritium	 so where can i go to talk about all things ubuntu that ISNT tech support?
2008-01-27T10:35:00.000Z	tritium	speedy	I've told you.  Continue this discussion in #ubuntu-offtopic.  Last time I'm goign to tell you...
