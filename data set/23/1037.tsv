2012-02-11T14:54:00.000Z	jetole		and oddly enough I'm finding myself surprisingly helpful tonight when I'm usually otherwise too busy to do so. I'm often helpful but not often in a channel long enough to answer more then 1 or 2 questions that come up while I'm asking my own question
2012-02-11T14:55:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	themonitor please use -offtopic channel for chat
2012-02-11T14:57:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	please don't
2012-02-11T14:57:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	lol. ok
2012-02-11T14:59:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	please move on and let the ops handle it
2012-02-11T15:00:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	sure. I was just curious
2012-02-11T15:39:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	mivulf sure it does, you can use  alternatives to set another version as default (of several softwares)
2012-02-11T15:40:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	kinda seems like a step backwards. Is that protected against upgrades and apt-get/aptitude/synaptic installs?
2012-02-11T15:41:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	I guess there's always the chattr +i option to protect it at least
2012-02-11T15:41:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	if you have more than one version of certain software installed, 'update-alternatives' is the proper way to set defaults
2012-02-11T15:41:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	those are just symlinks, so nothing to do with updates etc
2012-02-11T15:41:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	How do I change the default for my user but not the whole system?
2012-02-11T15:42:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	not through alternatives
2012-02-11T15:42:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	so how?
2012-02-11T15:42:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	I have no idea, not working with multiple users. And that was not the question
2012-02-11T15:43:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	well ok at not working with multiple users but that is the question. I just asked it
2012-02-11T15:45:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	also the proper way to do something is not change the whole system for ones own personal needs and on the system I am using now, 10.04, this is easily done. If what you proposed is documented as the proper way to do things then the documents are mistaken
2012-02-11T15:46:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	the way cypher-neo just explained to mivulf is the proper way. I have no idea what the documentation says
2012-02-11T15:48:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	it may be the documented way or the commonly accepted way but the logic to state it is the proper way is flawed and while it may work in mivulf's case it should only be used in a circumstance where the user knows that they want to change it system wide and for everything else there should be a standard default procedure on how to do it for just your user
2012-02-11T15:49:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	ok, but again the question is "how to set another version of firefox as a default in ubuntu 11.10 by using symlinks"
2012-02-11T15:49:00.000Z	jetole	oCean	I didn't say anything about symlinks
2012-02-11T15:55:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	no prob, really
2012-02-11T16:21:00.000Z	oCean	jetole	please stick to support
