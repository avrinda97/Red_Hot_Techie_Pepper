2009-02-07T18:54:00.000Z	Unguided		good morning
2009-02-07T18:55:00.000Z	Unguided		anyone got time for a general newb quest
2009-02-07T18:56:00.000Z	Unguided		how does ubuntu handle multiple hd's. i have a windows home server that i am going to migrate to ubuntu with multiple drives
2009-02-07T18:57:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	linux has one root file system and then "mounts" other drives onto emty folders in the file system
2009-02-07T18:58:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	you know how Windows uses C:\ D:\ ect?
2009-02-07T18:58:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	linux has one "C:\" named /
2009-02-07T18:59:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	linux then puts "D:\" on an empty folder you chose on /
2009-02-07T19:02:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	So I can make one drive for say movies and it will show up as a folder named movies
2009-02-07T19:02:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	you would need to originally assign it to a folder
2009-02-07T19:02:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	when you install ubuntu. It will ask you how you would like to partition. From there you are able to set mount points for each partition
2009-02-07T19:03:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	ok . thanks i will also check out the wiki
2009-02-07T19:04:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	come back if you have any questions
2009-02-07T19:06:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	you can assign mountpoints in the ubuntu installer
2009-02-07T19:06:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	I have the ubuntu pocketguide someone recommended. do u know if that answers those types of ques.
2009-02-07T19:08:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	I was hoping to find maybe a book that can tell me the difference between windows and linux ie: drive letter assignments
2009-02-07T19:08:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	that does not exist as far as I know
2009-02-07T19:09:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	I am reading the pocket guide
2009-02-07T19:10:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	ok. looks like i start all over and forget everything i know about windows
2009-02-07T19:10:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	lol. look at page 67 of you booklet
2009-02-07T19:11:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	chapter 4
2009-02-07T19:12:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	Damn. Just hadnt read that far yet. i guess my excitement and eagerness got in the way. thanks
2009-02-07T19:13:00.000Z	tekteen	Unguided	before you install, you should know where you want to mount which partitions. I also suggest you do not skip info about users.
2009-02-07T19:14:00.000Z	Unguided	tekteen	i guess i will go read. back in a little bit
