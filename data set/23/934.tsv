2011-03-03T10:02:00.000Z	digirak		how do i make it a dual boot
2011-03-03T10:03:00.000Z	digirak		once i install an os will it automatically be dual boot
2011-03-03T10:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	what do you want to dual boot
2011-03-03T10:05:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	ubuntu and kubuntu
2011-03-03T10:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	you can have both on the same OS
2011-03-03T10:05:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	yes, but the kubuntu wrapper is very unstable
2011-03-03T10:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	how many partitions do you have is the main question and how many HD's
2011-03-03T10:07:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	2 old linux partitions
2011-03-03T10:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	take a screen shot of gparted and paste it image.
2011-03-03T10:07:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	which are screwed
2011-03-03T10:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	so I'm assuming Ubunt and Kubunt are grub2 eh.
2011-03-03T10:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	just reformat one of gthe partitions and install custom to it. you can have grub control from Ubuntu  if you want afterwards.
2011-03-03T10:11:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	how do i paste the scrn shot
2011-03-03T10:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	name the useless partitions if they are not obvious
2011-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	those two partitions amount to about 5 gigs.  You would have to shrink sda5 and you can remove a swap as well.
2011-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	this wont affect my sda5?
2011-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	why shrink sda5?
2011-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	the space you offer as replaceable is not enough.
2011-03-03T10:22:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	so how do i decrease the space in sda5
2011-03-03T10:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	digirak	boot a live Ubuntu cd open gparted right click both swaps and make sure they are unmounted. right click sda5 the resize and resize. Then build the new partitions in the space of the removed and opened space.
2011-03-03T10:25:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	i have a ubuntu already
2011-03-03T10:25:00.000Z	digirak	nit-wit	resizing sda5 will make me lose data?
