2006-03-26T17:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	the same thing gnome, kde, and xfce do
2006-03-27T17:00:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	i see
2006-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Its just a graphical front end to linux. If you type "ls" in the terminal, it outputs all the files in the directory. Gnome/fluxbox/others just take that information and put it in a box with icons
2006-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	and a few other things :P
2006-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	thanks :)
2006-03-27T17:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	no problem.
2006-03-27T17:02:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	in this screen, how did he get that thing on the left? It looks like gDesklets but they dont mention it: http://www.lynucs.org/index.php?screen_id=212702003543b821f3279ba&p=screen
2006-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Checking...
2006-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Heh... no clue. But "GKRellM" does a great job on that stuff ;)
2006-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	better than gdesklets? cause i thought those looked hella ugly
2006-03-27T17:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Its an ugly app, but ugly apps run very fast.
2006-03-27T17:06:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	therefore GKRellM is nicer/slower?
2006-03-27T17:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Its faster/ugly
2006-03-27T17:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	but beauty is in the eye of the beholder ;0
2006-03-27T17:06:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	i want it to look as nice as his, hes got like transparencies etc
2006-03-27T17:59:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	its /home/yourusername/Desktop
2006-03-27T17:59:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	If its a shortcut, you can type in "ls -la ~/Desktop" and it should come up with something like
2006-03-27T17:59:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	no i mean the graphical icon file
2006-03-27T06:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	shortcut > /file/path/directory/lol
2006-03-27T06:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	Oh the image you mean? Er... Right click and hit properties, that might tell you some stuff.
2006-03-27T06:00:00.000Z	mzinz	rukuartic	nope :(
2006-03-27T06:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	mzinz	try looking to change the icon itself... (not in gnome, can't help too much)
