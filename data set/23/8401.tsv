2005-05-10T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	can you paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /etc/X11/xorg.conf somewhere so we can see it?
2005-05-10T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	use http://www.pastebin.com/
2005-05-10T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	use http://www.pastebin.com/
2005-05-10T08:00:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	I prefer that you use http://www.pastebin.com/, rather than giving you my email
2005-05-10T08:04:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	have you pasted yet?
2005-05-10T08:28:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	did you decide not to work on your xorg problem?
2005-11-05T13:14:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	there is no 6.0 ;)  try 5.10
2005-11-05T13:15:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	scroll up
2005-11-17T11:40:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	depends on what application you're using
2005-11-17T11:51:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	do you mean resize?
2005-11-17T11:52:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	install imagemagick.  It has command-line tools you can do all kinds of things with: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-tools.php
2005-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	imagemagick can certainly resize and re-sample images
2006-05-17T10:05:00.000Z	tritium	drcode	I still prefer xfig
