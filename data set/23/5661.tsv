2006-10-16T06:14:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Guess no one here runs Ubuntu on a laptop...:(
2006-10-16T06:14:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	i do
2006-10-16T06:15:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	and what you are saying is what my laptop does
2006-10-16T06:16:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	click system > preferences >  power management > actions
2006-10-16T06:16:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze	variant	mine doesn't, it blanks the screen and the backlight is left on...rather annoying when you're trying to listen to streaming music as you go to sleep...
2006-10-16T06:16:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	click system > preferences >  power management > actions
2006-10-16T06:17:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Options are: Do Nothing, Blank Screen, Suspend, Hibernqate
2006-10-16T06:17:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	yup
2006-10-16T06:17:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	you want blank screen right?
2006-10-16T06:17:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Currently set to blank screen
2006-10-16T06:17:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		I want the display turned off
2006-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Not just blanked
2006-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	ah, that really depends on your laptop
2006-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Dell CPx
2006-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	acpi support is very badly implemented on some laptops
2006-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Windows has no problem turning the display off
2006-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	yeah, its a problem caused by a windows written dhdt in the bios
2006-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	microsoft i mean not windows
2006-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	there is one standard acpi standard but microsoft implements it in a broken way and bios manufacturers who write to ms specification write broken acpi
2006-10-16T06:20:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	if its written to the intell spec then it shoudl be fine
2006-10-16T06:20:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Thing is, I didn't have this particular problem when running Mandrake 10.0
2006-10-16T06:21:00.000Z	virtual-stargaze		Of course...with Mandrake I couldn't stream Windows media files, use my wifi card, access the windows network and share files, and a whole other list of issues. Ubuntu is great
2006-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	variant	virtual-stargaze	yeah, it might not be that probelm, thats just he most likley
