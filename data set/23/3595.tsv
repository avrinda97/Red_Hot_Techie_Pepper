2008-03-22T12:19:00.000Z	artenius	unop	he's in revovery mode I think, will that still work there?
2008-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	unop	artenius	recovery mode? do you mean runlevel 1? or a failsafe gnome session?
2008-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	artenius	unop	I'm not sure exactly what he's in, he just said recover mode
2008-03-22T12:23:00.000Z	unop	artenius	it should work anywhere thats not runlevel 1 -- he seems to have a GUI up, it shouold work
2008-03-22T12:24:00.000Z	unop	artenius	why do you suppose that is?
2008-03-22T12:25:00.000Z	artenius	unop	I'm guessing that since it couldn't find the package
2008-03-22T12:25:00.000Z	unop	artenius	but it used to work before -- so obviously the package was (and still probably is) installed
2008-03-22T12:26:00.000Z	artenius	unop	I learn as much from helping people as I do from getting help, so I'm just trying to guess at this point. I have no clue why it wouldn't find the package
2008-03-22T12:28:00.000Z	unop	artenius	yes, sure, me too - what i think is, the menu files for the particular menu might be corrupted/missing
2008-04-11T15:57:00.000Z	artenius	unop	when I type sudo -u user gnome-display-properties should "user" be the new user I added or the word user?
2008-04-11T15:58:00.000Z	unop	artenius	'user' there is your usual user, your actual username
2008-04-11T15:58:00.000Z	artenius	unop	ok so not the second one I created
2008-04-11T15:59:00.000Z	unop	artenius	no, not the one you created, because you aren't modifying display properties for that user, but for the user that is having difficulties
2008-04-11T16:00:00.000Z	artenius	unop	I got ya, ok
2008-04-11T16:16:00.000Z	artenius	unop	when I login as the other user it drops me into a yellow screen
2008-04-11T16:26:00.000Z	artenius	unop	when I login as the other user it drops me into a yellow screen
2008-04-11T16:27:00.000Z	unop	artenius	yellow screen? do explain a little more
2008-04-11T16:27:00.000Z	artenius	unop	the yellow ubunto screen with a mouse cursor, nothing else
2008-04-11T16:28:00.000Z	unop	artenius	does ALT+F2 do anything there?
2008-04-11T16:36:00.000Z	artenius	unop	any idea why sudo -u user gnome-display-properties wouldn't pop anything up?
2008-04-11T16:37:00.000Z	artenius	unop	no
2008-04-11T16:39:00.000Z	artenius	unop	I'm able to get into Failsafe gnome, just trying to fix it over all
