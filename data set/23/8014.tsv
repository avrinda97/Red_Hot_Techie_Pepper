2005-02-21T06:32:00.000Z	tinster	TreadingSoftly	d3vic3 I have a similar problem
2005-02-21T06:33:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	also on a Thinkpad T40?
2005-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	did you enter your WEP in the form XXXX-XXXX-...-XXXX-XX (the hyphens are important)?
2005-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	possible
2005-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	mine is uppercase on my router and uppercase in my WEP entry on Ubuntu
2005-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	tinster	TreadingSoftly	ah, I see..
2005-02-21T06:38:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	yeah -- i think the install config works differently
2005-02-21T06:38:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	i assume you have actually activated eth0
2005-02-21T06:38:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	or tried to before...
2005-02-21T06:39:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	interesting, it's eth0 on mine
2005-02-21T06:39:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	ah... so GUI not doing you much good there
2005-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	does you iwconfig not provide a MAC?
2005-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	mine says Access Point 00:09:... it doesn't say anything about "Cell"
2005-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	tinster	TreadingSoftly	this isn't a home network, so I suspect there are multiple APs ? (guessing)
2005-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	well, even if it was, there might be other nearby wireless networks
2005-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	what command do you use with iwlist to get a list of cells?
2005-02-21T06:44:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	and does one of those cells match your router?
2005-02-21T06:44:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	or access point?
2005-02-21T06:45:00.000Z	tinster	TreadingSoftly	I think we can pick any one of those, it doesn't matter
2005-02-21T06:45:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	they all have the same key?
2005-02-21T06:46:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	yes, you can check it with iwlist key
2005-02-21T06:47:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	tinster	are you on the right channel for the cells?
2005-02-21T06:47:00.000Z	tinster	TreadingSoftly	I'm not sure how you check the channel ? can you explicitly set it anywhere ?
