2007-01-05T09:40:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Looks like you need to specifically uninstall the debian versions first, then install the proper versions
2007-01-05T09:42:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	yes, but removing mono-common will cause apt to remove ubuntu-desktop and a lot of other packages
2007-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Ahhh, I see, try your luck with apt-get install --reinstall mono
2007-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Also, if you can temporarily change the language to English, then me and some others can understand the error messages -- that would help. x.x
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	how to change it temporarily? :)
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Something like: sudo sh -c 'LANG=en_US apt-get install --reinstall mono'
2007-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	okay: http://phpfi.com/190702
2007-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	further ideas?
2007-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Try using the same command I gave but mono-common and mono-jit instead of mono
2007-01-05T09:50:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	gets me Reinstallation of mono-common is not possible, it cannot be downloaded., same with -jit
2007-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Try all three packages again but add --fix-broken
2007-01-05T09:55:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	--fix-broken doesnt help
2007-01-05T09:56:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	still the "it cannot be downloaded"-error
2007-01-05T10:00:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	That doesn't sound like the same error. o.o
2007-01-05T10:01:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	as i said before: "<kritzstapf> Ferret, gets me Reinstallation of mono-common is not possible, it cannot be downloaded., same with -jit"
2007-01-05T10:03:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	That's not quite the same error message as the original, can you pastebin the command output that gives you that please?
2007-01-05T10:03:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	yep http://phpfi.com/190708
2007-01-05T10:04:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Aha, ah yes... it can't find the versions you have installed, 'cos they're silly versions.  Let's see...
2007-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	youve got it ;)
2007-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	How about changing the command to install mono-1.1.17.1-1ubuntu7.1 specifically?  I dunno if apt lets you specify version exactly like that, but we can try it
2007-01-05T10:08:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	jrib: http://phpfi.com/190709
2007-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	Ferret	kritzstapf	Hrrrm.  That's a bit annoying.
2007-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	kritzstapf	Ferret	a bit..
