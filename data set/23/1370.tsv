2010-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	GhostWolf		hi all, can anyone help me? i downloaded the ubuntu 10.04 LTS and im trying to burn it with nero and when i select the file it says this, The entered block size does not correspond to the image legnth. The block size may be wrong. Do you want to correct the value or ignore the problem?. can anyone help me with this?
2010-05-03T04:43:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	have you checked the md5sum? I'd be concerned you got a corrupted download...

2010-05-03T05:07:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	i did what that site said
2010-05-03T10:48:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	have you run md5sum on the disk?
2010-05-03T10:49:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	no and im not going through that route cause i don't understand it and never had a problem burning ubuntu iso's before.. and the problem i had earlier was a corrupt file
2010-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	that's too bad, since it's the one thing we know reliably finds corrupted burns...
2010-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	so can you login? And have you?
2010-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	no i can't i have tried
2010-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	you've been working on this all day haven't you?
2010-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	not all day, it takes a while for me to download the file, then i just was able to burn the file and i just not able to get it to install properly, i only got to where it gives me options as live cd's do and then it as before just goes to the login screen
2010-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	and none of those options say "install"?
2010-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	yes only once i seen the install and selected it, like i said it prev statement and goes to the login screen nothing as to where i installed the prev versions
2010-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	if you won't run md5sum.exe I'm not sure i can help you any further...
2010-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	theres no md5 file in the iso.. so how can i check the md5sum?
2010-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	You misunderstand: md5sum reads every byte in the iso and uses it to calculate a checksum. If the checksum is correct, that pretty much guarantees every byte in the iso is correct, and in the right order. That's all...
2010-05-03T10:59:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	i understand but when i did it before and i looked i needed to have a .md5 file and there isn't one just the .iso that i downloaded from the ubuntu site..
2010-05-03T11:00:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	Ah, I understand your confusion. Let me see what I find for you in google.
2010-05-03T11:01:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	sillycat98: this one looks more unix compatible: http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/
2010-05-03T11:02:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	im not on any unix computer
2010-05-03T11:03:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	that url is for a windows machine, but it doesn't require an md5 file (which makes it more unix-like).
2010-05-03T12:06:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Loshki	thanks for helping me, i got ubuntu 10.04 LTS installed and able to get into desktop and no problems
2010-05-03T12:06:00.000Z	Loshki	GhostWolf	Excellent
