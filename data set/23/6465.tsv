2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		okay
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		any ppc users in here?
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		seems like the ppc port for ubuntu is mostly half assed
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		anyway
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		question, how do I make a custom initrd?
2006-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	stocksy	Shadowpillar	PPC user here :)
2006-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	stocksy		alas, it seems so
2006-04-05T14:18:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	I have a powermac 8500 (oldworld) and I need the 2.6.12 kernel for a vga card, as with 2.6.10, text is scrambled on the fb.
2006-04-05T14:19:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	however, some genius decided to make the scsi stuff optional in the newer release
2006-04-05T14:20:00.000Z	stocksy	Shadowpillar	Yeah, I'm trying to compile 2.6.16 kernel for my 9500, but I've not had much sucess - probably because I don't know what I'm doing
2006-04-05T14:20:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	ugh the thought of compiling on a 604e @ 120 mhz
2006-04-05T14:21:00.000Z	stocksy	Shadowpillar	you know patience when you've built the NetBSD kernel on a LC 475 mmm, 25MHz :)
2006-04-05T14:21:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		nice
2006-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		I have a lc 520 I wanna make use of
2006-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	but that requires system 7 being installed, which I have no way of installing
2006-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		I';ll worry about it later
2006-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		sleep
2006-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	stocksy	Shadowpillar	How come you can't install system 7?
2006-04-05T14:23:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	no disks
2006-04-05T14:23:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	stocksy	or any way to copy them as my current mac doesn't seem to open any hqx binaries, or stuffit, or disk copy
2006-04-05T14:23:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		I'm too tired atm
2006-04-05T14:23:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		later
2006-04-05T14:24:00.000Z	stocksy	Shadowpillar	I've used the 7.5.3 disk images from apple.com before
