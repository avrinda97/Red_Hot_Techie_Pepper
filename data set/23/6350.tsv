2007-04-09T06:03:00.000Z	Juancabrit1		Hi
2007-04-09T06:03:00.000Z	Juancabrit1		somebody could help me with Wine please?
2007-04-09T06:03:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	don't ask to ask a question, just ask your question ;)
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	what are you trying to run? which program? Windows programs aren't made for Ubuntu, but some windows programs work anyway, by using API Wrapper technology (for example: Wine does that) ..
2007-04-09T06:13:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	okay, well, the registry files of Wine, you can find those in ~/.wine/ directory
2007-04-09T06:13:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	that is your home folder and then the hidden folder .wine
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	the howto seems simple enough.. what doesnt work?
2007-04-09T06:15:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	to import the reg file you just have to type: sudo wine regedit adobe.reg
2007-04-09T06:16:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	well, do you have the adobe.reg file?
2007-04-09T06:18:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	well, that's strange, so you are in the .wine folder in your terminal window, and the adobe.reg file is in there, but when you type: "sudo wine regedit adobe.reg" it says it can't find adobe.reg?
2007-04-09T06:30:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	okay, so you miss the recode file?
2007-04-09T06:33:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	yes, but if you miss the recode app, you have to install it, try this: sudo apt-get install recode
2007-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	you have to be in the folder where the adobe.reg file is
2007-04-09T06:42:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	thats probably okay..
2007-04-09T06:51:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	after the recode command, did you try the: wine regedit adobe.reg command?
2007-04-09T07:00:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	hm, is it the setup program or something?
2007-04-09T07:00:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	its weird that it gives you that error
2007-04-09T07:00:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	you could _try_ to run it with sudo, but that shouldnt be needed because everything should be in ~/.wine... strange
2007-04-09T07:01:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	hm, maybe the register file you added is not good
2007-04-09T07:01:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	the adobe.reg file that is
2007-04-09T07:03:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	I dont know.. I havent used Photoshop for ages, last time I used it was 3 years ago in Windows
2007-04-09T07:18:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	I guess so
2007-04-09T07:18:00.000Z	profoX`	Juancabrit1	copy that file from windows to the directory in linux.. ~/.wine/drive_c/Documents...... and so on
