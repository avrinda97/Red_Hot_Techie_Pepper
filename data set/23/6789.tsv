2006-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	FHX	funkyHat	excellent progress today, but i'm still having this error  from earlier installations. Any advise?
2006-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	how big is your / partition?
2006-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	how did you get your install CD?
2006-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	so you're getting the same error when using completely different discs to install?
2006-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	I mean the CD
2006-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	order some CDs from shipit.ubuntu.com
2006-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	as a just in case ;), and we'll carry on trying working on it now
2006-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	it depends... I can't remember the order, have you got past grub installation?
2006-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	oops, lol
2006-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	FHX	funkyHat	which is the grub installation?
2006-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	the bit about the boot loader, it'll ask you about windows XP or whatever if you have anything like that still installed
2006-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	funkyHat	FHX	if there is a continue option, try it :)
2006-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	FHX	funkyHat	MY INSTALLATION WORKED!
