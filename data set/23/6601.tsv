2006-03-11T06:40:00.000Z	whishkah		I upgraded now my sound doesn't work. In /usr/share/alsa/cards my card is not listed. Does any one know where I can download a .conf file for a opl3sa2 card. Modprobes don't work anymore. That is how I got it to work when I first installed Ubuntu.
2006-03-11T06:40:00.000Z	crimsun	whishkah	what did you upgrade?
2006-03-11T06:41:00.000Z	whishkah		crumsun: everything. I installed an old hard drive, to have more space. Then redid everything.
2006-03-11T06:42:00.000Z	crimsun	whishkah	did you have to pass any options to modprobe the first time?
2006-03-11T06:43:00.000Z	whishkah	crimsun	Yes, now they do nothing. For some reason also "modprobe opl3sa" gets an error. I originally used modprobe then edited the modprobe.d.
2006-03-11T06:44:00.000Z	crimsun	whishkah	so you were using the oss/free driver and not the alsa one/
2006-03-11T06:46:00.000Z	whishkah	crimsun	I believe I was using both. I also added aliases to the alsa config. The forums listed various things to do, but nothing works now. I read on the forums also opl3sa2 cards aren't supported anymore. It normally would take this long to set it up, but I used to be able to use alsaconf, Ubuntu doesn't have that.
2006-03-11T06:47:00.000Z	crimsun	whishkah	you can't use both at the same time; you can only use one or the other

2006-03-11T06:52:00.000Z	crimsun	whishkah	you need to unload all of those, then load snd-opl3sa2
2006-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	whishkah	crimsun	Could you elaborate on unload?
