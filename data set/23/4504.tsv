2007-08-19T09:39:00.000Z	islan		I don't know if it's just my hardware, but when running Ubuntu on it, the hard drive seems to get really noisy
2007-08-19T09:39:00.000Z	islan		either the hard drive or graphics card
2007-08-19T09:40:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	Fan noise?
2007-08-19T09:40:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	yes
2007-08-19T09:40:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	That would make sense.
2007-08-19T09:41:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	so it's not an Ubuntu problem?  the last time I used this hardware for XP was a long time ago, but I don't remember it being this noisy
2007-08-19T09:42:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	assuming you are strictly talking about the noise from your video card's fan.
2007-08-19T09:42:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	, I think it's that
2007-08-19T09:43:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	okay.  I'll look it up, thanks!
2007-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	My fan usually will spin faster (get louder) when i run certain apps, specially games under XP, not sure what would case that under Ubuntu.
2007-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	What video card?
2007-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	not running anything particular on it though.  NVidia
2007-08-19T09:46:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	compiz/etc ?
2007-08-19T09:46:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	I'm sorry, compiz?
2007-08-19T09:47:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	3D accelerated GUI
2007-08-19T09:48:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	I think the screensaver is, but I turned that to a blank screen'
2007-08-19T09:48:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	but that has been the case on previous sound problems
2007-08-19T09:48:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	don't know how to fix it in Ubuntu though
2007-08-19T09:49:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	Fix what problem?
2007-08-19T09:50:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	noise caused by lack of 3D acceleration
2007-08-19T09:51:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	try a different distro, see if it does the same thing, maybe its all in your head :p
2007-08-19T09:52:00.000Z	islan	Parisi_work	nah, this is definitely noisy.  but I think I'm starting to find some articles now that I've narrowed it down, thanks
2007-08-19T09:52:00.000Z	Parisi_work	islan	Nice, good luck.
