2008-08-01T22:54:00.000Z	Huntersdead		Why Outlook if you can have freeware/OS(OpenSource)
2008-08-01T22:55:00.000Z	Huntersdead		Why use Evolution?
2008-08-01T22:55:00.000Z	Huntersdead		There are enough Email Clients for linux
2008-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	Huntersdead		Well, it would be possible to stuff it in a email client
2008-08-01T22:58:00.000Z	Huntersdead		After all, the source of those clients is Opensource. Maybe I'll look at it someday and try to understand it xD In 5 years or so...
2008-08-01T23:00:00.000Z	Huntersdead		That's much easier than typing something....
