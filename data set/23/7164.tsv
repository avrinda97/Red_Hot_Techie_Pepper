2006-02-26T08:34:00.000Z	dm		hey guys how do i CHROOT to my root partition form a LIVE CD
2006-02-26T08:35:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	it's not difficult, man chroot will have some nice explanations, and if not, google has tons of nice tutorials.
2006-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	man chroot doesnt tell me anything, just explains what it is
2006-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	ok, then the latter of my comment.
2006-02-26T08:38:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	if google doesn't provide enough help, or confuses you, pm me, and i'll help if i can
2006-02-26T08:39:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	ive already googled it , what happed is my Dapper's netorking was borked by devs, and i cant access updates to fix it, so im in liveCD right now trying to download the patches through live CD to apply to my runnning dapper install
2006-02-26T08:40:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	people tell you to do shit and no one explains it ( on forums )
2006-02-26T08:40:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	understood, it happens sometimes.
2006-02-26T08:41:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	if you have the livecd booted, and your / mounted somewhere, i suppose you could copy the files you need over to your messed up /, and then chroot, since networking won't work right now.
2006-02-26T08:41:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	do you know what you need exactly ?
2006-02-26T08:42:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	is there anyway to apt-get upgrade from livecd to your install ?
2006-02-26T08:42:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	good question. i'd likely copy the needed networking information (if its config files) over to the moofed installation, then just do it from the chroot
2006-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	like i said they borked networking and the supposid fix is under apt-get upgrade..
2006-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	let's try a chroot, and see what's moofed  then
2006-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	this is the worst break ever lol
2006-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	one sec might be going
2006-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	i was using sudo under root.. lol
2006-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	im such a dumbass
2006-02-26T08:47:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	i hope this fixes it , i want my linux back, wanna try to get WoW to work in it
2006-02-26T08:53:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	oh great now wireless on livecd stopped working
2006-02-26T09:10:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	nope its perminently borked and the yhavnet fixed it yet lol , i have to use windows now :( MF !!
2006-02-26T09:11:00.000Z	ohgood	dm	what exactly did you install to accomplish the moofing ?
2006-02-26T09:11:00.000Z	dm	ohgood	sudo apt.get dist-upgrade .. thats what killed all networking known to man in dapper
