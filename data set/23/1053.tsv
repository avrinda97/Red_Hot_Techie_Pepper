2010-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	I imagine the instructions would be similar
2010-09-25T08:08:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	root@curtis-laptop:~# $ gconftool-2 --set "/apps/metacity/general/button_layout" --type string "close,minimize,maximize:"
2010-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	first of all, why are you root?
2010-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	well when i run codes i always go in root lol thats not a good idea?
2010-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	nope
2010-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	ok
2010-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	now notice, when you were root you had a "#" sign in your prompt.  As a regular user, what do you see in place of the "#"?
2010-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	 (curtis@curtis-laptop:~$ $ gconftool-2 --set "/apps/metacity/general/button_layout" --type string "close,minimize,maximize:"
2010-09-25T08:12:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	says my name then laptop
2010-09-25T08:12:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	and then?
2010-09-25T08:12:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	curtis@curtis-laptop:~$ $: command not found
2010-09-25T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	I'm not asking about the output.  At your normal prompt, what do you see after "curtis-laptop".  You see some symbols?
2010-09-25T08:13:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	~$
2010-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	Guest97781	yeah, notice the $ is in the command you copied?  That's just to show you you run it in a shell.   You don't copy the $
2010-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	oh lol
2010-09-25T08:16:00.000Z	Guest97781	jrib	ok i got it working thanks
