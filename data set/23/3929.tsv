2008-01-25T13:07:00.000Z	nkriz		does gutsy come packaged with java?
2008-01-25T13:08:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	no but it is pretty easy to install
2008-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	nkriz	travisat	can i use synaptic, or can you recommend a page to look for install instructions?
2008-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	nkriz		(very new to linux, sorry)
2008-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
2008-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	nkriz		brilliant, thank you
2008-01-25T13:13:00.000Z	travisat		bash is not a directory
2008-01-25T13:13:00.000Z	nkriz		can anyone recommend a version of the 'Risk' board game for ubuntu? preferably a networkable version?
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	type in risk linux in google
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	nkriz		the only one i've found is jaba dependant
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	nkriz		*java
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	travisat		ah so that is why you wanted java
2008-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	nkriz		then i read the whole section on 'the java trap', so now i look for another
2008-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	nkriz		http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html
2008-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	nkriz		just curious, if there isn't a non-java dependent version, i'll use the one i found
2008-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	try xfrisk?
2008-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	if you are looking for a linux game I usually find the best place to start is www.happypenguin.org
2008-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	nkriz		thanks all, that gives me many places to look
2008-01-25T13:19:00.000Z	nkriz		hmmm, hadn't tried that
2008-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	nkriz		hehe. i was hoping to find something native, but if worse comes to worst i'll wine what i've got
2008-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	nkriz		thanks though
2008-01-25T13:22:00.000Z	nkriz		i'm searching now, and feeling pretty stupid because there's about 8 million versions. drinking + computers = idiot in channel
2008-01-25T13:23:00.000Z	travisat	nkriz	drinking + linux = fun in the morning
