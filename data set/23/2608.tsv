2009-12-20T18:37:00.000Z	lama_		Also you have a problem with certificates on ubuntu?
2009-12-20T18:39:00.000Z	lama_		Still when I want to log on to facebook redirects me to google.com
2009-12-20T18:40:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	why do you think that this is an ubuntu issue?
2009-12-20T18:41:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Becauseon other PCs in the internal network it works.
2009-12-20T18:42:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Its problem with certificate login.facebook.com
2009-12-20T18:42:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Still when i log to facebook so redirect me to google page
2009-12-20T18:44:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	yeah, i don't know. Just make sure you have the exact same network settings on both machines.
2009-12-20T18:45:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: They are same. I am desperate...
2009-12-20T18:46:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: I dont know why it doesnt work.
2009-12-20T18:46:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	me neither, when you go to facebook, you get certificate pop-up?
2009-12-20T18:48:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	In page.. and when i receive certificate and log in again so redirect me to google.com
2009-12-20T18:49:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	so, when you get certificate pop up, what do you click? "accept" ?
2009-12-20T18:49:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Yes and accept exception
2009-12-20T18:50:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	and then it redirects to google? That's weird
2009-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Yeah, i click on accept and I click on "Send again" (username, password) and after redirect me
2009-12-20T18:54:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	maybe file a report at facebook? It's at their login that you get redirected
2009-12-20T18:55:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: I dont understand.
2009-12-20T18:57:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: I tried opera, chrome... but doesnt work too.
2009-12-20T18:57:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	well, you are asking here for support, but you should ask for support at facebook. You can add the certificate, and you get at the login dialogue, but *then* you get redirected
2009-12-20T18:58:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	log a bug/report/helpcall whatever with the facebook people
2009-12-20T18:58:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Yeah, I bite it. Thanks for help.
2009-12-20T19:28:00.000Z	lama_	oCean_	: Hi again... this problem is everywhere where is certificate
2009-12-20T19:29:00.000Z	oCean_	lama_	have you searched the forums? It does not sound as a common issue to me... Like it is not accepting the certificate(s) after all
