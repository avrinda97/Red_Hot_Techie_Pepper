2007-04-25T15:47:00.000Z	coolgeek		Can any one explain what a cloak is?
2007-04-25T15:48:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	check the freenode website faq
2007-04-25T15:49:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	it masks your hostname when on irc
2007-04-25T15:50:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	find a freenode staffer, they'll fill you in on the rest.
2007-04-25T15:51:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	#freenode is a safe bet.
2007-04-25T16:00:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	you could try asking someone with a cloak to.
2007-04-25T16:01:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	what's to explain? You joined like this: 03:59 -!- coolgeek [n=ben@90.201.1.34]  has joined #ubuntu with a cloak it might look like 03:59 -!- coolgeek [n=ben@coolgeak/cloak]  has joined #ubuntu
2007-04-25T16:13:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	read topic: You will be voiced soon, please wait!
2007-04-25T16:21:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	screen+irssi > bitchx
2007-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	sure you can. that's the whole point.
2007-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	screen <command>
2007-04-25T16:24:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	that's not a command. that's an expression "screen and irssi are cooler/better than bitchx alone"
2007-04-25T16:25:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	irssi was written from scratch just a few years ago.  It's everything I wanted out of bitchx and others. bitchx has lots of old messy code that's hard to maintain.
2007-04-25T16:26:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	if X dies, or I need my irssi session remotely for a little while, I can steal my screen on another terminal.
2007-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	try apt-cache show screen irssi   to see those.
2007-04-25T16:37:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	apt-cache show <package>
2007-04-25T16:38:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	to see a description of any package, run apt-cache show <package> where <package> is the package name. eg, apt-cache show screen.
2007-04-25T16:40:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	open/switch a new terminal. are you on the console?
2007-04-25T16:41:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	open another ssh connection.
2007-04-25T16:41:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	you can't
2007-04-25T16:50:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	what did apt-cache show irssi say?
2007-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	uh, that's not irssi. that sounds like screen.
2007-04-25T16:53:00.000Z	Supaplex	coolgeek	*nod*
