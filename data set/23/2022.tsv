2009-07-29T19:54:00.000Z	fnord2		Well, I certainly can use support. :P
2009-07-29T19:55:00.000Z	fnord2		I'm having this problem with my soundcard and I was wondering if there is anyone who can help me.
2009-07-29T19:57:00.000Z	fnord2		Is there anyone who can help me configuring me sound? My soundcard was default in my laptop, and it is recognized by ALSA but it won't produce sound.
2009-07-29T19:57:00.000Z	fnord2		I know this problem is common and I followed the sound troubleshooting which didn't work.
2009-07-29T19:57:00.000Z	fnord2		Also OSS didn't do the trick.
2009-07-29T19:58:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	do you have pulse installed? If so, you need to set everything to use that and not alsa or oss
2009-07-29T19:58:00.000Z	fnord2	th0r	yes.
2009-07-29T19:58:00.000Z	fnord2		Moment.
2009-07-29T20:00:00.000Z	fnord2		Did not work th0r.
2009-07-29T20:00:00.000Z	fnord2		:/
2009-07-29T20:01:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	I don't use pulse so am doing this from memory...there is a padevchooser if I remember right...run it and check the pulse config settings
2009-07-29T20:01:00.000Z	fnord2		Is it okay if I query you th0r?
2009-07-29T20:02:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	keep it here in the channel....I don't know much about pulse
2009-07-29T20:02:00.000Z	fnord2		Ah.
2009-07-29T20:02:00.000Z	fnord2		Well, I'm not that into sound etc, padevchooser?
2009-07-29T20:03:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	just a sec while I boot up the gnome vm
2009-07-29T20:03:00.000Z	fnord2		Thnx. :)
2009-07-29T20:05:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	can't find it in the vm...this might take a while
2009-07-29T20:06:00.000Z	fnord2		I have patience, thanks for helping. :)
2009-07-29T20:07:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	it is an optional extra...padevchooser...you need to install it separately. Don't know if it will help, but if I remember correctly I needed it to get pulse working when I tried it
2009-07-29T20:07:00.000Z	fnord2		<- goes trying @ th0r
2009-07-29T20:09:00.000Z	fnord2		after the install th0r, do I need to restart pulse?
2009-07-29T20:09:00.000Z	th0r	fnord2	I don't think so, but like I said....don't use pulse, just tried it once
