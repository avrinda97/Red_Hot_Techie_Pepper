2007-12-01T19:50:00.000Z	hotchip		now, anyone fancies helping me?
2007-12-01T19:51:00.000Z	ant-	hotchip	you might as well just ask your question
2007-12-01T19:51:00.000Z	hotchip		Hey guys, I'm having some problems installing fuppes. It fails during make with this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/46448/ error. Someone helped me some time ago by making a .deb file for me. But I did a fresh install of Gutsy today and now it fails again.
2007-12-01T19:55:00.000Z	hotchip		hmm, I had the same problem when installing both windows and ubuntu on a computer that I recieved from a friend.
2007-12-01T19:55:00.000Z	hotchip		I gave up. :(
2007-12-01T19:58:00.000Z	ant-	hotchip	did you download the latest sources?
2007-12-01T19:58:00.000Z	hotchip		yes
2007-12-01T19:58:00.000Z	hotchip		549
2007-12-01T19:58:00.000Z	hotchip		And I followed the guide how to build it on their wiki.
2007-12-01T19:59:00.000Z	ant-		and did you do this exactly? http://fuppes.ulrich-voelkel.de/documentation/installation/linux/
2007-12-01T19:59:00.000Z	hotchip		yes
2007-12-01T19:59:00.000Z	ant-		hmm
2007-12-01T20:00:00.000Z	hotchip		or wait.
2007-12-01T20:00:00.000Z	hotchip	ant-	sorry, I followed this: http://fuppes.ulrich-voelkel.de/wiki/index.php/Compiling_on_Linux
2007-12-01T20:03:00.000Z	ant-	hotchip	the svn is beta, get the latest stable release
2007-12-01T20:05:00.000Z	hotchip	ant-	I just tried downloading it through the net, the 549 release. And doing ./configure with the settings for gnome integration and video transcoding. It still errors out in make. :(
2007-12-01T20:07:00.000Z	ant-	hotchip	are the errors the same?
2007-12-01T20:09:00.000Z	hotchip		roughly, but not really.
2007-12-01T20:09:00.000Z	hotchip		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/46452/
2007-12-01T20:12:00.000Z	hotchip		there's an update for ffmpeg, should I get it?
2007-12-01T20:14:00.000Z	ant-	hotchip	its good to update whenever possible
2007-12-01T20:15:00.000Z	hotchip		ok ok :D
2007-12-01T21:26:00.000Z	hotchip	ant-	If you're still here. Updating ffmpeg solved it all. Now it works fine.
