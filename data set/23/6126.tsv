2006-06-29T10:38:00.000Z	kvasov		hi. does anyone have any idea why my default ubuntu user is unable to browser /media/sd* folders? it used to work before i updated some packages for 6.06
2006-06-29T10:38:00.000Z	kvasov		dr-xr-x--- 1 root plugdev 16384 2003-01-01 01:12 sdb1
2006-06-29T10:39:00.000Z	kvasov		/dev/sda1       /media/sda1     ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
2006-06-29T10:39:00.000Z	kvasov		it's not  flash drive
2006-06-29T10:40:00.000Z	kvasov		are my settings any different from the default 6.06 installation?
2006-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	kvasov		and vmware is no longer starting in non root users
2006-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	the problem is your user isn't in the 'plugdev' group
2006-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	is that the default?
2006-06-29T10:43:00.000Z	kvasov		usermod -G plugdev -a $user ?
2006-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	i used the usermod command to add myself to plugdev and still not result
2006-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	well, I didn't explicitly add myself to that group.
2006-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	kvasov		so how does that work
2006-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	group changes take effect at login time
2006-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	run 'bash --login' inside your current terminal and see if it helps
2006-06-29T10:45:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	that works. but other things are still not working. how is it that you are able to have plugdev membership without being listed in the groups file?
2006-06-29T10:46:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	grep plugdev /etc/group and look for your user
2006-06-29T10:47:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	i added myself manually. yet, i am not in the audio group and audio is not working. i dont think the default installation had me in all these groups
2006-06-29T10:47:00.000Z	kvasov		i am pretty sure i was in only one group
2006-06-29T10:47:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	the first user created via the installer should have been put in a bunch of groups
2006-06-29T10:48:00.000Z	kvasov		what are those groups
2006-06-29T10:49:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	can you paste what groups i am supposed to be a part of?
2006-06-29T10:49:00.000Z	hyphenated	kvasov	my user is in the following groups (first group is the same name as username): username adm disk dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev staff lpadmin scanner admin
2006-06-29T10:49:00.000Z	kvasov	hyphenated	thanks.
