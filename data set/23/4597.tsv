2007-07-03T06:38:00.000Z	eboyjr		Anyone know the command for running the "File Browser"?
2007-07-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	nautilus
2007-07-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	or sudo nautlius to run as root :)
2007-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	wouldn't it be GKsudo nautilus, and I want to run as a root, but I don't want to have to enter a password each time.
2007-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Could be either... my gksudo has issues - no hard (in this case) using sudo - only have to enter p/w once and of course keep the parent terminal open..
2007-07-03T06:45:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	Okay
2007-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Xubuntu best for lower spec systems or when you want more bang for the buck (uses XCFE) ... Kubuntu/Ubuntu mostly a matter of KDE vs GNOME enviroments - I prefer the latter...
2007-08-01T06:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Whatchu mean - 3d graphic accel?
2007-08-01T06:58:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	I don't think my computer will support 3d windows unless it is software based. I have an ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra TF.
2007-08-01T07:01:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Pretty sure the ATI Rage Pro will run under the fglrx driver...
2007-08-01T07:02:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	Actually, I followed a tutorial once on that and restarted when I could start Ubuntu cause of something. I had to start Windows and try to remember what changes I made.
2007-08-04T15:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Ewww.... you may be boned... Brother has gateway with same sound and can't get it working... supposedly latest alsa has it, but compiling is a biznitch.... You can ask over in #alsa, though
2007-08-06T05:52:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Or CTRL-ALt-Backspace
2007-08-06T05:54:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	I am running from the live CD though.. I'm not allowed to install it, and I REALLY REALLY want to see Compiz.
2007-08-06T05:54:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Sorry, not sure what you're getting at -- what you have for graphics card?
2007-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Yeah, you're not getting compiz/beryl on any live cd -  you have to install XGL etc... I dunno that any live cd has that out of the box :)
2007-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	2 messages up
2007-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	It's weird but I type "compiz --replace" and everything turns white
2007-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	And if I do the commands I can fainlty se the wobbly windows
2007-08-06T05:58:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	Yeah, ati's are a trick prolly be better of with binary driver... but getting going on a live cd is tough... If you want to see compiz there is youtube :)
2007-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	lol. do you know which linux distro runs beryl or compiz or xgl from live cd?
2007-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	eboyjr	I do not, personally...
2007-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	eboyjr	ShackJack	okay, thanks for your help
