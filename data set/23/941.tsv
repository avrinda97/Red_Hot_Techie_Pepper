2012-07-20T19:22:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Would anyone happen to know a good guide on modifying a theme?  I'm trying to adjust the colors so that I can get the DE exactly how I want it.
2012-07-20T19:24:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Heya
2012-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		I am being seen, right?
2012-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	Yep.
2012-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Okay, I've been to a few channels where they wouldn't even talk to me.
2012-07-20T19:28:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		I understand.
2012-07-20T19:30:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		I'm assuming that a Gnome-Classic Session Theme can be edited with CSS, and the files for the theme would be found under /usr/share/themes/[theme name here]/gtk-3.0, right?
2012-07-20T19:32:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		BRB
2012-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	I'm under the impression that there would be some location in your home drive for "custom" (modified) themes. I'll do some digging around, but I don't really know much, so can't guarantee anything.
2012-07-20T19:34:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	I have perhaps found something!
2012-07-20T19:36:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Oh, thank you chu!
2012-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	So, this might be a bit too "easy" for you - I don't know where in learning curve you are - but have a look here: http://maketecheasier.com/install-custom-gnome-shell-themes/2011/09/27 (under the sub-heading
2012-07-20T19:40:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	"Installing Themes". Now, as far as the actual editing/reference the system themes go, I don't have any knowledge, so would recommend cracking open any custom themes you have available and seeing how they do it.) [Sorry for the double post.]
2012-07-20T19:41:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Hold on, I got a desktop notification from you, but I couldn't read it all.
2012-07-20T19:41:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Oh, there it is.
2012-07-20T19:41:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		That is okay.
2012-07-20T19:58:00.000Z	fuzzyghost	chu	as far as editing the files, for a Gnome Classic session, would I edit the CSS files in the gtk-3.0 folder, or the RC files in the gtk-2.0 folder?
2012-07-20T19:59:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	Well, that's a tough one. I can't guarantee anything, but again I will do some digging :)
2012-07-20T20:00:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		Okay, thanks.
2012-07-20T20:01:00.000Z	fuzzyghost		I do Google search, but I seem to get non-related links (like editing WordPress, Moodle, Windows XP, etc.)
2012-07-20T20:05:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	I can't seem to find anything about *editing* the gnome-classic session. What I can find however is a link on installing the older Ubuntu themes (like "Ambiance", "Radiance", etc) for gnome-classic. All I would suggest with this is just cracking them open and seeing how they do it. Not very helpful, I know.
2012-07-20T20:06:00.000Z	chu	fuzzyghost	Here is the link anyway: http://jaysonrowe.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/quick-n-dirty-ubuntu-1204-gnome-classic.html
