2009-04-26T09:12:00.000Z	leachim6		hey
2009-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	leachim6		I'm trying to use notify-send to give me some info about my currently playing Mpd song
2009-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	leachim6		I wrote a small python script...than when ran outputs a string of info
2009-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	leachim6		I try to pipe that into notify-send and I always get an error "wrong amount of arguments"
2009-04-26T09:14:00.000Z	leachim6		I am running it like this notify-send -t 5 MPD-Info `mpdcurrentsong-gosd.py`
2009-04-26T09:14:00.000Z	leachim6		why wouldn't that work?
2009-04-26T09:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	really?
2009-04-26T09:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	and yeah I like recommending Banshee
2009-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	well...that's debatable...while ext2-4 are all DIFFERENT....IDK if any one is better
2009-05-25T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	I know
2009-05-25T02:36:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	sorry
2009-05-25T02:36:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	didn't mean to seem condescending
2009-05-25T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	ok no problem
2009-05-25T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	the default should be the desktop CD, but there is also an alternate CD and a server CD
2009-05-25T02:41:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	yeah but you can't get the alt or the server cd without TRYING to ...
2009-05-25T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	you don't need the alt or server CD
2009-05-25T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	desktop CD should do it
2010-05-24T00:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	since  the features weren't proggrammed in
2010-05-24T00:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	you can change background and thats about it
2010-05-24T00:19:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	 why would they take features OUT
2010-05-24T00:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	since they wanted cleaner code
2010-05-24T00:20:00.000Z	leachim6	sebsebseb	what the fck....
2010-05-24T00:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	leachim6	GDM 2 is a complete rewrite of the old one, if you want a good looking log in screen by default, install KDM
