2006-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	pvd2006		How can you get firestarter to run automatically on Ubuntu even after restarting? I am using a PPPOE ADSL connection.
2006-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	firestarter had an autostart option
2006-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	TR30		had/has
2006-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	pvd2006	sean	slackware is a different linux operating system than Ubuntu.
2006-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	also firestarter runs in the background automatically during boot.. just because not user interface is present doesn't mean its not running
2006-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, do you know the process name? I used ps -e and I didnt see it
2006-03-27T08:45:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	try ps -A | grep firestarter
2006-03-27T08:45:00.000Z	pvd2006		alright thanks
2006-03-27T08:45:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, nothing showed up.
2006-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	did you set firestarter to start automatically in options?
2006-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	pvd2006		let me check
2006-03-27T08:47:00.000Z	TR30		Danee, right click a URL and select properties then goto the menu "open with"
2006-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	TR30		sure thing OpopanaxGentoo
2006-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, there we go... I had it only checked on start on program startup, lol. So now it should work all the time.
2006-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	yes.. it should work
2006-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, I notice that my friend can run nmap on me and see my open ports still using the -P0 option with nmap. Is there a way to block that you know of?
2006-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	probably tell firestarter to block all ICMP ports
2006-03-27T08:51:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	but that's just an educated guess
2006-03-27T08:51:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, thanks ill test it.
2006-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	sorry that probably wont work.. misunderstood your quesetion. Is your friend on the same network as you?
2006-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	pvd2006		tr30, no
2006-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	pvd2006		he isnt
2006-03-27T08:54:00.000Z	TR30	pvd2006	there isn't any way to stealth open ports. Sorry for the lag
