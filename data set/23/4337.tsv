2009-12-22T02:36:00.000Z	Exile		hey guys, I had to reinstall grub and now I cant access my windows partition in ubuntu? anyone have any ideas how I might fix this?
2009-12-22T02:36:00.000Z	Exile		it dual boots fine
2009-12-22T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	Which version of Windows?
2009-12-22T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	As long as Windows has shut down NTFS properly since Ubuntu 7.10 (October 2007)  Ubuntu should be able to read and write to it no problem
2009-12-22T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	well not 100% sure if what I just put is true for Vista version 2 (Windows 7), but I assume it is
2009-12-22T02:43:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	its fine
2009-12-22T02:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	oh
2009-12-22T02:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	what does?
2009-12-22T02:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	oh right ok
2009-12-22T02:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	thought for a second or so the other guy...  ,but no.  ok uhmm maybe it's not meant to be under places anymore
2009-12-22T02:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	should be able to get into it from  /mnt or /media though,  and  from computer
2009-12-22T02:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	ok, but is it in /mnt ?
2009-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	ok how are you getting in to it?
2009-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	/windows hmm
2009-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	Nautilus
2009-12-22T02:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	ok well don't think it's meant to make a /windows really
2009-12-22T02:48:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	should I worry or should I leave it?
2009-12-22T02:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	also I think really it's meant to ask for your password when you try and enter the Windows partition
2009-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	I'm not to fussed about linux being able to access windows without a pass
2009-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	I would be the other way round tho
2009-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	it's probably ok, and there might be something relivant in the 9.10 release notes
2009-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	Exile	sebsebseb	I would be the other way round tho
2009-12-22T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Exile	same here really I guess, and this is a good idea don't let Windows have access to Linux partitions :)
