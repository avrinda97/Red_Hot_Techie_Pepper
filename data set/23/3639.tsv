2009-05-02T18:05:00.000Z	Mechdave	archman	rename your .gnome and .gnome2 to .gnome-old and .gnome2-old directories in your home folder and then log out and back in again
2009-05-02T18:06:00.000Z	archman	Mechdave	can something go wrong so i can't login again?
2009-05-02T18:07:00.000Z	Mechdave	archman	no the system should re write the files and folders we re named
2009-05-02T18:07:00.000Z	archman	Mechdave	ok!
