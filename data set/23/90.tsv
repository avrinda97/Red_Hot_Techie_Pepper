2012-08-15T17:53:00.000Z	vicium\a		Would you reccomend ubuntu 11.04 or 12.04 and x64 or x86 for a ECS? with 2 cores 8 gb ram etc etc ~
2012-08-15T17:54:00.000Z	vicium\a		I assume 12.04 x86?
2012-08-15T17:55:00.000Z	vicium\a		But i've heard rumors x64 just gives alot of issues?
2012-08-15T17:56:00.000Z	vicium\a		Okay, so even if i run applicatioons that only supports x86
2012-08-15T17:56:00.000Z	vicium\a		It still runs as smooth in x64?
2012-08-15T17:56:00.000Z	vicium\a		With the 32bit library?
2012-08-15T17:57:00.000Z	vicium\a		I want to decide what dist to pick before ordering my ECS...
2012-08-15T17:57:00.000Z	vicium\a		And i dont know so much myselves so I came here for expertise
2012-08-15T17:57:00.000Z	vicium\a		Elastic cloud server senyb VPS-ish
2012-08-15T17:57:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	the distro you can handle best
2012-08-15T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	please dont host public servers if you dont have GNU/Linux knowledge
2012-08-15T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	a private cloud?
2012-08-15T17:59:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	no new users should administrate a public swerver
2012-08-15T18:00:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	open spam relay and other things will be the result
2012-08-15T18:01:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	are you a troll?
2012-08-15T18:01:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	i said, dont host a public reachable server if you dont have GNU/Linux knowledge
2012-08-15T18:01:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	that has nothing to do with ubuntu
2012-08-15T18:02:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	without knowledge people are doing mostly very insecure things (chmod 777, running everything as root, open mail relay)
2012-08-15T18:02:00.000Z	vicium\a	iceroot	You do realise that (internet estimation) half of the new ubuntu users comes from the very same position im sitting in?
2012-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	i am talking about public servers, not desktop systems
2012-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	try to learn GNU/Linux first before putting a public server on the line
2012-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	a server in the cloud is public
2012-08-15T18:04:00.000Z	iceroot	vicium\a	because the server has a public-ip
