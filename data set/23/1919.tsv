2009-09-20T14:02:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT		if an application makes my screen resolution bigger in order to work but then it crashes and leaves the screen with that resolution making it impossible for me to use, how do i find and kill what is causing? (ps aux | grep ??) or how do i simply put it back as it was, yesterday i tried many things from tt1 but in the end i had to reboot, i'd like to avoid it. any idea? thanks
2009-09-20T14:03:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	first, run xrandr in a terminal, and find out how to change modes with that. Then assign your favorite resolution to a gnome shortcut, e.g. alt+ctrl+1 ==> 1280x800.
2009-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	so u think even without closing the application thatz causing the problem i can reassign the resolution i want?
2009-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	yes
2009-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	ok cool, also i wasnt able to use my mouse, the keyboard i could use but just for writing in the quarter of screen i was able to see at that resolution
2009-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	try it, and if you get stuck anywhere ping me
2009-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	alright thanks, can i do it from tt1 or it has to be from a terminal?
2009-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	you need to be in an x session when you do it
2009-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	so you can't do it from vt1. E.g. from withing the problematic app, you just press alt+ctrl+1.
2009-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	(not alt+ctrl+F1 - I mean the shortcut that you put to change resolution)
2009-09-20T14:08:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	isnt tt1 one? (is the second command u suggested ctrl + alt + "number one" or "letter l" cuz in case itz an L i use that combo to lock the screen
2009-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	ok let me change the example shortcut: With you assign "alt+ctrl+r" to xrandr --output default --mode 1280x800. Then within the game, you just press alt+ctrl+r.
2009-09-20T14:10:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	xrandr only gives me this http://paste.ubuntu.com/274565/ how do i change key-shortcuts and stuff?
2009-09-20T14:11:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	first, try to change resolutions: xrandr --output default --mode 1360x768
2009-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	Does it work? Then, put the resolution back with: xrandr --output default --mode 1360x768
2009-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	is the same command :D
2009-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	sorry, I meant put the resolution back with xrandr --output default --mode 1440x900
2009-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	it does work but look http://paste.ubuntu.com/274569/
2009-09-20T14:16:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	well, if it works you can just ignore your graphics card module errors ;) Now, to assign a shortcut... do you have compiz enabled or not?
2009-09-20T14:17:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	yep
2009-09-20T14:18:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	there's a settings editor for compiz, but I don't use compiz so I don't remember its name. That settings editors has a panel with the shortcut editor. There you can put the "custom command" I think it supports up to 12 of them. I have 12 different resolutions with alt+ctrl+something shortcuts ... :)
2009-09-20T14:19:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	alkisg	yeah yeah i no about it :D thanks mate
2009-09-20T14:19:00.000Z	alkisg	IpSe_DiXiT	you're welcome :)
