2010-04-20T15:55:00.000Z	cortexman		I wrote a script called apt-home that solves the problem I asked about in here earlier http://grey.colorado.edu/mingus/index.php/apt-home
2010-04-20T15:55:00.000Z	poutine	cortexman	I disagree with your solution
2010-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	cortexman		of course you do
2010-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	cortexman		this is the internet
2010-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	cortexman		and THIS is irc
2010-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	poutine	cortexman	this fails when installing a new kernel
2010-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	cortexman	poutine	well it *does* say caveat emptor. if you need a new kernel use pbuilder:)
2010-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	cortexman		this will install almost every app...
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	poutine	cortexman	How do I know whether your hokey script will work or not?
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	cortexman		read and understand the code
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	poutine		it fails with the kernel
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	poutine		So I have to become a programmer to use your app effectively?
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	cortexman		its only 6 lines of code fercryinoutloud
2010-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	cortexman		trollol
2010-04-20T15:59:00.000Z	poutine	cortexman	it fails with kdelibs
2010-04-20T15:59:00.000Z	poutine		When _does_ it work?
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman	poutine	you don't really know what you're talking aout
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman		*about
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman		it can download and copy *any* packages
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman		it "installs"
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman		its not real. but you can realy use it. for rea.
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	cortexman		damn my l key is stickin
2010-04-20T16:00:00.000Z	poutine	cortexman	So you admit it's a novelty piece of software?
