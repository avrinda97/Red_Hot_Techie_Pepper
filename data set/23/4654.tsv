2007-06-11T07:20:00.000Z	logicwax		hey
2007-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	logicwax		anyone have this problem?  I'm on fiesty.....I turned on the desktop effects.....had the 3d cube for like an hour or so....don't got it anymore since reboot
2007-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 you need to add it to the startup
2007-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 lemme get you a link
2007-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	logicwax		BUT i do have it when I switch to another resolution
2007-06-11T07:22:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 oh hmm
2007-06-11T07:22:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 are you using beryl to be exact?
2007-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	logicwax		dunno...i used to use beryl.    i just formatted and installed fiesty, is that compiz or fiesty?
2007-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	logicwax		ah, compiz then i guess
2007-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	logicwax		how do you config compiz then?
2007-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	silvertip257		sh3r1ff:  beryl is compiz now; they merged recently
2007-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	logicwax		because its still not a cube....but a 2-desktop "plate"   i added more workspaces in gnome.......so i need to know how to config compiz i guess
2007-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	silvertip257		sh3r1ff:  recently installed beryl 3d desktop and read up on the devel notes
2007-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	logicwax		thanks
2007-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 if you want the 3d cube & other effects, you can install beryl
2007-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 if you want beryl 3d desktop on startup, please read this forum thread:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286508
2007-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	logicwax	silvertip257	is beryl better
2007-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	logicwax		?
2007-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 Beryl and Compiz (at least the plugins part of compiz) are now merging, in the hope of a better future.
2007-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	logicwax	silvertip257	but at the current moment?   which is better for performance
2007-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 that came from:  http://www.beryl-project.org/
2007-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 I don't know which is better for performance, they are both graphics intensive window managers =)
2007-06-11T07:35:00.000Z	silvertip257	logicwax	 I'm reading forum posts right now and it goes both ways; one guy says he got a boost of 40 fps with beryl compared to compiz
