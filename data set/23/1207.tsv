2010-08-02T12:12:00.000Z	juro		hi, how can I find out whether Ubuntu is using the correct swap?
2010-08-02T12:12:00.000Z	TiK	juro	df ?
2010-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	juro	TiK	thank you
2010-08-02T12:45:00.000Z	juro	TiK	it seems my swap is not mounted ...
2010-08-02T12:46:00.000Z	TiK	juro	why not it should automount
2010-08-02T12:47:00.000Z	juro	TiK	I don't know why it doesn't mount :(
2010-08-02T12:47:00.000Z	TiK	juro	did you just install?
2010-08-02T12:48:00.000Z	juro	TiK	no. this is 9.04 and I moved the standard "install on one harddrive" swap to another harddrive
2010-08-02T12:49:00.000Z	TiK	juro	sfa1 is a primary partition ithink you did something wrong
2010-08-02T12:50:00.000Z	juro	TiK	well this was working a while ago :(
2010-08-02T12:50:00.000Z	TiK	juro	my swap is 10 igs and sda5
2010-08-02T12:51:00.000Z	juro	TiK	not sure why that information is important to my question ...
2010-08-02T12:51:00.000Z	TiK	juro	bc you mad a whole hdrive swap and didn't partitin correctly
2010-08-02T12:52:00.000Z	juro	TiK	why would you say that?
2010-08-02T12:55:00.000Z	juro	TiK	the UUID is the unique identifier for a partition and yes, I am using a complete partition as my swap drive
