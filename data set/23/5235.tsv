2007-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid		how do I delete a string from firefox's config page?
2007-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid		there's no way to delete them!
2007-07-16T12:01:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	double click on the value field to edit
2007-07-16T12:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	yeah, but the main string, the entire string or boolean
2008-09-04T03:14:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	What version of Ubuntu?
2008-09-04T03:14:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	let me check
2008-09-04T03:15:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	it uses the same dns servers that everything else uses.
2008-09-04T03:15:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	doesnt resolve anything under apt-get... it says no such domain
2008-09-04T03:20:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	http://pastebin.ca/1193091
2008-09-04T03:21:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	Thats odd, did you perhaps have a proxy setup to connect to the internet previously?
2008-09-04T03:24:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	well here is the thing, the computer had some dead capacitors, which were repaired, and its been one year, i had trouble with getbyhostname() and i fixed that by adding 127.0.1.1 and machine name
2008-09-04T03:25:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	and now sometimes i can connect with apt-get but never with update-manager, so i dont know what is going on.. no proxy at all, i have tor disabled
2008-09-04T03:26:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	i really dont need to connect anymore, but there are a few updates that were held back and i would like to install them and i dont know why i cant
2008-09-04T03:27:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	try apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-09-04T03:28:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	What authentication?
2008-09-04T03:28:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	right, what ! heh
2008-09-04T03:28:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	You did use sudo with that, right?
2008-09-04T03:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	yeah of course, i mean if i boot to root. it works, but just not on a normal session
2008-09-04T03:30:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	im going to boot to root and install this
2008-09-04T05:05:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	i had a stupid proxy.. you were right
2008-09-04T05:05:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	now it works fine :)
2008-09-04T05:05:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Pici	i forgot everything was being routed to tor in the general browsing preferences, and the 8118 port was assigned, so i disabled it all
2008-09-04T05:07:00.000Z	Pici	SurfnKid	that would do it
