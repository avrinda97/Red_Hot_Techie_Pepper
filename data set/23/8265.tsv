2005-03-10T12:38:00.000Z	alvaro		yo dudes i need help with this ubuntu stuff
2005-03-10T12:40:00.000Z	alvaro		This is my problem: .wmv files don't run. In totem all i hear is distorted sound but no video. I installed Mplayer, but it doesn't play videos.. i try to play a video but it would just freeze the computer for some reason. I tried runnign it in root but it ain't working.
2005-03-10T12:40:00.000Z	alvaro		any ideas? :P
