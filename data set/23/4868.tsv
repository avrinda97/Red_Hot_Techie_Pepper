2010-03-03T21:38:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	'user' mount-option only means, that users can mount/umount a filesystem. doesn't affect permissions
2010-03-03T21:39:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	perms on ntfs are turned on by ntfs-3g only with uid,gid mountoptions. or ntfs-3g is outdated.
2010-03-03T21:39:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	perms on ntfs are turned on by ntfs-3g only with uid,gid mountoptions. or ntfs-3g _man_ is outdated.
2010-03-03T21:40:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	i meant this -> which is definetly wrong <ohir> dinosaurvskitten: you mount ntfs partition with 'user' option. It means that your user has all rights on that partition regardless of what ntfs's uids/gids are
2010-03-03T21:41:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	ok. Partially you're right. I was using shortage spell.
2010-05-29T00:11:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	it would do truncate too, just using '' from STOUT :)
2010-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	many companies didn't want to pay the +R license-fee, so they limited their firmwares
2010-05-31T21:50:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	won't work
2010-05-31T21:51:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	why?
2010-05-31T21:51:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	redirection + sudo cannot work, use tee
2010-05-31T21:52:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	basically the "sudo" issued with your command ends at ">" and won't afffect the part after it
2010-05-31T21:52:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	we certainly use very different unices then
2010-05-31T21:53:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	do excersise :)
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	you're right
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	:D
2010-05-31T21:56:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	so our unices are not sooo different ;)
2010-05-31T21:57:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	not that much :)
2011-06-24T17:11:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	no need to have /home on ntfs when dual-booting. shared ntfs-partition, mounted somewhere in $HOME/data does fine
2011-06-24T17:11:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	yep, thats better
2011-06-24T17:12:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	just new user can not in advance estimate how big his or her home will be. And windoz customs prevent him or her from thinking before putting file
2011-06-24T17:14:00.000Z	llutz	ohir	no extra home at all, just let them put their personal stuff on the ntfs-partition and they don't have to worry about /home-size
2011-06-24T17:15:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	so it equals. My advice was for a linux newbie with home box
2011-06-24T17:33:00.000Z	ohir	llutz	you are right though. Its better to recommend mounting ntfs under $HOME/WINSHARE or like.
