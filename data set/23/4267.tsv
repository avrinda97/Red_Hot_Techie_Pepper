2007-11-24T20:22:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	it's not loaded, yes. it goes right to windws
2007-12-25T12:49:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	go to #eeepc
2007-12-25T12:50:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	there are a couple of debian devs that hang there, they likely will know
2008-08-22T20:30:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	Thanks, but please read what I wrote.. I've written a lot of what's on help...EeePC. I need help making Ubuntu Eee 8.04.1. I have a problem where I'm thrown to busybox instead of booting
2008-08-22T20:31:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	you may also wish to look at the wiki for www.eeeuser.com or #eeepc
2008-08-22T20:32:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	the problem is with Ubuntu, not the Eeepc. I need help booting custom kernel with Ubuntu
2008-08-22T20:32:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	can you help me? I would be forever greatful
2008-08-22T20:32:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	no such problems here. it works fine.
2008-08-22T20:33:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	please read the resources I suggested.
2008-08-22T20:34:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	The problem is when following: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
2008-08-22T20:34:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	I add a custom kernel, as in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
2008-08-22T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	the best resources are the ones I have suggested; ie not that one.
2008-08-22T20:35:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	the kernel got squashfs and unionfs. But I can't get it to work. I'm on a mac, customizing Ubuntu. wiki.eeeuser.com can't help me with that. Can you please help me?
2008-08-22T20:35:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	and please don't say call apple. I'm running ubuntu
2008-08-22T20:37:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	Is your job to piss people of or actually to help people? I'm looking for help with ubuntu and you're answering like a bad programmed bot
2008-08-22T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	ramvi	not sure what help you want; cutting and pasting from the wiki seems silly.
2008-08-22T20:38:00.000Z	ramvi	bazhang	True! The problem is that I get this message in casper.log     /init: /init: 1: cannot open /dev/fd0: No such file . And thanks for your interest! :)
