2005-11-09T09:54:00.000Z	dottorpal		I can't boot kubuntu live on my powerbook titanium 550...anyone can help me?
2005-11-09T09:54:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	almost the same model. what happens?
2005-11-09T09:56:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	okay, the cd might be faulty or something!
2005-11-09T09:57:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	does it spit the cd out?
2005-11-09T09:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	hmm, does the tiger/jaguar cd boot?
2005-11-09T09:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	i was asking about the TIger boot disk/dvd
2005-11-09T10:01:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	hmm, no clue why it does that. either a problem with the cd or your cd drive
2005-11-09T10:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	can u retry burning the cd at a lower speed
2005-11-09T10:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	burn it at 8x/4x
2005-11-09T10:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	so, this is the kubuntu live dvd?
2005-11-09T10:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	try burning the live cd again, at 4X
2005-11-09T10:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	just try that. i've faced problems like that too
2005-11-09T10:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	while you are at it, check the md5 of the iso of the live cd
2005-11-09T10:16:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	there's a program on windows which checks for you.
2005-11-09T10:16:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	lemme pull up the link, uno momento
2005-11-09T10:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	gimme a minute. where is the kubuntu iso on? the windows machine, right?
2005-11-09T10:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	no speake italiano!
2005-11-09T10:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	http://www.nullriver.com/downloads/Install-winMd5Sum.exe that's the program to install.
2005-11-09T10:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	and this is the kubuntu breezy that we are talking about, right?
2005-11-09T10:20:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	install that program, and check the md5 checksum of the iso file
2005-11-09T10:21:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	here is the list of md5sums for kubuntu http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/kubuntu/breezy/MD5SUMS
2005-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	robotgeek	dottorpal	so, did the md5checksums match?
