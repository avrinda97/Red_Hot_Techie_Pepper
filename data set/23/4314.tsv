2007-09-25T13:02:00.000Z	Draggin		Good evening :)  I have questions on software installations
2007-09-25T13:04:00.000Z	Draggin		Hehe Jim... Well... Concerning the Ubuntu software repository - isn't it supposed to have a link to the latest versions of packages?  And how do I install a package if it's NOT listed there?
2007-09-25T13:06:00.000Z	Draggin		Jim - so does that mean that it won't be automatically updated and all that if I manually install it not using the Add/Remove thingy?
2007-09-25T13:08:00.000Z	Draggin		Jim - does apt-get perform the same function as the Add/Remove utility or are they slightly different?
2007-09-25T13:08:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	Same thing, just different interfaces.
2007-09-25T13:08:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- thanks... so - how do you do a 'su apt-get update' in Add/Remove?
2007-09-25T13:09:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	er... You'd have to use the Update manager for that.
2007-09-25T13:20:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	Blender 2.43 is in the Ubuntu repos
2007-09-25T13:21:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- I know - but I don't want to use 2.43 - I've been using 2.44 for a long time and 2.45 is a bug-fix release to that. so obviously the best option
2007-09-25T13:21:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	Okay, just letting you know
2008-05-14T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	sudo update-alternatives --config java
2008-05-14T22:09:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- thanks :)
2010-04-12T17:59:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	Can you repeat your question?
2010-04-12T17:59:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- sure, it's a long one though :)
2010-04-12T18:00:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- I'm an Acer Aspire One owner and have been struggling along with the default Linpus operating system since I bought it.  I've become accustomed to it and it's not really that bad, but when it comes to customising things, it's very easy to break stuff (as I have done frequently). So now I've tried out UNR 9.10 and it blew my mind with awesomeness.  But - the only issue that I have is this story that I heard that Linpus was customised 
2010-04-12T18:00:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	Linpus was customised.... you got cut off.
2010-04-12T18:00:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	-  I've become accustomed to it and it's not really that bad, but when it comes to customising things, it's very easy to break stuff (as I have done frequently).
2010-04-12T18:01:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- So now I've tried out UNR 9.10 and it blew my mind with awesomeness.
2010-04-12T18:01:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- But - the only issue that I have is this story that I heard that Linpus was customised to the netbook in such a way that it minimises write cycles to the SSD, thereby prolonging the device lifetime.
2010-04-12T18:01:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- I really want to use UNR, but not so keen on it if it might mean a shortened lifespan for my machine. Any opinions, facts, links?
2010-04-12T18:02:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	The only thing that I can think of would be the filesystem that it may have used.  You may want to look into using ext2 or ext3 (rather than ext4) when you do your install.
2010-04-12T18:02:00.000Z	Draggin	Pici	- okay, could you clarify, please? Would ext2 & 3 have less write cycles than 4? And if so, why?
2010-04-12T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	Draggin	I don't remember where I read that though, sorry.  Thats the only thing that I can think of that would help increase SSD lifetime though.
