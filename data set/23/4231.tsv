2007-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	Daggoth		Hey guys, I'm having a partition problem. Whenever I open GParted or the Ubuntu installer integrated partitioner, I am confronted by a blank screen, as it it isn't detecting my drives, any help?
2007-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	what type of drivers/controller do you have?
2007-10-08T09:30:00.000Z	Daggoth		Um...
2007-10-08T09:30:00.000Z	Daggoth		I'm not sure.
2007-10-08T09:31:00.000Z	Daggoth	h1st0	I'm running from a live CD, and I have an nvidia card.
2007-10-08T09:31:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	no your hard drives
2007-10-08T09:31:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	You said it wasn't showing your drives right?  Or does the whole screen go blank?
2007-10-08T09:32:00.000Z	Daggoth		It's not showing my drives.
2007-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	Daggoth		On GParted, everything is greyed out, and in the lower left corner it says that there are no devices detected. I have refreshed multiple times.
2007-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	What type of drives do you have sata? scsi? ide?  how are they connected to your computer?
2007-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	Daggoth		It's a fairly new computer.
2007-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	Daggoth		Got it early this year, and it's a desktop.
2007-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	Daggoth		They're IDE
2007-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	Daggoth		SATA I believe, but I'm not exactly sure.
2007-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	are you on the computer now so that you can issue commands?
2007-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	Daggoth		Yes.
2007-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	fdisk -l
2007-10-08T09:35:00.000Z	Daggoth		- I or L?
2007-10-08T09:37:00.000Z	Daggoth		Hegeru: How do I do this?
2007-10-08T09:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	L but lower case
2007-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	Daggoth	h1st0	It says Unable to open l
2007-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	Daggoth		Hegeru: will do.
2007-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Daggoth	try what hegeru said
