2005-02-25T11:19:00.000Z	viper12		hi all.
2005-02-25T11:20:00.000Z	viper12		Anyone know of a website/forum where the config for sound cards isn't written by a propellor head? (no offense to prop heads).  Trying to get a TB Santa Cruz working.
2005-02-25T11:21:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	should already work out of the box via the snd_cs46xx module
2005-02-25T11:22:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	tried using the surround* virtual devices?
2005-02-25T11:22:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	any alsa app. Try aplay -Dplug:surround51 foo.wav
2005-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	make sure 1280x1024 has been purged from all Depths' Modes
2005-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	and ensure that you restarted gdm after editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	prelim 2.6.11 packages have been in universe for weeks.
2005-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	they're also in universe, not main.
2005-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	seeing how when they were created, 2.6.11 was still in -rc
2005-03-16T14:33:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	=)
2005-03-17T13:57:00.000Z	viper12	crimsun	could you scroll up a bit to Rocco's command line question?  I'm not completely sure why his 'rights' would change overnight.......unless something got updated.
2005-03-17T14:01:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	thanks.
2005-03-23T14:15:00.000Z	viper12	crimsun	has the diagnosis changed since I was on earlier regarding borked restricted modules?
2005-03-23T14:21:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	so "struct_module" is the only error-related info in dmesg when you attempt to modprobe?
2005-03-23T14:27:00.000Z	viper12	crimsun	how much of the modules.dep do you want?
2005-03-23T14:29:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	hmm, for now, just the nvidia-related stuff
2005-03-23T14:41:00.000Z	viper12	crimsun	is that what you were looking for?
2005-03-23T14:42:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	forgive me for being dense, but where did you paste them?
2005-03-23T14:43:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	oh, I see. Actually I was referring to output from dmesg when you attempt to modprobe nvidia
2005-03-23T14:44:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	sorry if I was unclear
2005-03-23T14:45:00.000Z	crimsun	viper12	nothing else in dmesg or tail /var/log/syslog?
2005-03-23T14:47:00.000Z	viper12	crimsun	 here is the syslog entry:
