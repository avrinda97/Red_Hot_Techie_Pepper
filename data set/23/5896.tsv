2006-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	farous		any one know what is the normal operating temp for external hard drives? what is the max in partic.
2006-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	ych	farous	40C would be realistic, anything beyond 50C is high
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		but something below 40 would be even better
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	farous	ych	thanx do you know of any sensors package that can be used to measure the temp for usb drives
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		hmmm
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		dunno sorry
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		dont have one myself
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	farous	ych	the prob is mine is really high when i touch it i know it is high which bother me a lot
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		hmmm
2006-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	ych		are you using something to monitor temps for your internal drives right now?
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	ych		oh ok
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	farous		i thought it won't be a prob but i would guess around 60
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	farous	ych	yah lmsensors
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	ych		hmm
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	ych		ok, well, the hardware specs of most HDDs state max temp as 60 or 65
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	ych		you can google it if you know the mfg
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	farous		yah say ambient temp
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	farous		which mean surrond temp max 60
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	ych		however I'd suggest going for at least 10 under for a longer lifetime
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	ych		60C is abit hot though....
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	ych		if you can measure it to be that high with a normal thermometer...
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	farous	ych	it is basically a desktop hd put in case
2006-08-15T07:31:00.000Z	farous	ych	maxtor 6l300r0 to be precise
