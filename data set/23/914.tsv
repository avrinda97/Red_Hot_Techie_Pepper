2010-12-20T10:58:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	wireless card getting you down?
2010-12-20T10:58:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	what card are you using?
2010-12-20T10:58:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	and driver?
2010-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	sudo lshw      <--------say anything about your w-card?
2010-12-20T11:00:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	another command for hardware is:     dmidecode            that is kinda the same, should display the driver with the card section
2010-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	so it's a "Realtek" model: "rtl818" or is rt818 the driver being used?
2010-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	which card is it?  The realtek rtl8187L, realtek rtl8187B, or realtek rtl8187SE
2010-12-20T11:12:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	okay look into getting the xp driver for the card you have and the installing "ndisgtk" wrapper and i'll help you more after that
2010-12-20T11:34:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	what is hotspot?  and why are you using the vpn?  torrents?
2010-12-20T11:39:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	this might help you:      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZLEZRgWIOc&hd=1
2010-12-20T11:39:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	explains the ndiswrapper for wireless drivers
2010-12-20T11:40:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	and you'll probably need the program called "BUM" from the repos too
2010-12-20T11:41:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	"BUM" is bootup manager for services and rc related stuff
2010-12-20T11:41:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	it's a gui so it's okay
2010-12-20T11:42:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	no "BUM"
2010-12-20T11:46:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	cretx	sounds like you installed it then
