2009-09-02T19:45:00.000Z	Jonii3		how do I mount a shared folder with ubuntu as guest and windows as host? I know it's not the write channel, but could someone try to help me anyways?
2009-09-02T19:46:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	1) "mount.cifs", 2) it's "right", not "write"
2009-09-02T19:47:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	sorry, i'm tired
2009-09-02T19:49:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	bash: mount.cifs: command not found and it tells me how to install it. do I install it?
2009-09-02T19:49:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Yes, install it.
2009-09-02T19:49:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Or, wait. Do you use GNOME?
2009-09-02T19:49:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	yes
2009-09-02T19:50:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Then it would probably be better to use GNOME's SMB support... go to Places -> Network
2009-09-02T19:51:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	it shows windows network, but it can't see anything else, even if I double click it
2009-09-02T19:51:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Hmm
2009-09-02T19:52:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	What is the hostname of the Windows box?
2009-09-02T19:52:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	You might try entering smb://thathost/ to the file explorer's address bar.
2009-09-02T19:53:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Now that's a little unusual. Try connecting with 'smbclient' or 'mount.cifs' then.
2009-09-02T19:54:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	we tried mount.cifs already,  I just type in smbclient in the console?
2009-09-02T19:55:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	First, smbclient -L thathostname
2009-09-02T19:57:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Hmm. How about using the IP address instead?
2009-09-02T19:58:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Yes
2009-09-02T19:59:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	You know, I just remembered
2009-09-02T19:59:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	The 'samba' package - the File Sharing server - includes support for Windows hostnames
2009-09-02T20:00:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	So try installing that, then going through Nautilus
2009-09-02T20:00:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Nautilus is what's the GNOME's file manager called.
2009-09-02T20:03:00.000Z	Jonii3	grawity	now what?
2009-09-02T20:03:00.000Z	grawity	Jonii3	Installed 'samba'? Try going to Places -> Network
