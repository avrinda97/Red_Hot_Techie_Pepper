2008-09-17T19:34:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	when you put it in, were you prompted to add it to your Software Sources?
2008-09-17T19:35:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	i don't select dvdrom for source
2008-09-17T19:35:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-09-17T19:37:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	http://pastebin.com/m5a921831
2008-09-17T19:37:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	good, now what package are you trying to install?
2008-09-17T19:38:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	many packages say all them?
2008-09-17T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	well, the dvd won't have the package versions from -updates and -security on it, so apt will go online for those
2008-09-17T19:39:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	how can install packages from dvd?
2008-09-17T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	any package whose latest version from all the repositories in your sources.list is on the dvd, will be installed from the dvd
2008-09-17T19:41:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	no problem i want install from dvd  because my internet speed is not fast
2008-09-17T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	you could disable your -updates repository (best to keep -security enabled) and then use your system that way
2008-09-17T19:43:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	if i want to know a package is install or not which command can help me?
2008-09-17T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	apt-cache policy PACKAGE
2008-09-17T19:51:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	example if i want know vlc is install or not this command is true ? apt -cache VLC
2008-09-17T19:51:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	apt-cache policy vlc
2008-09-17T19:58:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	is this command true for installing vlc? apt-get install vlc
2008-09-17T19:59:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	yep, but you'll need to prefix it with sudo
2008-09-17T20:00:00.000Z	babaklinux	jrib	when i type that, this error appear  why?  E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-09-17T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	babaklinux	you need to close any other package managers, like update-manager, synaptic, and Add/Remove
