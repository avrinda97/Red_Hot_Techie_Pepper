2006-10-30T10:51:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	it looks like you still have to partition and format it
2006-10-30T10:52:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	With GNOME Partitioner?
2006-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	im a kubuntu person, but i would imagine so
2006-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	ext3 format right? and do I have to split the partition up for the swap partition?
2006-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	yeah, ext3,  shouldnt have to split anything, just tell it to partition and format that free space
2006-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	Thankz :)
2006-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	np

2006-10-30T11:09:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	you you want /home to be on a separate partition?
2006-10-30T11:09:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	Dont know :P I dont care i just want this think to work :)
2006-10-30T11:10:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	its not letting me go to step 6
2006-10-30T11:11:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	ok  you have a 7 gig system parition right now, thats what you want?
2006-10-30T11:11:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	yes
2006-10-30T11:11:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	erm,  hfs+ filesystem?
2006-10-30T11:12:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	ahhh ok,  well   crap,  your going to need to redo your system partition    linux will require 2, one for swap and one for system
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	 Yea thats what i told you before if i needed to break that 7 gig partition into two
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	sry, i wasnt paying attention to the partition format,  i thought the big partition was your system for some reason,  my bad :(
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	no problem
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	Laz45	gameman73	swap partition also ext3?
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	no, swap should have its own filesystem
2006-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	gameman73	Laz45	errr it would appear that you need a 3rd partition,,,,, sry  (thats a ppc specific thing)
