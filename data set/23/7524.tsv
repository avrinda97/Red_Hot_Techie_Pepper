2005-07-12T10:13:00.000Z	adwait		hmm....so hey can somebody point me to some basic reading for compiling my own kernel?
2005-07-12T10:14:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	En googlis :-)
2005-07-12T10:17:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Your resolv.conf is jacked up?
2005-07-12T10:18:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	well.....firefox seems to resolve the URLS fine...
2005-07-12T10:19:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	That makes no sense
2005-07-12T10:19:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	What is in /etc/resolv.conf ?
2005-07-12T10:21:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	I don't think that is right.  Is firefox using your adsl router as a proxy?
2005-07-12T10:21:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	nope..it is working w/o proxies
2005-07-12T10:22:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	u think i should directly add the DNS server to the resolv.conf and try?
2005-07-12T10:22:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Yes, I would try that
2005-07-12T10:30:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	:-)
2005-07-13T07:53:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Congrats
2005-07-13T07:53:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Force rem the linux directory and any subdirectories under it
2005-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	ok..but wht does it contain? the linux directory...
2005-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	What directory are you in?
2005-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	this is wht i am referring to http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-kernel.en.html
2005-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	there are two methods mentioned on the site http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-kernel.en.html, which one should i use bddebian?
2005-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Oh, that is just deleting the linux source directory from /usr/src
2005-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	I would pull the ubuntu source package if you can
2005-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Then you are fine
2005-07-13T08:00:00.000Z	adwait	bddebian	it says here to make a symbolic link from linnux-2.6.whtever to linux.......wht if i just rename?
2005-07-13T08:01:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	That works but a symbolic link is better if you want to keep a couple of kernel trees around
2005-07-14T08:56:00.000Z	bddebian	adwait	Dunno sorry
