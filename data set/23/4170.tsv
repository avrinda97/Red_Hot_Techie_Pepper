2007-10-28T10:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	Have you tried booting into safe graphics mode?
2007-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	yeah,but still does not works
2007-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	i use 60Hz refresh rate monitor,need to change VGA setting?
2007-10-28T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	Safe graphics mode *is* VGA
2007-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	do you mean if i changed VGA setting,i need to select safe graphics mode?
2007-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	No, nvm I thought that you just wanted to use the VGA driver ( vesa in Linux ), I just misunderstood what you said
2007-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	how can i solve this problem?
2007-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	I don't know :( You could try the alternate install CD but you will then likely have the same problem after installing
2007-10-28T10:38:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	i have tried that but still have the same problem as you said
2007-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	Try booting into recovery mode and editing your xorg.conf to use the correct resolution / refresh rate
2007-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	how? i already deleted ubuntu 7.10
2007-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	re-install with the alternate install CD? :(
2007-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	but i can't even successfully boot into the system after installed
2007-10-28T10:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	Have you tried booting into recovery mode? It boots into a terminal, not X
2007-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	ok,after boot into the terminal,what should i do?
2007-10-28T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	If you don't know how to edit your xorg.conf manually then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-10-28T10:47:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	what i i want to edit it manually?
2007-10-28T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	josss	Can you rephrase that please
2007-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	sorry,i mistype
2007-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	josss	Jordan_U	what is xorg.conf file look like and how can i change my refresh rate setting?
