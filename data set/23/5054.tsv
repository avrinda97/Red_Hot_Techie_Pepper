2007-03-02T07:35:00.000Z	lhuynh		excuse me, I was sent here to ask about scripts and/or vpython
2007-03-02T07:36:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	k, just ask
2007-03-02T07:37:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	how would I create a script to start a vpython program?
2007-03-02T07:41:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	what is vpython?
2007-03-02T07:41:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	better question, how do you usually start it?
2007-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	a python program that allows visual representation (3-D simulation)
2007-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	actually, I'm trying to install it.
2007-03-02T07:43:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	are you just trying to install the vpython module? or do you have a program that utilizes vpython?
2007-03-02T07:44:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	the module? I'm trying to install it. I'll eventually use it for a program, yes
2007-03-02T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	what is "it"
2007-03-02T07:45:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	visual python. I'm not much more sure how to explain it
2007-03-02T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	install the python-visual package to install the vpython module
2007-03-02T07:46:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	okay. I did that. is there anything else, or can I just start it? (and if so, how?)
2007-03-02T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	don't use "it", I have no idea what you are referring to :)
2007-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	sorry 'bout that. I typed in sudo apt-get python-visual. is there anything else to do?
2007-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	nope, now you have the vpython module installed.  You can run python programs that use the module or write your own python scripts that use the module
2007-03-02T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	I guess the name of the module is really "visual", it's a module just like "sys" or "os", you import it and use it in your python program
2007-03-02T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	have you seen http://vpython.org/webdoc/visual/index.html and http://vpython.erikthompson.com/  ?
2007-03-02T07:49:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	will go now. I couldn't reallly seem to find good vpython tutorials.
2007-03-02T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	I've viewed the first couple of videos ones, they are very straighforward and easy to follow.  do you already know python?
2007-03-02T07:50:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	yes. just got back from pycon. :)
2007-03-02T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	lhuynh	ah then those docs should serve you well
2007-03-02T07:59:00.000Z	lhuynh	jrib	lucky you can look at the videos. *heh*
