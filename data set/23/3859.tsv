2008-10-22T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manish	dude it was so long ago and you havent said what is wrong with it
2008-10-22T16:59:00.000Z	manish	ActionParsnip	 there is something wrong with my zimbra. Its not downloading the latest mails from yesterday. I think it is syncing the actions like deleting mails i deleted while offline but when it comes to downloading mails it is not doing so ... what do you think can be the reason and how can i correct it .... has anybody faced a similar problem earlier.... Has it something to do with the mail download limits ... can i change them
