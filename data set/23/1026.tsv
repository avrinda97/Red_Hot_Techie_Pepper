2010-10-08T17:16:00.000Z	thter		im trying to make a partition but Gparted is saying the device "is apparently in use by the system". does anyone know this means?
2010-10-08T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	if you run: mount   are trhere partitions mounted on the drive?
2010-10-08T17:17:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	no
2010-10-08T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	if you boot to live cd then you can definately do it there :)
2010-10-08T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	grub2 is a lot more complex but more flexible
2010-10-08T23:38:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	I'm following this tutorial and I need to edit that file. What can I do? http://mazeoflies.com/2008/06/09/ubuntu-hard-drive-encryption-with-external-key
2010-10-08T23:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	I've notused encrypted partitions. Ithink they cause too many headaches to be worthwhile
2010-10-08T23:51:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	i cant :(
2010-10-08T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	can't what?
2010-10-08T23:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	run: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub ,remove quiet and splash in thequotes but LEAVE the quotes. Save the new files, close gedit and run: sudo update-grub
2010-10-08T23:42:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	i need to remove it from /boot
2010-10-08T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	those quotes are alsowhere you add boot options. You must run the update grub to regenerate the config file
2010-10-08T23:43:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	im in a live cd editing the install
2010-10-08T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	the splash? Those boot options make the splash show
2010-10-08T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	then you'll need to chroot to run the update-grub
2010-10-08T23:45:00.000Z	thter	ActionParsnip	I don't know what that means.
2010-10-08T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	time to research then ;)
2010-10-08T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thter	if you boot to root recovery mode youwont need a chroot. Why don't you just do a littlewebsearching. There are plenty of guides on chroot and you'll learn more if you walk a little on your own
