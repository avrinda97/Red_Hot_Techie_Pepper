2010-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	aidrocsid		if i want to scan my windows partition for viruses from ubuntu what should I use?
2010-12-17T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	you can use clamav
2010-12-17T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	none, it's in the repo although the clamav ppa has newer stuffs
2010-12-17T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-clamav/ppa; sudo apt-get -y install clamav; sudo freshclam
2010-12-17T12:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	i suggest uninstalling openoffice and any old unused kernels you may have, frees up lots of space. Also run: sudo apt-get clean   can help
2010-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	sudo apt-get --purge remove openoffice*
2010-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	dpkg -l | less    will show all installed packages
2010-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	READ the command I gave, not what you think it says
2010-12-17T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	the asterisk was not an accident
2010-12-17T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	the command i gave with the ppa will give a newer lot
2010-12-17T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-clamav/ppa; sudo apt-get -y install clamav; sudo freshclam
2010-12-17T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	yes all as one
2010-12-17T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	as you already have it installed you just need: sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo freshclam
2010-12-17T12:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	then let it finish
2010-12-17T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	possibly
2010-12-17T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	exactly
2011-06-14T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	if you run:  smbtree   do you see the shares?
2011-06-14T07:42:00.000Z	aidrocsid	ActionParsnip	I see it, how do I browse it?
2011-06-14T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	press ALT+F2 and type:   smb://server/share    replace server with the server name, replace share with the share name
2011-06-14T07:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	why are you using samba4?
2011-06-14T07:45:00.000Z	aidrocsid	ActionParsnip	it's not showing me the tree anymore
2011-06-14T07:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aidrocsid	then restart the smbd service. I suggest you use samba and not samba4
2011-06-14T07:49:00.000Z	aidrocsid	ActionParsnip	smb://LAPTOP/Downloads isn't doing anything
