2006-10-28T12:24:00.000Z	jiger		does anyone know ip address of packages.freecontrib.org. it in't working and am unable to upgrade to edgy?
2006-10-28T12:26:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	plf packages?  if so, it's no longer maintained.
2006-10-28T12:27:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	then where are those packages previously in plf maintained now?
2006-10-28T12:28:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	i don't know.  http://plf.zarb.org/ says it's shutting down for ubuntu.
2006-10-28T12:28:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	damn....I hope my edgy upgrade goes fine
2006-10-28T12:29:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	can you remember off-hand what you installed from there?
2006-10-28T12:29:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	nope. know any command to query?
2006-10-28T12:29:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	perhaps mplayer codes or something
2006-10-28T12:32:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	if you can hold on for a min or 2, i'm trying to come up w/ a command for you.
2006-10-28T12:32:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	thanks. sure
2006-10-28T12:36:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	it might be a bit simpler to try using filters in synaptic rather than trying dpkg commandline options ad nauseum.  ever looked at the filters?
2006-10-28T12:37:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	nope :(
2006-10-28T12:37:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	pretty simple.  open synaptic.  settings...filters...
2006-10-28T12:38:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	am using kubuntu
2006-10-28T12:43:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	i'm trying to come up w/ a command line for you.  just a min....
2006-10-28T12:45:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	tried apt-cache dump |grep plf
2006-10-28T12:45:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	returns two versions. now how to know which packages have that version
2006-10-28T12:47:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	good...and you're sure that plf packages are the only foreign ones you've installed?
2006-10-28T12:47:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	got it libdvdcss2 and w32codecs
2006-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	ya rest are all main, multiverse ones
2006-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	withaY	jiger	you should be good to go, then.  you can get both of those elsewhere.  you just might have to reinstall them after you upgrade.
2006-10-28T12:49:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	hmm I guess so. my dvd drive gives a lot of problems without them. but I think I shud be good on once the repo comes up
2006-10-28T12:49:00.000Z	jiger	withaY	thanks for the help
