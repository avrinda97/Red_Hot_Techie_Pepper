2008-10-13T00:53:00.000Z	TempNick4		What I'm trying to do is change all instances, within a file, of ____.html to ____.php, where there is no .  or / immediately preceding the ____. So, I'd want misc.html to be misc.php, but I'd want www.site.com/misc.html to be unchanged.
2008-10-13T00:53:00.000Z	TempNick4		This seems perfect for regular expressions, but I just can't seem to phrase it correctly.
2008-10-13T00:54:00.000Z	TempNick4		Hey, I'm confused too. Thanks for trying. =P
2008-10-13T00:56:00.000Z	TempNick4		Well, I can definitely understand if no one here knows much about sed, but could anyone suggest a better place to ask?
2008-10-13T00:56:00.000Z	TempNick4		Hmm, interesting idea.
2008-10-13T00:57:00.000Z	TempNick4		So yeah, maybe bash would be better. Didn't see it.
2008-10-13T00:59:00.000Z	TempNick4		Oh, I see.
2008-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	TempNick4		Well, the trouble isn't searching and replacing.
2008-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	TempNick4		I want everything matching a pattern.
2008-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	TempNick4		I want misc.html, llama.html, and foo.html to all become php files.
2008-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	you want the rename utility
2008-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	it's able to do complex renames like that.
2008-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	TempNick4	Chousuke	Within a file?
2008-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	ah
2008-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	:s/.html/.php/g
2008-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	in vim ;P
2008-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	TempNick4	Chousuke	But I need exceptions.
2008-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	TempNick4	Chousuke	I need it so that foo.html is changed but not http://bar.com/baz.html
2008-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	Chousuke		hmm
2008-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	TempNick4		These are webpages and I want external links to still w*ork.
2008-10-13T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	that's a bit more complex a regexp
2008-10-13T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	dunno how to make a replace like that using the vim style.
2008-10-13T01:05:00.000Z	Chousuke	TempNick4	it is possible though.
