2009-05-31T18:06:00.000Z	mrwes	helper	I think you need the relatime and you would also want fsck on that partition, so 0 2 is correct
2009-05-31T18:07:00.000Z	mrwes	helper	pastebin your /etc/fstab so we can take a look at it
2009-05-31T18:07:00.000Z	mrwes		!pastebin
2009-05-31T18:07:00.000Z	helper	mrwes	error come like : mount: special device home does not exist
2009-05-31T18:07:00.000Z	mrwes	helper	from a terminal type sudo fdisk -l (lower case L), do you see the home partition?
2009-05-31T18:08:00.000Z	mrwes		helper /dev/sda2 or sda3 maybe?

2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	mrwes		Helper: did you actually make a /home partition?
2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	mrwes		I don't see it
2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	helper	mrwes	no i want to do now so i can set up the quota
2009-05-31T18:11:00.000Z	mrwes	helper	well I've never used quotas, but you can't mount a /home partition if it doesn't exsist
2009-05-31T18:11:00.000Z	helper	mrwes	there is /home
