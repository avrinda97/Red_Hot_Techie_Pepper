2005-02-10T11:53:00.000Z	Scooter		i was just about to network it and realized that samba is not going to work anymore, what do we use for Linux to linux networking? TIA :)
2005-02-10T11:54:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	samba, nfs, scp, afs, sfs, http, whatever you prefer
2005-02-10T11:55:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	if you need to transfer just one file, and it's not to big, use scp
2005-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	in that case, rather not us
2005-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	e scp :)
2005-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	also look at rsync
2005-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	oh, and you might still want to use samba, especially if you have a mixed environment
2005-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	no problem :)
2005-02-10T11:57:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	(rsync is especially nice if you need to sync in two directions, check it out)
2005-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	ok, have fun :)
2005-02-10T12:51:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	you could install samba of course :)
2005-02-10T12:52:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	no reason why linux<->linux couldn't use samba
2005-02-10T12:52:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	do you control both machines?
2005-02-10T12:53:00.000Z	LarstiQ	Scooter	ok, I'd try that route then
