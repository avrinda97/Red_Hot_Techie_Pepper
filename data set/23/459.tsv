2011-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	tensorpudding	numberstation	you could replace all instances of spaces with newlines
2011-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	numberstation	tensorpudding	how do I do that?
2011-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	tensorpudding	numberstation	sed or a reasonably smart text editor could do it
2011-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	numberstation	tensorpudding	i don' know these tools
2011-08-12T08:22:00.000Z	numberstation		DEAR EVERYONE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING ON THE COMMAND LINE, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

2011-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	numberstation		so, how do i make sure each line is unique?
2011-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	numberstation	oh, in the future, gedit can do it
2011-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	numberstation		oh, sort it, then try the uniq thing?
2011-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	numberstation		hwo do I sort it again?
2011-08-12T08:25:00.000Z	tensorpudding	numberstation	just replace, and search for a space, and replace with \n
2011-08-12T08:25:00.000Z	tensorpudding	numberstation	it's smart enough to match \n as a newline, and not a literal \n
