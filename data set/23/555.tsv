2011-06-11T02:05:00.000Z	Poindexter_		Lamp
2011-06-11T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	lamp will install apache, no point realy
2012-05-19T21:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	could use the freenode webchat portal and join your own channel
2012-05-19T21:49:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	I have seen the free Mibit as well. I would like to not be associated with any popular IRC server.
2012-05-19T21:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	could run your own :)
2012-05-19T21:52:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	   Freenode is running:    version ircd-seven-1.1.3
2012-08-06T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	i'dask in ##hardware
2012-08-06T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	then get registered and identified and you can walk in
2012-08-06T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	its offtopic here
2012-08-06T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	as long as there are kernel drivers for the controller, it will work
2012-09-20T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	you can run 32bit apps in 64bit Ubuntu
2012-09-20T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	then its teh usual difference inside the kernel (access to more of the cpu) etc
2012-09-20T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	working with Win7 will be identical
2012-09-20T03:02:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	thanks for the time and input. I will keep searching for the holy grail. :)
2012-09-20T02:54:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	would that simply apply with other VBOX issues if you know about the differences?
2012-09-20T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	if your CPU supports 64bit guests then you can run one.
2012-09-20T02:56:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	I am running Debian on VBOX right now. The throughput on the Host is great as well as the Guest. I was wondering because this box is  32 bit machine and I ran a 64 bit similar box and saw no difference in transit time.
2012-09-20T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	I'd ask in #vbox maybe they can explain better, debain is not supported here
2012-09-20T02:58:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	true. Lots of the folks on VBOX channel don't have a clue and wait for a guru to come on the channel.  :)
2012-09-20T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poindexter_	then ask in #debian
2012-09-20T02:59:00.000Z	Poindexter_	ActionParsnip	I was working on a special hardware box today. I sought some techs input, not everyone in on the same page.
