2010-08-01T03:38:00.000Z	jimbo_		Okay, so there's no more xorg.conf -- is there a way I can *get* one for my current configuration?  I need to modify it.
2010-08-01T03:39:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	yes, you can create an xorg.conf. you'll need to drop to a command prompt to do it, though, unless you already know all the settings you want to use
2010-08-01T03:40:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	I mean, how can I get an xorg.conf that represents my current video settings, as a starting point?  Creating one entirely from scratch is undesirable
2010-08-01T03:41:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	ok, write down what i'm about to say,or copy and paste it in your text editor of choice, then print it...b/c when you drop from the point-and-click GUI to a command line environment, you'll lose the IRC window.
2010-08-01T03:43:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	It's okay, I've been a linux admin for some years.  Just don't mess with X much.
2010-08-01T03:44:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	edbian: I dont have an `xorg` executable anyway, so what package am I missing?
2010-08-01T03:45:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	in that case, if you're comofortable outside of the GUI, then just hit ctl+alt+f1 to switch to a virtual terminal, then type sudo service gdm stop (and maybe sudo killall X for good measure) then run the command Xorg -configure. It will create the xorg.conf file in /root, so you will need to copy it over to /etc/X11
2010-08-01T03:46:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	oh, capital Xorg.  Gotcha,
2010-08-01T03:46:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	but gnome (or whoever) sets up my displays for me.  If I stop gdm, Xorg -configure doesn't seem likely to give me what I want.
2010-08-01T03:48:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	today's X and desktop environments tend to auto-configure..there still exists the option to use the settings in xorg.conf, though. If you create the file, and the syntax is correct, then I would think X should read the settings from it.
2010-08-01T03:48:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	for example, I always had to manually make an xorg.conf when i used the nvidia binary driver downloaded from nvidia's website.
2010-08-01T03:49:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	back shortly, let's see what I get.
2010-08-01T03:49:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	ok.
2010-08-01T03:56:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	can you pastebin the error?
2010-08-01T03:58:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	no error, just a backtrace.  Right after loading fbdev successfully, I think fglrx driver's next and that's where it faults.
2010-08-01T03:59:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	segfaults at 0x00000000 even which I don't believe I've seen heh
2010-08-01T04:00:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	fglrx? Is that why you need the xorg.conf? I thought amd had a utility to create the xorg.conf for you? drop to VT, stop X server, install driver, and run aticonfig --initial or something like that/
2010-08-01T04:00:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	keep in mind, i don't know much abpout fglrx...i'm just trying to remember stuff from old phoronix.com forum posts
2010-08-01T04:01:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	going for 2-head fglrx and a third on displaylink;  the first two are easy enough with automatic config, for the third I think I need to author an xorg.conf -- that's why I want the working 2-head xorg.conf as a starting point
2010-08-01T04:02:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	I'll try the aticonfig
2010-08-01T04:03:00.000Z	jimbo_	d9500	gotta get my ride in before the sun goes down.  back later on, thanks so far,  I had forgotten about aticonfig --initial which is what I used before all this auto-Xorg stuff become popular.
2010-08-01T04:04:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	ok... you can try it, but i freely admit that's just from memory. you might want to look up some more documentation first.
2010-08-01T04:05:00.000Z	d9500	jimbo_	anyway, glad to hopefully have been of some help. if i run into ya again, let me know how it goes.
