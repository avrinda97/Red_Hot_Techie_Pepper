2006-08-23T11:29:00.000Z	gdb		Well, that's not really ideal, either.  I want the functionality of the notifier, I just don't want it bugging me about *this* reboot because I know I don't need to do it.
2006-08-23T11:29:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	you get this after every kernel upgrade
2006-08-23T11:29:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	Right, and I've not upgraded the kernel.  I removed and reinstalled the running kernel.
2006-08-23T11:29:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	the path of least resistance would be to reboot and be done with it...
2006-08-23T11:30:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	That's the path of booting the folks using my machine and I'd like to avoid that.  Plus, it's a good idea to know how the software actually works.
2006-08-23T11:31:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	i have had the same issue, and couldn't resolve it without a reboot
2006-08-23T11:32:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	damn.. i was hoping there was a file somewhere that update-notifer read when it started up, that was deleted/modified on reboot, that I could delete/modify by hand :-/
2006-08-23T11:32:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	i get the feeling it is hard-wired. If you find another solution, let me know
2006-08-23T11:33:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	annoying, isn't it? ;-)
2006-08-23T11:33:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	yep
2006-08-23T11:35:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	heh found it
2006-08-23T11:35:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	yes?
2006-08-23T11:35:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	you need to remove /var/run/reboot-required
2006-08-23T11:35:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	:)
2006-08-23T11:35:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	well done
2006-08-23T11:36:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	yep, that worked heh
2006-08-23T11:37:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	it looks like after a kernel is installed, update-notifier runs /usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required
2006-08-23T11:38:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	that is a useful piece of info. That update notifier is as annoying as it's Windows counterpart
2006-08-23T11:40:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	I like it simply because I like clicky updates.  haha nothing to do with Windows either, I just like the idea of it.
2006-08-23T11:41:00.000Z	mcphail	gdb	clicky updates are fine, but nagging is not
2006-08-23T11:42:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	Yes, I'd like a button that was, essentially, "Reboot now?  Reboot later?" and hitting "Later" made the notification go away. heh
2007-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	that's what's installed
2007-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	gdb	mcphail	dpkg hasn't actually installed anything broken, it's state is screwed up because the system has been told to install things that don't make sense
