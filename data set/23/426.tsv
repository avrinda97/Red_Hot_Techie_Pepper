2011-09-05T06:07:00.000Z	notlistening	warning123	generally the process dies as the ssh session is broken, what processing where you doing and did you run it from the ssh terminal?
2011-09-05T06:08:00.000Z	notlistening	warning123	can you see it still running?
2011-09-05T06:08:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	yes server dies , how can i make server still run , while i leave the ssh session? and how can i get back to it for checking for instant to perform tasks like /changemap etc..
2011-09-05T06:10:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	qin Dr_Willis , i have putty installed , if i save a session can a friend use the same session?
2011-09-05T06:11:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	qin Dr_Willis , and will the same processing session show ( as in the live game server terminal console )
2011-09-05T06:12:00.000Z	notlistening	warning123	what game server is it?
2011-09-05T06:16:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	its running mumble aka voice chat application
2011-09-05T06:17:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	i dont want the console window to be on my computer all the time , i just want to start the server and leave and check back to it from time to time thats all
2011-09-05T06:26:00.000Z	notlistening	warning123	do you need to issue the server commands or just check its logs, best way to run it would be as a service and just login and check the log files
2011-09-05T06:29:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	whats the command to run it as a service>
2011-09-05T06:32:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	im logged as root  , whats the command to make it a session so it doesnt timeout when i leave or end's
2011-09-05T06:35:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	their is init in /etc/ init file , how to edit it ? gededit? i remember useing that back from dapper
2011-09-05T06:38:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	i see acpid - apf - and alot of other stuff like kudzu nfslock rdisc
2011-09-05T06:41:00.000Z	warning123	notlistening	should server be running first to show their? i see webmin and netconsole which may be the probable things , will it be better to launch through webmin ? i tried but once i loged out sesion is ended also
2011-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	notlistening	warning123	the files you see in there are like startup scripts if there is not one for the voice server then try google to find for it, there might be an example online with instructions
