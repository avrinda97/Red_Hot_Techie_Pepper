2005-04-17T10:05:00.000Z	heh		I have a computer with a 10 gig hard drive, and I want to know the most basic way to install a linux system on it, without taking all the disk space or anything like that, so I can also install games on it
2005-04-17T10:06:00.000Z	heh		it's my secondary computer that I mostly use for fun.  I was wondering if it's safe to JUST install Gnome, without installing other things, or if what I did originally installing Gentoo and then installing gnome on top of that was right
2005-04-17T10:07:00.000Z	heh		I'm really dumb about installing things, but I know how to use google =x
2005-04-17T10:08:00.000Z	heh		is it safe to just format my hard drive, and install gnome 2.10, or realistically what should I do?
2005-04-17T10:09:00.000Z	heh		also, how much space does gentoo and gnome combined take approximately?
2005-04-17T10:09:00.000Z	heh		well, my original question .. err one of the original ones, was if you need to have a system below gnome, or if you can just install gnome on a blank disk
2005-04-17T10:10:00.000Z	heh		is there any recommended system?
2005-04-17T10:10:00.000Z	heh		blimey!
2005-04-17T10:11:00.000Z	heh		naw, I see no need for alternative desktop environments.  I'm running gnome on the livecd package, and it seems really cool
2005-04-17T10:12:00.000Z	heh		granted asking this is like asking microsoft if there are better os's than windows in a way, but are there programs like gnome that are superior to gnome?
2005-04-17T10:13:00.000Z	theine	heh	I guess quite a few people would argue for KDE for instance
2005-04-17T10:13:00.000Z	theine	heh	Can't comment on that, I don't use KDE myself
2005-04-17T10:14:00.000Z	theine	heh	i'm sure "kde vs gnome" gives lots of matches on google...
2005-04-17T10:15:00.000Z	theine	heh	Well, you can try it yourself with the Kubuntu live-cd
2005-04-17T10:19:00.000Z	theine	heh	do you want to format the entire hard drive or just a partition?
2005-04-17T10:20:00.000Z	heh	theine	basically I want to start from scratch
2005-04-17T10:20:00.000Z	theine	heh	and install ubuntu?
2005-04-17T10:20:00.000Z	heh	theine	yeah, might as well.  I got sick of windows
2005-04-17T10:21:00.000Z	theine	heh	well, in case you go for ubuntu, you can select "use entire hard disk" during install
2005-04-17T10:21:00.000Z	heh	theine	that seems a lot easier than what I was doing earlier with gentoo
2005-04-17T10:21:00.000Z	theine	heh	I guess it is :)
2005-04-17T10:22:00.000Z	heh	theine	I want to eventually learn all about the general codes for using lilo/unix etc..  just as a hobby, but for the time being I have a friend chain laughing at me since I was at basically a dos'ish interface and couldn't access the internet for 2 days from the computer
2005-04-17T10:23:00.000Z	theine	heh	Ubuntu probably provides a smoother transition to the linux world than gentoo
