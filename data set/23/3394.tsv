2008-05-01T23:05:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer		hmm exaile eh
2008-05-01T23:06:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer		so exaile is the best non kde player for ubuntu eh?
2008-05-01T23:07:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer		(kinda like amarok, but not having hotkeys is a pain :(
2008-05-01T23:07:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	That is a personal preference... I just think it'd be neat...
2008-05-01T23:08:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	Would give projects motivation to use Launchpad also, so it'd get more use from all the Ubuntu users.
2008-05-01T23:08:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	isn't launchpad a bug reporting site, fde?
2008-05-01T23:09:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	No, that is just one of its features.... launchpad.net at the top gives a list of other modules...
2008-05-01T23:09:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	oh btw you using 64bit ubuntu?
2008-05-01T23:09:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	nope, sorry
2008-05-01T23:09:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	then 32bit ubuntu?
2008-05-01T23:10:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	Nope, 48  ;)
2008-05-01T23:11:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	No idea, but Ubuntu only supports 32bit and 64bit... guess it could mean it waste half a clock cycle? heh
2008-05-01T23:12:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	still doesn't make sense.
2008-05-01T23:18:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	the flash videos don't place, but the sounds in audacious plays
2008-05-01T23:12:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	Was a joke... ugh
2008-05-01T23:12:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	I can see that, it just didn't make sense to me though.
2008-05-01T23:13:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	its just that I have this problem with the soundmixer not working properly it seems
2008-05-01T23:15:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	Wasn't anything to do with that... heh.. if Volume Control applet is turned up, and right click > Open Volume Control on the same applet and turning Front up doesn't do it, idk
2008-05-01T23:16:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	If those are all up, then that's max I'm afraid.
2008-05-01T23:16:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	I think its an issue with the sound mixer...
2008-05-01T23:16:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	That is a frontend to the sound mixer... did you check "Open Volume Control" ?
2008-05-01T23:17:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	fde	all my volume bars are maxed out
2008-05-01T23:17:00.000Z	fde	Swiftfoxer	Then that is max  :/
