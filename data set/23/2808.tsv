2009-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	lyrae		when using vsftpd, where is the default dir?
2009-02-04T10:46:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	in vsftpd.conf, the option local_root is set to the root dir.
2009-02-04T10:47:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	and that's also where you can change it to anythin gyou want.
2009-02-04T10:47:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	doesnt seem to work
2009-02-04T10:48:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	you need to restart vsftpd for changes to take effect.
2009-02-04T10:48:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	 id id
2009-02-04T10:49:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	so what does it do, then?
2009-02-04T10:50:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	nothing...i go ftp://localhost and the file i put in home/lyrae/ftp/ insnt there
2009-02-04T10:50:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	the directory listing is empty..i should see a file
2009-02-04T10:51:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	did you put the initial '/' for the dir conf?
2009-02-04T10:52:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	(it's not home/lyrae..., its /home/lyrae
2009-02-04T10:52:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	yep: local_root=/home/lyrae/ftp/
2009-02-04T10:53:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	when i type 'ls' in ftp, i get /
2009-02-04T10:54:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	not 'ls', i mean pwd
2009-02-04T10:55:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	well yes, it sets the ftp root "/" to whatever you set local_root to. (well, supposedly. apparently it doesn't work for you...)
2009-02-04T10:56:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	any other ftp daemons i could try?
2009-02-04T11:01:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	hmm... well thereis proftpd
2009-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	there's the regular "ftpd"
2009-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	lyrae	nanotube	thank you
2009-02-04T11:03:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	just check what channels relating to ftp are out there, you might find some helpful folks :)
2009-02-04T11:03:00.000Z	nanotube	lyrae	helpful folks who know what they're doing, even. :)
