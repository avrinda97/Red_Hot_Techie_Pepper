2012-05-28T19:51:00.000Z	zombifier	Harris	What's the brand of this external keyboard?
2012-05-28T19:51:00.000Z	Harris		hp zombifier
2012-05-28T19:52:00.000Z	zombifier	Harris	open a terminal, enter "xev"
2012-05-28T19:52:00.000Z	zombifier		Then keep the terminal open and press the Cap Lock key and post the output exactly when the key is presses
2012-05-28T19:53:00.000Z	zombifier		Press the Cap Lock key on the xev window
2012-05-28T19:53:00.000Z	Harris		where should i paste the outcome it is long
2012-05-28T19:55:00.000Z	Harris	zombifier	http://pastebin.com/eg0QNV2j
2012-05-28T19:56:00.000Z	zombifier		Weird. The output says that Cap Lock WAS pressed. Can you type in all caps when Cap Lock was on?
2012-05-28T19:58:00.000Z	Harris	zombifier	harris@harris-HP-Pavilion-dv6000-RP296UA-ABA:~$ XEV
2012-05-28T19:58:00.000Z	Harris		XEV: command not found
2012-05-28T19:59:00.000Z	Harris	zombifier	 (root) has global permissions and it's VERY easy to screw somehting up. sudo (as root) only allows that one change to be made as a root user

2012-05-28T19:59:00.000Z	Harris		<nydel> ikonia: recently. when i use ctrl-meta-t to open a terminal window, it isn't in focus.
2012-05-28T19:59:00.000Z	Harris		<ikonia> nydel: that doesn't sound simple
2012-05-28T19:59:00.000Z	zombifier	Harris	It's a non-issue to me. I think the keyboard driver was not working really well with the lights, but it works.
2012-05-28T20:00:00.000Z	zombifier		And btw, commands in Linux are case sentitive - xev works, but XEV doesn't
2012-05-28T20:00:00.000Z	Harris	zombifier	 where can i get a new driver
2012-05-28T20:01:00.000Z	zombifier	Harris	Dunno. I'm blind as a bat when it comes to hardware-related stuffs
