2005-11-05T09:44:00.000Z	lucky_strike		i wanted to install multimeida codecs, but can't find "Multimedia (multiverse) > gstreamer0.8-lame" in Synaptic. i see the "Multimedia (multiverse)" category but not this package in it... Can anyone help me?
2005-11-05T09:45:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	check your repositories against a standard list...looks like you are missing something
2005-11-05T10:07:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	no
2005-11-05T10:07:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	disable those in your sources.list
2005-11-05T10:09:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	its definitely there
2005-11-05T10:09:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	your not finding it..which must mean a different problem...because it does exist
2005-11-05T10:12:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	cant you take a look at my sources.list file please? is it ok? http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3875
2005-11-05T10:13:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	roger
2005-11-05T10:16:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	I pasted my sources.list in there too, can you compare them plz? http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3877
2005-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	you could always use that link at the top of my source list to make another source list for yourself ;)
2005-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	yes, as ubotu told me
2005-11-05T10:21:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	well i will just try to take your .list. do you think its ok?..
2005-11-05T10:21:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	yeah you could do that...just remove all the '.au' parts
2005-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	or use http://ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
2005-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	using sourc-o-matic will allow you to have a localised sources.list
2005-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	i see
2005-11-05T10:27:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	but you have also added this "deb cdrom:.." package, right?..
2005-11-05T10:28:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	you can add your CD via synaptic.....
2005-11-05T10:29:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	go to synaptic and look in the menus for 'Add CD'
2005-11-05T10:31:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	that will work too :)
2005-11-05T10:35:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	omg, i did everything but it still is not there!..  this is my new .list file partly generated by source-o-matic http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3878
2005-11-05T10:35:00.000Z	mustard5	lucky_strike	something else is wrong
2005-11-05T10:37:00.000Z	lucky_strike	mustard5	seems to be..
