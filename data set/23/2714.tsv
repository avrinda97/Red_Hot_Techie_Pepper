2008-12-25T06:28:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Just having to pick/tick all the gtk-engines -> just a tad bit labourious
2008-12-25T06:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	roger... i was wondering if you figured this out yet -->  Apparently I need "GLib (GModule
2008-12-25T06:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Perserverence.
2008-12-25T06:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	I rather reckoned I'd have missed out on the gtk-engines bit - ain't had enough coffee today yet.
2008-12-25T06:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	roger... ok. what i was wondering is, if you had figured this out yet ?    -->  Apparently I need GLib GModule
2008-12-25T06:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Bear in mind this is a tad bit different than me other distros -> learning curve ya know.
2008-12-25T07:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	I'm giving up - day's half done - found XFce in the channels anyways...was worth a go.
2008-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	i could help you, but i could not get you to answer my yes or no question earlier
2008-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	you had said you were missing Glib.. i asked you a few times if had figured it out yet
2008-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Sorry mate - children are underfoot today - attention span of a gnat I've got
2008-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	lol
2008-12-25T07:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	ok, you still missing Glib?
2008-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Just a version diff. Sad but true. S'all right cuz I'm installing from the source channel...saves me a bit of time that - but would like to compile me own stuff as I've done in the past on Fed and Mandribble
2008-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	ok.. you get the Glib dependency figured out yet? yes? no?
2008-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Nah - still a mystery m8
2008-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	ok, i can help with that
2008-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Howzabout I put the ankle-biters to nap first, eh?
2008-12-25T07:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	YankDownUnder	i have to go myself, but   apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev pkg-config
2008-12-25T07:36:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	onetinsoldier	Coolbeans. Roger that.
