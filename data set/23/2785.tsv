2011-04-29T09:58:00.000Z	zetheroo1		Would anyone like to know how to get the weather applet/indicator back into the top "panel"/bar in 11.04 ? :)
2011-04-29T09:59:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	it goes away? yes please
2011-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	actually, i'm not using an applet. it's built into the time & date thing in previous versions
2011-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	zetheroo1	tanath	well it's no longer there in 11.04 ... I'll tell you how to get it back :)
2011-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	built into time & date still?
2011-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	zetheroo1	tanath	no ... in 11.04 it's gone! No longer built into the time/date
2011-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	>.< ok, so how?
2011-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	zetheroo1	tanath	so what you do is install "indicator-weather" from Synaptic or terminal ... then add it to Startup Applications ... logout/login ... ;)
2011-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	ah, i saw that in unity recommends...
2011-04-29T10:03:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	thanks for tip
2011-04-29T10:03:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	still have detailed info in tooltip?
2011-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	don't know what a tooltip is? when you hover mouse over somethign and info box pops up
2011-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	hovering over weather in 10.10 shows things like 'broken clouds, feels like temp, wind speed, sunrise & sunset'
2011-04-29T10:06:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	so check 11.04 for me
2011-04-29T10:07:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	mmk
2011-04-29T10:09:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	think phonetically
2011-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	'cause i don't think i'll like unity
2011-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	i've got everything set up how i like it. i'm nice and efficient and no annoyances. upgrading will break a number of things for me, like shortcuts
2011-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	oh, i will when i upgrade... i'm also waiting for a few days after release at least for the wave of inevitable bug fixes
2011-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	i typically upgrade a month or so before release. first i'm i've not wanted to upgrade
2011-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	but there's some drastic changes being made. will be better in long run, but we're not there yet. so i wait
2011-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	*first time
2011-04-29T10:15:00.000Z	tanath	zetheroo1	well things are always improving... not very often there's a step backwards
