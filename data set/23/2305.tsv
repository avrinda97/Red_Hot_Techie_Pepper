2010-06-11T08:11:00.000Z	kathe	bricky	that's talking about an error, I guess what you are asking is either can you install XP or can you get around the error
2010-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	kathe	bricky	or are you asking how to adjust a windows install file
2010-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	bricky	kathe	can I can install it on a physical partition with linux
2010-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	bricky		Can I
2010-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	kathe	bricky	yes you can follow the instructions, but the instructions asume you know something you probably don't.
2010-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	bricky	kathe	I would gladly  follow them, if I could find them
2010-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	bricky	kathe	what is that>?
2010-06-11T08:14:00.000Z	kathe	bricky	it's called slip streaming, it gives you a generic set of instructions, but basically it's you create your own XP install disk that has some modifications
2010-06-11T08:15:00.000Z	bricky	kathe	I cant use any CDS my computer overheats lol
2010-06-11T08:15:00.000Z	bricky		I need to do it right on linux, preferably with VMware
