2008-06-10T22:11:00.000Z	denon		am I missing something? Can't seem to find a dhcp-server package for hardy
2008-06-10T22:12:00.000Z	denon		but that's not there either :)
2008-06-10T22:12:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	Package dhcp3-server
2008-06-10T22:13:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	/ Slart: so would dhcp3-server not be in the default apt sources?
2008-06-10T22:14:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	what does "sudo apt-get install dhcp3-server" ?
2008-06-10T22:14:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	sudo apt-get update , and see if all internet sources are enabeld. actually it SHOULD be in the main repos.
2008-06-10T22:15:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	good thought .. updating now
2008-06-10T22:16:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	heh, update did it . .for some reason I was just assuming the stock cache would have most of it
2008-06-10T22:16:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	nice :)
2008-06-10T22:17:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	of course .. it installed, but wont start
2008-06-10T22:17:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	guessing I need to get my config on first
2008-06-10T22:17:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	prolly. may u wanna try udhcpd, the package says "very small DHCP server"
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	nah, I like ISC DHCPD
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	besides, I know it can handle a few hundred users without an issue .. which is what it needs to do here
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	ok gl there. guess there will be a few tutorials on google around :)
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	nah, I know how to config it ..
2008-06-10T22:19:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	good :) good luck with it then and have fun :)
2008-06-10T22:19:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	so what's the "ubuntu way" to start this stuff? /etc/init.d/dhcpd start ?
2008-06-10T22:20:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	prolly. should be already running, at least on startup i guess. dunno exaclty tho.
2008-06-10T22:20:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	sudo /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start
2008-06-10T22:20:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	k, wondered if there was any special tools I should know about in ubuntu
2008-06-10T22:20:00.000Z	denon	tschaka^	thanks for your help, much appreciated
2008-06-10T22:21:00.000Z	tschaka^	denon	no problem :)
