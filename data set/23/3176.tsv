2008-07-02T18:03:00.000Z	on5sl		i've got //192.168.0.10/bram /mnt/nas cifs user=*****,password=*************,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0 in my fstab, i've followed this guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=288534&page=2 and i can't create direcotry's with the correct rights. When i make a directory in nautilus is is drwxr-xr-x. But i can still chmod it manually to drwxrwxrwx. In windows the samba share works flawless so the server isn't the problem
2008-07-02T18:05:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	if you type "umask" at a prompt, what response do you get?
2008-07-02T18:06:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	i get 0022 then
2008-07-02T18:09:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	try setting "umask 0000" in your .bashrc or .profile, and log out and then back in. see if that sorts it. not really a great idea to apply this value of umask, but if you need to create a lot of folders this way. easiest, of course, is just to write a simple shell script to do it, in that case :-)
2008-07-02T18:10:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	i'll give it a try...
2008-07-02T18:11:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	if i do umask 0000 now in terminal...does it works right now?
2008-07-02T18:11:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	appereantly it does..when i give usmaks now the output is 0000 but i still can't create dir's with write acces :(
2008-07-02T18:12:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	you'd have to relaunch nautilus, and the change would not be saved. you should notice, however, that if you do a mkdir <foo>, <foo> will now have the permissions you want, i think.
2008-07-02T18:14:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	but did it work from the terminal?
2008-07-02T18:16:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	ah, this might be useful to you: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-40617.html
2008-07-02T18:17:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	trick is to put the umask in .gnomerc, apparently...
2008-07-02T18:17:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	you'll need to restart gnome in order for that change to take, of course
2008-07-02T18:30:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	i've created a .gnomrc now and logged in and out..still no result
2008-07-02T18:31:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	ah well. might try googling for further answers, or just breaking out a shell...
2008-07-02T18:32:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	i don't many folks who can actually get real work done with nautilus anyhow ;-)
2008-07-02T18:34:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	oh yeah, i've heard of them :-)
2008-07-02T19:08:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	appereantly the mask thing is a bug in hardy? i think that is not worth the status low...https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glib2.0/+bug/242618
2008-07-02T19:09:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	interesting
2008-07-02T19:11:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	what do you think about this bug...? i think is is worth a higher priority...shares are becoming more and more common...and when in the next release of ubuntu mounten shares becomes more easy it will cause a lot of problems for new users i think
2008-07-02T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	well, it should certainly be fixed in an LTS release, for the reasons stated there.
2008-07-02T19:13:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	so should i do something now?
2008-07-02T19:13:00.000Z	sipior	on5sl	not much you really can do about this, at the moment.
2008-07-02T19:14:00.000Z	on5sl	sipior	so for now making dir's with and chmod them with terminal...
