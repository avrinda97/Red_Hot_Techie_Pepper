2006-08-19T07:31:00.000Z	dlab		is there another linux distro that'll work on sun4v?
2006-08-19T07:33:00.000Z	dlab		.. the installer should detect that I'm using a serial line and not use fancy colors... :/
2006-08-19T07:33:00.000Z	dlab		really, waiting 10-20s for the screen to draw is annoying
2006-08-19T07:35:00.000Z	dlab		ugh
2006-08-19T07:35:00.000Z	dlab		now the rescue image fails since I don't have a complete install
2006-08-19T07:37:00.000Z	dlab		can someone just tell me a boot argument I can pass to the install image that'll give me a shell instead of this ncurses shite?
2006-08-19T07:38:00.000Z	timalot	dlab	u can run a shell from  the installed cant u?
2006-08-19T07:38:00.000Z	dlab	timalot	I need to get sshd up off of the cd so I can install it in the first place
2006-08-19T07:39:00.000Z	dlab		the normal ncurses bit is way too slow to use over a serial console
2006-08-19T07:40:00.000Z	timalot	dlab	isnt there some help messages available at the boot prompt
2006-08-19T07:41:00.000Z	dlab	timalot	nothing on how to drop to a shell
2006-08-19T07:41:00.000Z	dlab		I'll try init=/bin/sh, but for some reason I feel I'll have to break and run the installer again :/
2006-08-19T07:41:00.000Z	dlab		was hoping there was some argument like "nomenu" or something
2006-08-19T07:42:00.000Z	timalot	dlab	if you are at the physical console u can use alt-f2 or something or u you could try ctrl-z / ctrl-c when the ncurses is running
2006-08-19T07:42:00.000Z	dlab	timalot	I'm running over ALOM connected to the console
2006-08-19T07:42:00.000Z	dlab		^C does nothing
2006-08-19T07:42:00.000Z	timalot		ALOM?
2006-08-19T07:42:00.000Z	dlab		suspend I doubt works as it looks like it's forked by init
2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	dlab	timalot	lights-out managment
2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	dlab		so you can connect to the console remotely
2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	dlab		there is no keyboard/vga port on this box :P
2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	timalot		i am pretty sure ctrl-z or ctrl-c will work
2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	dlab	timalot	neither do..
