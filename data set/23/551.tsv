2011-08-19T23:31:00.000Z	widewake		hello, my browser speed recently becoming very slow, takes awhile to load even simple pages, any solutions? im using ubuntu 10.10
2011-08-19T23:32:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	look into the system monitor to see whether your CPU doen't do other things
2011-08-19T23:32:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	and if your network is used like it should do
2011-08-19T23:33:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	cpu looks fine, 4-6 for mozilla
2011-08-19T23:33:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	what about network, do you get the usage you would expect from your connection when you surf?
2011-08-19T23:34:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	 54 mbs,
2011-08-19T23:35:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	that sounds like your WiFi
2011-08-19T23:35:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	I meant that if you surf the web, that you get some 300 kB/s or so?
2011-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	 its up and down, though looks efficient atm
2011-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	I am just asking, maybe it is your WiFi or your internet connection that is slow
2011-08-19T23:38:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	kk, not sure what it is but i dont think its the wifi
2011-08-19T23:39:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	does it work with another browser?
2011-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	nope, slow as well
2011-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	it will get stuck randomly, one second it loads a page quickly, next its taking forever. its only recently its became a problem
2011-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	okay, so it is not browser issue … do you have tried it on another computer
2011-08-19T23:41:00.000Z	systemclient	widewake	sounds like when I am at the edge of my wireless …
2011-08-19T23:41:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	there are other people using the same wifi, theyve yet to complain so.. i think its jjust me

2011-08-19T23:49:00.000Z	widewake	systemclient	well thx for trying. going to trouble shoot later, its driving me bonkers!
