2010-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Most of the rescue disks I have gotten have several text editors
2010-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Hmm.... wireless...... does ubuntu still have problems with wpa support btw?
2010-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Im stuck on wep :(
2010-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I HAVE tried it usr13
2010-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I needed to boto up another pc and lookup a manual to find out how to exit after failing to use it to edit >.<
2010-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Im just saying its the first editor that I was not able to use without a manual, not even to be able to exit it
2010-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I have three systems that are wep, going to see if I can do anything about getting them to work with wpa
2010-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		because its not secure >.<
2010-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		.... wait, no, two systems iirc
2010-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		wpasupplicant?
2010-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	losha	Cyber_Akuma	vi was developed long before user 'friendliness' was even a concept. And there are still environments e.g. embedded processors where having a small but full-featured editor is worthwhile...
2010-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma	losha	yes, I know, I asknowledged this, that before modern ui concepts it was probably the best, and its still useful in tiny/embedded systems
2010-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Just don't see why its used for example on desktops nowadays, is it just because peopel are used to it? because pretty much eveyr distro has it?
2010-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Not really, more like I am trying to figure out why its still the main one in use today for even desktop work
2010-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		... the gui I guess? XD
2010-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Since apparently its not the apps
2010-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Ubuntu.... Isn't that like an African or something like that word meaning togetherness?
2010-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		BTW, anybody here boot ubuntu and other distros at once? Was wondering if there is a way to make it so grub2 won't have problems if distros other than ubuntu update their kernel, since it seems to need to point to the kernel directly
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Yeah but then THAT disto will aldo triple boot
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		also*
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Its a laptop and I have three OSes on it, not really possible unfortunately
2010-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		WIn7/Ubuntu/OpenSUSE
2010-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	losha	Cyber_Akuma	there's no way to *guarantee* that other distros will update grub2 correctly. There's basically no substititute for checking and maintaining it by hand, in my opinion...
