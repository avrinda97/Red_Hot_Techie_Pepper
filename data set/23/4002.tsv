2007-12-10T01:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	cd /path/to/folder
2007-12-14T13:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	i always figure if i can't smell it, its safe..lol
2007-12-14T13:15:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Good plan, haha, but I'd rather not trial and error myself to death :P
2007-12-14T13:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	:)
2008-02-07T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	well, Ubuntu is about as easy as it gets....
2008-02-07T07:55:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Yeh, bit it does take a bit more resources to run then some of the other distros I've heard about. Problem is, I don't really remember any of the other distros I saw :P
2008-02-07T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	how old a pc are we talking here?
2008-02-07T07:56:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Uh, 96mb RAM, AMD(i think) 450mhz processor, 8gb hard drive. All it's ever used for is flash games
2008-02-07T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	yeah, its gonna be really tough to find a distro to work on that...
2008-02-07T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	you're gonna have to looka t the small distros, Damn Small Linux, Puppy, Vector, etc.
2008-02-07T07:57:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Ah, ok. DSL would probably work? I've used that for like, 10 minutes once, it seemed decent enough.
2008-02-07T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	its not bad, don't know how newb friendly it is.
2008-02-07T07:58:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Meh, I remember Firefox worked in it, hopefully Wine would to. Firefox is all that REALLY needs to work.
2008-02-07T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	yeah, i'm pretty sure it comes *out of the box* with firefox, not sure on wine.
2008-02-07T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	if you want to look at distros for the type of pc youre looking at, I'd suggest DSL, Vector, Puppy...
2008-02-07T08:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	Linuxquestions.org has subforums for all 3 of them, check them out.
2008-05-01T05:28:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	I did. 8.04 didnt work with my wireless out of the box like 7.10, and I don't know enough about Ubuntu to be bothered to fix it.
2008-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	right click, propeties, then one of hte tabs shows it.. can't remember which
2008-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	timandtom	IndyGunFreak	Ah, thanks xP Probably shoulda thought of that...
2008-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	timandtom	it happens to the best of us..
