2008-07-13T07:46:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	^^^
2008-07-13T07:46:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	You should only need to compile the iwl4956 drivers as a module.  It should not require recompiling the kernel.
2008-07-13T07:47:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	Bodsda: i know but when i try to modprobe the driver i get a error: not right symbols or something and someone told me i don't have the right libs or kernel
2008-07-13T07:48:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	you will have to compile the module specifically for your kernel, but you shouldn't need to do more than that.
2008-07-13T08:02:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	It sounds like you followed the correct steps (generically).  Have you installed the kernel headers.
2008-07-13T08:03:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	yes and yes i read the README in the driver sorce
2008-07-13T08:05:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	http://paste.ubuntu.com/26994/ is the readme
2008-07-13T08:05:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	Thank you.  I'll take a look at it now.
2008-07-13T08:10:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	any ideas ?
2008-07-13T08:12:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	as long as you have the right headers, it should proceed normally.
2008-07-13T08:12:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	yea i don't know what the problem is :(
2008-07-13T08:57:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	it's really good to have you, and I'm sorry to say that compiling kernel modules is the one thing that hasn't improved.  ;)
2008-07-13T08:57:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	lol thanks
2008-07-13T09:21:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	we use ctrl+v to paste in windows ;)
2008-07-13T09:21:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	it's not the same as selecting some text and the middle-clicking.  ;)
2008-07-13T09:23:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	i find that confusing.. i still use ctrl+cmds in linux just to get my operation f'ed up by the copy command
2008-07-13T09:23:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	selecting and middle-clicking is a different clipboard than Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V (I use both back and forth).
2008-07-13T09:24:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	try using ctrl-c and ctrl-v in terminal ;)
2008-07-13T09:25:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	If try Ctrl-Shift-C and Ctrl-Shift-V if you want to copy and paste into GnomeTerminal.  ;)
2008-07-13T09:25:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	but in fact, terminal is usually where I select/middle-click the most.
2008-07-13T09:26:00.000Z	krsnadasa	nhaines	trakinas: i some 31337 i don't copy and paste i write down what i need on a paper and then type it back in :P
2008-07-13T09:26:00.000Z	nhaines	krsnadasa	lol
