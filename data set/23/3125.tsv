2008-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	I have no idea what you are talking about lol start from the top. What is the powervault?
2008-07-19T00:24:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	i have a dell powervault storage connected to a dell poweredge server
2008-07-19T00:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	oh. How do you connect to the storage? NFS? FTP?
2008-07-19T00:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	I mean, how do you connect to it at the FS level.
2008-07-19T00:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	is the device detected? check dmesg
2008-07-19T00:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	no, use a pastebin.
2008-07-19T00:33:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	its under the name of fuhgawz in pastebin
2008-07-19T00:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	paste the link to it here.
2008-07-19T00:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	did you say its connected via PCI?
2008-07-19T00:42:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	yes, its connected via PCI
2008-07-19T00:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	sudo lspci -vv
2008-07-19T00:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	pastebin the output of that.
2008-07-19T00:46:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	http://pastebin.com/m2b60eba0
2008-07-19T00:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	iirc, you need the megaraid2 kernel module to access the device.
2008-07-19T00:49:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	so i need to recompile the kernel?
2008-07-19T00:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	probably -- or find the module and install it.
2008-07-19T00:59:00.000Z	fuhgawz	fyrestrtr	i did a modprobe megaraid, is that ok?
2008-07-19T01:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	fuhgawz	that won't do anything if the module doesn't exist. Check with lsmod
