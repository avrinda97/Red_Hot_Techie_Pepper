2005-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	Anchovie		Hey guys. I have always wondered how would you install programs with *.tar.gz format under Linux. Well what I did with this particular program is I CD'ed to it's path contains the source and I typed "./configure", and I get the error "configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
2005-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	Anchovie		See `config.log' for more details." So bascially now I'm stuck.
2005-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	you need to install the 'build-essential' package
2005-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	you can use synaptic to do that
2005-10-14T16:12:00.000Z	Anchovie	HappyFool	How would I import the package into the Synpatic Package Manager?
2005-10-14T16:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	it should be listed in Synaptic already
2005-10-14T16:14:00.000Z	Anchovie	HappyFool	Sorry I misinterpreted what you said, I'll give "build-essential" a try, thanks.
2005-10-14T16:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	have fun ;)
2005-10-14T16:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	no, you need to install development files
2005-10-14T16:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	i recommend adding the 'deb-src' entries in /etc/apt/sources.list, then doing what thoreauputic suggested
2005-10-14T16:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	or find a simpler app to compile ;). Gaim will have the gnome-libs as dependencies
2005-10-14T16:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list'
2005-10-14T16:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	install gaim-dev
2005-10-14T05:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	are you compiling gaim or a plugin?
2005-10-14T05:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	did INSTALL start with 'These are generic instructions' or similar?
2005-10-14T05:08:00.000Z	Anchovie	HappyFool	Yep, how did you know?
2005-10-14T05:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	means the authoer didn't actually write an INSTALL file ;)
2005-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	check this link: http://gaim.sourceforge.net/faq.php#q93
2005-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	link the plugin to ~/.gaim/plugins/ (you'll need to mkdir ~/.gaim/plugins first)
2005-10-14T05:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	try system -> preferences -> keyboard layout, and add a keyboard layout there
2005-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	then rightclick on a panel (bar at top or bottom), choose 'add to panel' and choose 'keyboard indicator' from the list
2005-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	Anchovie	HappyFool	K thanks, but the key board layout doesn't seem to have Asian Character supports...
2005-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Anchovie	hmm. sorry, not sure about that.
