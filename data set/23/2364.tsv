2009-04-06T06:38:00.000Z	Confuz		I'm trying to get my other computer to connect to the internet through this one
2009-04-06T06:38:00.000Z	Confuz		both are running ubuntu
2009-04-06T06:38:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	do you have a cross-over ethernet cable?  You will need that to connect one ethernet card to another directly
2009-04-06T06:39:00.000Z	Confuz	ibeekman	yes. The second one was previously connected to a seperate network that it worked fine on, but I am having difficulties setting up the network between the two PCs
2009-04-06T06:40:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	So first off you will need a cross-over cable
2009-04-06T06:40:00.000Z	ibeekman		which is different than a standard ethernet cable
2009-04-06T06:40:00.000Z	Confuz		I have a CAT5 connecting the two
2009-04-06T06:40:00.000Z	Confuz		oh
2009-04-06T06:42:00.000Z	Confuz		whats the difference between the CAT5 and a crossover cable?
2009-04-06T06:44:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	It's the way it is spliced.  A normal cat5 preserves 1:1 mapping if you will, whereas with a crossover cable at least 1 wire enters in one position and is connected to a different position on the other side
2009-04-06T06:45:00.000Z	Confuz	ibeekman	but do they connect in the same port?
2009-04-06T06:45:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	I have no idea how to splice one but if you google for it you should get instructions or just buy one (for far too much money) at a store like best buy
2009-04-06T06:47:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	so if you make your own ethernet cables you have some spool of cat5 wire and then you cut it and crimp on the plastic parts that connect to the jack.  The only difference between a crossover cable and a normal cable is the way the wire is spliced into the plastic end pieces: both types of wire will plug into ethernet jacks and look essentially the same.
2009-04-06T06:49:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	If you want to connect two machines, be they windows boxes, ubuntu boxes, xboxes, directly without a switch/hub/router you need a crossover cable.  If you have two normal cables and a switch you should be able to just plug both into the switch and be fine, but to directly connect two computers you need a crossover
2009-04-06T06:49:00.000Z	Confuz	ibeekman	I connected my xbox to my PC via a CAT5
2009-04-06T06:49:00.000Z	Confuz		is this any different?
2009-04-06T06:50:00.000Z	ibeekman		I *highly doubt* you did this and got it to work without a crossover cable
2009-04-06T06:51:00.000Z	ibeekman		so if it worked then that cable is probably a crossover.  they look just like normal cables.
2009-04-06T06:51:00.000Z	Confuz		I just know my XBOX connects fine, but the other PC doesn't
2009-04-06T06:52:00.000Z	Confuz		PS3 works too
2009-04-06T06:52:00.000Z	ibeekman		oh really... hmmm well that's news to me, don't do a whole lot of networking
2009-04-06T06:53:00.000Z	Confuz		I did discover the cable I use in my garage though, and my brother does alot of work with computers and windows, so it's possible he spliced it
2009-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	ibeekman	Confuz	take a look here.  I geuss it depends on your hardware whether or not you need a crossover cable, you should be able to google around for that.  here is a tutorial on the forms for ICS:http://preview.tinyurl.com/akxfo
