2005-04-21T13:03:00.000Z	xukun_		can anybody see this video? http://www.cbtnuggets.com/webapp/theater?op=view&id=19
2005-04-21T13:04:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	it asks for a username and password... is it free registration?
2005-04-21T13:06:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	drspin all I see is a dark screen, does not show the video, I dont know which application I need to install
2005-04-21T13:07:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	if you give me a sec I'll try to set up an account and watch the vid
2005-04-21T13:07:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	sure
2005-04-21T13:09:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	sorry, didn't work: "Totem could not play 'mms://drm.cbtnuggets.com/freevideos/cisco/osi_model.wmv?embed'."
2005-04-21T13:09:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	I've never even heard of the MSS2 codec, and I've got pretty much every codec under the sun installed
2005-04-21T13:09:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	thanks for trying
2005-04-21T13:09:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	my guess is that it has some sort of DRM that Totem can't handle (hence the drm.cbtnuggets.com address)
2005-04-21T13:10:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	you might wanna try mplayer
2005-04-21T13:11:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	it seems that is some problem installing mplayer, I have to wait untill its fixed
2005-04-21T13:12:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	weird; didn't have that problem myself. don't bother though -- I just tried it in mplayer and it just sits there like a dead fish
2005-04-21T13:12:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	I see
2005-04-21T13:16:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	if you get that working please let me now
2005-04-21T13:19:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	I'll see what I can do, but I'm pretty sure that file is DRM-restricted, and that's why it won't play
2005-04-21T13:19:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	sorry I dont know what DRM-restricted means!
2005-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	means it's got copyright protection control crap on it.
2005-04-21T13:24:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	no, sorry... it segfaults when you try to run it, or once you close the window?
2005-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	when I run it nothing happens, after 3 sec it just gives me that
2005-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	weird. do any of the OpenGL screensavers work? (e.g., AntSpotlight, Flurry, Atlantis)?
2005-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	I will try that
2005-04-21T13:27:00.000Z	xukun_	pauldaoust	no they dont
2005-04-21T13:28:00.000Z	pauldaoust	xukun_	looks like you don't have OpenGL working properly. Unfortunately I don't really use 3D much, so I never bothered to get it working... but check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to make sure the GLX extension is enabled.
