2011-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	qwebirc44173		What is the purpose of lost+found folder?
2011-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	when fsck finds file inodes for which it can not find a directory entry, it puts them in lost+found
2011-04-01T12:07:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	QQ more
2011-04-01T12:08:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	or are tired of a whiny bitch whining about it.
2011-04-01T12:09:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	called me bitch
2011-04-01T12:14:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	acpi bug, probably depends on your specific hardware. though there may be a fix in newer kernels. it's unlikely.
2011-04-01T12:18:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	sure, another distro always solves the problem
2011-04-01T12:18:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	stop with irony
2011-04-01T12:19:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	it's not too late to try another distro, right now.
2011-04-01T12:20:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	it's not too late to stop hilighting me
2011-04-01T12:22:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	what other distributions have you considered?
2011-04-01T12:27:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	it would be more helpful to have the model of the motherboard.
2011-04-01T12:28:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	already told. scroll up
2011-04-01T12:28:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	you are just trying to get a conflict not helping at all
2011-04-01T12:29:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	scrolling is hard on my finger. maybe you could just provide the model number for people who are here now instead of then.
2011-04-01T12:29:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	you were he already
2011-04-01T12:29:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	my client was here already. I was killing virtual people.
2011-04-01T12:35:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	that does seem like a software problem. maybe if we had the motherboard model, we could find the bug report on which that had been filed.
2011-04-01T12:36:00.000Z	qwebirc44173	ayecee	for the second time: amd pc chips m810lmr
2011-04-01T12:36:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	that is the first time for me. let's see what comes up.
2011-04-01T12:41:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	maybe acpi=off
2011-04-01T12:43:00.000Z	ayecee	qwebirc44173	however, I haven't found a report of that problem with a solution, I'm afraid.
