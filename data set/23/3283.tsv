2008-05-26T03:00:00.000Z	mib_ih7x99	james__	Yep, 804 isn't bad at all--my Lifebook's wifi card and graphics chipset work OOTB
2008-05-26T03:01:00.000Z	james__	mib_ih7x99	it's sad when the wi-fi works better on Ubuntu than it does on Vista

2008-05-26T03:04:00.000Z	mib_ih7x99	james__	No problem. Never know how something's hooked up :-)
2008-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	james__	mib_ih7x99	does etc/hosts work just like the lmhosts file on windows?
2008-05-26T03:08:00.000Z	mib_ih7x99	james__	I'm not sure... I think it's a similar syntax
2008-05-26T03:08:00.000Z	mib_ih7x99	james__	`man hosts' maybe?
