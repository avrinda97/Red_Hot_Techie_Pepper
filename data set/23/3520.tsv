2009-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	CorbinFox		i have a Canon MX860 printer that i want to use through the network.  there is no pdd file on the CD and i cant find one online, does anyone know how to get the postscript file for this printer? or where to find a linux driver for this?
2009-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	did you check linuxprinting ?
2009-03-30T08:11:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	the openprinting site?
2009-03-30T08:11:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	yes
2009-03-30T08:11:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	if the pdd isn't on this website, it's going to be difficult to find one...
2009-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	CorbinFox		my printer isn't even listed on this site, illovae
2009-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	whoaou...
2009-03-30T08:13:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	it lists the model just before my model, it liss the 850 but not the 860
2009-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	maybe you can try with the 850's pdd, it might work... The canon website doesn't give you the pdd for your model I guess ?
2009-03-30T08:15:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	the canon site doesnt give anything but the .exe files, and there is no pdd on the CD
2009-03-30T08:15:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	maybe you can try to extract the content of the .exe with cabextract if it work on it
2009-03-30T08:16:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	or you can try to install the .exe on a windows partition and check the installed files
2009-03-30T08:16:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	i'll try that, then i'll try the 850's pdd, and if that doesnt work then i'll return the printer and get an HP or something
2009-03-30T08:16:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	yeah ^^'
2009-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	if you can return the printer, it's a good idea I think... You know Canon and gnu/linux are not friends
2009-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	blame my folks, they wanted the canon.
2009-03-30T08:18:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	arf, I can understand that :}
2009-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	if cabextract doesn't work, you can use wine to install the .exe in your ~/.wine folder ; you'll find the installed files easier than on a windows partition ;)
2009-03-30T08:23:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	i already tried that but it needs the printer to be plugged in via usb, and the printer is in another room and i was lazy :P
2009-03-30T08:23:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	ouarf, the .exe need the printer to be plugged !!! yiark
2009-03-30T08:24:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	well, I suppose cabextract won't work then...
2009-03-30T08:25:00.000Z	CorbinFox	illovae	im using it right now, havent found anything yet tho
2009-03-30T08:26:00.000Z	illovae	CorbinFox	yep... the 'windows partition' solution is the best way I think, anyway goodluck =)
