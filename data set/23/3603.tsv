2008-03-08T20:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	HAve you posted your xorg in the pastebin?
2008-03-08T20:30:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 Nope but I can.  It's just the default xorg.
2008-03-08T20:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	I gotta go, but people will want to see it..
2008-03-08T20:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	What version of ubuntu are you using
2008-03-08T20:33:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 8.04 Alpha 6.  But I had the same problem with 7.10.
2008-03-08T20:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	You still need to be in +1 if you are using hardy
2008-03-08T20:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	If you are running Hardy...  you questions need to be asked in hardy
2008-03-08T21:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	Numbers look a bit generic, are they for your specific monitor
2008-03-08T21:19:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 yes it's for my monitor http://www.necdisplay.com/Products/Product/?Product=437c10b5-a864-4f76-a011-5113f6157940
2008-03-08T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	You just want to get rid of a mount that shows up on your desktop.. use gconf-editor
2008-03-08T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	Mounts in media will show up on the desktop
2008-03-08T22:23:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 That must be an Ubuntu thing, because default GNOME desktop does not show this media icon.
2008-03-08T22:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	If you dont want it, remove it with setting in gconf-editor  volumes_visable or close to that
2008-03-08T22:24:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 I want removeable media to show up as an icon....Just not my main hard drive.
2008-03-08T22:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	then change how it is mounted...  see man fstab
2008-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 It's my primary hard drive, it must be mounted there is no option.
2008-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	it does NOT need to be mounted in /media
2008-03-08T22:26:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 Where should it be mounted then?  Where does Debian Stable mount hard drive?
2008-03-08T22:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	Ask then.. you can create a mount point anywhere you want.. read man mount   mkdir /data/sda1         or whatever you want
2008-03-08T22:27:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 Okay got it
2008-03-08T22:36:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 I changed the location that it was mounted in from /media/sda1 to /home/woden/sda1, but I still see the icon on my desktop.
2008-03-08T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woden	did you edit fstab as well?
2008-03-08T22:36:00.000Z	woden	Jack_Sparrow	 yes I edited fstab and then restarted
