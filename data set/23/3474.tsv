2008-05-06T14:23:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	there is an ipod plugin i think you can disable in rhythmbox
2008-05-06T14:24:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	Got a link?
2008-05-06T14:28:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	in nautilus's pref, there is a tab for media. try setting the one for music player to nothing or to prompt, etc
2008-05-06T14:29:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	That doesn't work in hardy
2008-05-06T14:32:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	still there... in gconf-editor, you go to gnome, volume manager, there is an option for autorun ipod that you can change
2008-05-06T14:33:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	np. I never knew it was there. here is the link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291584
2008-05-06T14:37:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	Just won't work
2008-05-06T14:38:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	you set the value to 1 in gconf-editor? Apart from that, I'm not sure.
2008-05-06T14:39:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	I got an idea, with the autoipod_command, I removed the word rhythmbox from it
2008-05-06T14:39:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	ok
2008-05-06T14:40:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	did you uncheck it
2008-05-06T14:40:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	that should have disabled it altogether
2008-05-06T14:41:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	i guess removing rhythmbox is a good solution. did it work?
2008-05-06T14:41:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	I don't know.
2008-05-06T14:42:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	go to prompts and disable the ipod photos... maybe that will start it up too
2008-05-06T14:43:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	perhaps try that
2008-05-06T14:44:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	with the value unchecked, perhaps reboot, or at least log out and back in
2008-05-06T14:47:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	Gonna restart X
2008-05-06T14:54:00.000Z	SitUbuntuSit	smmagic	did it work?
2008-05-06T14:54:00.000Z	smmagic	SitUbuntuSit	Not the slightest bit
