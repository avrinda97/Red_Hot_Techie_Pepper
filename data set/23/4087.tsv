2007-12-16T10:01:00.000Z	vasilisa		I just got a belkin Usb transfer cable so me and my girlfriend can share files. Im on Kubuntu Gutsy and she's on Windows XP. Possible, or did we just waste money??
2007-12-16T10:01:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	Are the two computers networked?
2007-12-16T10:02:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	I have never done netwroking stuff in my life. The extent of my knowledge: we want to transfer files
2007-12-16T10:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	Are the two machines physically connected?
2007-12-16T10:02:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	Well this usb thing connects them....
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	That's not gonna work
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	but it said its a transfer cable for files o.o
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	How do the two computers connect to the internet
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	It would work if both machines used windows
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	oh. crap.
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	both are in a router
2007-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	What are the IPs of each machine?
2007-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	....
2007-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	No offense, i dont give out IPs
2007-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	In windows, do start --> run --> cmd --> ipconfig ; in ubuntu open a terminal and do ifconfig
2007-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	What do we do with the info?
2007-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	You said they're behind a router, which means they're not public IPs
2007-12-16T10:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	You enable sharing on the windows box (ask ##windows) - and then use samba to connect to the windows box in ubuntu
2007-12-16T10:05:00.000Z	vasilisa	Cpudan80	Oh okay
2007-12-16T10:06:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	In ubuntu, you'll go to places --> Network --> Go --> location --> and type smb://IP
2007-12-16T10:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	I think it's native
2007-12-16T10:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	In fact, I know it is -- it works off the live CD
2007-12-16T10:13:00.000Z	Cpudan80	vasilisa	Yes, smb://ip-of-other-machine
