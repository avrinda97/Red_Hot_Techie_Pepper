2006-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	you can't use hdparm on an sata drive
2006-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	is it hard drive speed that is slow ?
2006-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	so they say?
2006-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	no and yes
2006-05-02T08:44:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	how can I test it ? hdparm -tT is not best way to term fast or slow?
2006-05-02T08:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	hdparm doesn't work on sata drives unless your connected via the ide connection on the drive.
2006-05-02T08:45:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	ok, so how can I speed things up? Go for gentoo?
2006-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	is it jsut disk access you find slow or the entire system ?
2006-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	both
2006-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	you won't notice any difference on a Gentoo system
2006-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	are you running the 64 bit kernel ?
2006-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	Livecd is faster than this
2006-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	 32bit
2006-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	run sudo top (and see what's taking the most resources)
2006-05-02T08:48:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	top
2006-05-02T08:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	yeah
2006-05-02T08:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	did you install binary drivers for your ati card ?
2006-05-02T08:50:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	I am using fglrx, direct rendering is on
2006-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	your using the default Ubuntu kernel, not the 64 bit kernel right ?
2006-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	unforcer	LinuxJones_	K7
2006-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones_	unforcer	ok that's fine
