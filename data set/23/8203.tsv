2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_	therefore you'd preface a command with sudo to run the command as root, since many system administration tasks require root privileges

2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_	ncurses is a terminal-based library, hence it's used for command-line applications
