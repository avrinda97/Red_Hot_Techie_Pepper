2007-02-05T15:25:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	thanks
2007-02-05T15:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	audacious-media-player.org
2007-02-05T15:26:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	apt :)
2007-02-05T15:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Yeah, but its not in any edgy repos
2007-02-05T15:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Its in the fiesty repos tho...
2007-02-05T15:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	How have you installed it? From the repos?
2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	really nice player
2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Yeah. Try doing "sudo apt-get build-dep bmpx"
2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	I usually compile audacious tho...
2007-02-05T15:30:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	whats bmpx anyway?
2007-02-05T15:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Well. BMPx and Audacious are forks of BMP (beep-media-player)
2007-02-05T15:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	BMPx is run by zealot morons, is barely stable, and has basically no support (even from the devs)
2007-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	why shall i download it? :)
2007-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	You're only getting its dependencies
2007-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	I suggest you just grab the latest stable and compile tho.
2007-02-05T15:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Oh, okay. I thought you didn't have mp3 support :P
2007-02-05T15:33:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	can't i just assosiate .mp3 with audacious in some way.
2007-02-05T15:33:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	yeah i do :P
2007-02-05T15:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	Ah I misunderstood. Right click an mp3 file, go to open with > audacious
2007-02-05T15:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	mohooo	It'll select that automatically
2007-02-05T15:34:00.000Z	mohooo	Stormx2	yeah my automatic in the feature
