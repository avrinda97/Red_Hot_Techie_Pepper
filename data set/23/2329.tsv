2009-12-11T22:17:00.000Z	Moonlit		heh
2009-12-11T22:17:00.000Z	Moonlit		why does it suck, chadi?
2009-12-11T22:19:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	if someone's got physical access, you're screwed anyway :)
2009-12-11T22:19:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	not like you cant boot a live cd to get in
2009-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- my netbook has no CD drive, and I can disable booting from anything other than the HDD, usually that would be enough, with Ubuntu that's not the case, I'd have to password GRUB too
2009-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	what, disable in the bios? like the bios ever stopped anyone!
2009-12-11T22:21:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- I think there's a point being missed here though, it shouldn't be all or nothing, any protection is better than none
2009-12-11T22:22:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	none of the protection you're talking about means squat diddly to any security professional
2009-12-11T22:22:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	all you're talking about is a false sense of security
2009-12-11T22:22:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	something which i would argue is BAD
2009-12-11T22:23:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	im not a hardcore security specialist. im a student. and ive known better for ages
2009-12-11T22:24:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- I'm well aware of countless methods of compromising a machine, but it's not me doing the compromising in this case, I think privacy is a fair expectation among non-experts, and I know that wannabe hacker kids would use the recovery console as an easy trick to get access
2009-12-11T22:28:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- but my point was, if you'll excuse the analogy, a key under the doormat is not the same as a guy with a lockpick, if you leave the key under the mat (recovery console) then you give someone the tool they need to get into your house, if they bring a lockpick then there's not much you can do about that
2009-12-11T22:30:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	ah you miss the definition of secure then. secure means only that it conforms to your policy
2009-12-11T22:31:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	so if your policy disallows remote access but says nothing about physical accesss...
2009-12-11T22:31:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- I don't think my particular definition of secure is really relevant, I'm 1 single person out of many thousands who use Ubuntu alone, not to mention the rest of the Linux world
2009-12-11T22:32:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	im going by the book "Computer Security: Art and Science" by Matt Bishop
2009-12-11T22:32:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	i only said i'm not a "hardcore security professional". i have no professional certifications yet.
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- well, you'll know the difference between handing access on a plate and requiring some work, right? a script kiddy might well know about the recovery console, that's low hanging fruit, if you require some effort then some percentage of those script kiddies might be stuck
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	if your policy disallows physical root access, you could simply remove the recovery entries from the grub menu, but be aware that there are many many ways around it
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	and so itd be an incomplete implementation
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	maco	Moonlit	as i said, i dont believe a false sense of security is a good thing
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	Moonlit	maco	- but Joe Shmoe doesn't do "security"
