2011-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	aple		I know I'm reaching here, but is there any way to install Ubuntu side-by-side with Windows so I can switch back and forth between the two all willy nilly?
2011-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	aple		I know about Wubi on boot
2011-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	aple		But is there any way to set up my system so I can like Alt + Tab back and forth between Win and Ubuntu?
2011-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	you will need to reboot to get to the other OS
2011-09-06T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	you could virtualize one of the OSes in the other
2011-09-06T13:25:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	How do you virtualize? :)
2011-09-06T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	virtualbox is nice and simple
2011-09-06T13:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	running both OSes at the same times uses a lot of ram and cpu
2011-09-06T13:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	if you want native USB access then install the closed source vitualbox from the virtualbox ppa
2011-09-06T13:30:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	How much RAM/CPU we talkin' here? I've got 4GB RAM and some 2-3 yr old processor. Think I could run Ubuntu in a virtualbox from Win7 and be able to dev in Ubuntu and design in Win7 without a big hinge?
2011-09-06T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	you'll be fine then
2011-09-06T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	the host OS will obviously suffer some speed degredation but you'll be ok
2011-09-06T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	simple yet effective
2011-09-06T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	vmware also exists
2011-09-06T13:33:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	What was that bit about USB? I have an external HD I need to access frequently but probably not from Ubuntu (which would be in the virtualbox).
2011-09-06T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	then if you want access to it then you will need to add the virtualbox ppa and install the closed source one from there: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
2011-09-06T13:35:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	But I can do that from within Ubuntu's virtualbox right? Then just restart VirtualBox and it will recognize the USB?
2011-09-06T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	not sure of that, could try it. You can always add the extra software source later and install virtualbox-4.1
2011-09-06T13:54:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	So, once I make this VirtualBox, will it save it's state or do I have to do that manually? For instance, if I download a bunch of apps and such on the Ubuntu virtualbox, will they load the next time I hit "Start" or do I have to save that state lest I start off on a clean Ubuntu install every time?
2011-09-06T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	you can stop systems and save state, or you can shut them down etc. The updates and changes you make are persistent between boots
2011-09-06T13:57:00.000Z	aple	ActionParsnip	qmr: So interesting :)))
2011-09-08T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	sudo apt-get -f install   will satisfy deps
2011-09-08T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aple	http://packages.ubuntu.com     or you can search with:  apt-cache search something
