2007-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	TheLance		cant wait for it
2007-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	TheLance		edgy has been pissing me off
2007-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	TheLance		edgy got annoying real quick
2007-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	TheLance		but i will admit
2007-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	TheLance		it looks nice though
2007-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	TheLance		dapper is the better one yes
2007-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	TheLance		but edgy looks better
2007-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	TheLance		i might just upgrade to feisty tommorow
2007-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	TheLance		i'll download it right now
2007-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	TheLance		so i can install it in the morning
2007-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	i'm waiting for the featurefreeze
2007-02-02T12:59:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	if you don't know where to download it, don't download it.
2007-02-02T13:00:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	dude
2007-02-02T13:00:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	well, you could revert to dapper. dapper is LTS after all
2007-02-02T13:01:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	edgy is only four months newer than dapper. there isn't a whole lot different.
2007-02-02T13:01:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	downgrading is stupider than not being able to even reach a login screen?
2007-02-02T13:03:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	yes you can
2007-02-02T13:04:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	it pages to the root partition
2007-02-02T13:04:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	much faster
2007-02-02T13:05:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	swapping to a partition means the operating system has a dedicated chunk of space where it can scribble anywhere it wants. it doesn't have to deal with the filesystem at all.
2007-02-02T13:05:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	much faster that way.
2007-02-02T13:05:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	well you can do without if you want. you can just make a file on your ordinary partition and loopmount it as swap
2007-02-02T13:06:00.000Z	Vuen	TheLance	*sigh* that's not what makes windows slow
