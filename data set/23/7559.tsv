2005-12-11T09:12:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	ubuntu is not here.
2006-11-25T15:41:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	do you have an idea why a linux LVM partition says device already mounted or mount point busy when mount /dev/hdb1 /media/mels_backup is ran, and mount |grep hdb1 shows no output, and there are no files in /media/mels_backup?
2006-11-25T15:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	i do no use lvm myself but i have seen this errors before they went away when i disabled lvm and evms at startup but if you actually use lvm you can't do that :(
2007-01-22T16:33:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	Thanks, fixed:)
2007-01-22T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	the problem was? (out of curiosity)
2007-01-22T16:35:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/16467/comments/1 is what I tried.
2007-01-22T16:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	i suspected a corrupted db, but even when feeded with corrupted files programs shouldn't crash and the bug must be reported... (it ain't a windows program XD )

2010-02-13T04:22:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	I thought he said that...
2010-02-13T04:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	he must have misstyped channel name. he did not enter the channel
2010-03-15T23:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	mail needs a mta running or maybe some nullmailer like ssmtp or msmtp iirc
2010-04-15T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	no really. but you can maybe see the date of the oldest file in the filesystem to get a good aproximate ??
2010-04-15T19:01:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	seems like the files keep their packaging dates.
2010-04-15T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	:/
2010-04-15T19:16:00.000Z	dabaR	erUSUL	Here is what I found out: dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda1 shows certain info, and you basically run it on your / partition's /dev entry. Shows creation time, for example. But it is not like a sureshot way of telling that the root filesystem was created when the OS was installed...but works in my case.
2010-04-15T19:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	dabaR	ok ; cheers
