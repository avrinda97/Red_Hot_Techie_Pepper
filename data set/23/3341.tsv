2009-04-22T07:34:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	The installer has an option to do manual partitioning.
2009-04-22T07:34:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	You don't have to do it before you run the installer.
2009-04-22T07:35:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	I don't think we'd release something that we knew would eat Windows partitions... there is an option right in the installer to resize it.
2009-04-22T07:36:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	Why do you want to use advanced mode? If you just want to resize the Windows partition, the Ubuntu installer will ask you if you want to resize it.
2009-04-22T07:38:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	System->Administration->Partition Editor.
2009-04-22T07:38:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	Yes, it's installed by default. In System->Administration.
2009-04-22T07:40:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	Yes. Now you can tell it to resize your Windows partition.
2009-10-25T09:54:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	There is no little unlock icon along the bottom?
2009-10-25T09:54:00.000Z	ubuntu	wgrant	yes there is but it's not active
2009-10-25T09:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	wgrant	the only active buttons are help and close
2010-03-15T06:41:00.000Z	wgrant	ubuntu	Cheese
2010-03-15T06:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	wgrant	: thanks, installing now
