2008-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	fryguy	you can't get to a tty after it freezes?
2008-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	fryguy	jrib	i can get to a tty right before it freezes.
2008-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	fryguy	jrib	as soon as switch back to gui it freezes
2008-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	fryguy	so you're forced to do a hard reboot then?

2008-12-20T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	fryguy	using nv now though?
2008-12-20T03:37:00.000Z	fryguy	jrib	same behavior with nv and all 4 versions of nvidia in ubuntu
2008-12-20T03:38:00.000Z	fryguy	jrib	of note is that all 5 of those drivers work in other operating systems
2008-12-20T03:38:00.000Z	fryguy	jrib	i've gone as far as installing linuxfromscratch with an ubuntu patched kernel and the same nvidia drivers, and that works fine
2008-12-20T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	fryguy	weird, no idea
