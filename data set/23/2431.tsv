2009-08-29T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 you can run kde apps on gnome and visa versa just fine. Ive had some issues with installing the 'full' desktops however .
2009-08-29T13:53:00.000Z	perscitus	Dr_Willis	Except Kformula and Konversation cant be installed at same time
2009-08-29T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 never noticed..  never used either one. :)

2009-08-29T13:55:00.000Z	perscitus	Dr_Willis	 bug #420990
2009-11-01T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 you mean system -> preferances 'startup applications' ?
2009-11-01T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 no idea what you mean then.
2009-11-01T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 9.10 has changed to upstart for many services.. the old tools no longer work for them. so many have bveen removed.
2009-11-01T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 what service are you trying to  change anyway?
2009-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 depends on what service you are wanting to manage.. Upstart controlled ones --> alter files in /etc/init
2009-11-01T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 none for upstart that ive seen/needed
2009-11-01T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 BUM can manage the ones still managed by  the scripts in /etc/rc#.d i belive
2009-11-01T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 /etc/init/cron.conf then it looks like to me.
2009-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 you have not really said what it is you are trying to do.
2009-11-01T14:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 if you want to start/stop/restart  the cron service.. use the 'service' command ->  $ sudo service cron start
2009-11-12T22:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 about the same. its not like 64bit software compiles into bigger exe's
2009-11-12T22:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 and the 32bit extras just add a little more. my systems / are all under 6gb
2009-11-12T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 yes,
2010-01-20T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perscitus	 you mean share the internet connection?
