2006-01-11T13:11:00.000Z	vultaire		newbie question: console command to see a list of pids?
2006-01-11T13:12:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	ps
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	ps -A | grep programname
2006-01-11T13:15:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	that's a good one too
2006-01-11T13:17:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	thx
2006-01-11T13:17:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	still need help mounting that ntfs drive?
2006-01-11T13:17:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	well, er, it's mounted. i just forget how to add my username to fstab to i have access to it, right now root is only allowed.
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	imo the easiest way is to set the umask property... this is what I have in my fstab
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	mine sharing an example?
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	/dev/hda1 /media/win_c ntfs ro,umask=0222 0 0
2006-01-11T13:20:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	when did things change over from being mounted in /mnt to /media?
2006-01-11T13:21:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	dunno; I've always done mnt but breezy does media, and I didn't argue with it
2006-01-11T13:22:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	perfect, your line worked for me. thanks a lot.
2006-01-11T13:22:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	happy to help
2006-01-11T13:23:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	/dev/hdb5       /media/ntfs     ntfs    ro,umask=0222   0       0
2006-01-11T13:23:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	it's hard to remember those little things. namely.. ro,umask=0222
2006-01-11T13:24:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	I remember that one -real- well, I've done lots of dual boot configs trying out different distros, and that was a pain in the ass to set up initially
2006-01-11T13:24:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	heh, probably.
2006-01-11T13:25:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	get ps working the way you wanted?
2006-01-11T13:25:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	yeah, works great, thx
2006-01-11T13:25:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	cool. there's another prog that people like to use, it displays pids, among other things: top
2006-01-11T13:27:00.000Z	vultaire	kameron	forgot about that one, thx
2006-01-11T13:27:00.000Z	kameron	vultaire	werd
