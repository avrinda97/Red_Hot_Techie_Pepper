2010-10-28T20:05:00.000Z	goltoof		is there a way to search for repositories from cli?  ie, i'm looking for a timer applet, how do i search for all the timers out there from cl?
2010-10-28T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	apt-cache search timer
2010-10-28T20:07:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	i don't think that's possible
2010-10-28T20:08:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	  yes it does, i'm talking about cli though
2010-11-11T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	i don't know, but you could easily write a script that calls all the programs you want in a row.
2010-11-11T20:43:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	    i can't, someone else can/has I'm sure
2010-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	sure you can, it's a matter of making a text file that says #!/bin/bash on the first line, and on the lines that follow contains the names of the programs you want to run. put it in /usr/local/bin and make it executable.
2010-11-11T20:47:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	    yes i'm familiar with bash...   i mean getting each program sectioned out on one screen
2010-11-11T20:49:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	   and truncating the information i don't want to see.
2010-11-11T20:51:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	i've searched a bit, but can't see a program like that
2010-11-11T20:52:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	  maybe you know this answer..   how would i truncate the output of, say,  uptime..   so it only shows the days it's been up ?
2010-11-11T20:52:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	   not the user or load averages
2010-11-11T20:52:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	   that'd be a good first step..
2010-11-11T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	uptime | awk ' { print $3 } '
2010-11-11T20:53:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	if you want to build this yourself, i think the most useful commands you should keep in mind are awk, head, tail and cut
2010-11-11T20:54:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	     what if i only want to show the top 5 processes in top?
2010-11-11T20:54:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	     right..   still haven't gotten savvy with awk or operators
2010-11-11T20:56:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	   i think i'd be fine with a command like "summary"  that just gives me a snapshot of each thing i want to see, not realtime, for now
2010-11-11T20:57:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	"top" is not really well suited to that, but if you want to show the top 5 processes in "ps aux", then do ps aux --sort -%cpu | head -n 5
2010-11-11T20:59:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	    coool  thx....   time for a couple tutorials  :)
2010-11-19T02:42:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	there is a channel #android btw
2010-11-19T02:42:00.000Z	LjL	goltoof	yes, google "android sdk", it's in it.
2010-11-19T02:42:00.000Z	goltoof	LjL	  yea i just realized, thx
