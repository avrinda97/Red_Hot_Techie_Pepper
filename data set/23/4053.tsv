2007-11-25T07:30:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	your video card is currently being driven by the "vesa" driver
2007-11-25T07:30:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	vesa has *NO* 3D acceleration
2007-11-25T07:30:00.000Z	LtEmerpo1		so? whats that mean?
2007-11-25T07:30:00.000Z	LtEmerpo1		so im screwed..
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	oh wait, I can't read
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	looks like you do have fglrx in your config too
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	I can't tell which one is loaded though
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	LtEmerpo1		im confused..
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	even if you had fglrx working, the stable version packaged in Ubuntu does not run Compiz
2007-11-25T07:31:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	fglrx is the binary video driver from AMD for AMD/ATi video cards
2007-11-25T07:32:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	it has never run Compiz until very recently -- and that version is not packaged in Ubuntu stable
2007-11-25T07:32:00.000Z	LtEmerpo1	ephemient	i already have it clicked on.. it says its in use
2007-11-25T07:33:00.000Z	ephemient	LtEmerpo1	if you want fancy effects, Compiz on top of Xgl on top of fglrx works
