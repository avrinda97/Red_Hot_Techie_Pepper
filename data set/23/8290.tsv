2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bhsx		howdy! i just installed late last night (i was drunk/tired) and finished configuration this morning, but don't remember the passwd I setup.  What are my possible options?  boot into knoppix and chroot?
2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bhsx		anything else?
2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	_Hiro_	bhsx	boot in single mode
2004-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	bhsx		i've never used grub, can anyone help with syntax?
2004-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	bhsx		i need to reset the password
2004-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	bhsx		so i can login
2004-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	_Hiro_	bhsx	just boot in single mode and do passwd <username> :)
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	bhsx	_Hiro_	i don't know how to boot in single with grub
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	_Hiro_		in ubuntu you'll see multiple boot options
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	bhsx		i'm an unititiated LILO user
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	_Hiro_		some have (recovery mode) behind it
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	_Hiro_		ah lilo
2004-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	_Hiro_		for lilo specify linux 1
2004-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	_Hiro_		if that's still correct of course :s
2004-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	bhsx		well yeah, i KNOW how to boot single in lilo, but not grub, which is what ubuntu uses
2004-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	_Hiro_		if you'd use grub you'd have the (recovery mode) options, dont' know if the lilo boot menu has those also
2004-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	bhsx		i'll take a look at the menu boot options, thanks
2004-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	_Hiro_	bhsx	just chose a boot option with (recovery mode) like Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.8.1-2-386 (recovery mode)
2004-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	_Hiro_		that'll boot you into single mode
2004-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	bhsx		cool, thanks
2004-11-01T09:42:00.000Z	bhsx		thanks so much, that did it!!
2004-11-01T09:42:00.000Z	bhsx		didn't realize recovery mode was single, good to know, maybe they could make a note of it in the grub menu for a next release...
2004-11-01T09:46:00.000Z	_Hiro_	bhsx	if you want to see the contents of a grub menu when it comes up a boot just press "e" :)
