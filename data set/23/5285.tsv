2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		is there some sort of built in one?
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		i couldn't figure out how to do it
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		and had no keyboard to figure it out
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		gok huh, i'll try it
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		there was no way i could have installed that while my keyboard was dead though
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		couldn't type my password
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		i could have typed the command itself by copy-pasting individual characters, but couldn't have pressed enter :P
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		maybe if i could have figured out how to get the alt+f2 dialog up without a keyboard
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		it really was a dilemma :P
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		no ubottu
2008-09-25T16:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	right-click panel, Add to Panel... choose "Run Application" applet
2008-09-25T16:03:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	oh yeah, nice tip!  le-chuck, how do i run gok from a menu?
2008-09-25T16:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	There is a way to do the password without keys :)
2008-09-25T16:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	A bit contrived but... find the characters and copy/paste them into a text doc then copy them to clipboard and paste to prompt box
2008-09-25T16:07:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	i tried that, but the enter (crlf) char just shows up as a little box with numbers in it (at least in xchat)
2008-09-25T16:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	Couldn't you click the OK button in the gksu/gksudo dialog?
2008-09-25T16:08:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	i didn't have any dialog when i didn't have a keyboard, but in gok, i tried all the buttons but not a single one brought up an onscreen keyboared
2008-09-25T16:11:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	exactly, but most ubuntu users are much more friendly than users of all other distros i've been into in the past
2008-09-25T16:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	Yes, that is a key differentiator I've found
2008-09-25T16:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	As long as the shared-support ethos continues it will be good - the problem will come if large numbers of users expect others to provide help and don't give anything back in return.
2008-09-25T16:13:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	absolutely, that's why I like to hang out in the channels and help with what I can, because others have done the same for me
2008-09-25T16:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	locke	Yeah, it gets you that way :)
2008-09-25T16:15:00.000Z	locke	IntuitiveNipple	I can't help it, it would make me feel really bad to not give back at least something to the community..  even though I can be a moron sometimes, I still try to give something back
