2006-01-18T10:27:00.000Z	ITSa341		anyone willing to help me with ndiswrapper? I get an error when trying to compile from source. "make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop."
2006-01-18T10:29:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	if you *must* build it, install linux-headers($uname -r) as well as build-essential and gcc-3.4
2006-01-18T10:30:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	  thx,
2006-01-18T10:30:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	try linux-header-$(uname -r)
2006-01-18T10:45:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	I got the packages you recommended installed and all it did was change the error message. Got time to help me a bit?
2006-01-18T11:35:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	what news?  I have been away for a while
2006-01-18T11:36:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	 I got the packages you recommended and it just changed the error message
2006-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	what are you trying to build? And what is the current message?
2006-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	 the latest ndiswrapper    so I can support my dwl-g122
2006-01-18T11:39:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	I haven't needed ndiswrapper, so haven't tried building it.  You may need to set CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 before runnig the build/configure (to tell the make subsystem to use that rather than /usr/bin/gcc

2006-01-18T11:44:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	you ned to escape the space (eg 'My\ Downloads' )
2006-01-18T11:45:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	??  you mean rename the folder without the space? or some other command?
2006-01-18T11:48:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	 I wouild try  'mkdir ~/src; mv ~/My Downloads/RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.6.0 ~/src/RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.6.0 then re-run the build from there.  Directory names with spaces in them are hard to work with in Makefiles
2006-01-18T11:50:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	  I renamed the folder and it seems to be working
2006-01-18T11:50:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	that sounds promising.
2006-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	  It compiled!  I used insmod to load the module and it loaded ok
2006-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	thats great.
2006-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	hmm, but no connection
2006-01-18T12:03:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	I can't help there - the kernel module I built was the VMware drivers.
2006-01-18T14:35:00.000Z	timfrost	ITSa341	any progress?
2006-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	 I got it to start compiling but then the error just changed  I fixed that and then another error farther along
2006-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	ITSa341	timfrost	 I'm in relax mode now. I'll get back to it tomorrow
