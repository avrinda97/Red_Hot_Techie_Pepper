2009-05-27T01:54:00.000Z	buttons840		I'm trying to run "sudo chmod a=rxt D/ -R" on my thumb drive (D), but it reports operation not permitted?  Why not?
2009-05-27T01:55:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	well for starters, the directory has to come last on the cmd line
2009-05-27T01:56:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	IC, although I was able to run the command "sudo chmod u=rxt D/ -R" and it worked
2009-05-27T01:56:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	Yes, but I wonder what it did?
2009-05-27T01:58:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	sudo chmod a=rxt -R D/   - <--- what's that character?
2009-05-27T01:58:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	just a typo, that wasn't in the real command
2009-05-27T01:59:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	and when you say 'didn't work' what exactly did/didn't happen
2009-05-27T02:00:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	what kind of filesystem is it?
2009-05-27T02:01:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	it's fat32
2009-05-27T02:02:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	also, "t" is the sticky bit. Only valid for directories & executables I believe. Not even sure if it has any meaning on a fat32 fs
2009-05-27T02:02:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	let me try without that
2009-05-27T02:02:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	what effect are you trying to achieve?
2009-05-27T02:03:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	well, i'm just learning permission, so i'm playing around with making a live usb read only
2009-05-27T02:03:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	whither this server a purpose or not is irrelivent, i'm just experimenting
2009-05-27T02:04:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	you were right though, the t being applied to non-executables and non-directories appeared to be causing the error
2009-05-27T02:04:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	then I would think you'd want chmod -R a=-w D/   i.e. turn off write on all files
2009-05-27T02:05:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	thanks, you explained it well, i think i try some more things on my own
2009-05-27T02:05:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	my pleasure....
2009-07-18T07:27:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	a good secure installation shouldn't leave any tcp ports open unless it's serving something specific...
2009-07-18T07:27:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	well that's what i have, because i can't find any tcp port to approach on my own system
2009-07-18T07:28:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	that's a good thing!
2009-07-18T07:28:00.000Z	buttons840	losher	decided i would just connect to a webserver on 80
2009-09-10T05:34:00.000Z	losher	buttons840	some people are incapable/unwilling to do anything that doesn't have a GUI. I also notice nowadays that youtube has videos of things which take 20 minutes to watch, which could be written in half a page of text...
