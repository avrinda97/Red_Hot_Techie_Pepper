2006-06-13T12:12:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	mplayer is not a gui kmplayer ads a nice layer of bloat to your movie watching
2006-06-13T12:13:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	ok... and that's what I need for internet audio streams too right?
2006-06-13T12:14:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	using ubuntu or kubuntu?

2006-06-13T12:15:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	i'm hoping though to just get a direct URL so I can do it through a player
2006-06-13T12:15:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	apt-get install mozilla-mplayer i think the package is

2006-06-13T12:16:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	for internet radio stations use streamtuner it works with xmms and is very nice.
2006-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	ok... let me check that out now... thank you!
2006-06-13T12:25:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	can xmms handle asf files?
2006-06-13T12:25:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	if you have codecs installed most yes some problems with asf occationally
2006-06-13T12:26:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	i installed easyubuntu stuff, does it come with asf?
2006-06-13T12:26:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	if not, where do I get it?
2006-06-13T12:28:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	usually if you have problem it would be an issue with the w32codec package you installed but asf can mean diff formats.. are you getting an error?
2006-06-13T12:28:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	yes, it's saying that totem can't play it...
2006-06-13T12:28:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	i'm not sure how to tell firefox to open up xmms to play it though
2006-06-13T12:29:00.000Z	pike_	GoDawgs	what is the url of the asf file?
2006-06-13T12:30:00.000Z	GoDawgs	pike_	http://ccri.eonstreams.com/ccri_ca_losangeles_kfi_am.asf
