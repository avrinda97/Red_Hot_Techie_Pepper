2010-08-01T21:49:00.000Z	Euthanatos		AxeZ, some modems act as router/firewalls

2010-08-01T21:51:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	happens with chromium, chrome and firefox
2010-08-01T21:52:00.000Z	Euthanatos	woble	could be your ISP throttling traffic, unlikely to be browser related anyway
2010-08-01T21:52:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	the windows pc's work fine
2010-08-01T21:53:00.000Z	Euthanatos	woble	what's your network setup like?
2010-08-01T21:53:00.000Z	Euthanatos		i'm guessing you have a wifi router?  do you retain internet connection and only the download is stalled?
2010-08-01T21:53:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	yes, its wifi
2010-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	wifi = modem, and pc is dualboot with windows 7. windows 7 works fine
2010-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	Euthanatos	woble	you mean your routers is your modem, like a 2wire sbc or something?
2010-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	so its really an ubuntu issue, could it have something to do with the wifi encryption? its WPA-2. I also notice radio streams drop
2010-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	its a modem with wifi added. no hubs or forwarders or anything
2010-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	Euthanatos	woble	sounds like a driver issue, what's your wifi card?
2010-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	Euthanatos	woble	what's the model number on your modem/router and wifi card on your PC
2010-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	Euthanatos		and brand
2010-08-01T21:56:00.000Z	woble	Euthanatos	modem = davolink 2020 (cant do anything to it, its completely locked down by the ISP, tards)
