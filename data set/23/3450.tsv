2012-09-02T09:35:00.000Z	dos000		i hate whoever did 112.04
2012-09-02T09:35:00.000Z	dos000		:-(
2012-09-02T09:35:00.000Z	dos000		anyway ...
2012-09-02T09:37:00.000Z	dos000		and install winscp on the xp machine
2012-09-02T09:38:00.000Z	dos000		can someone tell me if the universe repository is accessible on the live cd ?
2012-09-02T09:38:00.000Z	dos000		i have a machine that is not connected to the internet
2012-09-02T09:39:00.000Z	msx	dos000	what app r u looking 4? the package set of the live image is pretty small
2012-09-02T09:39:00.000Z	dos000	msx	 ... i am looking for chntpw
2012-09-02T09:40:00.000Z	dos000	msx	i downloaded the full 12.04 desktop cd
2012-09-02T09:40:00.000Z	msx	dos000	i'm pretty sure it isn't there... you should try SystemRescCD, the damn best rescue live image of all times, Gentoo-based, very easy to use and very powerfull too
2012-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	msx	dos000	i'm sure sysresccd have that tool
2012-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	dos000	msx	does it have chntpw on it ?
2012-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	msx	dos000	pretty sure yes it does, go check it's website or head to it's irc
2012-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	dos000	msx	I also need some adaptec drivers for a HW raid ... :-(
2012-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	dos000	msx	i might have better luck with ubuntu
2012-09-02T09:42:00.000Z	msx	dos000	i'm not sure about that but since it's made to work on anything may be you're lucky
2012-09-02T09:42:00.000Z	dos000	msx	can you explain why i cant access all the packages in the live cd ???
2012-09-02T09:43:00.000Z	dos000	msx	I mean i have the full 700megs cd with me ....
2012-09-02T09:45:00.000Z	msx	dos000	dumb simple: chntpwd is an utility to change windows passwd, while it's a good tool to have in a rescue live system, the ubuntu live image is not meant for that, so expect to have only a _very_ small subset of packages available in those 700mb
2012-09-02T09:46:00.000Z	dos000	msx	bazhang .. thanks all for your great support :-)
