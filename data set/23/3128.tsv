2009-01-27T02:31:00.000Z	mattgman		I cannot see any of the pictures located on my sdb1 drive, but i know they are there because they were put in there using xp.  any help would be great
2009-01-27T02:31:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	can you see the files using nautilus?
2009-01-27T02:31:00.000Z	mattgman		negative Slart_
2009-01-27T02:32:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	do you get some kind of error message when you try? do you see anything on the drive at all? what kind of drive is it? regular ntfs? not a dynamic disk?
2009-01-27T02:33:00.000Z	mattgman	Slart_	no error messages come up, all pictures are sorted into folders, cannot see any contents, ntfs drive, 250gb in ext usb casing
2009-01-27T02:34:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	are there any errors in the syslog?
2009-01-27T02:34:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog will show you the last 20 lines
2009-01-27T02:36:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: nothing looks like an error about my pics
2009-01-27T02:37:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	ok.. try doing this.. disconnect the drive (it was an external drive, right?), open a terminal and run this "tail -f -n 0 /var/log/syslog".. now connect the drive again and check that terminal window.. you should have a couple of new lines there now.. use pastebin to paste those lines
2009-01-27T02:37:00.000Z	Slart_		!pastebin | mattgman
2009-01-27T02:43:00.000Z	mattgman	Slart_	http://pastebin.com/m5d2af9e8
2009-01-27T02:44:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	hmm.. there is an error about VCN there at the end.. that might have something to do with it..
2009-01-27T02:44:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: you want me to go further?
2009-01-27T02:44:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	have you run a chkdsk in windows on the drive?
2009-01-27T02:45:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	nah, that's alright
2009-01-27T02:45:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: nope
2009-01-27T02:45:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: how do i do a chkdsk?
2009-01-27T02:45:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	or scandisk or whatever it's called in windows
2009-01-27T02:46:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: i dont have windows on, full ubuntu
2009-01-27T02:46:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	ubuntu (or linux for that matter) doesn't come with a checkdisk utility for ntfs
2009-01-27T02:46:00.000Z	mattgman		slart_: i don't want to go back to windows, but if i must to get my pictures (use them for work)
2009-01-27T02:47:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	you might be able to access the drive from a vm.. or just find any windows computer to borrow for the time it takes to do the scandisk
2009-01-27T02:48:00.000Z	Slart_	mattgman	I'm not even sure that error is what is causing your files to disappear.. I've never seen it before though.. and googling for it seems to generate a lot of hits for threads where people are having hardware problems
