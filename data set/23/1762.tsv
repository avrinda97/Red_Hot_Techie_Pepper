2009-11-04T03:11:00.000Z	jugglerbry		have a problem with newly installed karmic, anyone help ?
2009-11-04T03:13:00.000Z	jugglerbry		just installed karmic onto compaq desktop pc.  boots up ok, connects to wireless, but then afterabout a minute or two freezes and have to turn it off
2009-11-04T03:13:00.000Z	jugglerbry		worked fine with jaunty
2009-11-04T03:14:00.000Z	jugglerbry		poland ? any ideas ?
2009-11-04T03:15:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	does this happen only when you connect to wireless ?
2009-11-04T03:18:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	then do lspci | grep Wireless , then do a search with <Wireless card short name/model #> Karmic, see if anyone is having similar problems
2009-11-04T03:25:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	: thanks for that.  just tried to boot it again, but froze almost as soon as it loaded.  dont think it's wireless related now as i didnt allow it to connect
2009-11-04T03:31:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	if you can get enough time on it without crashing, do "dmseg | grep error" to look for errors, or do "pastebinit /var/log/messages" and paste the url here or in the forums for others to see it. If it doesn't give you enough time, try booting with a live CD, and then do the same using /media/<drivename>/var/log/messages
2009-11-04T03:32:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	thanks will do
2009-11-04T03:33:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	you said it freezes, does Alt+Ctrl+F2 get you to a terminal?
2009-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	you sure you didn't forget the "/" in "/var/log/messages" ?
2009-11-04T03:44:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	went via places/filesystem then looked in /var/log then found nothing relating to messages
2009-11-04T03:48:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	ok , try "sudo apt-get install pastebinit" then "pastebinit dmesg" and copy down the URL
2009-11-04T03:49:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	thank you, i'll do that now if i can.  brb
2009-11-04T03:54:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	it's getting surprisingly worse.  cant even click 'applications' or wont let me do anything unless i enter keyring for network manager. as soon as i do this, it freezes, or even before i enter anything.
2009-11-04T03:55:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	I'll reinstall 9.04 and see if the same thing happens, which will be interesting, as 9.04 worked fine before i reinstalled
2009-11-04T03:55:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	was 9.10 a fresh install or an upgrade?
2009-11-04T03:56:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	fresh install using the whole of the hard drive
2009-11-04T03:57:00.000Z	hassanakevazir	jugglerbry	hmm, so it has some serious issues out of box, thats pretty bad. you could try to boot into recovery mode. but never mind, if it was a fresh install, then somethings really wrong there
2009-11-04T03:58:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	yup, thats what i thought.  i'll try reinstalling karmic just in case and see what happens, if i dont get any luck, i'll try 9.04 again
2009-11-04T03:58:00.000Z	jugglerbry	hassanakevazir	thanks anyway :)
