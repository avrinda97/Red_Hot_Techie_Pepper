2011-03-27T17:08:00.000Z	B9		why wont my flash drive mount,  it says it already is when i do the sudo command, but damned if i can find how to open the contents in a graphical user interface... i am a poweruser, why does linux start doing really KOOKY things?
2011-03-27T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	B9	« mount » should show you where it is mounted
2011-03-27T17:10:00.000Z	B9	jrib	i am getting all these error messages when i do the "mount" command
2011-03-27T17:11:00.000Z	jrib	B9	share :)

2011-03-27T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	B9	http://paste.ubuntu.com
2011-03-27T17:14:00.000Z	B9	jrib	this is the link of the pastebin http://paste.ubuntu.com/586127/
2011-03-27T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	B9	yes, those aren't errors. Can you pastebin your attempt (including the output) at mounting your flash drive?
2011-03-27T17:18:00.000Z	B9	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/586128/
2011-03-27T17:19:00.000Z	B9	jrib	"http://paste.ubuntu.com/586128/"
2011-03-27T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	B9	did you sort out your flash issue?
2011-03-27T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	B9	your earlier pastebin shows you trying to mount /dev/sda1.  That's definitely not your flash drive
2011-03-27T18:21:00.000Z	B9	jrib	i just don't understand why when i plug it in sometimes it discovers and then other times it doesn't it is so fickle
2011-03-27T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	B9	check dmeg when it fails to mount when you plug it in if you want  to investigate
2011-03-27T18:24:00.000Z	B9	jrib	dmeg? or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg
2011-03-27T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	B9	I meant "dmesg", typo
2011-03-27T18:27:00.000Z	B9	jrib	most commandline is gobbleygook to me but i bumble my way thru http://paste.ubuntu.com/586143/
2011-03-27T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	B9	/dev/sdb1 is what you should be trying to mount
2011-03-27T18:30:00.000Z	B9	jrib	it says it is already mounted, but when i go into the "media" folder i cant find it :-(  i need a gui
2011-03-27T18:36:00.000Z	jrib	B9	you should pastebin your attempt at mounting it
2011-04-18T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	B9	this is #ubuntu
2011-04-18T16:47:00.000Z	B9	jrib	i know, i am in #yellowdog as well, i was just hoping someone may know :-S
2011-05-11T16:49:00.000Z	B9	jrib	thanx
