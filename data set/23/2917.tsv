2008-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		Is there a way to install Windows XP Pro on a machine that only has Ubuntu on it without having to reformat and start from scratch?
2008-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zetheroo-ubuntu	you can resize partitions with gparted, then when you have free space, install xp to that gap
2008-10-08T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zetheroo-ubuntu	you will need to reinstall grub though as xp will write the bootsector with its own
2008-10-08T15:45:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	ActionParsnip	: so thats all? ...
2008-10-08T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zetheroo-ubuntu	yeah
2008-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	ActionParsnip	: but how can I resize the partition when I am booted into it?

2008-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	ActionParsnip	 : but its used to be in the ubuntu repos ....
