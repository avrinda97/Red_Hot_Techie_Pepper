2009-08-22T14:58:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	leaf-sheep, llutz: I can hibernate on Windows (Fn+F1), if that's what you're asking. So I should make all 4 partition areas EXT2? Including /swap and the boot booster? I'm on a netbook (eee pc 1005ha, if that helps)
2009-08-22T14:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 depends on your needs.. my netbook just has --->   (restore partition) (windows, ntfs) (linux ext4) (swap parittiion)
2009-08-22T15:00:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	llutz: What do you mean by "depends on your needs"? I dont
2009-08-22T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 what I NEED is not what you need.....   I find a single / prtition works just fine.
2009-08-22T15:03:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	Okay, "/swap" for hibernation, should it be ext4 or "swap area"? Or another "use as"?
2009-08-22T15:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 you dont understand how linux uses 'swap' - Linux uses a swap partition. its NOT ext2/3/4 its 'swap'
2009-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 use it as swap. 4gb is a bit HUGE.....
2009-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 i only use 512mb
2009-08-22T15:06:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	Currently 1GB, but will be upgrading to 2GB in the near future.
2009-08-22T15:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 then you proberly can make due with 2gb swap
2009-08-22T15:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 ive had so many other issues with hibernate/suspend - i never use the feature any more
2009-08-22T15:09:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	leaf-sheep, llutz: Okay, I'm not using hibernation. Seems much trouble than it's worth.Do I still need a /swap then?
2009-08-22T15:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 use 512mb swap then  at least.
2009-08-22T15:11:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	leaf-sheep, llutz: For the "Location for the new partition" do I select Beginning or End? Or does it not matter?
2009-08-22T15:14:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	leaf-sheep, llutz: How much GB would you recommend /boot be? 1GB?
2009-08-22T15:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 i dont bothe rwith its own /boot parittion
2009-08-22T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 i use a partition for /, and perhaps one for /home and swap. thats it.
2009-08-22T15:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 you DONT need a /boot partition.. it can put a /boot directory on the / parittion and work just fine
2009-08-22T15:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 thats the big 'differance' a /boot partition  :) which in some cases is handy..
2009-08-22T15:29:00.000Z	chrisss9	Dr_Willis	And would you recommend having a /boot? And how many GBs? 1?
2009-08-22T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 i said you dont need a /boot partition.
2009-08-22T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 and 100mb is plenty for most people.
2009-08-22T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrisss9	 let me repeate.. you most likely do NOT need a /boot partition.
