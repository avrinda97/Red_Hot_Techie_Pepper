2010-02-17T10:42:00.000Z	ocean_		nplcl: not sure what you mean? I have 2 laptops, one installed on internal HDD (using it to talk right now), the other one does not have an internal HDD, was trying to use the portable one instead
2010-02-17T10:44:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: the one without an internal HDD until all went wrong, then the one working to see if I could actually format it and start anew (did not work)
2010-02-17T10:46:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	so you were never using the external for anything else?
2010-02-17T10:47:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: no, it's brand new, bought it 3 days ago
2010-02-17T10:47:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: am trying right now to boot the laptop on the live CD and unmount the portable HDD from it... hope it works
2010-02-17T10:48:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	alright
2010-02-17T10:49:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	though which stage did the install fail?
2010-02-17T10:51:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: after I had determined the new partition table and while writing (maybe 5 minutes ahead into the process)
2010-02-17T10:52:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: OK, now it seems I am able to unmount the file system and actually delete the partition
2010-02-17T10:53:00.000Z	ocean_		Could there be something wrong with the ISO live CD? I used it successfully once before (for the laptop I am using to write this)
2010-02-17T10:54:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	I would try again, if the CD boots it's probably working fine
2010-02-17T10:55:00.000Z	npc1		ocean_:try again, as in installing
2010-02-17T10:55:00.000Z	ocean_		npcl: doing it right now (fingers crossed... tx!)
2010-02-17T10:56:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	np I've had similar errors but it's odd to me you would get those on a new drive
2010-02-17T10:57:00.000Z	npc1		so anyone here know anything about alsa?
2010-02-17T10:58:00.000Z	ocean_	npc1	it is still under warranty (had them confirm I could use it for linux before I bought it) so if smthg is wrong with it I'm happier finding it right away. Thanks!!
2010-02-17T10:59:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	if there's a newer version of the installer (you said you used that Cd once before?) then I would also try that
2010-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	ocean_	npc1	what do you mean by "installer" ? I downloaded the ISO about 1 week ago, would it be already outdated?
2010-02-17T11:04:00.000Z	npc1	ocean_	Yea, I call it an installer/installation disc because I'm weird, but it sounds like how you the latest one. I find different distros and versions have different problems and recognize drives better than others.
2010-02-17T11:04:00.000Z	npc1		you have*
2010-02-17T11:06:00.000Z	ocean_	npc1	Ah, OK, thanks!
2010-02-17T11:07:00.000Z	npc1		militantPotato: nope
2010-02-17T11:19:00.000Z	ocean_	npc1	OK it failed again, this time I can see the error window as I write: it says the installer encountered an error copying files to the HD (it was at 35% completion) and it states an [Errno 5] Input/Output error
