2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	the "winking" is caused by gnome panel constantly terminating and being restarted. compare the pids of gnome-panel in your paste
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	k I'll check
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	when I killall gnome-panel it doesn't come back
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	and dialogs that I can get to come up work fine (like power off dialog)
2009-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	have you tried running gnome-panel from the commandline?
2009-05-09T04:08:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	when I killed it and tried to run it from tty1, DISPLAY wasn't set
2009-05-09T04:08:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	dunno the default display
2009-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	run it from a terminal in gnome
2009-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	how can I get a terminal in gnome :(
2009-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	dunno the necessary hotkeys to do that without using the menus
2009-05-09T04:11:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	so start gnome, killall gnome-panel, then switch to a tty console, type export DISPLAY=:0.0 and then gnome-terminal
2009-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	thanks
2009-05-09T04:15:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	error message along the line of "undefined symbol: g_mount_is_shadowed"
2009-05-09T04:16:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	please give the complete error message
2009-05-09T04:17:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	"gnome-panel: symbol lookup error: gnome-panel: undefined symbol: g_mount_is_shadowed"
2009-05-09T04:23:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	any idea? :(
2009-05-09T04:25:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	that means one of the libraries in ldd $(which gnome-panel) is too old or broken in some other way
2009-05-09T04:25:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	okay
2009-05-09T04:26:00.000Z	nog_lorp	hbekel	google turns up gnome library GIO, "index of new symbols in 2.20"
2009-05-09T04:27:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	that means that a function called g_mount_is_shadowed from the GIO library is missing, you'll need to update/reinstall the library that provides this
2009-05-09T04:37:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	try upgrading/reinstalling libglib2.0-0
2009-05-09T06:29:00.000Z	hbekel	nog_lorp	 strings /usr/lib/libgio-2.0.so | grep g_mount_is_shadowed
