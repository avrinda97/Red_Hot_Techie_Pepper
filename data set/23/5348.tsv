2006-12-20T17:25:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		some keeps trying to give me a file transfer. Is there a way to turn those off? (I'm using GAIM)
2006-12-20T08:46:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		I know I can use top to see cpu usage of my processes, but whats the best way to see how much memory each of the running processes are using?
2006-12-20T08:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	top again
2006-12-20T08:47:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	I tried looking for that in the manual 'cause i figured it might do it, but I got lost :(
2006-12-20T08:47:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	top has it under %MEM
2006-12-20T08:48:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	but how do I make it sort by mem?
2006-12-20T08:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	you can't have it sorted -- because its varying every nanosecond
2006-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	but it could be averaged out...
2006-12-20T08:50:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	System monitor panel will say how much is used overall...
2006-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	why dont you get a docklet that displays memusage -- that way you dont have to have top open
2006-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	I do, but when my usage is high, it doesn't tell me which prog is using the most!
2006-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	so I close the most common culprits until I hit the right one (Firefox with a ton of tabs, or rythmbox that has been running for a week, etc...)
2006-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	:)
2006-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	sounds so like me
2006-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	gnome-system-monitor
2006-12-20T10:03:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	sorry for the delayed response. system-monitor doesn't tell you how much memory you have in your system just the percentage used. same with cpu
2006-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	I think you might need to enable more fields for process view  -- edit > preferences -- the system monitor does display quite a bit of information about processes
2006-12-20T10:15:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	yeah, but I want to see how much is installed in the system overall, not per process (this is separate from what I what I was looking for before)
2006-12-20T10:17:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	many times I run the liveCD on a computer either given to me, or the people don't know what they own, and it would be cool to see how much mem is installed and the processor
2006-12-20T10:17:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	the system tab on my system monitor tells me how much RAM and CPU i have -- but i'm running feisty -- so that could be it
2006-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	FlyingSquirrel32	you could always do this -- cat /proc/meminfo /proc/cpuinfo
2006-12-20T11:15:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	yeah, I don't have a system tab, just processes, rescources, and filesystems. perhaps I'll have to wait till april.
2006-12-20T11:18:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	un_operateur	thanks for showing me /proc/. I didn't know that was there
