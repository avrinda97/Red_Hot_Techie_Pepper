2008-02-13T06:34:00.000Z	_Lucretia_		my samsung yp-p2 mp3 player isn't being recognised by gutsy via mtp-detect, but it is being shown by lsusb. How can I get it to work, I've added a line to libmtp.rules
2008-02-13T06:36:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	you mean that you can transfer files through nautilus but would like to do it with mpt?
2008-02-13T06:37:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	no, i'm just charging the thing up now, but mtp-detect doesn't detect it
2008-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	actually, is it supposed to be supported by mtp? did you check that libmtp can recognise your device?
2008-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	yes it is listed
2008-02-13T06:41:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	oh, ok. What application did you try it with?
2008-02-13T06:41:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	mtp-detect
2008-02-13T06:42:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	like i said
2008-02-13T06:45:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	do you have an mtp based player?
2008-02-13T06:45:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	hmmmm. I don't know what else you can do. Although it is not recognized by mtp-detect, did you try it with Rhythmbox and what happens?
2008-02-13T06:45:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	eh, no, I have an iPod.
2008-02-13T06:45:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	I have enabled the mtp plugin in rhythmbox, but I can't see anything that relates to mtp, confused
2008-02-13T06:46:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	yes, so neither Rhythmbox can see it.
2008-02-13T06:46:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	doesn't look like it
2008-02-13T06:47:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	should it give some extra menus or something?
2008-02-13T06:47:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	it is supposed that if you enable the mtp plugin, your device should appear in Rhythmbox when you connect it
2008-02-13T06:48:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	could it be a charging thing? I'm charging now
2008-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	I think since your device is recognized as a usb device by ubuntu it can be charged. i think that it's independent of the mtp problem
2008-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	it seems that udev has worked and mounted it tho, I do have /dev/libmtp-6-1 & /dev/libmtp-usbdev6.2
2008-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	ok. do you think a mtp specific app that gnomad2 will help? I don't know what else you can do with mtp
2008-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	i think i'll wait till it's charged and see what to do next
2008-02-13T06:55:00.000Z	kostkon	_Lucretia_	ok. sorry I couldn't really help you!
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	kostkon	thanks anyway, i'll prolly see how it goes tomorrow
