2011-11-23T06:31:00.000Z	blistovmhz		ubnt 11.10 alternate installer fails to write grub back to discs.  mdadm 4d-raid5 with lvm on top.
2011-11-23T06:32:00.000Z	blistovmhz		grub-install /dev/sd{a..d} - /usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: Your core.img is unusually large.  It won't fit in the embedding area..
2011-11-23T06:32:00.000Z	blistovmhz		/usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required when the root device is on a RAID array or LVM volume.
2011-11-23T06:32:00.000Z	blistovmhz		idea's?
2011-11-23T06:32:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	you using EFI?
2011-11-23T06:34:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	?
2011-11-23T06:35:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	what's EFI?
2011-11-23T06:36:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	Apple computer?
2011-11-23T06:36:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	no.
2011-11-23T06:37:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	big scary desktop.  had 10.10 installed fine.  my raid has been assembled for years and i've  booted off it for the past 2 years without any problems.  installed 11.10 today on another LV but the grub installation failed with an unknown error.  manually booted into the new installation to run grub-install manually.
2011-11-23T06:38:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	change FS or anything?
2011-11-23T06:38:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	no other changes.
2011-11-23T06:39:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	yea... holy fuck though.
2011-11-23T06:39:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	yeah, welcome to GRUB2
2011-11-23T06:39:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	that's a HUGE move.
2011-11-23T06:40:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	probably take you longer to figure out what all you can remove from the core.img
2011-11-23T06:40:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	I agree, but why doesn't 3794 fit?  that does not compute.
2011-11-23T06:43:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	i've never used gparted, but I don't want to do this whole thing manually.  is gparted solid?
2011-11-23T06:43:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	it's the most popular GUI partition manager, bar none
2011-11-23T06:44:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	I don't know how LVM works though
2011-11-23T06:44:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	doesn't look like it knows how to deal with lvm on mdadm
2011-11-23T06:45:00.000Z	reisio	blistovmhz	probably talk to #grub or ##linux
2011-11-23T06:47:00.000Z	blistovmhz	reisio	thank you sir.  will see what i can do.  probably just chainload it.
