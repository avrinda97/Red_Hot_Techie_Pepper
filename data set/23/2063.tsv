2009-07-16T12:35:00.000Z	daycreature		just tells me what i already know
2009-07-16T12:35:00.000Z	daycreature		that it was reclassified, it doesn't say why
2009-07-16T12:35:00.000Z	daycreature		and i think it's just bots in there
2009-07-16T12:36:00.000Z	daycreature		<grawity> ActionParsnip: But Pidgin for IRC... not very sane.
2009-07-16T12:36:00.000Z	daycreature		I use x-chat.
2009-07-16T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	then use it
2009-07-16T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	"daycreature: Damn I wish I could download torrents on my linux box"
2009-07-16T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	why would we do that?
2009-07-16T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	weirdest thing i ever heard
2009-07-16T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	tried restarting networking instead?
2009-07-16T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	tried restricting your torrent download speed in the app
2009-07-16T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	so even if yo restrict it to say 20k/s you get no web browsing?
2009-07-16T12:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	does it stop all network connectivity? Can you ping web addresses? Can you run apt-get upgrade etc and the files come down?
2009-07-16T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	can you do other web stuff, except web browse while torrents run
2009-07-16T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	thos are all in a web browser
2009-07-16T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	you are missing the point
2009-07-16T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	can you ping while torrents run? Can you chat using a chat client while torrents run?
2009-07-16T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	thats what i meant, the big list of stuff you can't do is all use in the same browser and you told us that doesnt work, so we needed to know if other apps work which we now know doesnt also.
2009-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	when it dies, run a terminal and type:   dmesg | tail
2009-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	then give us the output
2009-07-16T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	in a pastebin of course ;)
2009-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daycreature	we only need the lines after the crash
2009-07-16T16:02:00.000Z	daycreature	ActionParsnip	(or anyone), after I have installed LAMP how do I test that SQL is working, and how do I access and use the server
