2007-01-11T06:03:00.000Z	Salvar		Are there different rooms in this channel, or is it just a big free-for-all?
2007-01-11T06:03:00.000Z	Salvar		Aww.
2007-01-11T06:04:00.000Z	Salvar		I feel like a stock market trader.
2007-01-11T06:04:00.000Z	Salvar		Okay, see if anyone recognizes my problem. My scroll wheel suddenly controls back/forward, and my back/forward (thumb) buttons control scrolling.
2007-01-11T06:05:00.000Z	Salvar		I suspect it may have happened when I installed imwheel, but I followed the directions.
2007-01-11T06:06:00.000Z	Salvar		Anyone?
2007-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	Salvar		C'mon.
2007-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	Salvar		Anyone want to help convert a Windows power-user?
2007-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	there are button mappings in xorg.conf
2007-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	I don't know if they will solve that problem.. but you can try switching them around..
2007-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	I don't know what they represent either..  I just use the default buttons
2007-01-11T06:10:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	oh.. wait. .hold on
2007-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	    Option         "Buttons" "7"
2007-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	Zaxismapping is the wheel.. try changing the numbers there
2007-01-11T06:12:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	one gives you a graphical prompt.. a dialog box.. the other is console only
2007-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	yes, they do.. but one is console based.. the other gnome based
2007-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	or at least x based
2007-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	just restart gnome
2007-01-11T06:14:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	yes.. ctrl+alt+backspace restarts gnome
2007-01-11T06:19:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	nice
2007-01-11T06:21:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	no idea.. haven't missed it
2007-01-11T06:23:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	check the fstab.. it's one of the options there
2007-01-11T06:38:00.000Z	Slart	Salvar	I think there's a little customization in preferences, mouse.. but only size and shadow  I think
