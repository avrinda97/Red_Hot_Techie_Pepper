2010-11-09T12:16:00.000Z	brahmana		hi all
2010-11-09T12:17:00.000Z	brahmana		I am running 10.04 in vmware but the keyboard mapping has gone haywire
2010-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	yeah, that's a bug. The only work around I've found for it is to install with alternate disk
2010-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	you're on a laptop, right?
2010-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	yes
2010-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	It worked well on two other laptops.
2010-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	I copied the VM to this laptop and its gone haywire
2010-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	hrm, don't know.
2010-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	btw, I did not understand what you meant by the "alternate disk install". What was that?
2010-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	it's another method of installing Ubuntu.
2010-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	A link or some such info which I can read up?
2010-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download
2010-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	You basically mean Easy Install creates this problem?
2010-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	yep
2010-11-09T12:24:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	And to be absolutely honest, I haven't personally taken the time to hack the easy install script to fix it
2010-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	ok..
2010-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	so, no way to fix my current installation?
2010-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	Hell, I'm just now downloading the new version of VMware Workstation that works with Mav and I've had Mav installed for months already.
2010-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	Because there is a lot of data in there
2010-11-09T12:26:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	I'm sure there my be, I just don't know it yet since I've not taken the time to explore.
2010-11-09T12:26:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	Ok.
2010-11-09T12:27:00.000Z	brahmana	syn-ack	thanks for the info.. and any more suggestions are definitely welcome.
2010-11-09T12:27:00.000Z	syn-ack	brahmana	I'll let you know what I figure out when I get the time
