2005-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	Xnalz		second is when everythign whent to hell in a hand basket
2005-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	Xnalz		third time was all crazy
2005-06-16T12:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	is it a downloaded one?
2005-06-16T12:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	were you prompted to reboot for the second stage of the install?
2005-06-16T12:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	I think you need to start again: something odd happened - for instance you should never have got a root prompt
2005-06-16T12:37:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	ok
2005-06-16T12:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	what hardware is this? RAM? CPU?
2005-06-16T12:38:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	ram: 192mb or something odd like that. CPU= 800mhz
2005-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	OK that should be enough
2005-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	where did you read these "instructions" of which you speak ?
2005-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	i just meant that I whent along with the on screen prompts, looked for instruction but couldn't find any
2005-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	there are two phases - you should be prompted to reboot after the first phase, then the rest of the install should proceed
2005-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	first phase was fine
2005-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	hmm
2005-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	tried installing three times
2005-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	well, it's odd - i don't know what the problem is then
2005-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	first time in the second stage it stoped whne it was messing with open office, same with second time
2005-06-16T12:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	are you sure the CD is OK ?
2005-06-16T12:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	md5sum OK?
2005-06-16T12:44:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	ni what that is
2005-06-16T12:45:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	was told to burn at a slower speed trying a fresh install on the new disc, was burnt at 4x
2005-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	Xnalz	thoreauputic	how do I know if the md5sum is ok?
2005-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Xnalz	the md5 number should be on the server you downloaded from
