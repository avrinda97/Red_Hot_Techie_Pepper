2004-12-19T12:10:00.000Z	JDahl		isnt that run at 00:03 every night ?
2004-12-19T12:10:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	yes
2004-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	works fine here.
2004-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log on a paste web site
2004-12-20T11:00:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	I am in console mode... but I get a weird output in .xsession-error ('X' itself comes up fine, so does the gdm chooser - it is the xsession that seems to hang)
2004-12-20T11:54:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	what seemed to lock gnome during start was that gnome-menus was not installed - there was a dependecy conflict with kdelibs+friends.. after I unstalled them and installed gnome-menus everything is fine
2004-12-27T07:06:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	isnt highmem support enabled by default? and for debian also?
2004-12-27T07:07:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	for non -386, yes, but that's irrelevant for huttan, who compiled his own kernel
2005-01-10T11:27:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	no it's not... mplayer is the best... and emacs is better than vim
2005-01-10T11:28:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	I follow you up til em^H^HI won't utter such blasphemy
2005-01-20T14:38:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	both the cedega and point2play*debs installs fine.
2005-03-23T08:31:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	not in time for Hoary, no.
2005-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	it's being processed. There are still a bundle of python packages to transition to 2.4
2005-03-24T08:39:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	I'm referring to python-matplotlib
2005-03-24T08:40:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	hence my reference then to the python transition
2005-03-24T08:40:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	oh - ok
2005-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	it's good to be knowledgable about those three at least
2005-07-18T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	depends where you work :)
2005-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	I really hope you're joking
2005-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	yeah... actually it did seem abit rude :S
2005-08-12T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	I wouldn't say that they don't care about it, but have you provided enough debugging info for them?
2005-08-12T13:31:00.000Z	JDahl	crimsun	there was rants after rants about it one year ago Debian lists
2005-09-29T13:47:00.000Z	crimsun	JDahl	multiverse's flashplugin-nonfree
