2005-09-26T06:44:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	from memory it's not quite that simple.
2005-09-26T06:44:00.000Z	Whistler	nathan_	?
2005-09-26T06:46:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	you (at least used to) have to know the ranges of both for the monitor that you're using
2005-09-26T06:47:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	Although, looking at my xorg.conf, I think that HorizSync is the one that you want
2005-09-26T06:50:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	you should just be able to restart X.  logout and select restart X server if you're using gdm/kdm (or press ctrl + alt + backspace, if you don't mind losing your session)
2005-09-26T06:51:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	that's a really good move (gnome screeen resolution)
2005-09-26T06:54:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	you were lucky :)
2005-09-26T06:55:00.000Z	Whistler	nathan_	thx for help

2005-09-26T07:51:00.000Z	Whistler	nathan_	thx a lot
2005-09-26T07:56:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	download the macromedia installer, then copy libflashplayer.so to ~/lib/opera/plugins/
2005-09-26T07:57:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	lesshaste's thing will probably work too

2005-09-26T08:13:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	/home/<username>/lib/opera/plugins (~ is a shortcut to your home directory)
2005-09-26T08:15:00.000Z	Whistler	nathan_	there is no lib folder in my home
2005-09-26T08:18:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	in preferences --> advanced --> content --> Plug-in options...  what is your plug in path?
2005-09-26T08:19:00.000Z	nathan_	Whistler	then try putting it in /usr/lib/opera/plugins then
