2004-10-26T07:01:00.000Z	DXT		is there a gui services editor in ubuntu (dont remember where i saw one.. mebbe suse/mandrake)? im just looking how to check what services run on startup
2004-10-26T07:03:00.000Z	DXT		and another thing, can i configure gnome to react to search-by-typing? (for example in an icon list, when i press k it goes to the first icon beginning with k..)
2004-10-26T07:04:00.000Z	DXT		thanks both
2004-10-26T07:04:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	it does automaticly jump to the first one with k, atleast in icons mode.
2004-10-26T07:05:00.000Z	DXT	tolle_	it does not react to any keys at least on my gnome..
2004-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	strange..
2004-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	DXT		it was always like that in gnome i think.. i just wondered if i can configure it otherwise..
2004-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	DXT		it only works in nautilus
2004-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	DXT		at least for me
2004-10-26T07:07:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	ah, you want it to work in the filechooser?
2004-10-26T07:07:00.000Z	DXT		that too
2004-10-26T07:07:00.000Z	DXT		can it be done?
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	I do not think GTK supports it yet.
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		gah.
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	press ctrl + l
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	and start typing the folder name.
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		i know this one
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		:)
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		but i hate the new filechooser
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		why no simple browsing
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		why
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	DXT		:|
2004-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	tolle_	DXT	I love it, easier to browse different gnome-vfs controlled filesystems.
