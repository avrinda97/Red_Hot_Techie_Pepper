2006-01-01T13:14:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	i get this mount: special device /dev/hdc does not exist
2006-01-01T13:14:00.000Z	intelikey		fr figures.   that's udev for you.....
2006-01-01T13:15:00.000Z	fr		huh? don't know what udev is. how do i fix it?
2006-01-01T13:16:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	can you elaborate plz?
2006-01-01T13:17:00.000Z	intelikey		fr i don't know the 'right' way but sudo MAKEDEV cdrom   and edit the /etc/fstab  line that says /dev/hdc to say /dev/cdrom  will probably work.....  and i make no promices
2006-01-01T13:18:00.000Z	intelikey	acetech	nope
2006-01-01T13:19:00.000Z	intelikey	acetech	all the archive will have in it is one device inode  :)
2006-01-01T13:19:00.000Z	intelikey		and it is probably a symlink lol
2006-01-01T13:19:00.000Z	fr		intellikey: do i make one /dev/cdrom0 other /dev/cdrom1 right?
2006-01-01T13:20:00.000Z	intelikey		fr yes if the devices exist.   test with  'ls /dev/cdrom* '
2006-01-01T13:21:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	mount: special device /dev/hdc does not exist :/
2006-01-01T13:21:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	sorry mount: special device /dev/cdrom0 does not exist
2006-01-01T13:22:00.000Z	intelikey	acetech	first of all you will have to mount the partition/s some place then make a tarball of that directory.  but you also need to be in the dir unless you want problems restoring ....
2006-01-01T13:24:00.000Z	intelikey		fr without loading ubuntu on this system and searching for the actual device  the best i can hope to do for you is guess.    fr do a 'sudo fdisk -l '   and see what the names of the hard drive devices are.
2006-01-01T13:25:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	it just shows my 4 hard drives..
2006-01-01T13:26:00.000Z	intelikey	acetech	if you have partition to backup mounted on /media/backup   then do this  'cd /media/backup ;tar -czvf /address_to_storage_space/backup.tar.gz *
2006-01-01T13:26:00.000Z	intelikey		fr yes but are they /dev/hda?   and so on ?
2006-01-01T13:27:00.000Z	fr	intelikey	yea there is hda and hdb, then my 2 sata's which showup improperly but thast another issue :)
