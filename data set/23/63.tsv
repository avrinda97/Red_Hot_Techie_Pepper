2012-09-14T13:02:00.000Z	Nordom		anyone have sound problems with ubuntu 12.04?
2012-09-14T13:03:00.000Z	Nordom		I started using ubuntu a few days ago, and I noticed that my sound sounds choppy or stutters. When I boot into win7 I have no problems, anyone have any ideas? I am using an asus mb and seems asus doesnt play nice with linux
2012-09-14T13:05:00.000Z	Nordom		really? had problems on both pc's that I installed ubuntu on and both seemed to be related because they  stemmed from asus mb... but I did fix the problems eventaully
2012-09-14T13:06:00.000Z	Nordom		 Anyways, does anyone else have choppy or stuttering sound in 12.04 and if so how would I go about fixing it? Google answers havent given any precise answers
2012-09-14T13:07:00.000Z	Nordom		when sound starts playing its choppy and stutters after a little bit its audioable but still not as clear as when I am booted into windows

2012-09-14T13:08:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	when you boot, you never ever hear the sounds properly? its already distorted?
2012-09-14T13:08:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	which asus btw?
2012-09-14T13:11:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	does lspci show PCI bridge: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM108x somewhere?
2012-09-14T13:12:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	sorry, its a terminal command
2012-09-14T13:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	only a quick confirm if you do see that chip
2012-09-14T13:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	but continue with your guide by all means ^^
2012-09-14T13:16:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	lspci
2012-09-14T13:16:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	ok good to know... do you have extra peripherals you could remove? any extra pci cards?
2012-09-14T13:19:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	you could try rebooting and entering the bios, try to find that pci latency option and move it from 32 to 64, also try to disable anything than you are not using, or for testing, anything you can... such as extra usb ports, bluetooth, serial/paralel, things like that, try to have the bare minimun, and test
2012-09-14T13:21:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	i happen to have the same chip, and very rarely get the same synthom, but a simple pulseaudio restart cures it. But, have read really bad things about in in the linux kernel mailing list :(
2012-09-14T13:23:00.000Z	Nordom	Artemis3	is that guide I am doing going to fix it or am I doing something unneeded? ( I am a ubuntu nub who tends to do stuff until A) it works or B) I find some other guide that may work
2012-09-14T13:24:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	can't tell if it will help you or not....
2012-09-14T13:24:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	but i do know there is a problem with that asus pci chip
2012-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	try to turn off as many things as you can, just for testing, you could go back later to turn them back on one by one
2012-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	and try to find the pci latency option
2012-09-14T13:26:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	; is used when you are typing more than 1 command, ie:    ls ; ls -l   its equivalent to &&
2012-09-14T13:28:00.000Z	Artemis3	Nordom	you should copy and paste the whole thing :)
