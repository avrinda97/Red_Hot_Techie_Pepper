2011-07-12T22:58:00.000Z	LmAt		What does # before a command do?  And $ ?
2011-07-12T22:59:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	# is root $ is user
2011-07-12T22:59:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Thank you immensely.
2011-07-12T22:59:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	So, instead of typing "sudo ls", I could type #ls ?
2011-07-12T22:59:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	no, you dont type # or $, its for guides on the web showing wether to use root (or sudo) or do  a command as a normal user
2011-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Thank you very much.
2011-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	So when it says "#ls"  I should type "sudo ls" ?
2011-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	What is the command "su"?
2011-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	plain su chnages to root
2011-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Thank you immensely.
2011-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	What's the opposite of su?
2011-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	there isnt one, su changes to root or you can do su user to change to any user
2011-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	So, sudo is like running "su" "command" "su user" ?
2011-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	sudo does root stuff, but ubuntu has no root account so you have to use sudo
2011-07-12T23:03:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Non existent root password?  My root has a password.
2011-07-12T23:03:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Is that abnormal?
2011-07-12T23:03:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	you can set one, its to encourage people not to log in as root
2011-07-12T23:04:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Thank you tremendously.
2011-07-12T23:04:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	its ok. basically just use sudo
2011-07-12T23:13:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	yes, sudo -i
2011-07-12T23:13:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	Thank you very much.
2011-07-12T23:14:00.000Z	LmAt	sudokill	oh my...   I'm trying to figure out what the -i parameter does.  man seems a bit obfuscated on this point
2011-07-12T23:15:00.000Z	sudokill	LmAt	google it, it doesnt matter tbh. use sudo -i for a lot of root stuff in a terminal or just use sudo for individual things
