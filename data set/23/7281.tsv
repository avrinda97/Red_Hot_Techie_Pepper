2006-12-19T16:05:00.000Z	max_		im trying to install CDemu and when i do <make> it says </bin/sh: Syntax error: Bad fd number> what does this mean?
2006-12-19T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	probably because CDemu is using bash specific commands, and the default interpretter in ubuntu is dash.  Edit the script, change the first line to /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh
2006-12-19T16:07:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	which scrpit?
2006-12-19T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	whatever script that was.  try make
2006-12-19T16:09:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	all i did was type in "make" in a directory
2006-12-19T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	right, try the makefile in that directory
2006-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	bash: makefile: command not found
2006-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	er, wait.  that's silly.  makefiles aren't bash scripts.  I don't know.  Try asking the CDemu people, they'd know.
2006-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	makefile is a file, it'd be opening it in an editor, but, look for a script in that folder.
2006-12-19T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	edit the makefile, it'll most likely call a script, that script is most likely it.
2006-12-19T16:11:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	i have the makefile open, what am i changing?
2006-12-19T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	nothing in the makefile, youre lookng for a script being called by the makefile
2006-12-19T16:13:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	ok found the script, what do i changE?
2006-12-19T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	the shebang (first line) is #! /bin/sh  change it to #! /bin/bash
2006-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	the first line is <#!/bin/bash>
2006-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	with the brackets?
2006-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	good.  Well, then it's an error in the script.  You'll have to ask the CDemu people for specifics
2006-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	not on freenode.  Or at least, not named "cdemu", check their website/etc
2006-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	I have no idea what CDemu does ;)
2006-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	correct
2006-12-19T16:21:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	mountpoint in brackets?
2006-12-19T16:22:00.000Z	max_	Flannel	mountpoint in brackets?
2006-12-25T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	max_	konqueror
