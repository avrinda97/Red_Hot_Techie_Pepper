2008-08-15T08:45:00.000Z	tom_		can someone help me out with secure ssh tunneling and VNC? I've done it before but it just doesn't seem to work now...I remember getting it right was a pain last time.
2008-08-15T08:46:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	Put this in your ~/.ssh/config
2008-08-15T08:46:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	oh, wait, you want putty?
2008-08-15T08:47:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	yeah
2008-08-15T08:47:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	I've done it before -- and I think it's right, but obviously it's not because it isn't working :-p
2008-08-15T08:47:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	so.. this situation:
2008-08-15T08:47:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	You're on a windows box, and want to VNC over SSH to a linux machine
2008-08-15T08:48:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	correct
2008-08-15T08:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	Fairly easy, you want to do a "Source Port" 5900
2008-08-15T08:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	then Destination localhost:5900
2008-08-15T08:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	then click add
2008-08-15T08:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	then connect
2008-08-15T08:50:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	I have source to 5900 and remote to 5901. then I open vnc and then click connect then localhost. it connects and nothing comes up. If I close my putty window it kills the vnc connection, so I think it's on the other side
2008-08-15T08:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	well, source is the local port on the windows PC
2008-08-15T08:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	so if you have a VNC server on the windows PC you can't use 5900
2008-08-15T08:53:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	VNC server is running on a ubuntu machine
2008-08-15T08:54:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	Ok, but what about the windows machine?
2008-08-15T08:54:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	is there a server there too?
2008-08-15T08:54:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	the windows machine is using a vnc client.  Do you know how to tell in ubuntu what port vnc is listening on?
2008-08-15T08:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	netstat -aepl | grep vnc
2008-08-15T08:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	that might work
2008-08-15T08:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	tom_	netstat -pl | grep vnc
2008-08-15T08:58:00.000Z	tom_	SuperQ	http://img373.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vncpk5.jpg <-- does that look right to you? it does me
