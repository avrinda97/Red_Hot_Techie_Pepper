2008-08-14T03:31:00.000Z	paolo		Hi *. I have a very weird problem. A file is not recognized as an image if it has an extension (such as .jpeg, or .jpg). Does anyone know why?
2008-08-14T03:33:00.000Z	unop	paolo	maybe it is not an image file?  use this to find out.   file -i /path/to/file
2008-08-14T03:33:00.000Z	paolo	unop	it is
2008-08-14T03:35:00.000Z	unop	paolo	what does file return there?
2008-08-14T03:36:00.000Z	paolo	unop	Lake.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
2008-08-14T03:38:00.000Z	unop	paolo	hmm, did you run that under   file -i  image.jpeg?
2008-08-14T03:40:00.000Z	paolo	unop	Lake.jpg: image/jpeg
2008-08-14T03:40:00.000Z	paolo	unop	what shall I blame for this... gnome or gtk?
2008-08-14T03:41:00.000Z	unop	paolo	hmm, very strange .. you could use convert (part of the imagemagick package) to perhaps, repair the jpeg.  convert image.jpeg new_image.jpeg
2008-08-14T03:41:00.000Z	unop	paolo	well, it could just be that the jpeg is corrupted
2008-08-14T03:44:00.000Z	paolo	unop	well we are talking about thousands of files
2008-08-14T03:44:00.000Z	paolo	unop	including those that are downloaded from the internet
2008-08-14T03:44:00.000Z	unop	paolo	what program are you using to view the files?
2008-08-14T03:45:00.000Z	paolo	unop	well at the moment I am just trying to get them as background images...
2008-08-14T03:46:00.000Z	unop	paolo	hmm, well, do they open up fine in gthumb and/or eog ?
2008-08-14T03:54:00.000Z	paolo	unop	sorry... eog works fine
2008-08-14T03:56:00.000Z	unop	paolo	hmm, not sure then -- i don't use gnome to be able help you with this
2008-08-14T04:05:00.000Z	paolo	unop	yes they do
2008-08-18T03:14:00.000Z	unop	paolo	at the minimum ..  u+rw  with your user being the owner
2008-08-18T03:14:00.000Z	paolo	unop	it still doesn't work
2008-08-18T03:16:00.000Z	paolo	unop	if i erase .thumbnails, nautilius wouldn't recreate it
2008-08-18T03:16:00.000Z	unop	paolo	i'm not very good with nautilus .. i don't use it or gnome
2008-08-18T03:17:00.000Z	paolo	unop	ok... thanks anyway
