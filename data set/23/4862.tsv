2007-08-02T15:46:00.000Z	MannyZ		lets see is this right:
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	MannyZ		cp -R mannyz/desktop/tangoBlack /usr/share/cairo-clock/themes
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	MannyZ		like that howlingmadhowie?
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	MannyZ		ok ill try it :)
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	MannyZ		thanks
2007-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	NO!
2007-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	The mannyz/desktop/tangoBlack is wrong.
2007-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	No!
2007-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	You are not specifying the correct path.
2007-08-02T15:50:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	It should be: cp -R /home/mannyz/Desktop/tangoBlack /usr/share/cairo-clock/theme
2007-08-02T15:52:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	I suppose "just" is relative. The difference between these two commands ls 'just' a '/', but the result is quite different -- don't do this on your computer. rm -rf * or rm -rf /*
2007-08-02T15:53:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	Why?
2007-08-02T15:54:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	About what?
2007-08-02T15:56:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	If it's nothing you cannot discuss here, I suspect I won't be that interested.
2007-08-02T15:57:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	That's what you asked for.
2007-08-02T15:57:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	You always get what you ask for with computers :)
2007-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	rmdir will only remove empty directories. The rm -rf command will remove a filled directory, but be careful, you can really break stuff!
2007-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	MannyZ	owh	do you have a page with all commands :S?.. im a newby and i would need all commands.. like esxtracting.. installing changing places everything :S..
2007-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	The computer has the man command, you can use it to find out about each command. If you don't know which command, try the apropos command.
2007-08-02T16:04:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	sudo aptitude install mc
2007-08-02T16:05:00.000Z	owh	MannyZ	It allows you to remove stuff automatically if you don't like what you just installed.
