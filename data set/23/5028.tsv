2007-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	tkp_		hi
2007-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	tkp_		my libc.so seems to be screwed up somehow
2007-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	tkp_		take a look at this:
2007-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	tkp_		http://rafb.net/p/z3eYIR66.html
2007-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	tkp_		how can I get it back?
2007-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	that's normal. You can't execute libc6
2007-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	Seveas		if your libc were messed up, everything was broken
2007-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	tkp_	Seveas	thats not true...
2007-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	tkp_		normlly the output looks more like this
2007-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	tkp_		http://rafb.net/p/4Nl0DU37.html
2007-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	tkp_	Seveas	try yours
2007-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	tkp_		you'll see wht I mean
2007-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	interesting, I though only ld.so did that
2007-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	apt-get install --reinstall libc6
2007-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	tkp_	Seveas	nope... still looks wong
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	btw: it's /lib/libc6.so
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	btw: it's /lib/libc.so.6
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	Seveas		don't know what the thing in /usr/lib is
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	tkp_	Seveas	not on mine
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	tkp_		I don't have that file
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	tkp_		oh, hang on
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	tkp_		 /lib/libc.so.6
2007-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	Seveas	tkp_	the second one you should have
