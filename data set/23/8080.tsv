2005-02-02T06:21:00.000Z	ssam		i now have a debian sub menu in the main menu, which is odd, but i assume it is for the developers or something
2005-02-02T06:22:00.000Z	Serengeti	ssam	i think i'll try to upgrade someday soon
2005-02-02T06:22:00.000Z	ssam		be carefull if its your main system, it is meant fro devs

2005-02-02T06:24:00.000Z	Serengeti	ssam	I know I think I have some space left on my hdd so maybe I'll end up having two ubuntus :)
2005-02-02T06:24:00.000Z	ssam		when i figure out how to get rid of the naked people, i can pretend i am a real linux hacker

2005-02-02T06:34:00.000Z	ssam		if you are new to linux ubuntu is better than fc3
