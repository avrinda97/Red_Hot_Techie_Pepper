2009-04-01T10:39:00.000Z	MrSunshine		patch -p0 -i patch.name? :)
2009-04-01T10:40:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	but what if the "@@ -40,10 +40,12 @@" lines don't matcg...will they still work?
2009-04-01T10:40:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	for the most part if not alot of changes has been made to the code
2009-04-01T10:41:00.000Z	MrSunshine		that they've moved/trivial changes patch usaly can take care of
2009-04-01T10:41:00.000Z	MrSunshine		but if code is changed expect that you might have to hand patch :)
2009-04-01T10:42:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	that's why I want some info about...I donno what to change in those @@ -xx.xx +xx.xx @@ lines ... any info about what they mean?
2009-04-01T10:43:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	its position references
2009-04-01T10:43:00.000Z	MrSunshine		line numbers etc
2009-04-01T10:43:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	they can be a bit strange to read tho, as the first one might add 20 lines to the code, so the next position reference is the position in the new code, not the old etc :)
2009-04-01T10:44:00.000Z	MrSunshine		the code containing then new 20 lines
2009-04-01T10:44:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	but do a backup of the code and try and patch it :)
2009-04-01T10:46:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	"can't find file to patch at input line 4" ... so I need to manualy edit it
2009-04-01T10:47:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	oh
2009-04-01T10:47:00.000Z	MrSunshine		darn :)
2009-04-01T10:47:00.000Z	MrSunshine		dunno then
2009-04-01T10:47:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	you got a filename at the reference lines also
2009-04-01T10:47:00.000Z	MrSunshine		so you can see what file to edit etc
2009-04-01T10:48:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	manually editing the files would take ages :(
2009-04-01T10:48:00.000Z	MrSunshine		is it an old patch that your trying to use for a newer program ?
2009-04-01T10:49:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	yes
2009-04-01T10:50:00.000Z	MrSunshine	SoS11	might not even be doable then
2009-04-01T10:50:00.000Z	MrSunshine		as usaly files disapears, and new ones gets added etc
2009-04-01T10:50:00.000Z	SoS11	MrSunshine	I'll try to manualy edit the files...maybe I'll get lucky :)
