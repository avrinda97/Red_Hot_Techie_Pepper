2007-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	reel		Hi,  I have a sony camera that I wish to automount in PTP mode (assume no other mode available). Right now I can do that by hand  "gphotofs /mnt/camera". Is there a udev rule to automount in PTP mode already ? Or any other way to auto mount ?
2007-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	udev doesn't mount, hal does
2007-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	actually hal informs gnome to mount to be more exact
2007-11-30T18:43:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	okay. I see... so, is there a way to ask hal to automount ?
2007-11-30T18:43:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	oh okay
2007-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	but I could use the RUN to do the mounting can't I ?
2007-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	run ? sorry, I don't follow. I'm just checking ou the hal interaction process now
2007-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	I could say KERNEL="usb" RUN+="mount script"
2007-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	right?
2007-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	from within hal ?
2007-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	no, in a udev rules file
2007-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	I've never used "run" before in udev so wouldn't like to guess, but thats not really udev's job. Try it though if you like
2007-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	okay.
2007-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	What will be the proper way then ?
2007-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	to set a hal trigger on a udev event
2007-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	okay... how do I do that?
2007-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	I'm just reading up now. Feel free to read up on hal and beat me to it
2007-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	:) sure
2008-01-07T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	libjs is javascript as I recall
2008-01-07T21:20:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	yes, but I want to know the package name .. I have tried to list all possible JS packages and the files they provide still I donot have any answers for /usr/lib/libjs.so
2008-01-07T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	what wants that file,. it looks like it's a file that redhat are packaging up seperate from the jvm package
2008-01-07T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	reel	what is complaining about that file I should say
2008-01-07T21:27:00.000Z	reel	ikonia	what you say may be right. Since packages.ubuntu.com cannot find any file with this name. It is a JS devel library that I need to compile MediaTomb with. The problem apparently it seems is Ubuntu's JS package as it is got from xulrunner not from spidermonkey :(
