2009-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	big-bro		G'day world - updated to 9.04 jaunty last week and i do not have any sound on my firefox browser
2009-09-04T18:04:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	do you mean you don't get any sound with flash content or everything?
2009-09-04T18:04:00.000Z	big-bro		basically everything - even the start up sound does not work
2009-09-04T18:06:00.000Z	DefineByte		you mean you don't have sound system wide? i thought it was just firefox
2009-09-04T18:07:00.000Z	big-bro		it was everything - but i can listen to files from my folders now, but i cannot hear anything whilst using the browser
2009-09-04T18:11:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	sorry, haven't encountered that.
2009-09-04T18:13:00.000Z	big-bro	DefineByte	- i went into system - sounds and changed everything to OSS to recieve sound from my files, but , not sure what i have to do to recieve sound through the browser
2009-09-04T18:22:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	never used oss so i don't know how to get that working.
2009-09-04T18:23:00.000Z	DefineByte		irpty seems to be working in everything except ncmpc so I guess I'll have to start looking at that.
2009-09-04T18:25:00.000Z	big-bro		no worries DefineByte .. i think it might have something to do with flash maybe...thanks anyway.
2009-09-04T18:26:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	is it was back in the hardy days I'd say install libflashsupport but everything's supposed to "just work" now. xD
2009-09-04T18:26:00.000Z	DefineByte		if it was/
2009-09-04T18:27:00.000Z	big-bro		ok..will i obtain libflashsupport from my packet manager?
2009-09-04T18:28:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	no, because it only works with hardy afaik
2009-09-04T18:28:00.000Z	DefineByte		we are going back a bit
2009-09-04T18:29:00.000Z	big-bro		so the only option i can see is reloading hardy then..
2009-09-04T18:35:00.000Z	big-bro	DefineByte	- i might put up with it for a while and if i can't rectify it i might resort back to hardy.. Thanks for your input.
2009-09-04T18:36:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	i'm sure it can be made to work with pulse/alsa, you just need to ask the right people. tried on the forums?
2009-09-04T18:36:00.000Z	big-bro	DefineByte	- that was my next mission
2009-09-04T18:58:00.000Z	big-bro	DefineByte	- Good News, just found a forum and fixed it, all is good..
2009-09-04T18:58:00.000Z	DefineByte		fyi i managed to fix the problem. i rebooted...I know, but it's a sin to reboot in Linux, right? >.< Seems like it got stuck while running mpd --create-db.
2009-09-04T18:58:00.000Z	DefineByte	big-bro	excellent news. what was the fix?
2009-09-04T19:01:00.000Z	big-bro	DefineByte	- it had to do with libsound and pulse audio..it was an easy fix
