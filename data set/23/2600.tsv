2009-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	Abracadabr4		I need some help setting up my wireless access please
2009-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	Abracadabr4		I have just installed Ubuntu client
2009-01-12T00:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	which wireless card do you use?
2009-01-12T00:33:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	it says wlan0
2009-01-12T00:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	and the gnome applet in the top right does not display your wireless network?
2009-01-12T00:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	or the applet does not exist at all?
2009-01-12T00:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	does this command give any results: sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning
2009-01-12T00:36:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	yes it says no result
2009-01-12T00:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	the symptoms you are having are typically from the wrong driver being loaded in to the kernel
2009-01-12T00:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	I recommend looking up documentation or forum posts specific to your wireless device type
2009-01-12T00:39:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	ok, will do
2009-01-12T00:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	also, if you don't know the exact model number you can find out with: lspci
2009-01-12T00:41:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	it gives me a whole list of things but no Belkin USb
2009-01-12T00:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	sorry, didn't know it as usb. Try this one: lsusb
2009-01-12T00:42:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	it gives me 2 entries with belkin
2009-01-12T00:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	copy any paste them here
2009-01-12T00:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	one at a time, not sure the ruling here on multiple line copy and paste
2009-01-12T00:44:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	Bus 005 Device 002: ID 050d:705a Belkin Components
2009-01-12T00:45:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	Bus 004 Device 002: ID 050d:0237 Belkin Components
2009-01-12T00:45:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	ehh, try this: lsusb -vv
2009-01-12T00:52:00.000Z	Abracadabr4	Titan8990	the page doesn't show all the info, I will have to change the buffer size
2009-01-12T00:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	Abracadabr4	you can pipe through less like so: lsusb -vv | less
