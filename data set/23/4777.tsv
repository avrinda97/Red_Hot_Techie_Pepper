2007-05-10T15:52:00.000Z	dmhouse	Henica	you need to tell us precisely what you typed in the terminal.

2007-05-10T15:54:00.000Z	dmhouse	Henica	'connecting to the terminal' doesn't make sense. Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal gives you a terminal window, where you can execute a wide variety of programs that aren't available using the normal window system. You shouldn't have to connect to anything,
2007-05-10T15:55:00.000Z	Henica	dmhouse	; I don't have utilities under applications.
