2008-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	andreskru		its normal that ubuntu 8.04 64 bit take 500 mb ram?
2008-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	vista now does the same, cashing up all ram to improve performance. linux has been doing this for quite some time
2008-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	 i had use gusty 32 bit and doesnt take that amount of memory
2008-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	you can open your system monitor to see if there's a particular program taking much ram
2008-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	sort by memory in the processes tab
2008-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	many tabs open in firefox can take a lot of memory
2008-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	im sendind you a screenshot
2008-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	i'm not registered, you have to send me a link here to the screenshot
2008-04-30T05:43:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	mmm i dont have that
2008-04-30T05:44:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	you can easily upload it to a site like http://bayimg.com/
2008-04-30T05:45:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	and then post the link to it here
2008-04-30T05:48:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	http://bayimg.com/PajjFaaBi
2008-04-30T05:49:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	i can't see anything unusual there
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	i see you have the system monitor applet on your upper panel. you can change the preferences for that one to show the memory usage and then you can see how much is used by application and how much is cache and you can see if it's reaching your limit
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	500 mb ram!!!!!!!!!
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	how much ram do you have?
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	1 gb
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	then you have half left no problem
2008-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	andreskru	koudelka	but before i use 250 whit gutsy
2008-04-30T05:53:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	but did you have those programs running then?
2008-04-30T05:53:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	i also think application will use more ram if they kernel tells them there is free ram to use
2008-04-30T05:54:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	you shouldn't worry. ram is there to be used if it's not used it's wasted
2008-04-30T05:56:00.000Z	koudelka	andreskru	and are you sure it's 500? counting the ram usage i can see on your picture it's more like 300-350mb
