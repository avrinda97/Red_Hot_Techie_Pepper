2006-01-17T16:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	there are alot of issues left in dapper
2006-01-17T16:50:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	i'm using it right now, and the edubuntu release
2006-01-17T16:50:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	got it to work quite alright
2006-01-17T16:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	when did it hit beta?
2006-01-17T16:54:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	flight cd 2 went out awhile ago... dunno what its called
2006-01-17T16:54:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	flight cd 3 is about to come out soon
2006-01-17T16:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	this week
2006-01-18T17:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	what if he uninstalled ubuntu-desktop and reinstalled it?
2006-01-18T17:55:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	that could work
2006-01-18T17:57:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	yeah and around nautilus i think
2006-01-18T17:58:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	could dpkg be broken
2006-01-18T17:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	it could but i would the the .deb package would be first
2006-01-18T06:08:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	how about him deleting /var/lib/dpkg/info/nautilus.* ?
2006-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	i never did that :( i dont know never got a nautilus error on breezy :(
2006-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	well basically this is the error:  files list file for package `nautilus' contains empty filename
2006-01-18T06:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	i think thats a good shot
2006-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	this is what i get
2006-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	on my breezy box
2006-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	platos	is that yours im looking at?
2006-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	platos	gnomefreak	yes
