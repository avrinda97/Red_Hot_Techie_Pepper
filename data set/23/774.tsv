2011-02-14T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	What is the output of "sudo os-prober"?
2011-02-14T08:49:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	nothing happened
2011-02-14T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	That means that most likely you don't actually have a bootable Windows install.
2011-02-14T08:50:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	what do you mean its not a bootable windows
2011-02-14T08:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	os-prober checks all partitions on all drives for files which are required to be able to boot windows. It found no such partition.
2011-02-14T08:52:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	is there anything i can do short of physically unplugging my ubuntu hdd
2011-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	I doubt that physically unplugging your Ubuntu hdd would even work.
2011-02-14T09:00:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	you were right my win7 hdd is nto bootable now
2011-02-14T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	I personally doubt that it did.
2011-02-14T09:03:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	its all here i jsut cannot boot to it even with my ubuntu drive unplugged
2011-02-14T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	Can you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and pastebin the RESULTS.txt?

2011-02-14T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	Windows 7 installs consist of two partitions, a "system" partition which is somewhat analogous to a separate /boot, and the "C:" which stores pretty much everything else. You have no system partition.
2011-02-14T09:24:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	im dont understand what you are saying
2011-02-14T09:25:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	ubuntu is installed on a seperate hdd it shouldnt have done anything to my original hdd
2011-02-14T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	You at some point deleted a partition from your Windows drive. The Ubuntu installer did not do this.
2011-02-14T09:26:00.000Z	peayness	Jordan_U	so can i use my win7 disk to recover that hdd
2011-02-14T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	peayness	Most likely, yes.
