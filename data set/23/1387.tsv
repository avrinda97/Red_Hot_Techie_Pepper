2010-04-21T09:20:00.000Z	Sevion		Hey, guys. I've been having a problem. I have Windows 7 installed on my main drive and a second drive has Ubuntu. Once I install Ubuntu, I have to restart. So I do so. Once I do, I can't boot anymore. I get a Grub Loading. and it just stops there. Sometimes it goes to Grub Rescue. I can get back onto Windows by repairing boot through the install disc. I've tried a few things with reinstalling GRUB2, but no dice.
2010-04-21T09:21:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	it sounds like windows ate your bootloader, you tried the 'recoverr grub after installing windows instructions' ?
2010-04-21T09:21:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	I actually installed Windows before Ubuntu.
2010-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Though, when I repaired boot, it may have done that.
2010-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	are tou using any third party antivirus or backup solutions? those have a tendency to kill grub.
2010-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	I do have AVG Free
2010-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	any backup managers?
2010-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	None.
2010-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	usually that causes problems, things overwrite the MBR without looking
2010-04-21T09:24:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Well, I have gone into my Windows install disc and used bootrec.exe /fixboot and bootrec.exe /fixmbr, would that do anything? I have tried reinstalling GRUB2 after doing these actions.
2010-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	those will kill your grub, you then should be able to reinstall grub using instructions online to your mbr, boot into Ubuntu, do a sudo update-grub, and you should be set
2010-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Okay, I will try. Stand by for results.
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	hilight me, I'll probably be away
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Hilight? How?
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	exactly how you just did :) just my name
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Alright!
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	h00k	Sevion	Good luck
2010-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Trying now, afk. Thanks.
2010-04-21T09:53:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Are you there?
2010-04-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	I can now get past Grub Loading. I followed this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275 Instruction #13. However, now I get to the "GNU GRUB version 1.97 beta 4 [Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device/flies completions] sh:grub>" screen. When I type boot, it says "error: no loaded kernel". When I try to use any
2010-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Are you there?
2010-04-21T10:12:00.000Z	Sevion	h00k	Thanks for all of your help earlier; I seem to have got it to work!
