2008-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	oh dear???? Can I not go into terminal and put in something about update firefox???
2008-09-25T03:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 firefox 3.0.1 is working here fine with hotmail.. let me check other machine
2008-09-25T03:12:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	thks
2008-09-25T03:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 firefox 3.0.1 is working here fine with hotmail under linux and windows.
2008-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	so what's happened with mine??? Can you suggest anything I can do?
2008-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 not really - i avoide hotmail. I see my account has 400+ spam messages it missed... i rember why i never check it..
2008-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 try a useragent tool to set the agent, or opera browser
2008-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 thats 'windows' thinking.. remoive/reinstalling stuff RARELY fixes things under linux
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	I tried with Konqueror and had the same problem
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 - sounding like a deeper/more convuluted issue. not a browser specific issue.
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 i would try the Operabrowser
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade' and thats as up to date as it gets
2008-09-25T03:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 go get a firefox useragent extension. and make it identify as a different browser
2008-09-25T03:20:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	how do I get a firefox useragent extension?????
2008-09-25T03:21:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	dr_willis	many thanks to you too!!!!
2008-11-23T00:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	DavidCanarias	 you may want to clarify that question..
