2011-05-02T04:24:00.000Z	WhitePelican		my webcam doesn't work with Skype but works with cheese, I'm running natty. any ideas?
2011-05-02T04:26:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	just an idea. check if any other application using the camera is running, even if you closed; on skype test and configure it.
2011-05-02T04:30:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure skype_or_the_name_of_package
2011-05-02T04:31:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	see first on System Monitor if chesse or butter or whatever uses cam is working... because if cheese detects skype should
2011-05-02T04:31:00.000Z	WhitePelican	lcb	it works fine in cheese
2011-05-02T04:32:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	ok, but goto system monitor and see... or logout and login
2011-05-02T04:33:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	read above the suggestions :p
2011-05-02T05:06:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	did you get skype recognizing the cam?
2011-05-02T05:07:00.000Z	WhitePelican	lcb	yes
2011-05-02T05:07:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	what did you do? restart?
2011-05-02T05:08:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	ahh ok, great.
2011-05-02T05:09:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	i just installed and looks ok...
2011-05-02T05:10:00.000Z	WhitePelican	lcb	from medibuntu or the skype webite?
2011-05-02T05:11:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	from the regular repos. but that version is for maverik, btw
2011-05-02T05:13:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	when you start doesn't say "another skype instance may exist"? probably your prob w the pass is there...
2011-05-02T05:14:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	nooo.... is at the top panel, on the right... should be
2011-05-02T05:14:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	quit all you have there. probably more than 1 instance, even
2011-05-02T05:15:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	check system monitor, if for any reason you don't have the indicators
2011-05-02T05:18:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	write the nick so ppl can see who are you talking to :p that's another matter - the indicator.
2011-05-02T05:19:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	matter of fact i scrolled back, just in case .. and i saw it. are you on unity or classic desktop?
2011-05-02T05:20:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	oh... but you know, i'm not running from medibuntu. yours probably is different and, besides having medibuntu repos i don't see skype in synaptic
2011-05-02T05:21:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	sometimes is better if we stay with normal releases...
2011-05-02T05:22:00.000Z	lcb	WhitePelican	but i don't mean by this yours could be buggy. it could be also something elese, the issues you are having
