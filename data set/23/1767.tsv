2009-11-01T10:29:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	I've problems with the 185 driver  so flopped back to 173 -- much more stable.
2009-11-01T10:42:00.000Z	devon	Blue1	i don't even know which driver i'm running.  im going to check.
2009-11-01T10:42:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	kewl
2009-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	devon	Blue1	im running 185
2009-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	I've had problems with the 185 driver - so I went to the 173 driver - I'm now lockup free
2009-11-01T10:44:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	don't rightly know....I got it when 9.10 came out hand had problems
2009-11-01T10:45:00.000Z	devon	Blue1	just checking cuz i've had a few lockups now and then since i started at 9.04
2009-11-01T10:46:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	let us know if that works for you - it did for me...
2009-11-01T10:49:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	with 185 I was getting about 10,000 fps -- and with 173 about 8200 fps - I think the 185 driver overdrives the card...
2009-11-01T10:49:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	glxgears
2009-11-01T10:50:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	just a sec...
2009-11-01T10:51:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430] (rev a2)
2009-11-01T11:00:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	hope that stabilises for you
2009-11-01T11:01:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	hookahed on fonix, werked 4 me!
2009-11-01T11:01:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	different - how?
2009-11-01T11:02:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	slower for me - for me I think the 185 driver just taxes the the hell out of the gpu -- can you see what your temp is?
2009-11-01T11:02:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	thats F correct?
2009-11-01T11:03:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	you should kill glxgears
2009-11-01T11:03:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	whew!
2009-11-01T11:04:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	glxgears is a btfw programme for the gpu
2009-11-01T11:04:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	I never got compiz to work right - when I tried to use it - it crammed all 4 work spaces into 1, and then refused to let me move anything.
2009-11-01T11:14:00.000Z	Blue1	devon	okay --
