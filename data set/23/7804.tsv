2005-05-03T13:34:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	i would prefer the alt button. how did you do yours?
2005-05-03T13:33:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	beats me, but I set my windows button to "meta" so I use meta-4 and such to switch tabs
2005-05-03T13:36:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	mine is set in xorg (it was asked during the install)... but you can also set it from an x terminal with the command "setxkbmap -option -option altwin:meta_win" (just end after the first option to reset all options)
2005-05-03T13:38:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	what it did is just switched the function of the alt button to the windows button, but still didnt work to switch tabs in irssi
2005-05-03T13:39:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	though my esc button is working as a meta button properly
2005-05-03T13:39:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	well, you can clear options with 'setxkbmap -option', but using meta_win did work for me (I'm currently in irssi)
2005-05-03T13:40:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	i did clear the options but it just returns to what it was before...
2005-05-03T13:41:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	:/ well, clearing the options would do that, but I don't know why turning on altwin:meta_win wouldn't work for you like it does for me
2005-05-03T13:42:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	all it did  is switched functions between the alt and the windows button
2005-05-03T13:42:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	is it any different when im on laptop?
2005-05-03T13:42:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	its not supposed to. it should leave alt as alt, and set windows as meta
2005-05-03T13:42:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	I'm on a laptop.
2005-05-03T13:46:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	you could also try altwin:left_meta_win (which affects only one side of the keyboard)
2005-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	i just did what you told me, pressing "windows"+"2" gives me 
2005-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	sorry i got disconnected :/
2005-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	wow, that's interesting
2005-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	partly... but for me its rather... annyoing? xD
2005-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	hmm, well, the default is supposed to be altwin:meta_alt (where pressing alt results in both a meta and an alt)... that doesn't let me switch tabs in irssi though
2005-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	oh... any way i could "fix" that?
2005-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	are you using an english keyboard mapping?
2005-05-03T13:52:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	I just switched to gb keymap, and altwin:meta_win still works for me
2005-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	b2s	shinu	I don't have one either :)  also, I opened up irssi in a standard terminal, and I can only switch windows using alt instead of meta! weird... clearly a terminal thing though
2005-05-03T14:06:00.000Z	shinu	b2s	on gnome-terminal alt works fine as meta... meh... xD
