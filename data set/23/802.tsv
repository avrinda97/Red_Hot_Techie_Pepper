2012-11-26T01:44:00.000Z	WXZ		can I split a screen into 2, sort of like dual monitors, but on one monitor?
2012-11-26T01:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	for what?
2012-11-26T01:45:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	lucid lynx
2012-11-26T01:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	sorry, i meant why
2012-11-26T01:47:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	because I want to view two different workspaces simultaneously
2012-11-26T01:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	the closest i think you'll get to what you want is the expose-like function in compiz
2012-11-26T01:57:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	escott: I'm reading on different WMs right now. I'll be back, but xnomad seems promising.
2012-11-26T01:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	even a tiling wm won't let you tile workspaces for a side by side comparison
2012-11-26T01:59:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	well I hope you're wrong
2012-11-26T02:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	i honestly think that expose will be the closest you'll get to tiling workspaces
2012-11-26T02:04:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	I'll check out expose after nomad, or during, I don't know
2012-11-26T02:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	have you used unity?
2012-11-26T02:05:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	it's possible
2012-11-26T02:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	when you press the workspaces icon it zooms out to display all workspaces and their content (that is what i'm talking about)
2012-11-26T02:08:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	I might be using Unity then. Is the default shortcut for that Win + E?
2012-11-26T02:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	i don't think so
2012-11-26T02:12:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	Oh yeah, I played around with Unity, I remember I hated it.
2012-11-26T02:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	unity uses compiz, so that feature comes from compiz
2012-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	but you can use compiz with other desktop environments (like xfce or lxde)
2012-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	kde's kwin has a very similar feature too
2012-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	ofcourse I use compiz, I've been using compiz before I even knew what Unity was.
2012-11-26T02:22:00.000Z	WXZ	ThinkT510	yes, Expo is Win + E. But the workspaces are linearly shown so they're incredibly small, maybe if i tile them correctly and on a large screen it could work though.
2012-11-26T02:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	WXZ	ah yeah, expo, forgot what it was called
