2009-02-28T16:59:00.000Z	nosyc		what sftp server should I use?
2009-02-28T16:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	openssh-server is a sftp server
2009-02-28T17:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	from linux -> ssh, just use the sftp command like you would the ssh command
2009-02-28T17:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	like sftp user@example.com
2009-02-28T17:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	who will be browsing it... what OS?
2009-02-28T17:02:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	I can't connect with winscp
2009-02-28T17:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	there is a sftp client ... it's related to PuTTY
2009-02-28T17:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
2009-02-28T17:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	it's psftp
2009-02-28T17:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	from ubuntu, it's really easy, just Places -> Connect to Network... ; then just select server type as SSH
2009-02-28T17:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	whoops, mean Connect to Server...
2009-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	the SSL thing... the transport layer is encrypted, that's kinda the point of SSH (Secure Shell)
2009-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	I've given up on sftp and am going to try ftps instead
2009-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	I just need to generate a certificate for vsftpd
2009-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	well, i tried.
2009-02-28T17:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	on this one, you should blame windows :)
2009-02-28T17:07:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	nope, winscp usually works fine
2009-02-28T17:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	wait, for the ssh thing, did you make sure that your desktop was accessible?  i.e. no firewall blocking port 22?
2009-02-28T17:12:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	it's a server and yes. The problem is probably that I'm not actually running openssh but sshd or something
2009-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	well, sshd *is* openssh-server
2009-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	nosyc	rdw200169	why doesn't it work then. I can ssh in
2009-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	check the end of /var/log/auth.log
2009-02-28T17:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	nosyc	ntp
