2011-02-12T03:29:00.000Z	tuzlo		I have been trying to get Ubuntu installed on a Dell poweredge 1850, dual scsi drives but the cd which booted and ran on a PC doesnt get far, matter of fact, it seemd to freeze at a screen with UBUNTU and 5 dots below it, any ideas?
2011-02-12T03:30:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	run "check the cd for defects"
2011-02-12T03:30:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	it worked on a PC
2011-02-12T03:30:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	doesn't matter.
2011-02-12T03:32:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	ok how exactly do I do that in linux?
2011-02-12T03:32:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	the cd should offer the option near the beginning
2011-02-12T03:32:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	it goes no where, brings up this screen then locks
2011-02-12T03:34:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	thats gonna be hard to do as the windows box that burnt it no longer exists
2011-02-12T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	you can checksum the actual cd
2011-02-12T03:45:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	where do I get the md5 checksum for the version im runnning?
2011-02-12T03:51:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	you might try the alternate cd
2011-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	since I am slapping this on a dell poweredge, will the i386 iso suffice?
2011-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	sure, if that's the version you want
2011-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	I want one running, not sure if thats the best fopr thathardware
2011-02-12T03:59:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	I'm not familiar with the hardware.  How much ram?
2011-02-12T03:59:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	if you have 4gb+, you probably want the amd64 version, otherwise i386 is okay
2011-02-12T04:00:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	11.04 is still being developed
2011-02-12T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers
2011-02-12T18:03:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	it doesnt find any
2011-02-12T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	what card do you have?
2011-02-12T18:07:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	ok thats wierd, looks like it's using the right driver but when I try a screen resolution that I know worked in Slackware it garbles it all up
2011-02-12T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	tuzlo	I don't if that helpful depending on what you mean by "garbles it up"
2011-02-12T18:25:00.000Z	tuzlo	jrib	here's a pic of what I mean by garbled http://img718.imageshack.us/i/photoqi.jpg/
