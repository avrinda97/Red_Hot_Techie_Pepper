2012-06-30T22:50:00.000Z	Mahmoud		can't install pidgin... Depends: pidgin-data (<1:2.10.3-z) but 1:2.10.4-1ubuntu0+pidgin3.11.10 is to be installed
2012-06-30T22:50:00.000Z	Mahmoud		someone tell me how to resolve this error http://codepad.org/8W839Uxj
2012-06-30T22:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	make sure you run "update" first
2012-06-30T22:52:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	done
2012-06-30T22:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	and did it fix your problem..?
2012-06-30T22:57:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	didn't
2012-06-30T22:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	have you run an upgrade lately (through update manager)? It could be that you need a new kernel for the lib. I suggest doing a full update/upgrade and a reboot, then try again.
2012-06-30T22:58:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	done
2012-06-30T22:58:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	should i also try install pidgin-ppa?
2012-06-30T22:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	NO, ppa's are unstable and are not supported by the #ubuntu support channel
2012-06-30T22:59:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	ok, i did sudo apt-get remove pidgin-ppa -- hope this is enough
2012-06-30T23:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	LjL: About 50% of all update and install issues I've seen in this channel are caused by conflicts with PPA's for completly unrelated software (ex: skype PPA messing up GoogleEarth)
2012-06-30T23:00:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	can u give me a list of good ppa's so that i disable the rest
2012-06-30T23:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	I don't know of any good ones because I haven't had to use one in over 3 years
2012-06-30T23:01:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	i just want ubuntu's default repos (i guess called ppa's too)
2012-06-30T23:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	go into "software sources" and see if there are any 3rd party repositories in there
2012-06-30T23:03:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	how to identify whether a repo is 3rd party?
2012-06-30T23:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	just a sec, looking it up
2012-06-30T23:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	what happened?
2012-06-30T23:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	did you follow the instructions for ppa-purge?
2012-06-30T23:13:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	finally worked
2012-06-30T23:13:00.000Z	Mahmoud	DarwinSurvivor	i had to remove pidgin-data manually, then install it manually again... dunno why i had to do it this way
2012-06-30T23:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Mahmoud	weird, but at least it's working now :)
