2005-06-28T10:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	..... you're a heavy console user, and you use the default Ubuntu terminal?
2005-06-28T10:35:00.000Z	quam	Razor-X	i was a heavy console user years ago. i stopped using linux for about 5 years and got out of the loop
2005-06-28T10:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	happened to me, but I came back in full-swing ;)
2005-06-28T10:36:00.000Z	quam	Razor-X	give me some other terminal suggestions and i'll give them a looksi
2005-06-28T10:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	I suggest Eterm, it has fantastic console font support
2005-06-28T10:37:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	don't use xterm!
2005-06-28T10:40:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	even with the background, it's still much lighter than xterm
2005-06-28T10:40:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	your eyes'll get raw when you look at a blank console window for hours and hours
2005-06-28T10:40:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	I mean, it uses less resources/CPU
2005-06-28T10:40:00.000Z	quam	Razor-X	kbtin is a mud client :P i'll have plenty of text scrolling by to keep my eyes alive :P

2005-06-28T10:41:00.000Z	quam	Razor-X	wtf is the name of the bin for eterm, i installed it to check it out, trying to run eterm and e-term with no success
2005-06-28T10:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	Eterm
2005-06-28T10:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	but, the most notable are xterm (because it's old and legacy), Eterm, and aterm
2005-06-28T10:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	quam	I removed the menus from mine
