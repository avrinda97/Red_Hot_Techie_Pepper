2011-10-25T01:31:00.000Z	HorizonXP		what's the fastest way to backup my home directory to another internal HDD? It's 270 GB in size.
2011-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	HorizonXP		would dd be fastest?
2011-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	rsync I'd say
2011-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	I'm "backing up" so that I can format the HDD and do a clean install
2011-10-25T01:33:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	my understanding is that rsync is faster on subsequent uses because it won't copy unchanged files
2011-10-25T01:33:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	yes, best way then, unless you want a functional image
2011-10-25T01:33:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	right too, as it also uses a better algo than cp
2011-10-25T01:34:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	ok, that's enough to convince me, thanks!
2011-10-25T01:34:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	-P option is nice to see how long it'll take, -r for subdirs (but one usally needs /home and maybe packet selection just)
2011-10-25T02:45:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	thanks! the transfer finished surprisingly quickly!
2011-10-25T02:45:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	nice
2011-10-25T02:46:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	now to format and put wretched Windows 7 on here
2011-10-25T02:46:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	rather consider
2011-10-25T02:47:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	and maybe try lubuntu or xubuntu , if annoyed of new surface
2011-10-25T02:47:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	I've run dual-boot for quite some time. It's a lot of hassle flipping between OSes
2011-10-25T02:47:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	is it ? for web I can't miss linux, well some apps n games, win
2011-10-25T02:48:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	for example, for my presentations, I need to use PowerPoint, but all my data is in Ubuntu
2011-10-25T02:48:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	so ? use an ext3 to share
2011-10-25T02:48:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	It's more about being to use Ubuntu and Windows at the same time
2011-10-25T02:49:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	your choice, I'm on web most time
2011-10-25T02:49:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	unfortunately, equivalent to PowerPoint isn't enough. that's just one application.
2011-10-25T02:50:00.000Z	HorizonXP	DasEi	Me too. I love my setup, but I feel this is necessary for my work.
2011-10-25T02:51:00.000Z	DasEi	HorizonXP	I remind you at next forced install or updates coming, your sys has to be.. and you fissle with all apps to updated, loll, your choice, anyway
