2010-09-05T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	why are you using a server for a desktop function (tethering)
2010-09-05T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	then use a desktop install and remove what you want
2010-09-05T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	server install is meant for server hardware
2010-09-05T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	no
2010-09-05T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	again , I would strongly advise you to use a desktop install base, and remove what you don't want, or use the alternative CD installer to install a cut down base install
2010-09-05T23:26:00.000Z	picard1400	ikonia	i understand what ur sayin
2010-09-05T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	why should there be a deb for windows software ?
2010-09-05T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	its "windows software" it's not open source, how can debian package it ?
2010-09-05T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	are there linux drivers ?
2010-09-05T23:29:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	note the phrase "windows mobile phone"
2010-09-05T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	1.) the server install won't have all the software needed as it's not got a desktop setup in by default 2.) is there a linux driver for your phone
2010-09-05T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	is there a linux driver for your phone
2010-09-05T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	where are you getting this info ?
2010-09-05T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	could you please post the link ?
2010-09-05T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	thanks,
2010-09-05T23:32:00.000Z	picard1400	ikonia	look at first line
2010-09-05T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	you know that's not ubuntu forums ?
2010-09-05T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	the first line says nothing about ubuntu forums
2010-09-05T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	have you compiled the svn version of rndis-lite
2010-09-05T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	no it's not - it's svn
2010-09-05T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	they are svn
2010-09-05T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	picard1400	ok, so what does that tell you
