2008-10-10T02:53:00.000Z	misteralexander		I have 2 internal HD's on my laptop (Sony Viao).  I want to MOVE my /home directory from one HD (SDA1) to the other . . . any ideas how?
2008-10-10T02:54:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	create your new home partition.. copy *everything* to the new home.. change in fstab.. reboot
2009-07-06T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	before you clicked the "generate download script" did you mark any packages in the list?
2009-07-06T20:04:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Well shit, I feel like an ass . . . I highlighted them, I didn't "Check" them.
2009-07-06T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	=).. give it a try..
2009-07-06T20:06:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	okay, yeah . . . the script built just fine, but the problem is that the target computer has no internet & how to I make sure all dependencies get satisfied?
2009-07-06T20:07:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	okay, yeah . . . the script built just fine, but the problem is that the target computer has no internet & how to I make sure all dependencies get satisfied?
2009-07-06T20:08:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	now you save that script on a big flash drive and go run it on a computer that does have an internet connection
2009-07-06T20:08:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	it's basically the same as aptoncd.. but with a little more manual work
2009-07-06T20:09:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Oh, and it'll just download to the flash drive?  Do I need to specify somewhere that the Flashdrive is the target?  And will it just pull the Dependencies automatically?
2009-07-06T20:09:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	I think it will download it to the same directory as the script file.. it's just a simple text file that runs some wget commands.. open it up and look at it
2009-07-06T20:10:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Yeah, I did open it . . . and it is just wget commands.  Do you know anything about the dependencies?
2009-07-06T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	if the dependencies get "marked" too I think they will be included.. but if you go back far enough it will depend on almost everything that is in the default install..
2009-07-06T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	so if it did recursive dependencies you would end up downloading all the packages in the install cd..
2009-07-06T20:11:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Okay, thanks.
2009-07-06T20:11:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Okay, thanks.
2009-07-06T20:16:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	 What is a "Recursive Dependensies"?  And I checked, Synaptic does (at least for me) auto select dependencies.
2009-07-06T20:17:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	I meant for example,  you install openoffice, it depends on gnome, gnome depends on X and so on..
2009-07-06T20:20:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	 That's exactly what I mean, everything seems to depend on everything else . . . it's beyond irritating . . . that you know of (or anyone reading this), is there some magical thing to type [  sudo apt-get install depedencies ndiswrapper  ] to just make it work?  I'll be trying to satisfy dependencies for days if I do it one by one!
2009-07-06T20:21:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	why is that irritating? apt-get will only install the stuff you need to run the program..  the base stuff should already be installed
2009-07-06T20:24:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  For instance, the target computer needs "dpkg", which has nearly 30 dependencies itself.  Either I download just dpkg, or I (to "save" time) download them all, and THEN each of THOSE things has 20 dependencies, that's the irritating part.
2009-07-06T20:24:00.000Z	Slart	misteralexander	ahh.. but you create the synaptic script on the computer that needs the packages... then it will just download the stuff that it needs
2009-07-06T20:25:00.000Z	misteralexander	Slart	Okay, i'll just hold my breath & try it.
