2010-12-20T17:07:00.000Z	goodtime		something tells me i might have been better off useing ubuntu 10.04
2010-12-20T17:08:00.000Z	goodtime		what i did was just uninstall what ever opens up in place of your file browser
2010-12-20T17:09:00.000Z	goodtime		install

2010-12-20T17:09:00.000Z	goodtime		my screen now flickers
2010-12-20T17:10:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	o.o did you try changing settings for less graphic effects?
2010-12-20T17:10:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	what about drivers
2010-12-20T17:11:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	probably xorg configuration then.
2010-12-20T17:11:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	which card?
2010-12-20T17:14:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	did it work on 10.04?
2010-12-20T17:15:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	then maybe you can install 10.04 and update instead of reinstall
2010-12-20T17:17:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	reinstall 10.04 and the in a terminal, sudo apt-get install update-manager-core then edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal, then  sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-12-20T17:18:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	so it should keep any configurations the same
2010-12-20T17:18:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	how what?
2010-12-20T17:19:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	doesnt work? an error?
2010-12-20T17:19:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	do you know the error?
2010-12-20T17:21:00.000Z	rs0832	goodtime	ok.. check this out to downgrade back to 10.04
