2012-06-18T18:51:00.000Z	nicekiwi		im trying to set the permission on a .sh file, but the changes dont take effect weather i do them from consolr of the file manager. help?
2012-06-18T18:52:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	what kind of changes, and is the file system the file is one writeable and allowing these kind of changes?
2012-06-18T18:52:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	e.g. some file systems are noexec, so +x wouldn't work
2012-06-18T18:52:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	its a file in my user dir i just downloaded with git. I want to all myself to execute the file.
2012-06-18T18:53:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	ive been trying with chmod 764
2012-06-18T18:53:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	do you get any error messages?
2012-06-18T18:53:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	no
2012-06-18T18:54:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	and ls -l on the file gives you what?
2012-06-18T18:55:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	-rw------- 1 ezra ezra
2012-06-18T18:55:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	sure you are applying the changes on the right file?
2012-06-18T18:57:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	when i try to execue the sh file in console it says permission denied
2012-06-18T18:57:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	can I see the whole command you try to execute to change the permissions?
2012-06-18T18:58:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	http://pastebin.com/tdgHusra
2012-06-18T18:59:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	first of all, only sudo when needed. Then: ./build_all.sh  << this with the ./ won't work
2012-06-18T19:00:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	chmod u+rwx filename    would be correct
2012-06-18T19:00:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	as long as you are the owner, which, from the output above, I assume you are
2012-06-18T19:01:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	yeah.. well it dosnt work. I cant change the permissions and i cant run the sh file :(
2012-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	do you get any errors when doing  just a  chmod u+rwx build_all.sh?
2012-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	no
2012-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	and ls -l says what currently?
2012-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	same as before
2012-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicekiwi	if still not the right permissions: sure it's not on a filesystem which is mounted noexec?
2012-06-18T19:05:00.000Z	nicekiwi	Fuchs	hmm well that im not sure, but it wasnt actusally in my user dir. it was on a seperate disk, moving it to the home dir let me chnage it
