2011-02-06T07:45:00.000Z	hobbes	lighta	Install different linux versions on a hard drive so they get along, yet so they are easy to add and remove.
2011-02-06T07:48:00.000Z	hobbes	lighta	You can't install programs on a live CD, and live CD won't tell me how fast it will run off the hard drive. And if I am running a OS off a live CD on a regular bases, that is unnecessary wear on the DVD player, and I cant use the DVD player for other things if I am running a OS off it
2011-02-06T07:49:00.000Z	hobbes	lighta	all those are reasons to actually install on the HDD, and why shouldn't I actually install on the HDD?
