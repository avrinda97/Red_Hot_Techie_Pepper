2011-05-31T23:00:00.000Z	kubanc		is anyone familiar with this errors: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED
2011-05-31T23:00:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	some context would be useful
2011-05-31T23:01:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	http://paste.ubuntu.com/615456/
2011-05-31T23:03:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	which version of ubuntu?
2011-05-31T23:03:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	this thread may be useful: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/550559
2011-05-31T23:04:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	10.10. I had similiar simptoms in windows 7, but i could not get any log, so i installed a better OS, ubuntu ;), and now i have these logs
2011-05-31T23:17:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	changing from AHCI to IDE looks like this was the problem
2012-02-21T19:23:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	yes, of course.
2012-02-21T19:24:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	is there any tutorial how to set it up?
2012-02-21T19:24:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	well, there's not much to set up. you have an HBA that exports individual LUNs?
2012-02-21T19:25:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	most modern cards support exporting all drives as a jbod directly.
2012-02-21T19:26:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	i cannot create a JBOD with disks that are connected with IDE cable?
2012-02-21T19:27:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	jbod generally implies that each drive is accessed directly and independently, which would be the default for such an arrangement. did you perhaps mean something else?
2012-02-21T19:27:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	perhaps you mean a span?
2012-02-21T19:29:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	NO, i would like to connect hard drives with IDE cable to motherboard (i have an old computer), then i would like to put all the disks into JBOD, so the operating system will see all the disks as one partition...
2012-02-21T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	yes, a span :-) have a look for tutorials involving LVM.
2012-02-21T19:30:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	so span equals JBOD?
2012-02-21T19:31:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	not exactly. jbod is used to describe at least two different arrangements.
2012-02-21T19:31:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	have a look: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures
2012-02-21T19:32:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	might also be of use: http://www.davelachapelle.ca/guides/ubuntu-lvm-guide/
2012-02-21T19:32:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	already looking at it, looks like a good article to read :D
2012-02-21T19:38:00.000Z	kubanc	sipior	i also found http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/40702/how-to-manage-and-use-lvm-logical-volume-management-in-ubuntu/ . Thnx for help, i know now what to look for in google (LVM)...
2012-02-21T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	kubanc	yep, have fun.
