2006-09-01T13:57:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	I got disconnected.
2006-09-01T14:03:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	Are you still here?
2006-09-01T14:09:00.000Z	AstralJava	tjb	I'm here, was away for a bit, sorry. :)
2006-09-01T14:09:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	my name has changed
2006-09-01T14:10:00.000Z	[tjb] 		Man, this is so tricky.  Why must it be so hard to install a simple USB modem?
2006-09-01T14:10:00.000Z	[tjb] 		This is what I hate about Linux.  Something so trivial takes about 12 hours of my time, and then I just give up with it.
2006-09-01T14:12:00.000Z	[tjb] 		When I first put the Ubuntu CD in, it auto-ran (bringing up the package manager).  Now it won't.  How do I make it 'auto-run' again?
2006-09-01T14:12:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : Okay. Well, I don't know about that problem, but if the manufacturer doesn't care about linux, and doesn't publish the specs for that modem, then it's really up to the community to reverse-engineer the piece of hardware to see how it works. There are too many of such, to cover them all.
2006-09-01T14:13:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : Synaptic is the graphical package manager, you can find it in System | Administration menu.
2006-09-01T14:13:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	That has been done with this modem.  My complaint is that Ubuntu can't do it by default.
2006-09-01T14:13:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	So many people have asked about this on the Ubuntu forums.  I'm following the HOW-TO that someone there made, but I need more packages.  =/
2006-09-01T14:14:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : Okay, well if there's a how-to, I have nothing more on the issue. :)
2006-09-01T14:15:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	When I try to install the required package, it fails, telling me that I need 'hotplug' and 'pppoe'.
2006-09-01T14:16:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : And have you tried installing those first?
2006-09-01T14:17:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	I don't know how.  I can't even connect on there.
2006-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : sudo apt-get install hotplug pppoe
2006-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	DOesn't work.
2006-09-01T14:20:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	'Package hotplug is not available ... However the following packages replace it: udeb module-init-tools'
2006-09-01T14:21:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : Have you tried install what it suggests?
2006-09-01T14:22:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	Which suggestion?
2006-09-01T14:24:00.000Z	AstralJava		[tjb] : The packages apt says replace package hotplug?
2006-09-01T14:24:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	Actually, it tells me that whenever I try to install something that's already installed.
2006-09-01T14:24:00.000Z	[tjb] 	AstralJava	It started telling me that earlier when I tried to install hotplug and pppoe.  How can I stop it telling me that?
