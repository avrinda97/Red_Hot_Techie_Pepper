2010-07-03T00:51:00.000Z	juken		How do I remove pulseaudio completely and get install something that actually works?
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	juken		s/get//
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	maco	juken	you can uninstall it just fine. you'll then have to add yourself to the audio group and get used to the fact that there is no graphical volume mixer without pulseaudio
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	juken	maco	sounds good
2010-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	maco	juken	that sounds like a driver bug
2010-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	juken	maco	worked fine right after a fresh install, but once I rebooted it was gone.
2010-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	maco	juken	is this a usb headset or using the 1/8" jacks?
2010-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	juken	maco	USB
2010-07-03T01:00:00.000Z	maco	juken	ok so its a second sound device. the order of device enumeration in linux is nondeterministic. have you tried using pavucontrol to manually set which audio in (1/8" jack v. usb device) to use?

2010-07-03T01:01:00.000Z	juken	maco	those are pretty much the settings I'm using, but I've switched between a lot on alsamixer also trying different things.
2010-07-03T01:03:00.000Z	maco	juken	wow ive never seen that software before. i use kubuntu... but anyway, try installing pavucontrol. itll show open streams and you can click on the stream and set what device it should pull from
2010-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	maco	juken	i looked at your imgur. those arent pavucontrol...

2010-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	maco	juken	go to the recording tab
2010-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	juken	maco	when I go to the recording tab there is nothing there
2010-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	maco	juken	do you have a program running right now that is trying to record?
2010-07-03T01:05:00.000Z	juken	maco	I did before, I had sound recorder and skype.
2010-07-03T01:05:00.000Z	maco	juken	on those it should have a dropdown thing to pick the lifechat
2010-07-03T01:06:00.000Z	juken	maco	alright, one sec, let me reboot.
2010-07-03T01:06:00.000Z	maco	juken	im getting offline now though
2010-07-03T01:06:00.000Z	maco	juken	 im at work
2010-07-03T01:06:00.000Z	maco	juken	later on #ubuntu-audio-help may help out..
