2009-07-13T06:14:00.000Z	ndf		i'm having trouble with the live installer for 9.04; i put it on a usb stick and it worked the first time, but now it won't start the live distro or the install at all - i can't tell what's happening because usplash or whatever it is hides everything - the only signal i get that something is wrong is the progress bar stops 'night rider'ing and my caps lock light flashes - any ideas what this
2009-07-13T06:15:00.000Z	ndf		means?
2009-07-13T06:17:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	When you are looking at the menu you can hit F6 (I think) to get to alternative options.  Remove the word "quite" and the word "splash" to see what is going on behind the scenes :)
2009-07-13T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	When you are at the menu you can press F6 to set kernel options.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
2009-07-13T06:50:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	no
2009-07-13T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	Is this off a CD or usb?
2009-07-13T06:52:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Install2StartUp.png  not like this anymore?  See the F4 option?
2009-07-13T06:53:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	if you press escape at that menu; it loads a simplified one. that's all i get now.
2009-07-13T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	So you do see the menu I screen-shotted?
2009-07-13T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	Can you get a screen-shot of the simplified one?  Maybe google image search it?
2009-07-13T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	I don't think I've ever seen it
2009-07-13T06:57:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	I don't have a live CD.  Is there anyway to set kernel options in this menu?  Have you scoward the whole thing?  What you need to do is turn off the splash and quiet options so that you can see the errors during your boot.
2009-07-13T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	I'm sorry I didn't see that *sheepish*
2009-07-13T06:59:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	Then I suggest you check the filesystem of the usb stick.  Do you have a working ubuntu install or a live CD ?
2009-07-13T07:00:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	this worked the first time, and i've re-imaged and integrity checked the live on the usb stick a couple of times to make sure it's fine
2009-07-13T07:01:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	That is strange.  Do you have faulty hardware somewhere in your machine?  i know that live CD's won't boot if you have a fried network card or something.
2009-07-13T07:01:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	no it does this on every machine i put the stick in
2009-07-13T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	I have no idea.  Perhaps the stick is physically damaged?
2009-07-13T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	Sorry I'm not more help :(
2009-07-13T07:03:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	surely the integrity check (md5 on each file) suggests there's no damage?
2009-07-13T07:03:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	It was just a shot in the dark.  a good md5 checksum does seem to mean the disk is fine.  Like I said. I don't know what the issue could be :(
2009-07-13T07:11:00.000Z	ndf	edbian	lol after re-imaging again this time i didn't even see a boot menu at all, it was entirely replaced by unetbootin's own implementation, and it booted right away! what the fffffffff?
2009-07-13T07:12:00.000Z	edbian	ndf	Maybe a bug in unetbootin?  I have no clue
