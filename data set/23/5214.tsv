2007-01-17T12:49:00.000Z	chazco		hi, can someone tell me to exit Gnome and drop to a console?
2007-01-17T12:49:00.000Z	chazco		i need the RAM for a big build project
2007-01-17T12:49:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	it's as i said (or sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop for that matter)
2007-03-31T13:34:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	at the GRUB menu, select your kernel, hit "e", go to the kernel command line, hit "e", add "profile" to the list of options, hit "b" to boot
2007-03-31T13:35:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	that will generate statistics of the order files are accessed at startup, and later exploit that information to load them in an optimized order
2007-03-31T13:36:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	if you don't normally see it, then hit Esc like mad just after the BIOS hands off control
2007-12-03T19:11:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	- so theres no way to bypass it when it happens though? I'm using a laptop, and it can be annoying when it decides to fsck 120GB filesystem on battery before a presentation
2007-12-03T19:12:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	no, when it starts it must be left running, otherwise it may *break* the filesystem
2007-12-03T19:12:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	well, just tell it to never fsck at all, and remember to do it manually once in a while
2007-12-03T19:15:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	a quick look at the relevant /etc/init.d scripts seems to tell me that fsck is not run when on battery power
2007-12-03T19:30:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	- which init.d script was the battery test in?
2007-12-03T19:30:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	both checkfs.sh and checkroot.sh
2007-12-19T02:29:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	i think it has been pulled even from -proposed because of other problems. i think you should be patient
2008-01-10T20:39:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothDialup - this is for bluetooth but it's probably mostly applicable to usb as well
2008-01-16T21:09:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	well, that's because it's mainly the ones i've found :)
2008-01-16T21:10:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	if you or someone else has other suggestions (better if it's stuff that is in the repositories), please update that bot factoid
2009-04-17T02:25:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	- Yep, tried me-tv... had problems tuning in though (generating a channel list). Thanks :)
2009-04-25T02:46:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	no
2009-04-25T02:50:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	/ dr_willis - I have a separate /home (still ext3), will there be any issues using it on 8.10 if 9.04 applications have used it (ie, config file issues)?
2009-04-25T02:50:00.000Z	LjL	chazco	i don't know, it's possible
2009-04-25T02:50:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	- Ah okay, thanks anyway
2009-10-26T22:32:00.000Z	chazco	LjL	- I tried using the ubuntu-bug tool - it makes you register...
