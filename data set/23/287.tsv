2012-01-23T23:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_nooblet		Hello guys, I have been down a pretty deep rabbit hole here. Hoping someone can pull me back out...
2012-01-23T23:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_nooblet		First problem was that I can't remember the password, 2nd issue is apparantly there was no GKSU or GKSUDO provided with 11.04 so I can't even follow the instructions I have here.
2012-01-23T23:37:00.000Z	ubuntu_nooblet		I downloaded the gksu-2.0.2.tar.gz and extracted it.... don't see anything with GKSU that is runnable, just opens a text file when I double click it
2012-01-23T23:37:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	You need to use apt-get to install gksu... And Ubuntu DOES come with it.
2012-01-23T23:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_nooblet	theadmin	can you describe real quick the app-get command to install it? I have been on this for so long not sure I have time to read that
2012-01-23T23:40:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	sudo apt-get install gksu
2012-01-23T23:40:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	But you need your password for that...
2012-01-23T23:42:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Oh, that. It's asking for your login password most likely.
2012-01-23T23:43:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	It doesn't allow blank passwords.
2012-01-23T23:43:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Yeah, basically anything that's longer than 0 symbols xD But... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword
2012-01-23T23:45:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	To recover your password? Yes, you need to be on live.
2012-01-23T23:45:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	That, or recovery mode, doesn't really matter
2012-01-23T23:46:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Eh, well, not the problem right now, what we want right now is chroot into your installed OS and change your password.
2012-01-23T23:47:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	It won't be there...
2012-01-23T23:47:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Ugh, never mind, look, I can't really help you right now >.< Sorry.
2012-01-23T23:48:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	/usr/bin of course, like any other binary
2012-01-23T23:51:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	That doesn't make sense... You need to install gksu... "sudo apt-get install gksu". From a TERMINAL, not Alt+F2.
2012-01-23T23:54:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Err... You're not using Ubuntu.
2012-01-23T23:54:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	And that means we can't support you here.
2012-01-23T23:54:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	...Gnome IS used in Ubuntu, although it's not the same thing as Ubuntu.
2012-01-23T23:56:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	You are using SuSE, not Ubuntu, okay?...
2012-01-23T23:56:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Only SuSE gives messages like those. Ask in their support channel...
2012-01-23T23:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu_nooblet	Is #suse (on Freenode)
