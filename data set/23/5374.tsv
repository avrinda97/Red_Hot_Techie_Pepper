2007-01-07T11:55:00.000Z	edgy		Hi, I installed k3d and it's now giving some erros every time I run apt-get. I tried to remove it with sudo dpkg --remove k3d but it's giving errors like "subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1" how am I supposed to remove such packages in ubuntu?

2007-01-07T11:58:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	ok, I thought you were trying to burn CDs with k3b, sorry.
2007-01-07T12:01:00.000Z	edgy	n2diy	but whatever the package is I should be able to remove it, no?
2007-01-07T12:01:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	yes, maybe you need to use sudo though?
2007-01-09T13:19:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	take a look at man loadkeys.
2007-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	looks like you are missing a space, try  $f  -ext
2007-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	what generates that?
2007-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	edgy	n2diy	for f in '*.ext'; do cat $f > $f\-ext2; done; ls *ext2
2007-02-24T13:24:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	ok, I'm lost, gl
2007-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	edgy	n2diy	i have a file foo.ext and I want to say rename it to foo-new.ext

2007-02-24T13:32:00.000Z	edgy	n2diy	arrenlex: the issue is I need to create files with content generated from a pipe
2007-02-24T13:33:00.000Z	n2diy	edgy	you can do that with pipes, check out "man pipes or pipe"
