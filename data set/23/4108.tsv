2007-12-31T21:14:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	doesnt "blkid" give that as well?
2007-12-31T21:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	He wanted drive specific as the other command was not specific enough and included all drives
2007-12-31T21:16:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	yep youre right.. btw i was trying to use "blkid" and ubuntu said that the application crashed.. isnt that weird?
2007-12-31T21:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Odd,
2007-12-31T21:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	You may want to check out those partitions and make sure they are ok
2007-12-31T21:18:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	yea i was having issues with a new SATA drive.. maybe thats the cause
2007-12-31T21:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Consider it a warning shot...   and deal with it asap
2007-12-31T21:19:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	well kind of a nice warning shot as i am currently unable to boot Gutsy.. :(
2007-12-31T21:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	If you need help we will do what we can.  Hopefully you were not running it under wubi or in a vm that went very wrong
2007-12-31T21:22:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	no i just got a new hard drive (SATA) and i wanted to install Gutsy on it.. the installation went just fine but when Grub came up after a reboot i was unable to boot into ubuntu
2007-12-31T21:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Multiple drives? or single  and did you get to a cli/terminal prompt
2007-12-31T21:24:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	yes two hard drives, two partitions each (sda1,sda2,sdb1,sdb2) and yeah i am able to start the ubuntu live CD so i can use the terminal
2007-12-31T21:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Then grub didnt get installed to the right place..  Dual booting as well...?
2007-12-31T21:25:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	yes dualbooting indeed.. i wonder how grub could be installed to the wrong place as it is showing up and i can boot into XP from there
2007-12-31T21:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Then something is wrong past that in your setup.  Did you add the drive after the install?
2007-12-31T21:27:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	no.. i can even access it from the live cd and as far as i can see (im a linux newb hehe) the installation went fine and ubuntu is completely there
2007-12-31T21:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	I need to run, but others here can help better than I can with grub and dual drives.. it is a common problem.. just not one I know the answer to on how to fix it
2007-12-31T21:27:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	okay.. thanks anyway and cya
2007-12-31T21:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	It is a simple edit to grub...   just not "My Thing"
2007-12-31T21:28:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	hehe sure .. bye
2007-12-31T21:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	Post your grub/menu.lst to the pastebin for people to check it over.. not in this channel.. then give us the link to your file
2007-12-31T21:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	c4liforNia	welcome to Ubuntu.. See you soon
2007-12-31T21:34:00.000Z	c4liforNia	Jack_Sparrow	yeah thanks.. im looking forward to using it and the community (: bye
