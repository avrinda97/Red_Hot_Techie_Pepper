2005-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	Mez		ah ok
2005-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	Mez		so... now what to do
2005-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	have you altered your default runlevels?
2005-05-18T10:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	type `runlevel ` in a term and tell me the output
2005-05-18T10:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	sudo telinit 2
2005-05-18T10:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	you shouldn't be in runlevel 5
2005-05-18T10:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	ubuntu uses debian conventions: runlevel 5 isn't used normally
2005-05-18T10:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	yes, confusing I know
2005-05-18T10:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	your inittab looked fine
2005-05-18T10:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	or what i saw looked fine
2005-05-18T10:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	it's always a good idea to know the distro before you change fundamental system files ;-)
2005-05-18T11:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	erm... no Gentoo is most definitely NOT Debian based
2005-06-18T08:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	the 2x swap rule is rather outdated now, with so many people having buckets of RAM
2005-06-18T08:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	OK :)
2005-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	Mez	thoreauputic	backports dont neccessarily cause breakage :D
2005-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	hrm <cough> If you'd been around here a few times when they did....
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	Mez	thoreauputic	yeah, but how long ago that was?
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	Mez	thoreauputic	so far they've not caused a single problem with my system
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	couple of weeks
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	lucky you
2005-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	Mez	thoreauputic	backports is technically not 3rd party
2005-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	not any more - right - I really meant the old ones...
2005-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mez	fair point ;)
