2007-07-09T05:20:00.000Z	revilodraw		hi! im using the edgy livecd now so i can get help to load my feisty which is installed on the hd, but havent been able ti use yet because when i do i get x problems
2007-07-09T05:21:00.000Z	Romnous	revilodraw	you can't load feisty??
2007-07-09T05:22:00.000Z	revilodraw		romnous; that is correct.. i installed it last night from the update manager, and when it restarted i got a bliue screen telling me of x problems and that there are no screens found (which i found quite ironic)
2007-07-09T05:23:00.000Z	Romnous		you might format your partition, dl the cd and install it from the cd
2007-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	revilodraw		romnous; i think there will be a much easier fix than that
2007-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	Romnous		xD = smiley
2007-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	Romnous	revilodraw	i'm sure there is, but that one is the most effective
2007-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	Romnous		darter: turn it 90 degrees to the right
2007-07-09T05:26:00.000Z	Romnous		or move your head to the left :P
2007-07-09T05:26:00.000Z	Romnous	revilodraw	you got an ubuntu-distro working with the same system before ??
2007-07-09T05:26:00.000Z	revilodraw		im using the livecd, how do i open my xorg.conf file that is stored on my hard drive
2007-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	revilodraw		romnous; yes i did, dapper and edgy
2007-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	Romnous		hmm :/
2007-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	Romnous		you can access the hdd through File Browser from the lifedisc
2007-07-09T05:27:00.000Z	Romnous		the log file you talked about which was irritating you, seek it in your hdd
2007-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	Romnous		hmm :/
2007-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	Romnous		what's the name of the log file?
2007-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	revilodraw	Romnous	you can access the hdd through File Browser from the lifedisc?? can u elaborate pls?
