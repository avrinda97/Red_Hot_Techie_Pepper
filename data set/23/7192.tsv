2005-10-25T16:35:00.000Z	chris86wm		is there a place where i could get all the screens that pop up during the ubuntu install?
2005-10-25T06:15:00.000Z	chris86wm		hey guys, is there another distro that is similar to ubuntu?
2005-10-25T06:16:00.000Z	chris86wm		i cant seem to get ubuntu to install on my laptop so i have to find another distro :(
2005-10-25T06:16:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	ubuntu's laptop support is top-notch
2005-10-25T06:17:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	when i go to install, on the select keyboard screen it keeps scrolling like the screen is messed up
2005-10-25T06:18:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	did you check the md5sum of the install image before burning it to CD?
2005-10-25T06:18:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	well no, but i burned multiple copies of ubuntu live/install kubuntu live/install and none worked. but they did work on my desktop
2005-10-25T06:19:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	I see.  Which laptop?  Did you try any kernel parameters?
2005-10-25T06:19:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	inspiron 6000 and no
2005-10-25T06:20:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	i did get the live cd to boot by pressing enter a bunch of times without reading the text
2005-10-25T06:20:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	what make/model of laptop?
2005-10-25T06:20:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	dell Inspiron 6000
2005-10-25T06:20:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	u need the specs?
2005-10-25T06:20:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	that should be working with the install CD
2005-10-25T06:21:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	i know, its listed as compatable
2005-10-25T06:22:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	i believe it will work once installed, but i cant install it because i cant read the text during the install because of the scrolling
2005-10-25T06:22:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	check here for any info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron6000-2
2005-10-25T06:24:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	could i hook up an external monitor to it? would that work?
2005-10-25T06:24:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	you can try that
2005-10-25T06:24:00.000Z	tritium	chris86wm	is your laptop similar to the one in that URL?
2005-10-25T06:27:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	yes it is
2005-10-25T06:28:00.000Z	chris86wm	tritium	external monitor didnt pick up btw
