2009-05-13T07:07:00.000Z	kerin		i have a second display set up through nvidia-settings - it doesn't work.  the screen is black, but when I move my mouse to the other screen I can see the pointer on the second screen.
2009-05-13T07:08:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 ok which nvidia card specifically and which driver version
2009-05-13T07:09:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	gtx260/driver 180.
2009-05-13T07:09:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 also when you open nvidia-settings and go to xserver display configuration are both monitors shown?
2009-05-13T07:09:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 do you have a background image on the desktop?
2009-05-13T07:09:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	i do not.
2009-05-13T07:10:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 ok  first open a terminal  and paste this     glxinfo -l |grep MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
2009-05-13T07:10:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 just tell me the max texture size on the readout
2009-05-13T07:10:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	8192
2009-05-13T07:11:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 oo nice  you really shouldnt have too much issue with max texture size then
2009-05-13T07:11:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 in terminal   lspci | grep -i vga
2009-05-13T07:11:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	since i can move my pointer over there at all - and because it worked flawlessly in both 8.10 and the same install dist-upgraded to 9.04 - it isn't a hardware issue.
2009-05-13T07:12:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 no but I wanted to check exact card version before searching
2009-05-13T07:13:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 are you setting the dual monitor manually via nvidia-settings?
2009-05-13T07:14:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 and you do need to run this as twinview
2009-05-13T07:14:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	yes.  although, again.  i'm using a known good con-
2009-05-13T07:14:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	no, i do not.  twinview is not what i'm looking for.
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 ok then you will have some issues with separate xscreens  and I never use separate xscreens so I wont be able to trouble shoot this
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	this is apparent.  thank you anyway.
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 although with twinview  windows will open only on the primary monitor  until you drag them to seondary monitor
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 they will also maximize only on the primary
2009-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	coz_	kerin	 that can be changed in xorg.conf
2009-05-13T07:16:00.000Z	kerin	coz_	again.  you don't understand the problem.  evidently i have come to the wrong place.
