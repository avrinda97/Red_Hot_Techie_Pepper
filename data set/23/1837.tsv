2009-10-08T07:30:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	do you mean a backtrace from a crash?
2009-10-08T07:35:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	yeah
2009-10-08T07:36:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	you could pastebin it here & we can look, but it might need a kernel geek to really tell you what's going on...
2009-10-08T07:36:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	can i pm u with the lines?
2009-10-08T07:37:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	definitely not. You can pastebin it to  http://paste.ubuntu.com like all decent folk.
2009-10-08T07:37:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	ok, its posted
2009-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	now you need to tell us the url...
2009-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	http://paste.ubuntu.com/288255/
2009-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	checked it yet?
2009-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	looking now. You'd think a pornstar would have more patience...
2009-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	lol just curious
2009-10-08T07:44:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	Hmm, Bad news. Your system tried to read a block from the disk, the block was faulty so the drive tried to move (reallocate) the block to a spare block. Apparently that realloction attempt failed, so the read failed. That's bad because drives usually have a bunch of spare blocks, and reallocations usually succeed without you noticing. The fact that yours failed means the drive is unreliable. Start backing up anything you can't
2009-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	ugh
2009-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	thats verybad news
2009-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	what could've caused that
2009-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	no, the really bad news would be you here on this channel saying: my drive failed without any warning and I lost all my data. You actually caught a break here...
2009-10-08T07:47:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	ill run e2fsck -f -c -v /dev/sda1
2009-10-08T07:51:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	Personally, I would run 'sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda' to find the model number, then download & run the manufacturers diagnostic disk. If you don't want to do that, at least look at the SMART data for the drive http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.
2009-10-08T07:52:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	can this problem may be caused by overheating?
2009-10-08T07:53:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	the cause is probably nothing special. Disks just go bad, what with all those high-tolerance moving parts inside. If you've ever dropped your laptop, that doesn't help either. Overheating probably *isn't* the cause. Either way. manufactures diagnostic disk...
2009-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	pornstar	losha	i always take very good care of my computers...
2009-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	losha	pornstar	what can I tell you. Disks go bad. Every day. Like teenagers with drug problems...
