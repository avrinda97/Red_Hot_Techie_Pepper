2009-01-30T15:55:00.000Z	lesshate		hi
2009-01-30T15:55:00.000Z	lesshate		X now just comes up with a black blank screen since I did the last intrepid update
2009-01-30T15:56:00.000Z	lesshate		I am using the intel driver
2009-01-30T15:56:00.000Z	lesshate		how can I get X to start?
2009-01-30T15:56:00.000Z	lesshate		the error message in the logs is "underrun pipe B" it seems
2009-01-30T15:58:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	i think if you type startx
2009-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	go on
2009-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	looking it up now
2009-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	thanks! I am in a virtual terminal :(
2009-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	looking stuff up is a little tricky
2009-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	try typeing that first and see what happens ?
2009-01-30T16:02:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	try typing startx?? The problem is that X comes up blank
2009-01-30T16:04:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	um I would type locate xorg.conf and check to see what video thing it's loading <open that file as admin>
2009-01-30T16:05:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	intel
2009-01-30T16:07:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	try changing that to um instead of intel to -> Device      "VESA Framebuffer"
2009-01-30T16:08:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	and under that try putting this DefaultDepth 16
2009-01-30T16:13:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	you need to change it first save it then reset the X cntrl+alt+bckspace then it can take effect
2009-01-30T16:17:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	the same xorg.conf -> where it says Section "InputDevice" Identifier     "Mouse0       and add Driver         "mouse"
2009-01-30T16:18:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	how is xorg.conf related to a virtual terminal if X isn't running??
2009-01-30T16:19:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	your going to have to tell us those sections of what it says in the Xorg config for the device you want to use the Section of the Name of the Device it's currently using
2009-01-30T16:19:00.000Z	lesshate	rainmanp7	?? in any case.. they are paste binned aboce
2009-01-30T16:29:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	can I ask if it worked before (-What Changed-) to make it not work now ?
2009-01-30T16:37:00.000Z	rainmanp7	lesshate	Congrats!
