2008-12-16T21:36:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	yes that is correct
2008-12-16T21:29:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	/boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2008-12-16T21:30:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	is that the startup script for everything?
2008-12-16T21:30:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	for the boot loader
2008-12-16T21:31:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	thanks
2008-12-16T21:34:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	uhm, menu.1st is a configuration file for grub rather than a batch file?
2008-12-16T21:36:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	is that really the place to choose the preffered swap area?
2008-12-16T21:38:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	I dunno maybe I read wrong what are you trying to do again ??
2008-12-16T21:38:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	i want to force ubuntu to use my /dev/sdb1 partition instead of my /dev/sda3 for swapping
2008-12-16T21:38:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	that is in /etc/fstab
2008-12-16T21:39:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	in fact, i've got two swap partitions
2008-12-16T21:39:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	one created later by myself
2008-12-16T21:39:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	now i want to convince ubuntu to suddenly use this new swap drive
2008-12-16T21:41:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	that is in /etc/fstab
2008-12-16T21:45:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	sorry for bothering you further but do you think i could just exchange the text "/dev/sda3" with my desired "/dev/sdb1"?
2008-12-16T21:45:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	in my fstab, http://pastebin.com/m433cb313
2008-12-16T21:47:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	you sure.  worst that can happen is you reboot with no swap and switch it back
2008-12-16T21:47:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	my biggest concern is the gooey after "/dev/sda3"
2008-12-16T21:48:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	 oh you need the UUID
2008-12-16T21:49:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	  sudo blkid
2008-12-16T21:49:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	i realize now that the UUID thing is smart, since the device name might change from time to time
2008-12-16T21:50:00.000Z	mr_boo	hwilde	many, many thanks
2008-12-16T21:50:00.000Z	hwilde	mr_boo	  sudo blkid      you should get somethin like   /dev/sda5: TYPE="swap" UUID="5c60b197-d30d-402d-b6ec-89b9a034649e"
