2011-04-10T08:23:00.000Z	AaeRohn		I've tried the compile help, I still cannot install this driver, I still do not know how
2011-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	which driver?
2011-04-10T08:26:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	it's a driver for my vistablet, xf86 input wacom 0.10.9
2011-04-10T08:26:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	if I cant get my tablet working, I can't make money on my side art commissions
2011-04-10T08:27:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	what is wrong with this driver?
2011-04-10T08:28:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	I cannot install it, I do not know how, I even went through a compile help/tutorial thing
2011-04-10T08:28:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	try sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-wacom
2011-04-10T08:29:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	I am not brave enough to compile an xorg driver... Just use the premade one.
2011-04-10T08:31:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	pksadiq: there is no driver in the way smw told me to get it, and I have the tar.bz2 file I was only able to find
2011-04-10T08:31:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	it should already be installed...
2011-04-10T08:32:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	if it was already installed, my tablet would work properly
2011-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	did you try the restricted drivers manager?
2011-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	the what
2011-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	system -> administration -> additional drivers
2011-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	after you plug in the device of course.
2011-06-11T07:02:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	actionparsnip: take note, my ubuntu computer has no internet until I get it to work, I am on my brother's computer and mine atm *goes with smw's suggestin first*
2011-06-11T07:03:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	if you have no internet, how do you plan to install the drivers? lol
2011-06-11T07:04:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	I cant use the disc that came with the adapter?
2011-06-11T07:04:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	actionparsnip: it's not a card btw, it's a usb adapter
2011-06-11T07:05:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	no, that is not possible
2011-06-11T07:05:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	the disk was made for windows
2011-06-11T07:06:00.000Z	AaeRohn	smw	so even if I were to go and get an actual wireless card, I would still need internet to get a driver so I can get on the internet?
2011-06-11T07:06:00.000Z	smw	AaeRohn	unless the card has a driver installed in linux. Many cards work out of the box.
