2012-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	DoctorD90		i let's try ^^
2012-09-18T18:47:00.000Z	L3top	DoctorD90	learn to execute scripts you are working on with: bash -x /path/to/script.sh     will often expose the problem.
2012-09-18T18:47:00.000Z	DoctorD90	L3top	i use chmod +x script     the first time..then no more :)
2012-09-18T18:47:00.000Z	DoctorD90		maybe is differente
2012-09-18T18:48:00.000Z	L3top	DoctorD90	very different... this bash -x illiterates everything it is doing. Try it and see.
2012-09-18T18:49:00.000Z	DoctorD90		^^ THX ^^ im looking for a thing like this ^^ thx!
2012-09-18T18:53:00.000Z	L3top	DoctorD90	bash -n will quickly tell if there are any big problems without actually running the script as well. If there is no return then it is not broken... however it may not function as you desire ;)
