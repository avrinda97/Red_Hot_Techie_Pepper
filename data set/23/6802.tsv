2006-01-06T17:46:00.000Z	Shadyman		Hey guys, my wpa_supplicant is just about connecting, but it says authentication time out. it finds the AP, associates, then times out on auth
2006-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	Kensey	Shadyman	you using TKIP or AES?
2006-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	TKIP
2006-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	WPA-PSK
2006-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	ASCII
2006-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	You suggest pregen?
2006-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	OK :)
2006-01-06T17:52:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	I'll keep that in mind ;)
2006-01-06T17:53:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	In the wpa_supplicant.conf, you can make it try them one by one in the order they're in teh file
2006-01-06T17:54:00.000Z	Kensey	Shadyman	I want it to let me use the regular tools to connect to arbitrary networks :)
2006-01-06T17:54:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Ah.
2006-01-06T17:54:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	You don't have WPA_GUI do you?
2006-01-06T17:55:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	It's a gui for wpa supplicant instead of having to use wpa_cli.
2006-01-06T17:56:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Nope.
2006-01-06T17:56:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	It's actually part of the wpa_supplicant source, but doesn't compile by default.
2006-01-06T17:57:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	I've yet to find out how to compile.
2006-01-06T17:59:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Woo! the hex key worked :D
2006-01-06T17:59:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	But then, so did the ascii one, yesterday :P
2006-01-06T17:59:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	ASCII prefix? I did key="whatever"
2006-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Blonde typingn moment.
2006-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	I'll have to restart and see what happens.
2006-01-06T06:01:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Also, I've got wired and wireless on my laptop. If i don't plug in the wired, it takes 5 minutes trying to find the wired connection. What do you set it to for enabled/disabled connections at boot time?
2006-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	Shadyman	Kensey	Where do you activate wpa_supplicant? on login?
