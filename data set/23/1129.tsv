2011-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	This guide is written for an older version of Ubuntu, so we may need to make some changes.
2011-04-06T10:04:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	What guide are you following?
2011-04-06T10:15:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	Hey, I'm looking at it now.
2011-04-06T10:16:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2011-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	Ummmm, I would hope you mean 10.04
2011-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	Ok
2011-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	What happens when you type "sudo ./wireless" ?
2011-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	Ok, let's make this simple then :)
2011-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	So you extracted the tar.bz file then?
2011-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	Ok, so let's make this simple. You right-click and choose "Extract here"
2011-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	leave the second compressed file there, do not extract it
2011-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	rypervenche	Rigadoog	I know, I am just trying to make sure we are not making any mistakes anywhere. Shall we continue this in a private chat maybe? So we don't spam people here.
