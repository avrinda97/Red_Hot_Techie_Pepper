2008-11-03T18:41:00.000Z	Deiselton		hey guys is there a way when ubuntu starts up to get X11 and my nvidia drivers to execute s simple if statment that says: if(2 displays are detected){use display thats not my laptop LCD and disable laptop LCD} ?
2008-11-03T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	I've done that int he past with dccprobe
2008-11-03T18:47:00.000Z	Deiselton	ikonia	how does that work?...
2008-11-03T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	I put an init script before X that basiclly did a dcc probe, if it returned 1 result (laptop screen) set xorg config to xorg.conf.laptop if it detected more than one set xorg.conf to xorg.conf.multihead
2008-11-03T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	thats a little obsolete now with xorg being dynamic
2008-11-17T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	yes you can do that, I used to do it with a docked/undocked laptop
2008-11-17T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	I think I did it from edid information, I did an if edied = blah then copy xorg.dual xorg.conf else copy xorg.single xorg.conf
2008-11-17T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	thats right
2008-11-17T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	set it to execute before the gdm init script
2008-11-17T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	/etc/init.d
2008-11-17T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	ddcprobe sorry
2008-11-17T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	ignore ddcprobe - that wasn't for you
2008-11-17T19:10:00.000Z	Deiselton	ikonia	yeah got it... have to install the xresprobe first
2008-11-17T19:11:00.000Z	Deiselton	ikonia	ddcprobe as far as i can tell doesnt show anyhting as far as monitors or display devices... what am i looking for?
2008-11-17T19:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	if should output edid info for montiors
2008-11-17T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	ktorrent is a torrent program ?
2008-11-17T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	why would that have a monitor information detection command
2008-11-17T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	I have no idea what he's on about then
2008-11-17T19:20:00.000Z	Deiselton	ikonia	through articles i verified that edit and xresprobe is not used in ubuntu 7 and later... but none of them say what replaces it....
2008-11-17T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	they are not used, but you can use them to detect a monitor
2008-11-17T19:22:00.000Z	Deiselton	ikonia	http://pastebin.ca/1259279
2008-11-17T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	thats frusting, let me see if I can figure out another way to do it
2008-11-17T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Deiselton	depends on the software how it's referened
