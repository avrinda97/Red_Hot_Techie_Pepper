2008-03-25T20:31:00.000Z	GillaGal		Any idea why the window border disappears when using Emerald theme?
2008-03-25T20:33:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	try alt-f2 and typing emerald --replace
2008-03-25T20:33:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	alt-F2 don't bring up the run window
2008-03-25T20:34:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	use the terminal then
2008-03-25T20:35:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	  Well that's yet another issue... when I try launching a term window, it's all white... can't type it in.
2008-03-25T20:37:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	That's a separate issue? Which version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-03-25T20:38:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 7.10    Everything was working fine... till I added dual monitors today.  Now Emerald isn't working (no top to windows) and my term windows are all white, can't type in them.
2008-03-25T20:40:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	only your terminal windows are white? That's really odd
2008-03-25T20:41:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 yes.  everything else works...   might have something to do with emerald and transparent windows.
2008-03-25T20:42:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	I was just about to say that. Try setting your terminal to solid color
2008-03-25T20:43:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 where do I set that?
2008-03-25T20:44:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	in the terminal "Edit > Current profile > effects"
2008-03-25T20:45:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	and check "none (use solid color)"
2008-03-25T20:45:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 lol  Umm... back to the initial problem then.... NO window borders.
2008-03-25T20:46:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 The whole term window is white... can't see the edit, close, etc...
2008-03-25T20:47:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	We need a working terminal or run application box to solve the original problem ;)
2008-03-25T20:53:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	Try adding Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True" to the device section in xorg.conf.
2008-03-25T20:54:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 ok.... brb
2008-03-25T21:19:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 I got my terms back.... added a few things to the xorg conf.....  still no window borders tho, tried emerald --replace.
2008-03-25T21:21:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	what's the terminal output when you type emerald --replace?
2008-03-25T21:22:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 nothing.... it just sits there.
2008-03-25T21:23:00.000Z	captainm	GillaGal	hmm, I'm out of ideas. You could try reinstalling emerald altogether.
2008-03-25T21:23:00.000Z	GillaGal	captainm	 ok thanks
