2007-04-04T10:55:00.000Z	sipior	ben	have you specified the correct settings in Systems -> Preferences -> Multimedia Selector?
2007-04-04T10:56:00.000Z	ben	sipior	i dont have Multimedia Selector menu!
2007-04-04T10:56:00.000Z	ben	sipior	I'm using ubuntu 6.10
2007-04-04T10:57:00.000Z	sipior	ben	might be called Multimedia Systems Selector, and you might have to use the menu editor to activate it, as it might not be by default
2007-04-04T10:57:00.000Z	ben	sipior	how do i activate it?
2007-04-04T10:58:00.000Z	ben	sipior	all the available menus are activated
2007-04-04T11:00:00.000Z	sipior	ben	try System -> Preferences -> Menu Layout
2007-04-04T11:01:00.000Z	ben	sipior	all menus are activated
2007-04-04T11:01:00.000Z	sipior	ben	then you're out of luck, sorry :)
2007-04-04T11:01:00.000Z	ben	sipior	but how do i activate my three speakers?
2007-04-04T11:02:00.000Z	ben	sipior	only front two speakers and front two are working!
2007-04-04T11:02:00.000Z	ben	sipior	only front two speakers and woofer are working
2007-04-04T11:02:00.000Z	sipior	ben	my guess is that you need to select the appropriate media system from the menu. if you can not find the application for that, you can try googling for your card and see if someone has come up with a solution
2007-04-04T11:04:00.000Z	ben	sipior	but my soundcard is supported by alsa. i confirmed it from their sire
2007-04-04T11:04:00.000Z	ben	sipior	*site
2007-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	sipior	ben	the card maybe supported, but in 5.1?
2007-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	ben	sipior	but how do i check that?
2007-04-04T11:11:00.000Z	sipior	ben	they should have a web page for the card itself, and it should mention whether 5.1 support is there
2007-04-04T11:12:00.000Z	ben	sipior	thanks sipior.Let me check that
2007-04-04T11:12:00.000Z	sipior	ben	good luck
