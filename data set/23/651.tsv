2012-03-26T00:32:00.000Z	lisa_		how easy would it be for someone to break into my Ubuntu and gather my personal files in HOME if I am using a 10 character password?
2012-03-26T00:33:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	bad question. "password12" is pretty easy to guess
2012-03-26T00:33:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	my password is "thedogatethecat"  is that ok?
2012-03-26T00:34:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	there are a bunch. there is a gnome 3 shell extension on extensions.gnome.org but there are many others
2012-03-26T00:34:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	name ?
2012-03-26T00:34:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	don't remember. i think a lot of this shows up when you search for gtg
2012-03-26T00:35:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	rather gtd "getting things done"
2012-03-26T00:36:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	pomodoro
2012-03-26T00:37:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	whats pomodoro do?
2012-03-26T00:38:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	no thats what these applications are called. pomodoro timeers
2012-03-26T00:38:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	ever heard of Workrave? I want something similar to remind me ever 30 minutes to take a break
2012-03-26T01:05:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	unless you are running a proxy server it would be inside your $HOME
2012-03-26T01:10:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	things can leak through files in /tmp and the swap, but the swap is encrypted by default which leaves the /tmp.
2012-03-26T01:10:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	when I installed Ubuntu yesterday it never asked about creating a swap file
2012-03-26T01:11:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	where is the /tmp located and how can I clean it daily?
2012-03-26T01:11:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	in general encrypted home is probably good enough. if someone really wanted your passwords they would find other ways to get the data
2012-03-26T01:13:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	you should try looking for some of these things yourself. open up synaptic or the software center and see what text editors are listed and then go to those websites and see what features they have
2012-03-26T01:13:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	okl
2012-03-26T01:20:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	in general backing up the system files is not useful. if you hardware fails its not likely you will put a new disk in the same hardware and have everything identical to what it was before. so better to backup your /etc with etc-keeper, and use !clone and backup your $HOME
2012-03-26T01:20:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	i dont follow, thats complicated what you said,. im confused
2012-03-26T01:22:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	suppose your laptop hardware fails in some way. what will you do? replace the failed piece of hardware or just buy a new laptop... more likely the later, so use the backup utilities to backup $HOME, and use !clone to record what you installed and install and use etc-keeper to backup special changes you might make to /etc
2012-03-26T01:23:00.000Z	lisa_	escott	that sounds good but the problem is I cannot understand what you said
2012-03-26T01:24:00.000Z	escott	lisa_	you should never download something from a webpage. clonezilla is in apt
