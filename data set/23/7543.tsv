2006-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	wladston		Guys ... I want to understand something .... why isn't the universe and multiverse installed by default ??
2006-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	wladston		hum ....
2006-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	wladston	because they contain software that is not absolutely open source
2006-04-10T08:14:00.000Z	wladston		sure ... but ... Why don't you guys at least make it clear on the "Add Applications" ?
2006-04-10T08:15:00.000Z	wladston		so people can know they have some missing packs ..
2006-04-10T08:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	wladston	they start to get into legal waters, waters they would just as soon avoid
2006-04-10T08:16:00.000Z	wladston		I wanted to install gmail-notify and took a long time to figure out how to do it via apt-get . Like me, there are lots of users that don't know what do do after searching a packet and not finding it ...
2006-04-10T08:16:00.000Z	wladston		Maybe not include by default, but a warning there should be useful ...
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		yeah  - all time "nothing found"
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		but now I installed via apt-get
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		after enabling the repositories...
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		strange them ... O.o
2006-04-10T08:18:00.000Z	wladston		ok .. wait a bit Orbin ...
2006-04-10T08:20:00.000Z	wladston		Orbin : yeah, it's there ...
2006-04-10T08:21:00.000Z	wladston		Orbin : Even though, I think that a warning at the first open or when not finding a package at "search" using the "Add packages" would be useful to newcomers ...
2006-04-10T08:21:00.000Z	wladston		Orbin : you agree ?
2006-04-10T08:22:00.000Z	wladston		Orbin : Great ! :) So, how can we put this on hands of developers, to add on the next release ?
2006-04-10T08:23:00.000Z	wladston		I'm a newcomer to linux ... I'm impressed on how things got more user-friendly in Ubuntu!
2006-04-10T08:23:00.000Z	wladston		A dev channel ? maybe #ubuntu-dev ?
2006-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	wladston		tritium : googling for "malone" ...
2006-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	wladston	tritium	orbit : here ! https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+filebug
2006-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	wladston		where to report a bug, I'm going to fill it.
