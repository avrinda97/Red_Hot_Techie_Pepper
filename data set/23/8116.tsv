2005-01-18T07:54:00.000Z	aToaster		can I run cedega well off the vesa drivers?
2005-01-18T07:55:00.000Z	aToaster		I've been having a hard time trying to get the ATI drivers to work, I just get a blank screen when it opens gnome, and I usually end up reinstalling ubuntu
2005-01-18T07:56:00.000Z	aToaster		having an ATI seems to be a curse =/ spent too much money on this card not to use it
2005-01-18T07:57:00.000Z	aToaster		guess I'll just have to go to windows for my fix of WoW then... =/
2005-01-18T07:58:00.000Z	aToaster		so. can you just pop the cd in and install it on linux? don't really know how that works
2005-01-18T08:00:00.000Z	aToaster		ic
2005-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	aToaster		so cedega would emulate more efficiently than wine?
2005-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	aToaster		what video card do you have HrdwrBoB?
2005-01-18T08:02:00.000Z	aToaster		do you use cosmos ui HrdwrBoB?
2005-01-18T08:02:00.000Z	aToaster		or can you use cosmos is the question
2005-01-18T08:02:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	no, I tried to access their website the other day and it was down
2005-01-18T08:07:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	it is not the same
2005-01-18T08:07:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	it is currently *disabled*
2005-01-18T08:07:00.000Z	aToaster	HrdwrBoB	ah... isn't that a risk though?
2005-01-18T08:08:00.000Z	aToaster	HrdwrBoB	hrmm I guess, I though regular users should be seperated from the root
2005-01-18T08:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	they are
2005-01-18T08:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	if you create another user it won't be able to be root
2005-01-18T08:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	and only you know your password
2005-01-18T08:09:00.000Z	aToaster	HrdwrBoB	ah hrmm, alright, guess I'm just too used to having two seperate pass's
2005-01-18T08:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	yes :)
2005-01-18T08:12:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	aToaster	yes it is
2005-02-13T11:09:00.000Z	aToaster	HrdwrBoB	hahah
