2010-04-23T19:42:00.000Z	Dravekx		if anyone has some time to kill and wants to help setup a hosting home webserver, let me know.. I can use the help setting up the user accounts,
2010-04-23T19:43:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Have you seen the Ubuntu server guide? It probably could get you up and running fast.
2010-04-23T19:49:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	Ive read it a couple times... but the symlinks confuse me.
2010-04-23T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Which part specifcally?
2010-04-23T19:53:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	I had someone help me set this up once, I cant remember exact though. something about symlinking /var/www to each home directory and then making it so each user's directory was accessible via the web.
2010-04-23T19:54:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	So you want people to have things like: server.com/~username/ ?
2010-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	yes! :)
2010-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Okay, one moment, let me find your something.
2010-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	thanks!!! :)
2010-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	Im starting from the beginning with a fresh install of ubuntu server 9.10
2010-04-23T19:56:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Do you have apache installed yet?
2010-04-23T19:57:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	not yet... Ubuntu Server is installing now on the primary 128GB SSD of the new server.
2010-04-23T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Okay, what you'll need to do once you install apache is to enable the mod_userdir module with "sudo a2enmod userdir" then add a line to your site's configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default that says "UserDir public_html".
2010-04-23T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Then, you can either add a folder to /etc/skel/ or have the users manually create the public_html folder in their home directory.  Just as long as www-data has read access to it (chmod o+r) then they will be able to get to it by going to server.com/~username
2010-04-23T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	This is tha page from the apache2 documentation that explains the userdir module: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/public_html.html
2010-04-23T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Poke me if you have any questions, I'm usually around.
2010-04-23T20:02:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	ok. I'm copy pasting things so I can remember. It's installing LAMP and SSH now.
2010-04-23T20:42:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	I enabled UserDir, added the line, restarted the server, but it's not working. :(
2010-04-23T20:49:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Sorry, I missed your last line.  /home/*/www isn't going to work.  Are you placing the userdir directive inside of the virtualhost in 000-default?
2010-04-23T20:50:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	yes. I put UserDir public_html inside the virtualhost in 000-default. Then I created a directory called public_html inside user home/dravekx, but when you go to .com/dravekx, nothing comes up.
2010-04-23T20:51:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	You need to go to .com/~dravekx
2010-04-23T20:52:00.000Z	Dravekx	Pici	thanks!! didn't see the tilde.
2010-04-23T20:52:00.000Z	Pici	Dravekx	Its okay :)
