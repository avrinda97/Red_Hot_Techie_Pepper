2010-09-15T03:00:00.000Z	cyclist_2		Hello, there! I need help getting all my USB hard drives' icons showing on the desktop; the thing is: they *are* mounted, but their icons do not appear on the desktop; any ideas?
2010-09-15T03:01:00.000Z	cyclist_2		I have just closed it and then restarted it, but no joy...
2010-09-15T03:02:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	logged out and logged back in with the device plugged in?
2010-09-15T03:03:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	I have just restarted my PC, and now I am missing 2 icons; before, I only had I missing
2010-09-15T03:03:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	I never switch off my USB hard drives; in case of a restart, they are always on
2010-09-15T03:05:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	just logout and back in again then ;)
2010-09-15T03:06:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	ok...
2010-09-15T03:11:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	no joy, here...; the missing icons are still to be found...; somewhere...
2010-09-15T03:13:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	all USB devices or just that one hard drive?
2010-09-15T03:14:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	have you tried it on another computer to see if it works there?
2010-09-15T03:14:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	to be precise: the missing icons refer to 'partitions' on the internal hard drive
2010-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	the internal partitions are connected by usb?
2010-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	I do not have that alternative; but they all used to appear ok...
2010-09-15T03:17:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	no, they are just partitions assigned to specific purposes [and they are formated in ext3 {the internal disk is formated in NTFS, but it shows ok, as usual}]
2010-09-15T03:18:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	you may have to manually mount it in your fstab file
2010-09-15T03:18:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	but they are all mounted already...; I can navigate them without any problem
2010-09-15T03:19:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	oh ok, create a manual symlink on your desktop then, I guess..
2010-09-15T03:19:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	not sure why it's not showing up automatically, maybe ask in #gnome ?
2010-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	at this rate, it will not be too long and I will have none of those icons showing on my desktop
2010-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	lol, try a windows hail mary? haha (format && reinstall) :P
2010-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	that is a good idea; I will pop out to #gnome now for a while
2010-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	renedox	cyclist_2	good luck ;)
2010-09-15T03:46:00.000Z	cyclist_2	renedox	I had no luck over at #gnome; I will head for bed now, and resume this saga tomorrow; thank you, all the same
