2008-04-28T10:08:00.000Z	roocraig		can anyone help me with difficult sound problem-no sound in ubuntu 8.04
2008-04-28T10:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	What card?
2008-04-28T10:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	"asoundconf list" should list it if it's detected
2008-04-28T10:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	otherwise 'lspci'
2008-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	"asoundconf list" or look through the output from "lspci"
2008-04-28T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Did anything show up from "asoundconf list" ? ( that will tell me if it is detected by alsa at all )
2008-04-28T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Ok, run "alsamixer" and make sure that all channels are turned up and unmuted
2008-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	If it's muted you will see "MM" at the bottom, press 'm' to unmute / mute a channel
2008-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Do you possibly have more than one sound card?
2008-04-28T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Try going to System -> Preferences -> Sound and try the test tone with the setting set to pulseaudio and alsa
2008-04-28T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	'lspci'
2008-04-28T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	If lspci returned nothing something is seriously wrong
2008-04-28T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Tell me the output ( if it's only one line ) of "lspci; echo $?"
2008-04-28T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Run the command without the quotes
2008-04-28T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	And you are running the command without quotes?
2008-04-28T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Does "echo test" print anything?
2008-04-28T10:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	and "lspci ; echo $?" still prints nothing?
2008-04-28T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	That frankly shouldn't be possible
2008-04-28T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	What is the output of "echo $0" ?
2008-04-28T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	the command "echo $?" should never return nothing, and is actually a built in function of bash so I don't know how "lspci ; echo $?" could return nothing
2008-04-28T10:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	It can't hurt but both of those commands not working is extremely odd
2008-04-28T10:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	run "script" it should start a new shell, all output from this shell will be saved to a file named typescript in your home folder, in this new shell run "lspci ; echo $?" then run "exit" and pasetebin the file ( typescript )
2008-04-28T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	roocraig	Reboot and try running memtest, if that passes try an fsck ( you may need to do it from a liveCD ) and back up any important files as soon as possible in case your drive is going
