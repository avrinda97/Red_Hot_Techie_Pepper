2007-07-31T11:56:00.000Z	niuq		hello
2007-07-31T11:56:00.000Z	niuq		there is any app to change the size and name of a bunch of pictures??
2007-07-31T11:56:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	to do batch resizing: imagemagick
2007-07-31T11:57:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	to change the names, some bash scrips should work
2007-07-31T11:57:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	im not familiar with scripts
2007-07-31T11:58:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	to do the renaming, for loops work really well. if you give me an example, I might be able to come up with the oneliner to rename a directory full of files
2007-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	an example?, what kind of example do you need?
2007-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	well i have a bunch of pictures in a folder, and i'de like to put them in some order
2007-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	example of example... here goes... rename a directory of jpgs by prepending a date
2007-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	i dont know something like       pic1.jpg    pic2.jpg    pic3.jpg
2007-07-31T12:01:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	are all the jpgs named with a mish mash of naming conventions?
2007-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	I guesss they are .. hence you'd like to make them uniform
2007-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	all are named  something.jpg
2007-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	id like something like    1picture.jpg     2picture.jpg
2007-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	something like it
2007-07-31T12:04:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	for that case, I don't think I could do a oneliner... it'd have to be a script
2007-07-31T12:04:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	i dont know if you need more info.... and im not sure what else you can need
2007-07-31T12:05:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	what do you mean?
2007-07-31T12:06:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	sometimes, bash scripts can just be typed at the commandline.  For more involved things, they need to be stored into a file and you'd have to type: examplebashscript.sh (to start the script)
2007-07-31T12:07:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	and in this case you'll store it in a file?
2007-07-31T12:08:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	yes.  it's just too much stuff to type again and again
2007-07-31T12:08:00.000Z	niuq	punsad	so you will help me with that?
2007-07-31T12:12:00.000Z	punsad	niuq	that PM I just gave you is an example of a oneliner script.  as you can see, they can get complicated
