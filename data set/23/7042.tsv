2006-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	Fujitsu		It is possible to recover.
2006-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	Fujitsu		If you know some of the contents of the file, you can likely get part of it back...
2006-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	Fujitsu		However, it is unlikely that you would be able to locate a JPEG in the entirety of the disk.
2006-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	Fujitsu		Yes, that's what you'd have to do, AFAIK.
2006-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	Fujitsu		I remember I was really annoyed when I was trying to undelete stuff from an ext3.
2006-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	Fujitsu		So, I always use ReiserFS now.
2006-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	brave soul
2006-02-27T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	you were blessed?
2006-02-27T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	lol, talk about serendipitous
2006-06-12T10:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	not really...
2006-06-12T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	so this is not just a sudo issue then
2006-06-12T10:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	no.
2006-06-12T10:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	looks like X is just being stupid.
2006-06-12T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	glad you were here :)
2006-06-12T10:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	hehe. Thanks :)
2007-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	the installer doesn't support sticking in the cd for an upgrade anymore?
2007-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	The Desktop CD never did.
2007-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	eh, never used the desktop anyway, don't remember why I thought that
2007-12-24T07:59:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	Dvorak is good.
2007-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	I've got nearly 40 years of qwerty, I'd probably explode
2007-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	It was painful to throw away a decade of typing ridiculously quickly, but I'm fairly quick again now.
2007-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Fujitsu	how long do you figure it took you to get reasonably proficient? And how do you deal with machines that aren't yours?
2007-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Fujitsu	nickrud	It's hard to say. After about a day I was only a bit horrible painfully slow, but I can't give much more info... hm...  I can still type QWERTY fine, though sometimes end up doing things wrong.
