2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		i installed nvidia-glx while trying to enable the driver it says Error: your X configuration has been altered.
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		command:
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		from nv to nvidia.
2006-11-12T17:07:00.000Z	compengi		can anyone help me with it?
2006-11-12T17:09:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	 Do you have an entry in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for "nv"??
2006-11-12T17:09:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	yeah
2006-11-12T17:09:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	 Driver  "nv"
2006-11-12T17:10:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	make yourself a copy of the xorg.conf to xorg.conf it blows up first...then change the nc to nvidia.
2006-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	can you help me with it?
2006-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	sorry Im a little lost with the multiple conversations... re-state your issue again...
2006-11-12T17:23:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	i installed nvidia-glx when i want to enable it i get Error: your X configuration has been altered.
2006-11-12T17:24:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	i changed it to nv still get same error
2006-11-12T17:24:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	Id try this..and see what happens....copy xorg.conf to xorg.conf.old then change the nv to nvidia.. in the file and try again..
2006-11-12T17:25:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	i've tried it but same error
2006-11-12T17:25:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	and reloading the X by doing a ctrl-alt-bkspc does nothing??
2006-11-12T17:32:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	didn't work
2006-11-12T17:33:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	i had to reboot to get out of it
2006-11-12T17:34:00.000Z	sky123	compengi	that is weird....Id try and work through the entire NV how to step by step again...and see what is going on..without tracing your steps...Im not too sure what is missing.
2006-11-12T17:41:00.000Z	compengi	sky123	frankly what i did is the following: i installed before nvidia-glx-legancy and it was working fine but i read in how to install nvidia is that nvidia-glx is the driver for my fx 5500 so what i did is that i removed the previous one and installed the new one so the problem occured
