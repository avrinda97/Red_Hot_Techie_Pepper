2006-08-30T15:24:00.000Z	blub		mmmh, are there more repositories for ubuntu than the ones which are default? And where can I find them?
2006-08-30T15:25:00.000Z	sethk	blub	yes, but you don't get to wait hours for a few minutes worth of software
2006-08-30T15:26:00.000Z	sethk	blub	if he wants to take two days to do two hours work, he needs gentoo  :)
2006-08-30T15:26:00.000Z	blub	sethk	cant follow you?
2006-08-30T15:26:00.000Z	blub	sethk	me uses gentoo and I am more than happy, now I am helping him to configure his kubuntu install
2006-08-30T15:26:00.000Z	sethk	blub	not being exactly serious.  You get better performance from ubuntu than from gentoo, and you get it a with a lot less work
2006-08-30T15:27:00.000Z	blub	sethk	I love gentoo, so no way for logical argument :-)
2006-08-30T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	blub	all available
2006-08-30T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	blub	use synaptic.  it's a nice friendly gui app with a search function
2006-08-30T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	blub	or you can install from the command line with just the package name
2006-08-30T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	blub	you never need to download anything manually
2006-08-30T15:29:00.000Z	blub	sethk	just using adept manager from kde
2006-08-30T15:29:00.000Z	sethk	blub	why?  synaptic is a lot easier to use.  I use it in kde
2006-08-30T15:29:00.000Z	blub	sethk	because I have no clue of kubuntu and int was preinstalled :-)
2006-08-30T15:30:00.000Z	sethk	blub	ok.  no problem
2006-08-30T15:31:00.000Z	blub	sethk	and my frind just switched a few month ago from XP tu SuSE, but suse sucked, and didn't help him with suse
2006-08-30T15:31:00.000Z	sethk	blub	I'm not fond of suse
2006-08-30T15:31:00.000Z	sethk	blub	but package management in ubuntu is really very easy
2006-08-30T15:32:00.000Z	blub	sethk	looks like it is, but I was wondering why I couldn't find opera and win32codes with the default manager
2006-08-30T15:33:00.000Z	sethk	blub	I'm not sure about opera; I think you have to add a repository to the list of repositories to get opera
2006-08-30T15:33:00.000Z	blub	sethk	is there a list with extra repositories? I am googeling around, but no success so far
2006-08-30T15:34:00.000Z	sethk	blub	I thought someone gave you the repository for opera.  I think you can do:
2006-08-30T15:34:00.000Z	sethk	blub	follow that url
