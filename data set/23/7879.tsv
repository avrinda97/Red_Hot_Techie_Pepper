2005-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	brian_		Method 1: Use Sun Java packages prebuilt for Ubuntu
2005-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	brian_		It is currently the best way to get an up to date Java installation in Ubuntu. It cares for the environment setup and the Firefox/Mozilla browser plugin as well. For easy installation there is a repository.
