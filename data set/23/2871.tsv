2008-11-03T10:47:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	it should be gone, the directory may be empty or just have files of no value anymore which you can just delete yourself
2008-11-03T10:41:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	 I mean permanently, can I just unistall it?
2008-11-03T10:42:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	okay, thanks
2008-11-03T10:45:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	it says it removed properly, but the samba directory is still there, and I cant currently reboot to see if its really gone
2008-11-03T10:48:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	the smb.conf is still there, according to nano
2008-11-03T10:50:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	i must be forgetting one of the remove commands i wish i could think of it off the top of my head.  Give me a sec and i'll figre it out
2008-11-03T10:50:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	sure
2008-11-03T10:52:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	try sudo apt-get remove libcupsys2 samba-common
2008-11-03T10:52:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	okay, thanks. One sec
2008-11-03T10:53:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	ok
2008-11-03T10:56:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	the /etc/samba/ directory still stands, and it deleted cups and kismet :(. I think Ill just force delete those folders and see if samba is still running next chance I get to reboot
2008-11-03T10:56:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	Thanks for the help
2008-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	wish i could have helped more but it looks like we are doing more bad than good now
2008-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	its okay, ive had trouble with samba since the start, anyway. Im pretty much used to it. Thanks again
2008-11-03T10:58:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	tell me about it, i have never been able to configure it right. Some people swear by it, but not in this camp lol
2008-11-03T10:58:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	lol
2008-11-03T10:59:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	umm.. I get an error saying the pakcage cups doesnt exist, has the name changed?
2008-11-03T11:00:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	your gonna have to sudo apt-get install libcupsys2 again
2008-11-03T11:00:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	 okay, thanks
2008-11-03T11:03:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	Does that install cups? How can I tell if its installed? Im planning on setting it up tomorrow
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	Thorsten11	\Kira	thats the remove we did that unistalled cups, it should reinstall the missing files. to see if its running i think ps -e will show cups in the list
2008-11-03T11:08:00.000Z	\Kira	Thorsten11	I didn't see it there, but I might of missed it due to the like hundred kismet entrys. I havnt rebooted yet, so that might be it
