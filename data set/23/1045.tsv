2010-10-16T07:43:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	you can get both on ubuntu
2010-10-16T07:43:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	so? they are nonfree...
2010-10-16T07:43:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	free as in GNU, not free as in they don't cost any money.
2010-10-16T07:44:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	do you even know about free software? o.o
2010-10-16T07:44:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	ok i'm sorry
2010-10-16T07:44:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	i know about $$$
2010-10-16T07:48:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	did you fresh install or upgrade? I installed Lucid on two E1505 and it worked just fine with that.
2010-10-16T07:49:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	tab autocompletes nicks...
2010-10-16T07:49:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	does it always turn your volume up or only in certain apps?
2010-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 oh kool thanx
2010-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 always
2010-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 whether watching dvd, downloaded movie or music from hard drive
2010-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	that's extremely weird... I installed Lucid this morning on an E1505 and that didn't happen.
2010-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	what if you're not running any app? do the forward and backward buttons still turn your volume up and down?
2010-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 i actually installed twice due to changing hard drives and it's done it both times
2010-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	I'm thinking that maybe the apps have the wrong shortcut assignment
2010-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	i havent a clue dude. i've only been using lucid or any linux os for a month
2010-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 is there a way to check that?
2010-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	Linux isn't an OS... GNU is. Try hitting the "forward" without any media app open and see if the volume goes up.
2010-10-16T07:54:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 nope all it did was light up the panel
2010-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	then you probably need to check the shortcuts on the apps you were using.
2010-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Chaos2358	something like Settings > Preferences > Shortcuts maybe...
2010-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	Chaos2358	leo_rockway	 ok thanks 1 sec
