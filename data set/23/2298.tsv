2009-06-10T13:35:00.000Z	xtknight		i think it does checksums on everything
2009-06-10T13:35:00.000Z	xtknight		if ur net is that unreliable i would check into it
2009-06-10T13:36:00.000Z	xtknight		i had an ethernet driver that really messed up every one of my downloads
2009-06-10T13:37:00.000Z	xtknight		there's iwl3945 and then some other older one
2009-06-10T13:37:00.000Z	xtknight		that actually worked better
2009-06-10T13:39:00.000Z	xtknight		configuration.....driver =
2009-06-10T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight		directory=..
2009-06-10T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight		:/
2009-06-10T13:44:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	good show old man, that did the trick
2009-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	 glad to hear... stay off of ext4 boot partitions they're bad stuff ;)
2009-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	i didn't really know it was customary to make separate /boot partitions
2009-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	i do if my root is ext4 just to avoid problems with legacy grubs
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	OH WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO KNOW 2 HOURS AGO
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	:)
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	 at least that's why i do it
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	well i learned a very valuable lesson today
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	 and i agree completely, i didnt discover it was a good idea till later.. but my bro always raised me on making separate /boot, /, swap...
2009-06-10T13:46:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	stay the hell away from fedora. :)
2009-06-10T13:50:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	xfce is quite fast
2009-06-10T13:50:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	well it's not compiz, for me it's the GTK drawing engines or nautilus or something...the menus seem snappier in xfce (altho i thought it used gtk as well)
2009-06-10T13:53:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	like the new uxa mode?
2009-06-10T13:54:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	xtknight	something like that
2009-06-10T14:07:00.000Z	xtknight	s1gmab3ta	yup
