2010-01-24T06:49:00.000Z	jake614		sorry for flooding
2010-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	jake614		i have tried all 4 of them
2010-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	jake614		just so you know, i had jaunty installed after it was released and everything worked smoothly, then updated to karmic and still everything was working just fine
2010-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	jake614		like a month ago, after an update they stopped working
2010-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	jake614		then i downgraded to jaunty again b/c of sound issues
2010-01-24T06:52:00.000Z	jake614		yes, everything worked just fine before
2010-01-24T06:53:00.000Z	jake614		i only have jaunty installed
2010-01-24T06:53:00.000Z	jake614		i dont think its the devices though, all of them worked before and none is working now, and ive tried in all ports
2010-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	Matthew11	jake614	Have you got any other liveCD?
2010-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	jake614		the mouse will even blink
2010-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	no, i dont... is there something else i can try?
2010-01-24T06:55:00.000Z	Matthew11	jake614	My soundcard also deffected by one moment to the secound. So i want to sure if it isn't a hardware problem
2010-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	everything worked perfectly on this laptop out of the box when i installed jaunty... lost sound with karmic, but usb was still working fine
2010-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	sound is back now i put jaunty back, but usb is not
2010-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	Matthew11	jake614	Try the karmic again (as a live cd). If it works, there is an unoffical upgrade that makes the sound much better
2010-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	Matthew11	jake614	you experienced a cracking noise dont you?
2010-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	no, sound was completely gone
2010-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	i'd rather keep jaunty, sound is not an issue anymore, but i'd like to make usb devices work
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	Matthew11	jake614	Well i don't have any further idea right now
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	Matthew11		Maybe someone else can help you
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	jake614	Matthew11	 okay, thanks for your time!
