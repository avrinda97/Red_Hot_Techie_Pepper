2010-10-23T22:36:00.000Z	Metalan		Anyone here with experience with windows 7/ubuntu shares?
2010-10-23T22:38:00.000Z	Metalan		k. I'm having an issue trying to connect to my Win 7 share from Ubuntu. It keeps prompting me for my password but I believe I didn't set a password for samba shares
2010-10-23T22:38:00.000Z	Metalan		My homegroup password doesn't work either
2010-10-23T22:38:00.000Z	Metalan		(Also, thanks Krishnandu)
2010-10-23T22:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 you mean from Windows --> to Linux (shares) or Linux (using nautilus) to --> windows shares?
2010-10-23T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 i often have to enter a share name manually.  smb://servername/sharename   or use the ip. instead of servername.
2010-10-23T22:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	  I agree with Krishnandu  - sounds like you need to set up windows share with some different settings. I tedn to just  make  a Public share. :)
2010-10-23T22:40:00.000Z	Metalan	Dr_Willis	Tried the manual share name thing, same results. I believe they're already public, how can I check?
2010-10-23T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	  under windows.. they got that weird shareing 'properties/permissions' thing. :) ive rarely used it.
2010-10-23T22:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 be sure the linux workgroup is the same as the windows workgroup also. (thats in /etc/samba/smb.conf)
2010-10-23T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 i thought it wanted my windows users password.. Im not using homegroup stuff on windows7 at all.
2010-10-23T22:53:00.000Z	Metalan	Dr_Willis	Me neither. I have no password on the Windows server. Krishnandu: Well, the permissions are set to "Everything" for "Everyone" on Windows
2010-10-23T22:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 that may be the issue.. Ive had shares on windows NOT work properly unless i set up a user with a password.
2010-10-23T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 even when tryign to do everythign to everyone.. - i still had to give the user (my wife) a password ,  for them to actually work.
2010-10-23T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 ive found each release of windows gets weirder and harder to get going with shares.. its hard to grouble shoot. :(
2010-10-23T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 theres the 'findsmb' and 'smbtree' commands that may give some info on what shares are seen.
2010-10-23T23:00:00.000Z	Metalan	Dr_Willis	The network page on Nautilus finds the Windows server without issue
2010-10-23T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 depends on how much data. and how often you are transfering stuff.
2010-10-23T23:02:00.000Z	Metalan	Dr_Willis	Lots. Around 100GB today. I'd need to move about 2GB a week
2010-10-23T23:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 scp is an easy way to do it.. but it can be slower.. but more flexiable in many ways
2010-10-23T23:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 i think NFS is fastest.. but harder to setup.
2010-10-23T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Metalan	 gnomes connect to server qwizard.. or enter a path like smb://linuxboxname/sharename
2010-10-23T23:19:00.000Z	Metalan	Dr_Willis	"Failed to mount Windows share."
