2012-03-11T12:21:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	depending what you mean with "backport"
2012-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	blendedbychris	iceroot	i'm just trying to get php 5.3.3 on lucid … i'm looking at http://blog.dmitryleskov.com/web-development/php/backport-php-5-3-3-from-maverick-to-lucid/ which says use apt-src and build your own local repo
2012-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	public server?
2012-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	blendedbychris	iceroot	what do you mean?
2012-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	and why not 5.3.2?
2012-03-11T12:25:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	use php5.3.2 from the repos and install php5-fpm as external package
2012-03-11T12:26:00.000Z	blendedbychris	iceroot	php5-fpm is php compiled with the process manager option… 5.3.2 needs to be recompiled with that option
2012-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	blendedbychris	iceroot	stop talking out of your butt
2012-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	building such an insecure software from source is not good
2012-03-11T12:28:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	no problem, i will stop the talking
2012-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	but as we said, its not a good idea
2012-03-11T12:32:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	https://launchpad.net/~fabianarias/+archive/php5
2012-03-11T12:34:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	but as we said already, using a ppa (no software from the official repos) is not a good idea, especially on a server
2012-03-11T12:34:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	ppa will give you (maybe) sec updates
2012-03-11T12:34:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	compiled by hand not
2012-03-11T12:35:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	and it may break dependencies
2012-03-11T12:35:00.000Z	blendedbychris	iceroot	if you were stuck in this pickle what would you do?
2012-03-11T12:35:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	so please use it at your own risk, issues are not supported here
2012-03-11T12:36:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	1. i would never use ubuntu as a server 2. i would try to avoid php 3. i would use apt-pinning with a newer repo (very bad idea)
2012-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	no
2012-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	as i said "I"
2012-03-11T12:38:00.000Z	iceroot	blendedbychris	ubuntu is a great desktop-system but not my first choice for a server (but i think that is getting offtopic)
