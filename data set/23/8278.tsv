2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	topyli	jc-denton	maybe it's created (by sudo) while you make your first user during base-config. dunno
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	jc-denton	topyli	what are the settings for the default ubuntu user?
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	topyli	jc-denton	sudo-wise. the first user is a member of the admin group, which is given full rights in sudoers
2005-04-16T15:22:00.000Z	jc-denton	topyli	can you paste yours somewhere?
