2006-01-07T07:36:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Pygi	thanks, I figured it was an error
2006-01-07T07:38:00.000Z	Pygi	lotusleaf	what the hell is that nUbuntu????
2006-01-07T07:39:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Pygi	I don't know, I didn't bother to visit the site, I was looking at new news stories on digg and someone submitted it, I came here after searching ubuntuforums and google to get more information
2006-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	Pygi	lotusleaf	I visited the site, but I don't think they are allowed to use Ubuntu name as they are not affliated with canonical
2006-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Pygi	indeed, perhaps some official ubuntu and/or canonical reps may want to look into this quickly.
2006-01-07T07:41:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Pygi	yw :)
2006-01-07T07:45:00.000Z	Pygi	lotusleaf	k, authorities informed :) investigation pending :)

2006-01-07T07:49:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Pygi	I hope that doesn't make the frontpage of digg, it's getting a lot of diggs, I posted a comment but if it hits the front page it's going to create a lot of confusing news ;/
