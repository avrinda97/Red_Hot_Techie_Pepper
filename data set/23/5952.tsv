2009-02-23T04:59:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer		guys there's any problem if i try to compile my own kernel under ubuntu?
2009-02-23T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	I woudn't recommend it
2009-02-23T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	other distros such as Gentoo sure, but Ubuntu no
2009-02-23T05:00:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	why?
2009-02-23T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	because Ubuntu isn't really the type of distro where people tend to compile their own kernels if at all
2009-02-23T05:01:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	ikonia: but there's anything from ubuntu that gonna lock me of this?
2009-02-23T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	why do you want to compile yoru own?
2009-02-23T05:01:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	to optimize my kernel
2009-02-23T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	if you want more control of your technical system under the hood,  Ubuntu probably isn't really the correct distro
2009-02-23T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	Ubuntu's kernel should be fine,   unless maybe your going to do something really fancy that requires some other kernel
2009-02-23T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	by the way
2009-02-23T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	Ubuntu only releases security updates,   well there are some ppa for some apps.  for later stuff yes  you would need a later version of Ubuntu
2009-02-23T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	where as other distros are more cutting edge
2009-02-23T05:05:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	hmm understood
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	just out of curiosity why did you want to compile yoru own anyway?
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	to make it more faster having only things that i need
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	  get  Jaunty when it's released and do Ext4 and you got faster
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	April yeah
2009-02-23T05:07:00.000Z	WarriorSlayer	sebsebseb	jaunty = the next ubuntu version?
2009-02-23T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	yes the next Ubuntu version
2009-02-23T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	default is Ext3, but it has Ext4 support
2009-02-23T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	yep probably
2009-02-23T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WarriorSlayer	not much suppourt for Ext4?????
