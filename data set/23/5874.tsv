2006-08-16T06:51:00.000Z	doublehp		I have got "*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption " problem with nearly all applications; how can I solve this in a generic way ?
2006-08-16T06:52:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	Ouch.... is this with all apps ?
2006-08-16T06:52:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	several
2006-08-16T06:53:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	Dapper by upgrade ?
2006-08-16T06:53:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	stil breezy (?)
2006-08-16T06:53:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	Um... not sure what could be wrong :-/ That's usually a coding error ...
2006-08-16T06:54:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	I would try "sudo aptitude reinstall glibc" but I'm not sure it will help ... is it up to date ?
2006-08-16T06:54:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	how the hell upgrade to a not freezing glibc ? I have had this bug on many distros ... and generic fix is: upgrade glibc !
2006-08-16T06:54:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	updated yesterday and this morning
2006-08-16T06:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	I've never had this problem :-/ It could be a gcc bug as well, I'm not sure....
2006-08-16T06:56:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	actually Firefox 1.5 (after I upgraded FF because original was already buggy )
2006-08-16T06:57:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	Well, try http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash to get a backtrace of a program that crashes
2006-08-16T06:58:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	MALLOC_CHECK_=0 didnt help
2006-08-16T06:59:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	It could be a bug in some other library, not glibc (I don't really think it is anyway)- the backtrace may help to pinpoint the library
2006-08-16T07:02:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	MALLOC_CHECK_=0 DOES help (mistake was that I forgot the trailing '_'  )
2006-08-16T07:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	Sorry - what is that MALLOC_CHECK ?
2006-08-16T07:25:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	Gentoo's solution against this bug :)
2006-08-16T07:28:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	What uses that variable? Heh, I've never heard of it before (and i've used gentoo )
2006-08-16T07:29:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81255 :) all Skype users known this; for FireFox on ubuntu, I have binded the desktop icon to a personal script doing: export MALLOC_CHECK_=0 ; firefox $1
2006-08-16T07:30:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	ty :) I'll read up on it
2006-08-16T07:30:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	I am now looking for a way to declare this variable for the whole machine, so that all users can inherit this fix, and also for all applications (OOo also bugs); which /etc/??? would help ?
2006-08-16T07:32:00.000Z	neutrinomass	doublehp	I think it's /etc/environment
2006-08-16T07:38:00.000Z	doublehp	neutrinomass	echo "MALLOC_CHECK_=0" >>/etc/environment ; reboot; enjoy :)
