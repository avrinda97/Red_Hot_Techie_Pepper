2007-05-28T16:58:00.000Z	egat		hello! im also a newbie, having some trouble with my Ubuntu install. do i need to create a new partition to install it on?
2007-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	egat		hey, im having some trouble with install. do i need to create a new partition to install 7.04 on?
2007-05-28T05:11:00.000Z	stefg	egat	the installer actually triesto guide you through that. Do you have empty, unpartitioned space on your drive yet?
2007-05-28T05:11:00.000Z	egat	stefg	no, i dont. im going into this fairly blind, so my apologies if i seem a bit daft
2007-05-28T05:12:00.000Z	stefg	egat	so what situation are you in? Running the Live CD on a machine which one big fullsize win-partition on it?
2007-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	egat	stefg	im trying to install to a single win-partition on an older laptop (still a p4 though). i burnt the iso from the site to cd, booted to it and chose the install option
2007-05-28T05:15:00.000Z	egat	stefg	i got an error re: gnome preferences but i let it continue, it eventually just sits on a blank desktop.
2007-05-28T05:16:00.000Z	stefg	egat	so ubuntu is installed, but the install didn't work right, or are you in the process of installing, and it the install hangs?
2007-05-28T05:17:00.000Z	egat	stefg	the install hangs. it ran for about an hour the first  time before i accidently knocked out the power to the laptop(dead/dying battery). i started it again, but still got the gnome preferences error, let it run for about 2 hours when it died
2007-05-28T05:18:00.000Z	stefg	egat	hmmm... so ubiquity (the graphical installer) apparently doesn't work. is this a dual boot machine or will ubuntu be the only OS on it?
2007-05-28T05:19:00.000Z	egat	stefg	single boot
2007-05-28T05:21:00.000Z	stefg	egat	very good. 1.) check if the CD is good, it's got a selftest option at boot. 2.) use the Alternate CD to install.
2007-05-28T05:33:00.000Z	stefg	egat	*if* the installer works on your machine it's best to present an empty unpartitioned disk to him,
2007-05-28T05:34:00.000Z	egat	stefg	thanks :)
2007-05-28T05:34:00.000Z	egat	stefg	gah, smileys
2007-05-28T05:41:00.000Z	egat	stefg	when i selected the cd check option, it flashed up a splash screen which i *think* said 'loading kernel' then hit a black screen and says 'crc error --system halted'
2007-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	stefg	egat	so the CD is a coaster
2007-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	egat	stefg	looks like it
2007-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	egat	stefg	thanks for your help. i'll reburn it and try again. you dont happen to know the iso files md5 sum do you? or have a link to a page that would?
2007-05-28T06:23:00.000Z	stefg	egat	so either your d/l is bad, or your Drive needs cleaning/replacing
2007-05-28T06:24:00.000Z	egat	stefg	the md5 sums matched up...i know thats not definitive, but its usually pretty good isnt it?
2007-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	egat	stefg	thanks, i'll take a look
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	egat	stefg	no luck....thanks anyway for your help; same to jonaskoelker. im gonna give it up for now, hopefully i can get it working soon though.
