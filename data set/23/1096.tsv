2010-09-06T17:23:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	what are you using to record ?
2010-09-06T17:24:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	audacity
2010-09-06T17:32:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	about your audio recording, did you try checking the "Software playthrough" option in the "Recording" section of the preferences ?
2010-09-06T17:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	hi, you mean in audacity ? I will look it up! sounds like what I need :)
2010-09-06T17:34:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	yes in audacity
2010-09-06T17:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	yea seems nice, I will try that tonight :), I hope it works
2010-09-06T17:36:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	thanks :)
2010-09-06T17:36:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	you're welcome
2010-09-06T17:37:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	about your other issue, looks like your windows manager crashes at startup, are you using compiz ?
2010-09-06T17:37:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	yeap
2010-09-06T17:38:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	actually I even have a bug filed for compiz...but no response by anyone in that
2010-09-06T17:38:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	could you try "compiz --replace" in a terminal and see what output you get ?
2010-09-06T17:39:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/home/dhruva/.compiz/session/10f0b452f559b49b12837529358654100000018000008"
2010-09-06T17:40:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	do you really want to use compiz or would metacity fill your needs ?
2010-09-06T17:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	I would like to use compiz...unless metacity can have the 'extra' visual effects
2010-09-06T17:41:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	no metacity doesn't
2010-09-06T17:42:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	hold on, looking if I can find something to help
2010-09-06T17:43:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	you may try installing fusion-icon
2010-09-06T17:44:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	it solved some issues with compiz for me some time ago (I'm not using compiz anymore)
2010-09-06T17:44:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	was that really for me !?
2010-09-06T17:44:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	ok installing
2010-09-06T17:45:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	glebihan	actually another interesting thing is, I use guake, and I like it to be transparent, but its not transparent anymore...I just see my wallpaper behind it, not the actual open windows etc...
2010-09-06T17:47:00.000Z	glebihan	dhruvasagar	for your settings, try using "ccsm", it should allow you to get your transparency back
