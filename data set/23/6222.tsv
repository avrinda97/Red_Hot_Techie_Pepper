2006-06-06T06:38:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	You may need to set the output to ALSA
2006-06-06T06:38:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	 i'll give that a go
2006-06-06T06:41:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	still no go it jus rapidly goes through the playlist without a hint of sound but xmms works fine
2006-06-06T06:41:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Are they MP3s?
2006-06-06T06:41:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	yes they are
2006-06-06T06:42:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	ah, then you need the libxine-extracodecs package
2006-06-06T06:42:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	amaroK doesnt do mp3 by default?
2006-06-06T06:42:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	No
2006-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Do you know how to change the repositories in Synaptic?
2006-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	i dont even have synaptics on this
2006-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Ah, sorry. Adept, then?
2006-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Can you change the repositories there?
2006-06-06T06:44:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	The package is in multiverse
2006-06-06T06:45:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	backports?
2006-06-06T06:45:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Actually, I don't know. I just enabled multiverse on all of them to be sure.
2006-06-06T06:46:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	;)
2006-06-06T06:48:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	its still not finding it
2006-06-06T06:49:00.000Z	lufis	UzzaDead	Hmm... try googling "amarok mp3"
2006-06-06T06:50:00.000Z	UzzaDead	lufis	if its not too much trouble could you give me the name etc of the repository and i'll manually add it
