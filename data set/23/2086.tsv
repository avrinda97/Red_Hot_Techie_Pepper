2009-07-07T09:10:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Boot the disk and use the verify feature to test the disk for errors.
2009-07-07T09:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	What version?
2009-07-07T09:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Does a live session boot up?
2009-07-07T09:12:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	So how far does the install get before failing?

2009-07-07T09:20:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	What exactly are you trying to do? Reinstall? Format the drive?

2009-07-07T09:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Then your is FUBAR. No reason ubuntu cant overwrite a drive.
2009-07-07T09:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Less you have failing hardware or some such.
2009-07-07T09:22:00.000Z	stronze	linuxguy2009	-new HDD.
2009-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	live session. gparted erase the drive and then reinstall.
2009-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Are you trying to mix Windows and Ubuntu on the same machine?
2009-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	stronze	linuxguy2009	- gparted erase? yes trying to dual os
2009-07-07T09:24:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	I figured. Forgive my tone, but I dont know why newbs try and run before they walk.No better way to say it.
2009-07-07T09:24:00.000Z	stronze	linuxguy2009	- i already did dual install with vista and ubuntu on laptop
2009-07-07T09:24:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	IMO mixing is more trouble than its worth,
2009-07-07T09:25:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Sorry I said excuse the tone. hehe
2009-07-07T09:25:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	stronze	Im actually very helpfull.
2009-07-07T09:25:00.000Z	stronze	linuxguy2009	- if i can remove the old ubuntu i can get ubuntu installed side by side but the problem is i cant erase it
