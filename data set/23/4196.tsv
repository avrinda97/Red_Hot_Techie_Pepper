2008-01-22T19:34:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	at some point you might want to learn some command line as well; it really is much faster and intuitive as well :}
2008-01-22T19:34:00.000Z	benny269	bazhang	I wish, I did a bit of simple basic and java coding but CLI makes no sense to me
2008-01-22T19:35:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	once you learn the very basic commands for adding stuff you may not go back :}
2008-07-10T17:10:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	are you doing this manually?
2008-07-10T17:10:00.000Z	benny269	bazhang	Installing RAM manually? Yes - as in buy it and install myself
2008-07-10T17:11:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	crack it open and look then; that is what I did
2008-07-10T17:11:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	what laptop version
2008-07-10T17:12:00.000Z	benny269	bazhang	I would, but I'm abroad where I want to buy the hardware but I'd have to buy tools etc to open it. I really do just want a scanner or software solution
2008-07-10T17:13:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	you know the make and model
2008-07-10T17:13:00.000Z	benny269	bazhang	Compaq Presario V5207TU
2008-07-10T17:25:00.000Z	benny269	bazhang	Did you manage to find anything on the Presario?
2008-07-10T17:26:00.000Z	bazhang	benny269	not the ram type; many many pages with specs though-->how old is the laptop
