2007-01-12T11:13:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki		hello,
2007-01-12T11:13:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki		i have some problems with sound in edgy, somebody could help me?
2007-01-12T11:14:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki		my problem is i get no sound using java or flash in edgy
2007-01-12T11:14:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki		it's not a firefox related issue
2007-01-12T11:15:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	ah I remember that problem
2007-01-12T11:15:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	edgy is pretty unstable
2007-01-12T11:15:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	try reinstalling flash and java
2007-01-12T11:16:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki	daftman	i did that, but it's not the solution, i had sound before and now i have not
2007-01-12T11:16:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	no sound doesn't change but flash and java might
2007-01-12T11:16:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	firefox 2.0 is different
2007-01-12T11:18:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki	daftman	but it0's not related to firefox, i have the problem outside firefox, in opera, seamonkey, standalone flash player, using java with swt
2007-01-12T11:20:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	I get that problem sometimes: i think another program is still using the sound device
2007-01-12T11:20:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	you can check that
2007-01-12T11:20:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	check the task manager
2007-01-12T11:21:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	you migh have some zombie process hoggin up the sound device
2007-01-12T11:22:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki	daftman	but i have the other sounds working
2007-01-12T11:23:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	yea I know, it is annoying. I can suggest you to reinstall java and flash may be?
2007-01-12T11:23:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	you can't watch youtube year?
2007-01-12T11:24:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	ah then its flash 9
2007-01-12T11:24:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	it is still in beta mode
2007-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	I don't think flash 9 is a stable yet. I am still using flash 7
2007-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	daftman	faeryNatsuki	then you can kick adobe's ass
2007-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	faeryNatsuki	daftman	thanks fort the help, i'll try the asound.conf solution bwefore and after i'll try the java and flash reinstall if nothing works ;)
