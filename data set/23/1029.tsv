2011-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	johnny77		I'm working on an old laptop and installed a CLI only to ensure that it would run. I've been able get an IP address, but I still can't ping the router or connect to the internet.
2011-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	did u assign static ip or use dhcp?
2011-02-27T23:33:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	used dhcp
2011-02-27T23:34:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	hmm. guess not problem - i kinda figured u may have forgot to define gateway as the router
2011-02-27T23:36:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	Just to make sure I am doing this correctly I typed: ping 192.168.2.1 - it respondes with From 192.168.2.12 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
2011-02-27T23:37:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	try to assign a static ip --- follow this if needed http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-server-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/
2011-02-27T23:39:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	if follow that guide dont bother with remove of dhcp-client
2011-02-27T23:50:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	It gave me an error - SIOCADDRT: no such process - Failed to bring up wlan0
2011-02-27T23:51:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	so your using wifi?
2011-02-27T23:51:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	trying to :)
2011-02-27T23:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	are u in gnome?
2011-02-27T23:53:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	No, I only installed a CLI. I only have the terminal.
2011-02-27T23:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	i remember now
2011-02-27T23:57:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	what kind of wifi card u have?
2011-02-27T23:59:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	It was some kind of broadcom card. I use a b43-fwcutter to install the drivers.
2011-02-28T00:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	that what i have used in past so should be setup properly
2011-02-28T00:04:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	what do u get if u -- dmesg | grep wlan
2011-02-28T00:05:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	I think I got it this time. it is pinging google.
2011-02-28T00:05:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	might i ask what you changed
2011-02-28T00:07:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	honestly. not sure. I went through and set up the dhcp again.
2011-02-28T00:07:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	just wondering if u ifconfig does it report as wlan0 or something else
2011-02-28T00:10:00.000Z	johnny77	geoffmcc	it reports as wlan0. Maybe a typo.. sorry.
2011-02-28T00:11:00.000Z	geoffmcc	johnny77	least it working
