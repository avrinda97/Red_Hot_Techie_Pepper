2012-11-04T01:27:00.000Z	edlik		Can anyone help me. I upgraded to 12.10 and now my only display option is 640x480, it should be 1280x1024. I googled it and tried other suggestions to no avail.
2012-11-04T01:27:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Install proprietary drivers.
2012-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Go to System Settings;Software Sources;Additional Drivers tab. And install newest version driver for your graphics card.
2012-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	thank you I will try that
2012-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Let me know if it works.
2012-11-04T01:35:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	additional drivers tab is empty. how do I get it to recognize my graphics card?
2012-11-04T01:35:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	What graphics card are you using?
2012-11-04T01:36:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	AMD Radeon X300
2012-11-04T01:38:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Which Ubuntu? 32 bit or 64 bit?
2012-11-04T01:40:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run
2012-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Did you directly upgraded from 12.04? I think you should do fresh install, cause I had problems when I directly upgraded distribution. Did Ubuntu recognized and downloaded drivers on 12.04? Or this problem occurs only on 12.10?
2012-11-04T01:43:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	I did upgrade from 12.04 and yes, I did have a problem with 12.04 .
2012-11-04T01:43:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Try going to that link I gave you to download ATI driver. If that wont solve the problem do it as I said before, fresh install.
2012-11-04T01:45:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Or problem even could be because of AMD's bad support for Linux drivers. I even had a problem back in Ubuntu 10.04 with my NVIDIA drivers.
2012-11-04T01:46:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	is there such thing as the perfect set up for a ubuntu system? If there is, I may have to build one.
2012-11-04T01:47:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Did you try to download that driver from AMD's site?
2012-11-04T01:49:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Did you try to setup resolution? Go to dash and type "Displays".
2012-11-04T01:57:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	the computer is still working hard, nothing in displays yet
2012-11-04T02:45:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Did you solve your problem?
2012-11-04T03:39:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	still nothing. maybe I did it wrong but after the download I clicked on the file and it ran gedit for a long time but nothing seamed to happen afterwords
2012-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Try to do fresh install.
2012-11-04T03:44:00.000Z	edlik	thelinux	thanks for your help. fresh install here I come:(
2012-11-04T03:46:00.000Z	thelinux	edlik	Will you be tomorrow here too? So I can see if that will work and help out till you solve your problem.
