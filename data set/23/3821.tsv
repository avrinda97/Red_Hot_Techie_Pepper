2008-03-17T17:19:00.000Z	yowshi		wubi wtf?
2008-03-17T17:20:00.000Z	yowshi		and how does it virtually garauntee that the end user will never switch?
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	yowshi		one thing i wouldnt mind though is the ability to install while already booted in windows. not into the windows partition but into it's own
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	yowshi		so i could kind of install while being online and able to get help
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	yowshi		i dont want virtual box. and i already have ubuntu here being used heh
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	yowshi		no not virtual box a full and actual install
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	yowshi		just i had problems when i was trying to install ubuntu in the first place
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	yowshi		so it would have been nice if i could have installed while booted into windows
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	yowshi		that way help would have been easy to access
2008-03-17T17:23:00.000Z	yowshi		yes
2008-03-17T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	you could suggest it to the ubuntu team and it might get implemented.
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	try virtualbox then. you can run any OS from within wndows with it
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	so what is your issue?
2008-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	thats very common
2008-03-17T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	so you mean install to a different partition from within windows?
2008-03-17T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	get it suggested
2008-03-17T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	I suggested an install to usb stick as an install option
2008-03-17T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2008-03-17T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	try there
2009-05-03T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	skype is evil
2009-05-03T00:53:00.000Z	yowshi	ActionParsnip	no it isnt i just dont see how skype will record a video for me i can then upload to a website
2009-05-03T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yowshi	its proprietary and closed source which makes it near impossible to troubleshoot and improve via the community
2009-05-03T00:56:00.000Z	yowshi	ActionParsnip	you know of any webcam recording programmes other then cheese?
