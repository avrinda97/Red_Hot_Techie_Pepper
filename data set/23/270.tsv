2012-03-12T00:17:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 i guess /dev/sda is simply not used and your system is installed on /dev/sdb or so
2012-03-12T00:18:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	nope i am running off sda right now
2012-03-12T00:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 idd, fdisk -l says that
2012-03-12T00:19:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	what idd?
2012-03-12T00:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 idd, /dev/sda is being used, is what i mean
2012-03-12T00:20:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	 i am running ubuntu from sda1
2012-03-12T00:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 yes, it shows, I wonder why gparted shows something else
2012-03-12T00:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 the only thing that comes on my mind, is that you didn't start gparted as root, but i'm not sure if that's even possible or makes a difference
2012-03-12T00:23:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	 \that image i showed has the disk utility in it on the bottom right ant is shows a huge partition at the end that doesnt exits
2012-03-12T00:23:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	i am running gparted as root
2012-03-12T00:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 the Windows Trick: have you restarted your pc to see if it changes something?
2012-03-12T00:25:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	yes
2012-03-12T00:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	SHOVELL	 the strangest thing, no further advice, maybe somebody else can help
2012-03-12T00:26:00.000Z	SHOVELL	MonkeyDust	 ok thanks
