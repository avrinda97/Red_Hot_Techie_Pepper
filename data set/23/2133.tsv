2009-07-19T08:40:00.000Z	Shawnc		If you looked at the logs....

2009-07-19T08:42:00.000Z	enduser000		how about "sudo apt-get update"?
2009-07-19T08:43:00.000Z	Shawnc	enduser000	I did that and I also did sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	enduser000		how about the computer janitor in system > administration ?

2009-07-19T08:45:00.000Z	enduser000		ok, sry.  I think it mostly does "sudo apt-get autoremove" but it is a gui
