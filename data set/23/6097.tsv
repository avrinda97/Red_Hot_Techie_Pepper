2012-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	dsa		question if i update release to 12.10 will i lose any of my data?
2012-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	no, you shouldn't.  But you should have backups anyway.
2012-11-28T01:34:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	bekks thanks
2012-11-29T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	no
2012-11-29T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	iptables rules won't get saved anywhere unless you save them
2012-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	so what you suggested is that ufw is what should be used in ubuntu?
2012-11-29T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	what?
2012-11-29T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	not really sure what your question is.  What rules?
2012-11-29T06:01:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	rate limit connections -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring
2012-11-29T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	I just use denyhosts
2012-11-29T06:01:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	which lead to http://www.sollers.ca/blog/2008/iptables_recent/ which refer to iptables instead of ufw
2012-11-29T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	you can use iptables, ufw is basically just a nice frontend to setting iptables rules
2012-11-29T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	denyhosts and fail2ban are two similar programs that analyze ssh login attempts and just block logins from hosts that seem to be trying to brute force
2012-11-29T06:03:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	im interested on ufw now =) i just enabled it on the computer im messing with
2012-11-29T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	ok
2012-11-29T06:04:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	cool denyhosts seems to be the way to go then and just disble ufw for now then :D
2012-11-29T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	yeah, to me it seems like a better solution if your intent is to try to mitigate brute forcing attempts
2012-11-29T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	yep
2012-11-29T06:08:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	yeah indeed its just for that, it seems to be the best solution for the issue thank you =)
2012-11-29T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	if you have lots of users connecting who tend to forget passwords, you might want to relax the settings unless you want to get frequent e-mails about being "locked out" (users seem to like trying the same wrong username/password 20 times in a row...)
2012-11-29T06:14:00.000Z	dsa	jrib	denyhosts need configuration right?
2012-11-29T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	dsa	it should work by default, but you can change its settings.  The configuration file is well-commented
