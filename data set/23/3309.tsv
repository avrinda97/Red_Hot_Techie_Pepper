2009-06-16T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djoob	if the repo fails yo uyou can download the tar.gz file and put the .so file in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-06-16T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djoob	is it seen in about : plugins
2009-06-16T18:06:00.000Z	djoob	ActionParsnip	I tried it through install missing plugin, deb package from adobe and tar.gz from adobe.... all fail to load flashplayer
2009-06-16T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djoob	so you see something like this: http://pastebin.com/d7accf72b
