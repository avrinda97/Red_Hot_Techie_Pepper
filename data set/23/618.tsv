2011-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	C_K_		i am trying to convert a iso .img and this is what i am typing in
2011-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	C_K_		Goodies$ hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/Users/Goodies/ubunutu.img ~/Users/Goodies/Desktop/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.iso
2011-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	C_K_		and it says failed no such directory
2011-10-20T22:57:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	what if you run just 'hdiutil' with no args.  Same result?
2011-10-20T22:58:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't hdiutil an OS X program?
2011-10-20T22:59:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	mmm...You might see if the graphical Disk Utility will write the image onto the USB stick for you.
2011-10-20T23:22:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	2gb per file in my experience.
2011-10-20T23:23:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	Ubu can read/write fat32, and read ntfs.  I believe writing to ntfs is also possible, but it will not do this "out of the box".
2011-10-20T23:29:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	Disk Utility is also a destructive partitioning tool.  Use gparted to resize nondestructively.
2011-10-20T23:30:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	sorry, too many conversations.  Ignore my last statement.
2011-10-20T23:49:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	your paths are wrong.
2011-10-20T23:49:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	The leading tilde implies your home directory.  You are using a leading tilde, while also speciying a full absolute path.
2011-10-20T23:50:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	Try without the tildes.
2011-10-20T23:52:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	no leading period either.  Lead with the forward slash.
2011-10-20T23:53:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	take out both tildes.
2011-10-20T23:54:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	is "Goodies" your username?
2011-10-20T23:59:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	I would expect that you will need to follow the guide in order to properly write it to the USB media.
2011-10-21T00:22:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	try bs=1000000
2011-10-21T00:27:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	bs=1000000
2011-10-21T00:29:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	No output means it's doing it's thing.  Wait now for a result when it finishes.
2011-10-21T00:52:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	Apple-key == command
2011-10-21T00:53:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	http://davespicks.com/writing/programming/mackeys.html
2011-10-21T00:56:00.000Z	B0g4r7	C_K_	your dd command overwrites the entire device.  Anything you write onto it beforehand is irrelevant.
