2008-07-20T21:26:00.000Z	cygoku		Hey, it's me again, I am using VLC for playing video and DVD, but it is not supported my laptop front panel play/pause/stop/"etc" buttons, how I can have them recognise ?!?!
2008-07-20T21:27:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	there are some packages to do that, but honestly, you're better off trying to get your videos to play in totem.
2008-07-20T21:27:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	what packages ?
2008-07-20T21:27:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	*shrug* dunno.  I just got my video to play in Totem :)
2008-07-20T21:28:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	Huh ok :P But totem doesn't play dvd ;)
2008-07-20T21:29:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	sure it does...
2008-07-20T21:29:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	I plays dvd true okay, but without menu !
2008-07-20T21:48:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	I was going to say before, try Totem-Xine for DVD Menu support
2008-07-20T21:50:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	I know, tho this is only a workaround the problem, not a fix.
2008-07-20T21:50:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	And everything with totem or xine is the worse scenario you can ever use.
2008-07-20T21:50:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	but using VLC isn't?
2008-07-20T21:51:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	I've been perfectly happy with them...
2008-07-20T21:52:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	: VLC is not a workaroung, VLC is the video player that does it all, I only miss the way to set a simple media button to play/pause.
2008-07-20T21:52:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	if the media buttons don't work, then it doesn't do it all :)
2008-07-20T21:52:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	: I guess you have an nVidia card ?
2008-07-20T21:52:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	not to mention the fact that totem handles remote locations pretty darn well, like mounted sshd drives.
2008-07-20T21:53:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	actually, I have a Mobility Radeon X1400 in my laptop, which is what I primarily use ubuntu on.
2008-07-20T21:53:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	with desktop effects, no less.
2008-07-20T21:53:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	: I have the exact same card and I have having problem with video and totem-xine.
2008-07-20T21:54:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	*shrug* I just played a dvd with it about 30 seconds ago, just to make sure I wasn't crazy.
2008-07-20T21:54:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	:  it's possible that you are not crazy, but with ati card, I always have to set the video output to use X11, and with totem-xine it's a pain.
2008-07-20T21:55:00.000Z	cycom	cygoku	I didn't change any settings...
2008-07-20T21:55:00.000Z	cygoku	cycom	: My mistake, xine is using X11 by default.
