2009-06-05T01:20:00.000Z	AakashPatel		how do i check what linked in a staticly linked .a file?
2009-06-05T01:20:00.000Z	AakashPatel		like ldd on a .so file
2009-06-05T01:22:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	did you want to see what is in the archive?  they are generally archives of multiple libs.  Try "ar t <lib>"
2009-06-05T01:24:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	im trying to compile samba for arm in scratchbox staticly, it compiles, but when i try to compile my app with libsmbclient.a i get http://pastebin.com/m31360bc1
2009-06-05T01:26:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	reconfgiure it with --without-winbind, so a make clean and then a make
2009-06-05T01:26:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	also is there some reason you don't simply install samba from apt?
2009-06-05T01:26:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	im trying to cross compile it to ARM
2009-06-05T01:28:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	is this on ubuto or on debian?
2009-06-05T01:28:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	ubuntu
2009-06-05T01:28:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	should i try to compile it dynamicly  linked and see if its getting linked with libwbclient?
2009-06-05T01:29:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	debian directly supports arm, you may want to consider it instead
2009-06-05T01:29:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	you will need arm libs and arm development as well
2009-06-05T01:32:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	it would be easier IMHO to simply install arm debian, it can be managed much in the same way as ubu is (it is the basis for ubu anyway) and you would have package support for it.  http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/samba
2009-06-05T01:34:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	i needed a staticly compiled build of libsmbclient.a
2009-06-05T01:35:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	libsmbclient.a of a bunch of dynamic libraries
2009-06-05T01:39:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	see, we are trying to compile libsmbclient.a to not rely on systems libraries
2009-06-05T01:40:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	you don't compile and archive, you add files to it
2009-06-05T01:40:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	uh, ./configure and make make an archive
2009-06-05T01:41:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	im sure it does, it used ar to create it.  But in order for you to run samba you will need libs for that platform, in this case arm.  The archive you have is comprised of libraries for x86 or x86_64 NOT arm.  So it will not work
2009-06-05T01:42:00.000Z	AakashPatel	mdm	but im using a cross compiler...
2009-06-05T01:43:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	its not as simply as just cross compiling, you also need the headers for that platform and the libs
2009-06-05T01:45:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	like bernz said its not as easy as just compiling.  hence the reason I suggested for you to install arm Debian instead
2009-06-05T01:49:00.000Z	mdm	AakashPatel	look at this http://wiki.gnashdev.org/Tools its how I compile my firewall kernel for an AMD Geode
