2007-06-04T12:31:00.000Z	hydan		where do i go to get support for gdesklets?
2007-06-04T12:33:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	rigt click an select Remove from Panel if i understand yr queston correctly
2007-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	you understand it, but that doesn't work with this desklet. :\
2007-06-04T12:35:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	are we talking about the wrokspace switcher?
2007-06-04T12:36:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	 i believe that's what it's called.
2007-06-04T12:36:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	or maybe it's called workspace selector.
2007-06-04T12:36:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	i use gnome and i removed and reinserted it ok just now ... is it locked to panel maybe that stops it
2007-06-04T12:38:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	i've got an idea. i'll just remove gdesklets and reinstall it.
2007-06-04T12:38:00.000Z	hydan		brb
2007-06-04T12:38:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	they bothe seem quite addable an removable here
2007-06-04T12:40:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	nope, that didn't work
2007-06-04T12:41:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	it's the workspace switcher applet.
2007-06-04T12:43:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	you wouldn't happen to know where the /schemas/apps directory is would you?
2007-06-04T12:43:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	i can't explain yr problem sorry ... i know it does not help you but it works ok here fyi
2007-06-04T12:43:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	ok
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	hydan		does anyone know where the gdesklets startup preferences are located?
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	to fiddle with gnome configuration i suggest you install Configuration Editor
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	i don't use gnome.
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	sorry
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	it's fine, i'm experimenting right now.
2007-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	wow, it just worked. i clicked at the very top right of the app and it finally gave me the regular options!
2007-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	Tom47	hydan	:D
2007-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	hydan	Tom47	thanks for your generosity :)
