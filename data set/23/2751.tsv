2009-05-14T09:48:00.000Z	Sagaci		i see that APTonCD is quite outdated to this point, is there a newer program that saves all packages onto usb or cd for installation for later?
2009-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	Sagaci		it says is only works for eft, fiesty and dapper
2009-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	Sagaci		http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/index.html
2009-05-14T09:50:00.000Z	Sagaci		i'll try it later
2009-05-14T09:51:00.000Z	Sagaci		i've have to clean install ubuntu 3 times since i got it. i love the distro but the only annoying thing about clean install is that i have to d/l all the pkgs again, but this should alleviate the problem
2009-05-14T09:52:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	packages go into /var/cache/apt/archives. In theory, you should be able to burn those files to a DVD and then bring them back again whenever you want...
2009-05-14T09:54:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	where's all the other packages? scattered around ie. ubuntu-restricted-extras, cups, etcetra
2009-05-14T09:55:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	as far as I know, any/all downloaded packages go into /var/cache/apt/archives before being applied, and they stay there...
2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	nope, i've only got about 22 there
2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	1758 installed according to synatpic
2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	er, you're doing network installs?
2009-05-14T09:58:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	then unless something has changed, it either comes from the install medium or it gets downloaded and put in /var/cache...
2009-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	not sure what you mean. All packages are deb packages...
2009-05-14T10:00:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	i have ubuntu restricted extras, but it's not listed there
2009-05-14T10:00:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	so try an experiment. Download something from restricted & after install, see if it's in /var/cache/apt/archives...
2009-05-14T10:07:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	if it was installed off the DVD, it won't be there. But that's ok, because next time you install it will just come from the DVD again.
2009-05-14T10:08:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	unfortunately not, it was upgraded from 8.10 and installed via live cd 8.10
2009-05-14T10:11:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	well make up your mind. You said "the only annoying thing about clean install is that i have to d/l all the pkgs again".
2009-05-14T10:12:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	well now the annoying thing is to figure out how to retrieve all the pkgs
2009-05-14T10:14:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	it might help if you told us what your ultimate goal actually is.
2009-05-14T10:16:00.000Z	Sagaci	losher	my gui screwed up on 3 separate occasions and i found it easier just to clean reinstall, i'd like to be able to install these pkgs off a cd/dvd in the event of a clean install rather than having to wait hours to download and configure each time
2009-05-14T10:18:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	sounds like what you really need is just a full backup of a cleanly installed system
2009-05-15T10:00:00.000Z	losher	Sagaci	you can download debs without installing using apt-get --download-only. The debs will be in /var/cache/apt/archives. Dunno how far you can get as the dependencies won't get updated until you actually install...
