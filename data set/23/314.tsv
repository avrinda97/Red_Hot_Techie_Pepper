2012-06-27T02:26:00.000Z	Krywk		I need help from people who know how to use Mono.
2012-06-27T02:26:00.000Z	Krywk		I won't go to ##mono since they don't answer there.
2012-06-27T02:27:00.000Z	Krywk		Anyone like that around here?
2012-06-27T02:27:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	Ask your question(s)

2012-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	no.
2012-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	Did you install it via the package manager?
2012-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	yes
2012-06-27T02:36:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	Give us the package name

2012-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	a
2012-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	QUITE possible
2012-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	Yes
2012-06-27T02:40:00.000Z	usr13	Krywk	yep
2012-06-27T02:56:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	A bigger error appeared.
2012-06-27T02:57:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	Here's the output: http://pastebin.com/N2LyCvWP
2012-06-27T02:59:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	Any ideas?
2012-06-27T03:00:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	I know what the problem is. I have sqlite 2.8.17, I need sqlite3
2012-06-27T03:01:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	nvm it's not that.
2012-06-27T03:04:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	this is what calls my attention: [Fatal] [DBManager]: Connect() - [Exception] System.DllNotFoundException: System.Data.SQLite.dll
2012-06-27T03:05:00.000Z	Krywk	usr13	It throws that even though System.Data.SQLite.dll is inside the exe folder...
