2005-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	liz4rd		my ISP gave me 2 ips. how would i be able to use the other ip instead of dhcping to this one (there both static) any ideas?
2005-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	set your ip address to the other ip
2005-07-20T16:03:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	WOW thats was good help man WHY DO YOU THIN K I CAME IN HERE!!! i dont know how
2005-07-20T16:04:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	if someone tells you your question is unclear, why not try to clarify?
2005-07-20T16:05:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	stop it.  i understand now.  there's no reason to be a dick about it.
2005-07-20T16:05:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	are you running gnome?
2005-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	fuck now i hate it :P
2005-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	forget it.  find someone else.
2005-07-20T16:08:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	what you think is a perfectly worded quesition may not be to someone else
2005-07-20T16:08:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	instead of telling me my question doesnt make sence to you tell me what parts :)
2005-07-20T16:08:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	so, if you like, tell me if you're running gnome or not in response to my previous question
2005-07-20T16:10:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	is your interface eth0?
2005-07-20T16:11:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	look for the interface with an ip address
2005-07-20T16:12:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	oops i thought you said ipconfig
2005-07-20T16:14:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	did you not install gnome and any of the other tools, or are you just running xfce4 aside from it?
2005-07-20T16:14:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	no gnome is installed
2005-07-20T16:15:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	try typing 'sudo network-admin'
2005-07-20T16:15:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	sorry, i misread that as gnome being installed
2005-07-20T16:16:00.000Z	liz4rd	husher	so configureing this wonk work then? should i exit network-admin?
2005-07-20T16:17:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	no
2005-07-20T16:17:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	if it came up, it'll work
2005-07-20T16:17:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	as in no, don't exit
2005-07-20T16:18:00.000Z	husher	liz4rd	did your isp give you a gateway address?
