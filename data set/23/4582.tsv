2007-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	Boris		Does anyone here have experience installing GRUB so that the second HD in a software RAID-1 array could boot by itself?
2007-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	Boris		Has anyone here used RAID?
2007-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	Boris		What should I do to make the second HD in a RAID array bootable on its own?
2007-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	what type? 0? 1? 01? 10? 3? 5?
2007-07-07T05:05:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	Software RAID-1 in SuSe, 2x10GB IDE w/3 partitions: /, /boot, swap
2007-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	I don't know that much about Suse, but I would assume that you need a boot loader.
2007-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	How do I install this bootloader? I already tried "setup (hd1)"
2007-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	 what is the raid configuration you are using, that was my question. Is there mirroring? Stripping?
2007-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	mirroring
2007-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	DaltonS		!grub
2007-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	I have already read through all howto's; no solutions work.
2007-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	mirroring makes two drives appear as one. I don't think you can just boot to one, you would have to boot to a differant partition.
2007-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	I could boot with master (it marks the slave as failed), but I get a blank screen when the BIOS tries booting the slave HD.
2007-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	DaltonS		!raid
2007-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	did one of the drives fail?
2007-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	I don't understand why they can't make a decent (working) howto step-by-step guide to implementing RAID.
2007-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	because RAID is extrememly complicated.
2007-07-07T05:11:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	Not yet, I'm testing. I already tried Ubuntu, but they have a bug so I use SuSe.
2007-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	let me see if I have any good info for you on RAIDS.
2007-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	I already checked everywhere; the most relevent information is here: http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Gentoo_Install_on_Software_RAID#Installing_Grub_onto_both_MBRs
2007-07-07T05:13:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	I sent you a private
2007-07-07T05:13:00.000Z	Boris	DaltonS	When I try following the instructions, I get "stage1 files not found."
2007-07-07T05:19:00.000Z	DaltonS	Boris	http://blog.thilelli.net/post/2007/05/30/RAID-1-Volume-From-the-root-File-System-Using-SVM-on-x86-Platform read some of that and tell me if that helps
