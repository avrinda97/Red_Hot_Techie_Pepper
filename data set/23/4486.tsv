2007-11-01T19:41:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-bugs/2007-March/438916.html
2007-11-01T19:41:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	Its a bug apparently...
2007-11-01T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	minus	reading. Docs suggest that SSP is not in 7.10 so I don't see how that can be
2007-11-01T19:42:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	I found a thread about it.. It says that a reboot will solve the problem, but that seems a bit, wierd.. Cause Reboot and linux isn't really the same xD
2007-11-01T19:43:00.000Z	ikonia	minus	ahhh its not SSP
2007-11-01T19:43:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	ok..
2007-11-01T19:44:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	where do I change it then?
2007-11-01T19:49:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	as I said, where/how should I rename the module for my graphics to get nvclock to work
2007-12-21T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	minus	using the nvidia drivers and twinview ?
2007-12-21T03:45:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	ATI card
2007-12-21T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	minus	what problems are you having, I know the official issues with ati, just not the physical weird ones
2007-12-21T03:49:00.000Z	minus	ikonia	Flare183; The problem is that, when I follow this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1773544 . At the end,when I enable the monitors, something just makes it all go weird. Either the resolution is wrong. Or only one of the monitors are functioning. etc.etc.
