2011-08-27T14:36:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	back to DHCP, issue persists (if you already replied, please copy-paste answer)
2011-08-27T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	has your machine got an IP address from dhcp ?
2011-08-27T14:37:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	won't connect at all, can't even ping
2011-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	that's not what I asked, please answer the question I asked, "does your machine get an IP address from dhcp"
2011-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	tried plugging in another computer and it works… :S
2011-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	no ip address received
2011-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	ok, please do "sudo ifconfig -a" how many devices do you see ?
2011-08-27T14:39:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	eth0 + lo
2011-08-27T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	run "sudo dhclient eth0"
2011-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	ok. That keeps on sending a request but it does not seem to be using the right netmask
2011-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	that's called a broadcast, don't worry about that
2011-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	it exited with "No DHCPOFFERS received."
2011-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	and "No working leases in persistent database - sleeping."
2011-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	ok, so there is the issue, the dhcp sever is not giving an IP - so either a.) there is a problem with the dhcpd server b.) there is a problem with your cable
2011-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	based on that error, there appears to be a problem with the range on the dhcp server
2011-08-27T14:46:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	cable should be no problem since it works with other computers. As for the DHCP range… it worked before and the machine is remembered… I'm gonna try forgetting in the router configuration page to see what happens.
2011-08-27T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	that would be the most reasonable action
2011-08-27T14:52:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	removing the problematic machine from the DHCP client list di not help… :(
2011-08-27T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	re-run sudo dhclient eth0 see if the error changed
2011-08-27T14:53:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	same error
2011-08-27T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	got to be a problem with the router not offering a dhcp request
2011-08-27T14:53:00.000Z	chocobanana2	ikonia	shouldn't it be using the right netmask? My router's is 255.255.255.0. dhclient is using 255.255.255.255
2011-08-27T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	chocobanana2	it's not a netmask, its'a broadcast as I said earlier
