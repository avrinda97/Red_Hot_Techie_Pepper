2011-07-30T03:23:00.000Z	Squall5668		Hello all, im trying to make a really restricted user in 11.04. I have removed most buttons etc from the drop downs (ubuntu classic ofc) and im trying to get rid of the System Settings in the top right indicator too. Any clue on how to do that?

2011-07-30T03:23:00.000Z	Squall5668		i thought of a chroot jail, but that's quite easy to break out of
2011-07-30T03:23:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	there are tools to do that, but if you say why you want to do it, it's probably easier to give you a good answer.
2011-07-30T03:27:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	hope you have good reasons for it.
2011-07-30T03:29:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	i told you the reason. I just don't want that idi... ahem... guy to mess anything up. Even his own settings
2011-07-30T03:29:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	but if you explain the scenario, it really does become easier to provide better help.
2011-07-30T03:30:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	why don't you make a panic button instead, so that he can just jump back to a time when everything was fine? It's easier to do, and a lot more user friendly.
2011-07-30T03:31:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	agh, you are really pushing my english skills... This box will be given to a guy and he will share it with others too. All of which have no idea of doing more than clicking the mouse button. All they need is probably the office suite. Maybe firefox too (not sure if they have even used the internet before) Yes that's the kind of people im talking about. So no, one more button is just
2011-07-30T03:33:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	making it so that alt+ctrl+f12 restores everything to how it was a half an hour ago is something you can do in an hour or so. Locking down all applications can be _really_ difficult. In any case, you should give each user their own account. That usually reduces problems dramatically since people tend to care less about systems they share.
2011-07-30T03:35:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	sorry forgot to type your name, check a little upwards :)
2011-07-30T03:35:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	let me put it another way. Avoiding all possible errors is extremely difficult. Making it possible to easily correct all possible errors is very easy.
2011-07-30T03:35:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	i still wish to see a guide. Is there one?
2011-07-30T03:36:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	I actually tried to do that once. I spent a week, and I gave up. Some applications are almost impossible to lock down because of how they work. You can try Sabayon, for instance. It will lock down the main desktop. The panel and such.
2011-07-30T03:37:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	thank you! Ill poke around that tool then
2011-07-30T03:38:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	but if you value input, then my opinion is that what you are doing is wrong. I don't often say that. You should use backups instead. It's _much_ easier both for you and the users and you get lots of bonuses.
2011-07-30T03:39:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	did you try automatic incremental backups and a keyboard shortcut to restore to the last backup? "Press alt+ctrl+f12 and everything will be back to normal, no matter what you do". Nothing is easier than that.
2011-07-30T03:41:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	no i haven't tried the one-button restore approach but a tool for backups. I guess im not too good with user-friendlyness. Anyways, ill take your input and rethink my approach :)
2011-07-30T03:42:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	that's wise. Because I can almost promise you that no matter how hard to try to make the system bullet proof, some user is going to find a way to do something wrong.
2011-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	what I ended up doing, in order to really be sure everything worked, was to take an incremental backup of the users home every 30 minutes. The panic button would log out the user, restore to the latest backup and then log the user back in. It worked very well.
2011-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	that'll be quite easy. Ill go with that for a while then, see how it woks
2011-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Squall5668	good luck :)
2011-07-30T03:47:00.000Z	Squall5668	jo-erlend_	thanks
