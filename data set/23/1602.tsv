2010-01-10T22:39:00.000Z	drizzt__		I'm trying to connect to Windows share, but it rejects my (correct) password/username, what can be wrong?
2010-01-10T22:40:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	sudo apt-get install smbfs
2010-01-10T22:43:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	i have smbfs installed
2010-01-10T22:45:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	try mounting from the command line
2010-01-10T22:48:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	mount error(13): Permission denied
2010-01-10T22:49:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	sudo mount -t smbfs //192.168.1.xxx/share /media/mountpoint -o username=drizzt  ?
2010-01-10T22:51:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	 mm.. sure the pass is correct? lower/upper case?
2010-01-10T22:51:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	of course
2010-01-10T22:52:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	smbclient -L 192.168.1.xxx   returns the share?
2010-01-10T22:53:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
2010-01-10T22:53:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	seems to be a username pass thing??   connecting to windows? or a samba server?
2010-01-10T22:54:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	yes it windows server, and name.pass are correct because I can connect from another win machine in same network
2010-01-10T22:55:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	which version of windows server?
2010-01-10T22:55:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	XP Professional
2010-01-10T22:57:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	Usually its the other way around! Very confisuing..
2010-01-10T22:58:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	in nautilus, can you navigate to smb://ipaddress and see the share?
2010-01-10T23:01:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	it keeps asking for password, but won't accept it
2010-01-10T23:02:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	im stumped..  on windows XP , set up another folder, share it.. and make sure your username is in the permissions list..  try to connect to that share with the username
2010-01-10T23:04:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	it's the same password loop for that new shared folder
2010-01-10T23:05:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	but works from Windows.....
2010-01-10T23:08:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	mmm im stumped..  manually, when you do -o username xxxxx .. xxxx = your username on the xp machine (i know, ridiculosu question, but no hard im checking)
2010-01-10T23:08:00.000Z	drizzt__	smiley_	yes, i'm providing correct username both in mount and smbclient
2010-01-10T23:10:00.000Z	smiley_	drizzt__	im stumped then.. probably a good idea to troll the forums and see.. this seems very trivial..
