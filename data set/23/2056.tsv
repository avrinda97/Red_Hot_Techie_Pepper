2009-07-18T23:15:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	That is if oubackwifi: is having trouble
2009-07-18T23:16:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	What exactly is the issue?  Are you trying to get a resolution higher than the ones offered in the GUI?
2009-07-18T23:16:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	yes. before the kvm i had 1280 by 1024.
2009-07-18T23:17:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	and it seems configuring xorg only sets up my keyboard
2009-07-18T23:17:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Try "xrandr --fb 1280x1024"
2009-07-18T23:18:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	that made my wallpaper bigger, thats it
2009-07-18T23:18:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Also, I learned a little trick.  Make sure your KVM is set to your monitor when you boot your system.  If the kvm is set to a different monitor than X11 will see that monitor when probing.
2009-07-18T23:19:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	yes ive done that
2009-07-18T23:20:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Try running Xorg -configure
2009-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	ive already done that
2009-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Xorg is so advanced now that you don't have to have an xorg.conf at all.  If you don't have one than X simply looks at the info it probed from your hardware.
2009-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	If you add things to xorg.conf though it will pay attention to them over the probing info.
2009-07-18T23:22:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Could you pastebin your xorg.conf file for me?
2009-07-18T23:22:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Or just say if it is blank
2009-07-18T23:23:00.000Z	flatley	edbian	http://pastebin.com/f5de7b683
2009-07-18T23:24:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	Ok good.  That is a typical one.  It hold basically no information but it is a skeleton to add configurations to.  Take a look at this: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/x-config.html
2009-07-18T23:26:00.000Z	edbian	flatley	ha ha ha
