2008-03-26T15:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	no, MB= motherboard
2008-03-26T15:30:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	What CPU is it?
2008-03-26T15:31:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	intel pentium 4 3.8ghz
2008-03-26T15:31:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	with Hyper Threading?
2008-03-26T15:31:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	might be able to get you the exact model or capabilities output if you need
2008-03-26T15:31:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	yes it does
2008-03-26T15:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	that usually shows as 2 cores
2008-03-26T15:32:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	what exact benefits does hyper threading give? and am I right its underclocking it? Because I might put in a 2.4ghz dual core
2008-03-26T15:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	core 2 duo at 2.4 is two true cores running at 2.4 each, hyper-threading is virtual
2008-03-26T15:34:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	yeah my system has support for dual cores I found out but need a bios update I think
2008-03-26T15:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	yeah, probably
2008-03-26T15:35:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	I would hate to be wasting 1.4ghz on this sucker besides I think the cpu limiting is making some 3d apps crash
2008-03-26T15:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	core 2 duo is much more efficient than a P4 hyper-threaded
2008-03-26T15:36:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	then again, I'm running a 3.2Ghz hyper with no issues :)
2008-03-26T15:36:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	so if you have a dual core motherboard only options are a completely crappy single core (like around 2.0 not 3.0 ghz range) or a dual core?
2008-03-26T15:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	What MB do you have?
2008-03-26T15:38:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	you mean memory? oh I got 2gb at 800mhz but its underclocked to 667mhz
2008-03-26T15:39:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	But yeah, dual/quad is better than hyperthreaded
2008-03-26T15:39:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	FS31V10 is my motherboard
2008-03-26T15:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	Shuttle or Abit?
2008-03-26T15:41:00.000Z	gerro	DistroJockey	shuttle
2008-03-26T15:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	Can't find much info atm, sorry. But as I said Core 2 Duo's are the way to go if you can :)
2008-03-26T15:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	gerro	or need to. 3.8Ghz is pretty decent :)
