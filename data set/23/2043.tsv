2009-08-11T07:06:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	linux
2009-08-11T07:07:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	what's not working about your samba?
2009-08-11T07:07:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	are there any firewalls on any machines?
2009-08-11T07:07:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	my system doesnt appear under networks
2009-08-11T07:08:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	there are no firewalls
2009-08-11T07:08:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	within windows networks or what. i can't help if you;re not being specific.
2009-08-11T07:09:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	it doesnt appear under Networks in File Browser under the Places menu of Ubuntu
2009-08-11T07:11:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	oh, i dont even bother with nautius places as it hasn't worked for me ever, dating back to breezy. to see your network, go to nautilus and enter this: smb://ipaddressofmachinehere    and then hit enter, it should pop up a prompt for a username and password. if you want to just see the shares that your box is sharing, enter  testparm
2009-08-11T07:12:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	enter testparm where
2009-08-11T07:14:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	on a terminal
2009-08-11T07:14:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	Could not display "smb://192.168.1.3/documents/".
2009-08-11T07:17:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	Could not display "smb://192.168.1.3/documents/".
2009-08-11T07:17:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	 enter smbtree in the terminal and see if documents is the exact sharename. also, what security is in your smb.conf file. user or share?
2009-08-11T07:18:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	if it's user, then you need to add your users name to smb passwd file and use the same password as your sudo password. that's what I do. issue sudo smbpasswd -a username
2009-08-11T07:20:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	my computer isnt even listed under smbtree to begin with
2009-08-11T07:21:00.000Z	mazda01_	koolkat	are you even using samba? did you sudo aptitude install samba and then configure what shares you want to share? you need to follow a guide for sharing folders via samba
2009-08-11T07:22:00.000Z	koolkat	mazda01_	yes i did
