2008-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Shadow_X_	ah okay, they might be blocking it was my thought
2008-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	Shadow_X_	bazhang	doubt it. the IT guy said if you plug right into the port, it should work no prob. but idk whats up with it :?/
2008-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Shadow_X_	could be dns problem
2008-11-03T16:14:00.000Z	Shadow_X_	bazhang	then how is my macbook online when it uses the same DNS? lol
2008-11-03T16:18:00.000Z	Shadow_X_	bazhang	i think i got it now. i remember they had to add the mac address of my wireless card to the system to allow connection.....even tho they SAID i can just plug the line in and it would work, they still have 2 IPs are a row linked to my macbook. .03 and .04 so they apparently have even the cat5 links locked out without permission to
2008-11-03T16:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Shadow_X_	that sounds like it
