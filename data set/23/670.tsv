2012-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	gdea73		I had xsensors installed already before I lost access to the DE.
2012-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	so i am assuming you used ubuntu's hardware driver utility, and it had nothing for you there, or ???
2012-03-16T07:01:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I ran the Additional Drivers utility, and it did show FGLRX, and it probably would've worked, but I wanted to run Catalysts 12.2 because I figured it'd have better support for the APU.
2012-03-16T07:01:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	ahh, I see. are you sure the fglrx installed properly? it's been quite a while since i used ati hardware on a linux box.
2012-03-16T07:02:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	well it took me a couple hours of trial and error, but I thought so. It compiled correctly and I finally got amdconfig recognized as a command. I could successfully run amdconfig --initial, but it wouldn't load Gnome after that.
2012-03-16T07:03:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	what happens when you initiate startx yourself?
2012-03-16T07:03:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I don't know. I'll run the command.
2012-03-16T07:04:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I tried the command and I got a bunch of errors, followed by error 11 - segfault.
2012-03-16T07:05:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	hmm, is there any way you could dump that to a pastebin? it might be nothing, but maybe we could see somethging there..??
2012-03-16T07:06:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I can manually copy it onto my old laptop or something but that would be a bit of a pain.
2012-03-16T07:07:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	i would think you it would be easier to run something like links, and then perhaps go to google from there. i'm gonna try it, i live in the cli anyways.
2012-03-16T07:08:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I would, except the wireless driver doesn't appear to be working when I'm in TTY1. Which is strange. And a pain. it took me all day to get WiFi working :
2012-03-16T07:09:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	aww, dang. did you install wicd by any chance?
2012-03-16T07:17:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	sorry... that sucks. using ndis wrapper?
2012-03-16T07:14:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	another option would be to use the live cd. you use backspace as it is loading until you get a cli menu. then you can choose safe menu. you should then be able to find a menu option for booting with the default (but crappy) gui driver. this would atleast get you back out of cli land... but then you would have to remove that driver, and either try to re-install it or choose one from the ubuntu driver repositories...
2012-03-16T07:15:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	that seems like it would work except I'd prefer to use the wireless. Which I can't unelss I'm in X on my native install. I think. Though I don't see why the module rt3090sta wouldn't load in tty1. Maybe I'll try again.
2012-03-16T07:16:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	that's iffy. My wireless works right off the live cd, but this is a pretty simple little netbook I have here.
2012-03-16T07:17:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	well that's ... lucky. as I explained, it took me a long time to get the RT3090 working. A loong time. And now I have to do the work I put off! :P
2012-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	minecraft runs beautiful, just do not use icedtea6 plugin or open jdk. make sure it is from sun/oracle or it won't work at all.
2012-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	I don't remember. Probably. I had to compile the module and blacklist a bunch for it to work. I was real excited when it did though.
2012-03-16T07:22:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	my suggestion would be to remove the driver you where using altogether. once you have done that, we should hopefully be able to walk you through the cli to get a known functioning driver installed.
2012-03-16T07:44:00.000Z	hylian	gdea73	i wish I had that resolution. I am forever stuck in 1024x600, (netbook).
2012-03-16T07:45:00.000Z	gdea73	hylian	haha, bummer. I liked the old 4:3 resolutions like 1024x768, etc, as long as the screen fits it.
