2008-10-12T00:34:00.000Z	extor		Whats the best proggy to sound edit an mp3 sound to dampen or even remove the thud thud thud of the drums?
2008-10-12T00:34:00.000Z	Slart	extor	try audacity
2008-10-12T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	extor	check out ubuntu studio, see what audio editing software is included there
2008-10-12T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	extor	it's a ubuntu version for audio and video editing
2008-10-12T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	extor	I'm not suggesting you install it.. just see what software they include
2008-10-12T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	extor	here's a list.. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/PackageList
2008-10-29T16:46:00.000Z	extor	Slart	not to mention having a command shell which is a scripting language
2008-10-29T16:47:00.000Z	Slart	extor	well.. I don't think having a scriptable shell has some kind of magic +5 to os -knowledge perk.. but sure =)
2008-10-29T16:47:00.000Z	extor	Slart	it sort of babies you into the coding world
2008-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	extor	mm.. you could have a point there.. but this is getting offtopic
2009-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	Slart	extor	this might be worth reading http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/Debian
2009-07-28T14:18:00.000Z	Slart	extor	I think one the biggest differences is the release schedule when it comes to new packages and such
2009-11-19T04:31:00.000Z	Slart	extor	if an application has multiple threads I think it will be spread out.. according to the scheduler and whatnot.. I'm not sure what the difference is between "has multiple threads" and "thread aware"
2009-11-19T04:32:00.000Z	extor	Slart	I just want to be assured that I am making full use of my quad-core rather than using just 1/4th of it's processing power when I am running vbox virtual machines
2009-11-19T04:33:00.000Z	Slart	extor	oh.. I'm not sure how virtualbox handles it.. why not try it? start two vm's.. run something in both and have a look at the system monitor at the different cores
2009-11-19T04:34:00.000Z	extor	Slart	which system monitor are you referring to?
2009-11-19T04:34:00.000Z	Slart	extor	system, administration, system monitor
2009-11-19T04:34:00.000Z	Slart	extor	if you're running gnome, that is
2009-11-19T04:39:00.000Z	extor	Slart	supposing I am not running gnome and this is a remote ubuntu-server?
2009-11-19T04:40:00.000Z	Slart	extor	ah.. then the system monitor won't be there.. try running htop, it will display the cpu load for the different kernels
2009-11-19T04:41:00.000Z	Slart	extor	you can probably make top display the same thing.. but I'm to lazy to search the man page for the correct switces =)
2009-11-19T04:41:00.000Z	extor	Slart	I think pressing '1' will expand the CPUs to the total number of cores
2009-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	Slart	extor	ahh.. nice.. didn't know that one =)
