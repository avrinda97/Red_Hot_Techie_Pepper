2007-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	unh0ly		No ideas? :)
2007-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	in general repeat questions *in full* and spaced at least 5 mins apart.
2007-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	Are you serious?
2007-03-17T08:20:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	yes... Questions scroll, people join, so you cannot assume that people can easily remember your question.
2007-03-17T08:20:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	also leave at least 5 mins between repetitions, ideally 10.
2007-03-17T08:20:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	some people take a bit to think about questions, do Google searches, etc.
2007-03-17T08:21:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	it may take 20-30 minutes to get a comment.
2007-03-17T08:21:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	I mean to answer a question people may want to take 5-10mins doing Google searches themselves.
2007-03-17T08:22:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	Yes. I just wanted to point out, that I'm not too much a couchpotatoe to search by myself. :o)
2007-03-17T08:23:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	there are often very many bugs in graphics status save/restore. Usually they get eventually fixed.
2007-03-17T08:24:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	however, if you are running *any* sort of framebuffer kernel driver disable it, and that usually helps.
2007-03-17T08:24:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	Any idea on how to find out if I am running a fb-module?
2007-03-17T08:25:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	well, if you see the little penguin icon at the beginning of boot, you got one.
2007-03-17T08:25:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	else try 'lsmod | grep fb'
2007-03-17T08:25:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	or 'ls -ld /dev/fb*'
2007-03-17T08:26:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	Thank you. The output is crw-r--r-- 1 root root 29, 0 2007-03-16 18:44 /dev/fb0.
2007-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	looks like you have a framebuffer driver. There is an option to prevent it loading.
2007-03-17T08:29:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	By excluding the module from booting, like I already did wit fglrx?
2007-03-17T08:29:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	yes.
2007-03-17T08:29:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	there is also an option to tell the driver to not activate itself if it gets loaded.
2007-03-17T08:29:00.000Z	unh0ly	Blissex	Will I have performance-issues or something similar?
2007-03-17T08:30:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	no.
2007-03-17T08:31:00.000Z	Blissex	unh0ly	depends on *which* framebuffer driver you are using.
