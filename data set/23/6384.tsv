2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	rm_you		and it does work without it
2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	rm_you		I was asking in #debian, not sure why they told me to come here
2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	rm_you		since it WORKS in ubuntu
2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	rm_you		>_<
2007-03-27T07:32:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	:)
2007-03-27T07:26:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	are you typing that url in the nautilus browser?
2007-03-27T07:27:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	yes
2007-03-27T07:27:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	i'm unaware of what package you would need, but you're aware of Places -> Connect to Server... aren't you?
2007-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	you can connect to an ssh server pretty easily with that tool
2007-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	yes. that's how I found the syntax for the URL... and it works on my ubuntu machine, but even Places -> Connect to Server doesnt work with ssh under debian
2007-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	can you ssh in the shell?
2007-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	yes
2007-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	and i installed sshfs now, so i will probably just end up using that... I just would like the gnome- connect to server thing to work :(
2007-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	looking. just a sec
2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	all i can find is openssh-client. not sure what else would be needed. are you on etch?
2007-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	yes
2007-03-27T07:57:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	sorry. had to step away from the computer for a minute. did you get if figured out?
2007-03-27T07:57:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	no >_> I ended up using sshfs to mount the machine as a folder on the desktop... it works >_>
2007-03-27T07:57:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	sshfs is good stuff
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	use it all the time
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	brb
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	rm_you	atoponce	but the command to get that working as it should is REALLY complicated... and it's for my rommate, who is newish to linux
2007-03-27T07:59:00.000Z	atoponce	rm_you	hmmm
