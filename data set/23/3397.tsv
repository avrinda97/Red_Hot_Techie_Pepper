2008-05-13T13:32:00.000Z	xs142		How do I force folder sharing? Nautilius just whines ..
2008-05-13T13:34:00.000Z	xs142		Anyone?:(
2008-05-13T13:35:00.000Z	fde	xs142	Your user must be in sambausers group.
2008-05-13T13:35:00.000Z	fde	xs142	also, you have to have samba installed ...
2008-05-13T13:37:00.000Z	fde	xs142	As I said, install samba and add yourself to the sambausers group.
2008-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	xs142	fde	Bue samba installed when I first opened the sharing options
2008-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	fde	xs142	Ok... then add your user to the sambausers group......
2008-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	xs142	fde	how?
2008-05-13T13:39:00.000Z	fde	xs142	gksudo gedit /etc/group ... add your user to the line that starts 'sambausers' after the last : without spaces.
2008-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	xs142	fde	you mean sambashare?
2008-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	fde	xs142	yeah... sorry
2008-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	xs142	fde	it's there
2008-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	fde	xs142	Then it should work fine.
2008-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	xs142	fde	it doesn't
2008-05-13T13:41:00.000Z	fde	xs142	What is it not doing?
2008-05-13T13:41:00.000Z	xs142	fde	Right click folder -> Sharing Options -> "Share this folder" --> Create Share -> Add these permissions Automatically --> ""Could not change the permission of folder "xx" ..
2008-05-13T13:42:00.000Z	fde	xs142	I don't even have that option... hardy?
2008-05-13T13:42:00.000Z	xs142	fde	ofc
2008-05-13T13:43:00.000Z	xs142	fde	it just says it can't :P My guess is the usual "oh you're not root, sod off then" thing that's going on?
2008-05-13T13:43:00.000Z	fde	xs142	You're in the group that has permission to do that...  what is 'ofc' though?
2008-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	xs142	fde	"ofcourse" sorry :P
2008-05-13T13:45:00.000Z	fde	xs142	Then I'm not sure where you're getting that option... I see "allow others to write to share" as the closest option to yours....
