2005-10-07T14:35:00.000Z	Mars__^		Hi I have big problem. After i installed Opera, my internet connection is very slow (browsers) i cant open any website. But thunderbird and xchat works good. Maybe it is because of that there were some errors during installing Opera? Maybe you could tell me how to uninstall it? I installed it with: sh install.sh (i cant uninstall t using dpkg -P opera)
2005-10-07T14:36:00.000Z	Mars__^		Ok thanks
2005-10-07T14:37:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	why can't you install from one of Opera's .deb files?
2005-10-07T14:37:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC		!+mount
2005-10-07T14:38:00.000Z	Mars__^	MadpilotPPC	I had a problem cause i am noob:)
2005-10-07T14:38:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC		!+opera
2005-10-07T14:38:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	see the ubotu post a few lines up, and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OperaBrowser for next time
2005-10-07T14:39:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	but I have no idea how to get rid of your current install of Opera, if you installed from source
2005-10-07T14:40:00.000Z	Mars__^		Funny, I hope i will uninstall it
2005-10-07T14:41:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	you could ask on Opera's own forums, there's a very good group of people there
2005-10-07T14:41:00.000Z	Mars__^		O another problem, i am installing nvida drivers and when i write: sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/NVIDIA-Settings.desktop: but it writes that there is not command called getdit. What is proper one?
2005-10-07T14:44:00.000Z	Mars__^		sudo: gedit: command not found
2005-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	Mars__^		what you mean?
2005-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	simpler check: type "man gedit" at a prompt, please
2005-10-07T14:47:00.000Z	Mars__^		mars@lunar:~$ man gedit
2005-10-07T14:47:00.000Z	Mars__^		No manual entry for gedit
2005-10-07T14:48:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	that's very odd - gedit is installed by default in Ubuntu, and so is the man page
2005-10-07T14:48:00.000Z	Mars__^		I didnt delete anything, what schould i do now?
2005-10-07T14:50:00.000Z	MadpilotPPC	Mars__^	try a couple other default man pages?
2005-10-07T14:55:00.000Z	Mars__^		o maybe thats because i am using kubuntu?
2005-10-07T14:55:00.000Z	Mars__^		:(
2005-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	Mars__^		o and i reasding tutorial how to install nvidia drivers, but i checkegd and i dont have /usr/share/applications/NVIDIA-Settings.desktop
2005-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	Mars__^	MadpilotPPC	thanks but can you tell me what exactly you mean?
