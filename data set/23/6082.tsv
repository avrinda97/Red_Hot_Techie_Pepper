2006-06-15T13:32:00.000Z	WarpX		I can't believe so many people use compiz ... it's a functionality wasteland
2006-06-15T13:33:00.000Z	WarpX		even metacity, which is pretty minimalistic, has buckets more features than compiz
2006-06-15T13:34:00.000Z	WarpX		metacity is the default window manager (program that displays titlebars and lets you move around windows) for gnome
2006-06-15T13:34:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	have you see the Xgl Fuctions with metacity???
2006-06-15T13:34:00.000Z	WarpX	gnuaha7	no, I briefly tried to play with it but was unsuccessful
2006-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	WarpX		I'd rather wait for aiglx I suppose
2006-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	i remember you that Xgl runs with Compiz...
2006-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	WarpX		you remember me?! this is the first or second time I've IRCd in years
2006-06-15T13:36:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	sorry the sentences was: remember that...
2006-06-15T13:36:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	the reason for the many users of compiz is that those peoples uses Xgl
2006-06-15T13:37:00.000Z	WarpX		yes, but I cannot believe that so many people can use compiz on a day-to-day basic
2006-06-15T13:37:00.000Z	WarpX		basis
2006-06-15T13:37:00.000Z	WarpX		it's a nice demo/toy but it doesn't have much functionality
2006-06-15T13:37:00.000Z	WarpX		I certainly couldn't use it every day
2006-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	SUSE 10.1 comes with Xgl and MANY people use it... me too can't use Xgl day-to-day
2006-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	WarpX		it sounds like it's still effort to get xgl working under suse
2006-06-15T13:40:00.000Z	WarpX		I would suspect that the kind of people who can make it work are the kind of people that can read a doc ... therefore I would expect they're the kind of people who desire more functionality :)
2006-06-15T13:40:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	but if some body tell you that WinBugs looks better than any linux... show to him Xgl and you will feel very good with hes eyes
2006-06-15T13:40:00.000Z	WarpX		I think clearlooks/metacity looks better than xgl/compiz
2006-06-15T13:40:00.000Z	WarpX		personally <shrug>
2006-06-15T13:41:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	or people that use Gnu/linux to play games and play films and music... but oviusly don't know what is VIM, Anjuta or GCC .P
2006-06-15T13:42:00.000Z	gnuaha7	WarpX	if you don't understand me... sorry i'm a spanish-speaking
2006-06-15T13:42:00.000Z	WarpX	gnuaha7	I understand you perfectly!
