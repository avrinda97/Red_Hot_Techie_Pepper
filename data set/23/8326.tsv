2008-05-12T03:07:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	check your media with md5sum or the test on grub
2008-05-12T03:07:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	ok well it may need a boot cheat noapic
2008-05-12T03:08:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	you edit the grub and add it then select b to boot it
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	helix	wirechief_intel	i just tried that with several apps and i keep getting weird errors. Could it be because I have a 64 bit system?
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix yes
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix use the 32bit .iso less problems
2008-05-12T03:10:00.000Z	helix	wirechief_intel	how can I DL the 32 bit..? i thought it was the default one.

2008-05-12T03:12:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix ok well also there is cheat called acpi=force not sure if that will help...you do know how to edit the grub and boot with the modification ?
2008-05-12T03:12:00.000Z	helix	wirechief_intel	yes i know how to edit grub, what's the param? (and that will not messup my installation..? right? because its working fine besides wine)
2008-05-12T03:13:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix it only uses the cheat once, it it works fine with cheat then you put it in the menu.lst after you make a backup.
2008-05-12T03:14:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		!grub
2008-05-12T03:14:00.000Z	helix	wirechief_intel	What do you mean? yes i'll make a backup of menu.lst, but i dont get the "uses the cheat once" part
