2008-07-17T00:03:00.000Z	Blaenk		what's the equivalent of cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature on ubuntu?
2008-07-17T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	that line works on my computer.. it doesn't on yours?
2008-07-17T00:04:00.000Z	Blaenk	Slart	nah
2008-07-17T00:05:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	hmm.. I've installed some sensor stuff.. lm-sensors might be a good start.. I don't know if that puts stuff in the /proc tree though
2008-07-17T00:05:00.000Z	Blaenk	Slart	alright
2008-07-17T00:07:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	here's some old info (they mention dapper which is.. well. old =) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=385446
2008-09-23T02:35:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	have you google for the error message?
2008-09-23T02:35:00.000Z	Blaenk	Slart	of course, they all say what LordC said
2009-01-13T14:27:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	I don't think a group can own a file
2009-01-13T14:28:00.000Z	Blaenk	Slart	directory even?
2009-01-13T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	it has to be user and group... but you can set permissions for the group
2009-01-13T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	nope, not even for a idrectory
2009-01-13T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	are you using command line?
2009-01-13T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	chmod g+rw filename  will make everyone in the group have read and write permissions
2009-01-13T14:30:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	the 'g' means the change the permissions for the group, +r means to add read permissions, +w means to add write permissions.. +r+w is written as +rw
2009-01-13T14:31:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	not if the file is alread owned by a user and a group
2009-01-13T14:32:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	what you write in the chmod command will be for the group that owns the file
2009-01-13T14:33:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	you can change what group owns the file later and the permissions will transfer.. the file only knows that "my group can read/write me", not that "group gr1 can read/write me"
2009-01-13T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	that looks right
2009-01-13T14:35:00.000Z	Blaenk	Slart	one last question, if a user within the group creates a file in that dir, somedir/, it will still be the same permissions right? meaning the group will have ownership, since I did it recursively
2009-01-13T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	if you're going to be using special permissions with lots of weird users/groups there are stuff you can install to let you use acl's.. I think it's pretty much like in windows
2009-01-13T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	hmm.. there is a setting for that too.. if new files in a folder inherites the parent folders permissions.. not sure how to set it though.. might be something called guid but I'm not sure
2009-01-13T14:37:00.000Z	Slart	Blaenk	you're welcome
