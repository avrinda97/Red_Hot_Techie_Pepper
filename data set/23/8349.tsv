2005-06-17T11:27:00.000Z	chrishaum		ok
2005-06-17T11:27:00.000Z	chrishaum		i tried an xp boot disk and it said press any key to boot from cd
2005-06-17T11:27:00.000Z	chrishaum		i then tried ubuntu cd, and it didn't say"tpress any key..." it just booted xp
2005-06-17T11:28:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	that's a "feature" of the xp cd
2005-06-17T11:29:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	yes, xp boot cds ask you to press a key to boot from cd so that if you leave it in the drive when you reboot it doesn't automatically boot from cd if you're away when it powers up
2005-06-17T11:34:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	you saying ubuntu doesn't boot from cd?
2005-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	ooer
2005-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	is this a cd you burned yourself from the ISO?
2005-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	boot to windows and insert the ubuntu cd, what do you see?
2005-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	you didn't do something silly like put the ISO *on* the cd?
2005-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	I have a pc here which is picky about what CDs it will boot from
2005-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	some are picky like that, yeah
2005-06-17T11:41:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	it might need madwifi driver
2005-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	sorry to say.. google...
2005-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	there's quite a bit of docus out there if you google for "linux" and your model of card
2005-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	some cards don't have a native linux driver, so some use a wrapper
2005-06-17T11:44:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	so you actually use the windows driver, but it depends on the chipset in the card, and without knowing the card...?
2005-06-17T11:44:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	give me the model number of the card
2005-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	looks like that card may be supported by the prism54.org site...
2005-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	click link, read text, digest
2005-06-17T11:55:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	seen http://nixdoc.net/files/forum/about36648.html ?
2005-06-17T11:55:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	mentions "ndiswrapper" which I *think* is the wrapper around windows drivers for linux
2005-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	popey	chrishaum	http://www.linux-wlan.org/ also
