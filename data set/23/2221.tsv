2009-12-30T09:53:00.000Z	genoobie		and aptitude is a nice pkg manager
2009-12-30T09:53:00.000Z	genoobie		which I know is in ubuntu too
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	genoobie		I just thought xubuntu would be fast, but it's not
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	genoobie		yeah 1200baud :)
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	genoobie		I remember 150
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	genoobie		well here's my question
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	genoobie		I'm having a hell of a time with debian's kernel and my sound card
2009-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	genoobie		I'm wondering if I'll fair any better with ubuntu
2009-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	genoobie		any way to check?
2009-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	genoobie		it's a laptop with cirrus sound
2009-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	aliendude5300	genoobie	if you're looking for lightweight ubuntu, try crunchbang. :)
2009-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	genoobie	aliendude5300	is that comparable to debian + LXDE?
2009-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	genoobie		well the only reason I would switch at this point is if the kernel had sound card support
2009-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	aliendude5300	genoobie	I'm not sure, but I've gotten it to run on a Pentium 3 with 128MB ram... :)
2009-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	genoobie	aliendude5300	run, or run well
2009-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	genoobie		I mean this is running well
2009-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	genoobie		I can even play flash video fairly smoothly
2009-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	genoobie		:)
2009-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	aliendude5300	genoobie	what are your system specs?
2009-12-30T09:58:00.000Z	genoobie		P3 800, 256MB
2009-12-30T09:58:00.000Z	genoobie		like I said, I would keep what I have, but the soundcard is borked
2009-12-30T09:58:00.000Z	genoobie		I dunno if the kernel that crunchbang has will work either
2009-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	aliendude5300	genoobie	give it a try... it ran pretty well actually, compared to Xubuntu which was REALLY slow. It uses OpenBox as the desktop environment.
