2007-01-04T08:34:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo		Yoohoo :D
2007-01-04T08:35:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo		Anyone care to tell me if I can use that cool smart partitioner with Ubuntu?
2007-01-04T08:35:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo		I'm talking about one like that one Mandrake used to have
2007-01-04T08:35:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo		That'll get the free space in a partition and build a new one on that
2007-01-04T08:36:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	gparted is included in the Ubuntu installer
2007-01-04T08:36:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	can it do what I said? :D
2007-01-04T08:37:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	oh yes
2007-01-04T08:37:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	won't it damage the partition I use?
2007-01-04T08:37:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	what do you mean ?
2007-01-04T08:38:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	will it take the free space in X partition, break it and build a separate partition with that, all tidy and clean without losing any data?
2007-01-04T08:38:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	if it knows how to resize the partition you're talking about, yes of course
2007-01-04T08:38:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	you don't "break" partitions
2007-01-04T08:38:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	resize?
2007-01-04T08:39:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	when will it know (or not) how to resize the partition?
2007-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	that depends on th epartition type, as I said
2007-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	all my partitions were build by Windows XP
2007-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	so, NTFS then, well it worked for me
2007-01-04T08:41:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	cool :) so thumbs up?
2007-01-04T08:41:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	why not just go try it first ? it will tell you quite clearly when you're about to make changes that can't be reversed
2007-01-04T08:42:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	yeah, but it will be a PITA for me if I download the whole installation CD and burn it with my slow internet connection just for it not to work...
2007-01-04T08:42:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	thank you!
2007-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	adaptr	PedroAGontijo	you're being paranoid.. thousands of people succesfully install Ubuntu next to Windows every day
2007-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	PedroAGontijo	adaptr	haha, good, thank you! I'll try downloading it and later on come haunt you here again ;D
