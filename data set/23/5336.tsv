2006-12-24T07:24:00.000Z	jackson3246		I'm using a single partition for the /home directory on two different ubuntu installations. both have the same username. when I boot into the second (most recently installed) installation it tells me that that /home partition has an error but if I ignore it I can boot into the system and it works perfectly as far as I can tell. any ideas as to the error's origin?
2006-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	Have you run fsck on the partition?
2006-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	not aside from the fsck performed at boot
2006-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	No problems while actually running?
2006-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	nope. I'm on it right now
2006-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	Very odd
2006-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	yeah. I was thinking it might have something to do with UIDs or something. I don't know anything about that though
2006-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	It's possible.  Have you checked whether they are different?
2006-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	I haven't. I'm not sure how, to be honest
2006-12-24T07:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	System > Admin > Users is your easiest bet.  Under the advanced tab of properties
2006-12-24T07:34:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	hm... yeah. I just checked the /etc/passwd on both installations and the entries for the corresponding users are identical
2006-12-24T07:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	Does it say anything other than "there is an error"?  Anything useful in log files?
2006-12-24T07:35:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	no for the first question, and I wouldn't know which log files to check to answer the second
2006-12-24T07:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	I usually just pop into /var/log/ and look at anything that looks interesting.  Particularly syslog and the kernel one.
2006-12-24T07:36:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	oh. haha good plan. I'll check that out, yeah
2006-12-24T07:38:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	nothin good in the logs
2006-12-24T07:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	Darn.  Anything odd about this partition setup?  When did this start?
2006-12-24T07:40:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	it started just when I installed in an hour ago. I've got edgy on /dev/sda1, the home on /dev/sda2, windows on /dev/sdb1, and this one (dapper) on /dev/sdb2
2006-12-24T07:40:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	this one was the one I just installed because the dist-upgrades from breezy --> dapper --> edgy kind of messed up my system
2006-12-24T07:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	maybe it's getting weirded out b/c they're different disks, not just partitions?
2006-12-24T07:41:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	yeah. it's probably something like that. I think I'm gonna give it a topic on the message boards
2006-12-24T07:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jackson3246	good plan
2006-12-24T07:42:00.000Z	jackson3246	tonyyarusso	thanks for the help. I'll be off now
