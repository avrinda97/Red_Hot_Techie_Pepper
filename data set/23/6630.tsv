2008-01-13T09:01:00.000Z	DanaG		Oh, I can use my device fine without any special software.  The only software it came with was a media player app and a syncing thingy for people who like to use such apps.  The latter app also lets you edit FM Radio tuner presets.
2008-01-13T09:02:00.000Z	DanaG		Aaaaah:
2008-01-13T09:02:00.000Z	DanaG		USB selective suspend/resume and wakeup (EXPERIMENTAL) (USB_SUSPEND)
2008-01-13T09:02:00.000Z	DanaG		If you say Y here, you can use driver calls or the sysfs "power/state" file to suspend or resume individual USB peripherals.
2008-01-13T09:03:00.000Z	DanaG		That's the issue: the Ubuntu kernel lacks that feature.

2008-01-13T09:06:00.000Z	DanaG		Oh yeah, are there any PDF editing apps?
2008-01-13T09:07:00.000Z	DanaG		(random note: I just use the old Deskbar.)
2008-01-13T09:07:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	pdfedit
2008-01-13T09:07:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	don't remember if it's in the repos though
2008-01-13T09:10:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	did you see my reply about PDFEdit?
2008-01-13T10:18:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	how do you get that working?
2008-01-13T10:19:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	I've been wanting that for years!
2008-01-13T10:20:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	no I won't do that...
2008-01-13T10:25:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	what are those 'tapbutton1' etc about?
2008-01-13T10:28:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	ah sure, yeah I tried it once but found it too unstable/unpredictable
2008-01-13T10:30:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	I need only edit the two TwoFingerScroll options into my Xorg.comf, right?
2008-01-13T10:48:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	Yippee - almost! I can scroll but when I lift my finger, it scrolls back, to the side or somewhere else - sometimes. Is that something you've seen?
2008-01-13T10:51:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	Ah so it's a known problem? I'm using kernel 2.6.15 since 2.6.16 broke my laptop speaker muting...
2008-01-13T10:51:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	and a recent one?
2008-01-13T10:53:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	thanks!
2008-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	xfree86 and xorg are different projects afaik - but they share that kind of drivers?
2008-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	lusepuster	DanaG	anyway, a huge thanks for the help! I'll wait for Hardy (this is a machine I use for studying so I can't afford having an unstable distro...)
