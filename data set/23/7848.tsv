2010-01-12T07:05:00.000Z	imran		Ok. I am back to Ground Zero....
2010-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	imran		So, I need help and it looks like the people who tried to help me before are gone, so let me explain. I had Windows XP on HD 1. I later installed Ubuntu to HD 2. I LATER partitioned and installed Windows 7 to HD 1. So I have XP and Win 7 on HD 1, and Ubuntu on HD 2. Now, I have GRUB installed and it loads Ubuntu just fine. I cant get it to load Win 7 however. Note that Win 7 "Chain boots" into Win XP, asking if you want to boot XP or 7. So,
2010-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	imran		how can I add Win 7 to Grub?!
2010-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	imran		Also note that I forgot to say I cant load Win XP from Grub Either.
2010-01-12T07:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 in theory if using 9.10 -  the grub tools should see/add  windows.  - you DO have an entry in grub for widnwos or not?
2010-01-12T07:10:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	Im using 9.04... Can I easily update to 9.10 without a new CD?
2010-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 you can.. but that wont update grub to the latest version (grub2) - and grub2 has the fancy new stuff to see/add windows automatically
2010-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 you may have to manually edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst and add a proper entry for your windows drive.
2010-01-12T07:12:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	I tried to manually do it and couldn't get it - How can I update to 9.10 and install Grub2? I wanted to upgrade to 9.10 anyway so this is a good excuse for myself
2010-01-12T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 i would do a clean install to 9.10 - not a upgrade.. but you can try a upgrade if you want
2010-01-12T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 deopends on what you mean by 'stuff'
2010-01-12T07:14:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	Applications and Tweaks, etc.
2010-01-12T07:14:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	Games, Compiz settings, others
2010-01-12T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 thers ways to clone a list of what apps you have installed.. and if you keep /home/  on its own partiion, or restore it. your other settings stay the same
2010-01-12T07:16:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	So your saying that if I just went and clicked upgrade, I would lose as much stuff as if I had clean installed?
2010-01-12T07:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 no that is not what i said.
2010-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 upgradeing however will NOT get you to grub2. so you would still need to add the windows sytem by hand. or manually upgrade to grub2
2010-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	I understand, and ok one more question, is the installation of grub2 difficult, assuming I'm decent with terminal?
2010-01-13T04:46:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	Hey - remember me from yesterday? Just wanted to say thanks, as after updating to Karmic, GRUB picked up Windows and is booting fine now.
2010-01-13T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	  Yep - the move to grub2 is Very nice for many people
2010-01-13T04:49:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	I now have one problem, though - Ubuntu isn't letting me get drivers for my video card - it's usable, but I can't use Compiz without the drivers. I went to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and it found nothing
2010-01-13T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	imran	 you can change the background wallpaper for the grub menu . and thats about it at this time
2010-01-13T06:01:00.000Z	imran	Dr_Willis	iflema, Pelo, thanks :D
