2006-09-05T12:02:00.000Z	kaot		paging a guru:  My junk don't boot, suddenly.  Gives me "Mounting /dev/hda2 failed: no such device", drops me into busybox.  I can then mount /dev/hda2 with no problems.
2006-09-05T12:03:00.000Z	kaot		My grub looks fine, my fstab looks fine.
2006-09-05T12:04:00.000Z	kaot		Also, I blame MTecknology, because this happened because I rebooted while trying to get dual monitors working.
2006-09-05T12:04:00.000Z	kaot		:D
2006-09-05T12:05:00.000Z	kaot		yeah yeah.  Find me someone that knows how to fix it.  :\
2006-09-05T12:05:00.000Z	kaot		what's crazy is now it won't even boot windows, either.
2006-09-05T12:06:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	how does that relate to dual monitors?
2006-09-05T12:06:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	nothing, except I rebooted.  Now it doesn't boot.  If I hadn't rebooted I'd be happily doing my thing.
2006-09-05T12:07:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	could it be a faulty hard drive? i suggest you do backups soon
2006-09-05T12:07:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	probably not, I've seen no signs of it going bad before now, and I can mount linux partitions from busybox with no problems.
2006-09-05T12:08:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	I'm not ruling it out, but this is kind of seriously out of the blue.
2006-09-05T12:08:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	can you sum' up your current partitions? (and OSes)
2006-09-05T12:09:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	hda1: windows, hda2: linux /, hda3 extended for hda5 swap, and hda4 is spare space where I keep my music
2006-09-05T12:10:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	windows still works?
2006-09-05T12:10:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	what was that issue you said earlier
2006-09-05T12:10:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	no, oddly.  Starts to boot, then bluescreens so fast I can't read it and then reboots automatically.
2006-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	which issue?
2006-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	so both windows and linux have issues out of nowhere?
2006-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	kaot	JoseStefan	yeah.  I know you're going to say bad hard drive.
2006-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	backup right now, better safe than sorry
2006-09-05T12:12:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	your hard drive was nice enough to give you a warning
2006-09-05T12:13:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	not always
2006-09-05T12:14:00.000Z	JoseStefan	kaot	it could be another hardware issue, but i'm doubting it. it could be faulty ram
