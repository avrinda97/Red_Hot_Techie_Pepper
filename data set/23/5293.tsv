2007-04-06T10:50:00.000Z	mzanfardino		ok, I've done something I've having a hard time undoing. Last night, when it was late, I was screwing around with launching a wine application in it's own instance of X.  Now whenever I execute wine or winecfg my X system resets.  I don't think this is a wine specific issue, but I will ask in #wine as well.  Is there something that could bind a command to another command?
2007-04-06T10:50:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	#winehq actually ;P
2007-04-06T10:51:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	yeah, that's what I meant
2007-04-06T10:51:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	i had the same problem
2007-04-06T10:51:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	any idea of a command that could bind another command?  I thought I'd read something in the man last night refering to a TCL command, but I'll be damned if I remember what it was...
2007-04-06T10:51:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	i think it was my kkernel and video drivier
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	hmmm...
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	a new version of wine conflicted with kernel or the video driver, or something, causing X to reset
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	damn can't remember
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	that's a great hint, as I upgraded wine to .34...
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	ya i think that was the screwy one for me
2007-04-06T10:53:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	bind another cmd?
2007-04-06T10:54:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	sorry, wish I could be more specific.  It was late and the only thing I remember clearly form the man page was a reference to TCL and I thought the command was bind, but that's not right, cause bind is for network interfaces... so I just can't recall
2007-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	not even sure what you mean
2007-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	not sure what bind means relaly
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	ok, just for the record, it had nothing to do with any hullucinations of a TCL bind command.  I was able to determin it was a video driver issue (I used glxgears and found x rebooted, which is a sure fire indicator), so I just rebuilt my driver into the kernel and away I'm going.
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	lol
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	thanks for the hints, they helped me focus on the correct course of action
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	TCL bind?  i still have no idea..
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	mzanfardino	good to know though
2007-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	neither do I.... clearly the delusions of a late night and low light.
2007-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	and no booze or other inhibitors... just plain old lack of sleep...
2007-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	mzanfardino	xtknight	anyway, just thought I'd let you know. Thanks again
