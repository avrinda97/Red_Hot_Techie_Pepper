2010-03-20T16:41:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	did you install Skype from the repositories or from their website?
2010-03-20T16:42:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	their website i can be online but still when i test my video it shut it
2010-03-20T16:42:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	run it from a terminal, in debug mode if that is available.
2010-03-20T16:43:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	how can i do that?
2010-03-20T16:44:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	open a terminal and type Skype, then give me the output when it crashes.
2010-03-20T16:46:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	its just open skype as usual but not the problem is that my problem is when i test my webcam inside the skype it gives shut it my skype
2010-03-20T16:48:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	I know that's the problem, but you should see an error message in the terminal when your application crashes.
2010-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	nothing seen on screnn or on terminal
2010-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	try skype --debug
2010-03-20T16:51:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	interesting i did it and open skype as usual and then give my pass and then online and then test it again and it shut it again but in terminal its says "aborted"
2010-03-20T16:52:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	I'll look if this a known problen.
2010-03-20T16:53:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	looks like Skype is closed-source, no way to figure out what's wrong. Do you have PulseAudio installed?
2010-03-20T16:54:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	how can i check?
2010-03-20T16:54:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype, try this guide.
2010-03-20T16:55:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	ok let me read
2010-03-20T16:56:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	wait, are you on Kubuntu or Ubuntu?
2010-03-20T16:59:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	on Kubuntu 9.10, Skype should work with ALSA without configuration. What webcam are you using?
2010-03-20T16:59:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	philips to ucam fun2
2010-03-20T17:04:00.000Z	orb01	Lanthes	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeWebCams. Some Philips cams work on Skype, some do not. Yours might be one of those that doesn't. Try your webcam in any other program, and/or try and older version of Skype.
2010-03-20T17:05:00.000Z	Lanthes	orb01	ok i will do
