2006-06-20T08:14:00.000Z	iamcitizen		Hey guys, when I turn on my computer, Grub loads fine, and then it goes to the next page, and it has some text, and then it says "Ok, Booting the kernel..." After that, it just sits at a black screen, but it used to display the start up processes, with that progress bar. I can still boot, but I would like to have that progress bar. Any ideas?
