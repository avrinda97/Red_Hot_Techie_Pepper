2006-02-22T06:20:00.000Z	mandavi		someone knows why my ipw2200 does not reconnect after the wireless connection was temprorarily disconnected - i can't even reconnect with the build-in network configuration tool
2006-02-22T06:21:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	i do not knwo why it does that but restarting the router always helped here
2006-02-22T06:22:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	i restarted the whole machine till now - how do i restart the router?
2006-02-22T06:23:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	where are you running the machine.
2006-02-22T06:23:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	at my window...? what do you mean?
2006-02-22T06:23:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	or in other word do you use a home based wireless network like me
2006-02-22T06:23:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	yes, homebased
2006-02-22T06:24:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	it is a not encrypted free wireless lan
2006-02-22T06:24:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	does not matter i found that most of the time it is the wireless router prob
2006-02-22T06:26:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	and if i were you i would take some security measure you do not want unauth person to log in your private lan
2006-02-22T06:27:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	it is an open city-lan, not my private
2006-02-22T06:28:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	have you tried ifup and ifdown
2006-02-22T06:28:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	no, not yet
2006-02-22T06:28:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	what else do you do to restart the router for the wlan?
2006-02-22T06:29:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	alright, thank you, will try at the next disconnect....
2006-02-22T06:29:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	having casual disconnection is normal my friend you will get it a lot
2006-02-22T06:30:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	it is actually not all that many times, sometimes it runs properly for two, three days
2006-02-22T06:31:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	that is exceptional for me ? my router at home is really bad that i am using the ethernet cable. gave up on wirless
2006-02-22T06:32:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	move to berlin - free city-lan at some parts of the city - and with some privacy tool fair anough
2006-02-22T06:32:00.000Z	farous	mandavi	your mayour is a great man :)
2006-02-22T06:33:00.000Z	mandavi	farous	city major?
