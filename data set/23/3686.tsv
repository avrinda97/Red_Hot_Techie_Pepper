2009-01-26T02:36:00.000Z	flodin		what is the best option if i want to share files on my system with others, without exposing the whole file system?
2009-01-26T02:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> can you clarify what you meant by share?  users have read/write priviledges to your files?
2009-01-26T02:38:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	yes, or write privileges to parts of the directory structure
2009-01-26T02:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> there are different ways, samba, nfs, sftp ... are they users of your system? or just grabs the files?
2009-01-26T02:40:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	i only want them to have access to files, not a shell on the machine. And i'd prefer for it to have high performance and be secure. I've already looked at sftp but there's apparently no way to not expose the whole system or building lots of dummy dirs for a chroot
2009-01-26T02:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> the harder part is for them to write, reading a file is easier with tools like apache or web servers
2009-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	indeed. I find it odd that in this day and age, there's no such simple thing as a secure file server protocol
2009-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	one that has actual implementations, that is
2009-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> there are, its just you have to do some work
2009-01-26T02:44:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	what do you propose?
2009-01-26T02:44:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> for just the users to see? apache or tomcat is more than enuff
2009-01-26T02:44:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	i want write access too
2009-01-26T02:45:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	to write, proftp  server
2009-01-26T02:46:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	you mean with SSL encryption then, i suppose
2009-01-26T02:47:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> yes, proftpd uses ssl or openssh somewhere in the pipeline i believe
2009-01-26T02:48:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	there is no server that uses openssh, unfortunately
2009-01-26T02:48:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	apart from openssh itself
2009-01-26T02:48:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	-> i dont know the internals of proftpd , perhaps google for it
2009-01-26T02:49:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	ok thanks, i will try with ftp over ssl
2009-01-26T02:49:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	not ftp over ssl, look into tools like proftpd
2009-01-26T02:50:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	proftpd uses ftp over ssl
2009-01-26T02:50:00.000Z	n8tuser	flodin	okay, there are more alternatives, just google for them
2009-01-26T02:52:00.000Z	flodin	n8tuser	yes, but the only encrypted alternative is ftp over ssl
