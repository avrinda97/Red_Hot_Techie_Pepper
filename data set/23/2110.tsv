2009-10-08T03:01:00.000Z	thiebaude	greensimian	gksudo nvidia-settings and save the resolution as root
2009-10-08T03:02:00.000Z	greensimian	thiebaude	I did the, same things happen.  I even looked around for another xorg.conf just to make sure there was no sillyness in my pathing.
2009-10-08T03:03:00.000Z	thiebaude	greensimian	save to x configuration file?
2009-10-08T03:03:00.000Z	greensimian	thiebaude	yes, I save it in /etc/x11

2009-10-08T03:07:00.000Z	thiebaude	greensimian	i chose the recommended driver
2009-10-08T03:07:00.000Z	greensimian	thiebaude	Nope, it didn't detect anything...that's why I went to Nvidia to download the driver.
2009-10-08T03:08:00.000Z	thiebaude		ah ok
2009-10-08T03:08:00.000Z	greensimian	thiebaude	On my old hardware I had an older Nvidia card and it worked great.
