2010-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	jcrawford		hey guys i could use a hand with 10.04.  prior to upgrading I was using the driver from Nvidia's site which I had manually installed with their installer at the terminal.  Since I upgraded I uninstalled that using their installer again and tried to put the 185 driver in place however I cannot get 185 nor 173 to actually install.  Any takers on who wants to help me :)
2010-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	what have you tried so far?
2010-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	try /etc/modules
2010-05-03T20:45:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	(I'm darrend not darrenb) what module are you trying to rmmod?
2010-05-03T20:46:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	have you tried System>administration>Hardware Drivers
2010-05-03T20:46:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	yes and because this other module is installed those drivers will not download and install
2010-05-03T20:47:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	what's the output of "locate nvidia.ko"
2010-05-03T20:48:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	pastebin it if more than 2 lines

2010-05-03T20:50:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	that looks like the standard stuff ubuntu would use, and the versions match lucid.
2010-05-03T20:50:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	what error exactly do you get>
2010-05-03T20:50:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	when i try to enable the driver?  Just a generic message that says to check jockey.log i will paste that sec

2010-05-03T20:55:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	if you do "aptitude search nvidia-glx" which versions does it show as installed?  (line starts with an 'i')
2010-05-03T20:57:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	looks sane to me.  I assume you have you rebooted (fully) to clear out the kernel modules and then retried the System>Admin>Hardware Drivers?
2010-05-03T20:57:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	multiple times i have tried
2010-05-03T20:59:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	I can only suggest attempting to purge all packages listed in the output of "aptitude search nvidia|grep ^i" and starting again.. not sure what else to suggest unless you can find a rogue kernel module and the config that is loading it from the previous install
2010-05-03T21:03:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	how do i purge?
2010-05-03T21:14:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	"aptitude purge package-name"
2010-05-03T21:38:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	sorry can you repeat the last message, i had to step away and it blew past my buffer
2010-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	been away for a while.. did you sort out the nvidia issue?
2010-05-04T00:44:00.000Z	jcrawford	darrend	nope and sadly no time as I leave work in 15 mins to go coach my kids little league game :)
2010-05-04T00:45:00.000Z	darrend	jcrawford	:(
