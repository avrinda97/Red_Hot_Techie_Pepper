2008-05-07T07:01:00.000Z	kuahara		so 117GB disappeared
2008-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	kuahara		is this the version of gparted that i need?  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=115843&package_id=125754
2008-05-07T07:03:00.000Z	kuahara		if restoring files is easy with gparted, I would like to do that
2008-05-07T07:03:00.000Z	kuahara		my wife already cried when I told her that 2nd partition was gone
2008-05-07T07:03:00.000Z	kuahara		all the baby pics, etc... were stored there
2008-05-07T07:04:00.000Z	kuahara		I have 1.5TB of online storage
2008-05-07T07:05:00.000Z	kuahara		xcell not everything was backed up
2008-05-07T07:05:00.000Z	kuahara		she takes pics and records videos all the time, I have other crap to do than daily backups of her junk =p
2008-05-07T07:05:00.000Z	kuahara		zcat thx.  will gparted do that?
2008-05-07T07:05:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	then set up a cron job to do it for you!
2008-05-07T07:20:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	it is a LiveCD
2008-05-07T07:21:00.000Z	kuahara	fde	whats does liveCD imply
2008-05-07T07:21:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	You boot to it and it runs off the CD rather than on the harddrive... it basically just runs 'gparted' for you in a self hosting environment.
2008-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	kuahara	fde	all I can say is I tried and my comp doesn't seem to think its a bootable disk
2008-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	You're sure your system is set to boot from the CD first?
2008-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	the md5sum checked out?
2008-05-07T07:23:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	you're sure you don't just have a .iso on the CD, rather than a full CD layout?
2008-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	Can you look at the CD on your other OS, does it look normal, or is there just one file (the iso) on it?
2008-05-07T07:26:00.000Z	kuahara	fde	file on disk
2008-05-07T07:26:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	Yeah, that's bad... people are recommending 'isoburn' a Windows app...
2008-05-07T07:54:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	I've used gparted ... but your question isn't specific enough.
2008-05-10T14:25:00.000Z	fde	kuahara	GiB vs GB maybe?
