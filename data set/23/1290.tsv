2012-01-26T03:12:00.000Z	tristan3199		anybody know where to find the configurations for my desktop icons [the built in system icons, such as trash and my computer] so i can allow them to open with dolphin
2012-01-26T03:12:00.000Z	aBound	tristan3199	Simplifies things, I can add apps to the launcher, the icons can be customized, I can autohide unity it's simple and basic. No need for complications. :P
2012-01-26T03:13:00.000Z	aBound	tristan3199	With the compiz plugin makes life even better.

2012-01-26T03:14:00.000Z	tristan3199	aBound	cool, i messed around with it, but ended up preffering classic gnome. i do like that i can find my apps alot quicker.. but other than that it just seemed limited..
2012-01-26T03:16:00.000Z	aBound	tristan3199	Fallback Gnome?
2012-01-26T03:16:00.000Z	tristan3199		does anybody know where i might find configuration files that would allow me to change how My Computer and Trash Open.. there has to be something somewhere i just dont know exactly where to look..

2012-01-26T03:20:00.000Z	aBound	tristan3199	A few plugins can be installed to but once you installed the plugin you have to log out and log back in to use it.
