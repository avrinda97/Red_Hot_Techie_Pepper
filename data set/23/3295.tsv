2008-05-28T00:12:00.000Z	kurugah		my lan adapter (eth0) stopped working. i was using firestarter to route my internet coming form wlan (ath0) to eth0 when i came back from uni today my eth0 was dead. the switch wont even recocnise the cable is pluged in. anything i can check ? tried to ifdown and ifup with no results
2008-05-28T00:13:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	uninstall Firestarter, enable ufw.
2008-05-28T00:14:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	i have uninstalled firestarter what is ufw?
2008-05-28T00:23:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	I have tried them all.
2008-05-28T00:15:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	another firewall. Terminal: sudo su, ufw enable, ufw logging on, ufw default deny.
2008-05-28T00:15:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	 my network isnt working without the firewall anymore, i think i need to fix that first, or?
2008-05-28T00:16:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	the firewall is not critical if you are behind a router with built-in hardware firewall.
2008-05-28T00:16:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	as i said eth0 is dead. thats the problen i dont care if a fw is working or not
2008-05-28T00:17:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	network config problem unrelated to firewall.
2008-05-28T00:17:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	 yes
2008-05-28T00:17:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	try manual config
2008-05-28T00:18:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	i did and i ifconfiged it to an ip no results
2008-05-28T00:20:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	 ?
2008-05-28T00:21:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	you will have to troubleshoot the problem and eliminate possible causes.
2008-05-28T00:21:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	im pretty noobish. what would u advice i do next?
2008-05-28T00:22:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	find a friend will some expertise.
2008-05-28T00:23:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	 thank you for your time. ill think ill try another distro then
2008-05-28T00:54:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	re, i booted with another distro it worked so its not a hw issue of some kind is there any way i can reset all my network stuff to a working state?
2008-05-28T00:55:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	you may have messed up the install. A failed network connection is often a first sign of that.
2008-05-28T00:56:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	it worked till today. do you really think i have to reinstall?
2008-05-28T00:56:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	can't say. Find a pratical solution to the problem.
2008-05-28T00:57:00.000Z	kurugah	robg_	 are there any logs that could be of use nailing the problem down?
2008-05-28T00:58:00.000Z	robg_	kurugah	you would have to ask a Linux nerd in the room.
