2007-03-25T07:23:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	yup they woikin good :). they run games, well really the card works as good as xp. the only downside it game compatability in linux :)
2007-03-25T07:24:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	the ones you install direct from synaptic?
2007-03-25T07:25:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	Yeah i know them, are they the ones that run okay?
2007-03-25T07:25:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	yeah.
2007-03-25T07:25:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	you can use the envy installer but manually works also.
2007-03-25T07:26:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	I mean the drivers that are the nvidia-glx inside synaptic?
2007-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	I mean the drivers that are the nvidia-glx inside synaptic?
2007-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	yeah, those are the ones the guide tells you to install right?, thats what i got and it works fine
2007-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	okay :)
2007-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	Do you run games on them?
2007-03-25T07:29:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	umm i run WoW and Steam with wine and it works really good. and i got some native linux games like Quake 3, Quake 4, NWN, Savage, RTCW Enemy territory, Tibia and a VBA emulator :D
2007-03-25T07:29:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	Thats all i needed to know, thanks :)
2007-03-25T07:34:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	The guide should guide to which one you should select :)
2007-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	Its like do i want the non free-ones or the free ones?
2007-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	now im confused :)
2007-03-25T07:36:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	well you search 'linux-restricted-modules' in synaptic and look
2007-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	i have the non free ones listed. although dosen't make sense :) the modules are free :)
2007-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	shafto	omeil	Can you remember which ones you selected when you installed the drivers or did you not touch them?
2007-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	I just installed the ones that met the specification to the uname -r im running
2007-03-25T07:47:00.000Z	omeil	shafto	hows things?
