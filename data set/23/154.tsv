2012-05-17T22:03:00.000Z	MrFaggotson		Is it even possible to get Ubuntu installed on XFS?
2012-05-17T22:04:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	can't see why not.. you'd need to use an initrd
2012-05-17T22:04:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	A what?
2012-05-17T22:05:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	if you're trying to do it through the installer, i'm not sure it supports it
2012-05-17T22:05:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	if you know what you're doing though.. you could put one onto an xfs filesystem
2012-05-17T22:05:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Well, yeah.. So, how do I install it then?
2012-05-17T22:05:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	explain why you want to first
2012-05-17T22:06:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	It's a stable filesystem, and I tested it to be faster than any other. And since I do a lot of file transfers, I need speed.
2012-05-17T22:09:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	So, how do I do it?
2012-05-17T22:10:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	does the installer give you the option to use xfs?
2012-05-17T22:11:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Yeah, but I can't install GRUB2 on there :/
2012-05-17T22:12:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	does it give an error?
2012-05-17T22:12:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	It simply doesn't let me choose sda5 in my case.
2012-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	lots of info from googling but.. seems people have had success making a small /boot partition with ext3, and then / on xfs
2012-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Oh, yes! How could have I forgotten about that idea!
2012-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	I'm guessing a gig will be plenty for it.
2012-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	100 megs would probably be lots
2012-05-17T22:20:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Oh, cool.
2012-05-17T22:20:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	hmm.. actually looking at my own it's 135 megs in size
2012-05-17T22:20:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	250 would be safe for space during upgrades and such
2012-05-17T22:21:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Will make it that.
2012-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	MrFaggotson	imbezol	Yep, seems to allow me to install it just fine now.
2012-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	imbezol	MrFaggotson	cool
