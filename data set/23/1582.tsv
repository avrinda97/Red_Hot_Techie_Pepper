2010-02-21T02:28:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	oh
2010-02-21T02:28:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	what issues are you having with it?
2010-02-21T02:31:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	pvt please
2010-02-21T02:34:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	does it turn on?
2010-02-21T02:35:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	did you install from a live cd?
2010-02-21T02:35:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	have you tried using the live cd again to boot the machine?
2010-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	so after the problem the computer didnt boot anymore
2010-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	did you put the cd back in and try that?
2010-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	nothing works cd or usb
2010-02-21T02:37:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	yes didnt worked anymore
2010-02-21T02:38:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	I'm afraid that I'm out of ideas.  Perhaps others will have some. Sorry I couldn't be more help.
2010-02-21T02:38:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	all right thanks
2010-02-21T02:38:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	you might want to remove the battery, then reinstall the battery and try again. Just a thought
2010-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	another thought--my toshiba gives me the chance to select a boot device when it starts up, does yours?
2010-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	not
2010-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	newclimb	olympus	i get to select but nothing boot
2010-02-21T02:41:00.000Z	olympus	newclimb	ok, well that's about it for me.
