2008-10-25T01:06:00.000Z	dulak	favro	k, give me a minute
2008-10-25T01:04:00.000Z	dulak	favro	there is a plugin for firefox that will play video in firefox using mplayer, I cannot remember the name though
2008-10-25T01:05:00.000Z	favro	dulak	mplayer-plugin - it tries to load then does nothing
2008-10-25T01:05:00.000Z	dulak	favro	you can load mplayer manually though?
2008-10-25T01:05:00.000Z	favro	dulak	for a local file it works fine
2008-10-25T01:05:00.000Z	dulak	favro	let me install it and look, see if I have a problem
2008-10-25T01:05:00.000Z	dulak	favro	you're on 8.04?
2008-10-25T01:08:00.000Z	dulak	favro	what package name did you install?
2008-10-25T01:09:00.000Z	favro	dulak	mozilla-mplayer
2008-10-25T01:18:00.000Z	dulak	favro	that is working perfectly for me, it goes to a buffering page, then plays the video in-line in firefox
2008-10-25T01:18:00.000Z	favro	dulak	I was worried it was a local issue...
2008-10-25T01:19:00.000Z	dulak	favro	do you see the buffering page?
2008-10-25T01:19:00.000Z	dulak	favro	this is the url I used to test: http://media.grc.com/files/ss_06_17_98.wmv
2008-10-25T01:19:00.000Z	favro	dulak	nope - it seems to try then gives up after 1sec
2008-10-25T01:20:00.000Z	dulak	favro	you reloaded firefox after you installed the plugin right?
2008-10-25T01:20:00.000Z	favro	dulak	yep - been trying for a few days
2008-10-25T01:21:00.000Z	favro	dulak	have installed anything and everything that could be relevant
2008-10-25T01:21:00.000Z	dulak	favro	do this: dpkg -l | grep codec and pastebin it for me
2008-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	favro	dulak	http://pastebin.ca/1235933
2008-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	dulak	favro	hmmm, I dont' even have the w32codecs installed and it's working
2008-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	favro	dulak	I'm giving up for now - thnxs  :)
2008-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	dulak	favro	sorry I couldn't duplicate it
