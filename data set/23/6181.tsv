2010-01-25T17:52:00.000Z	retry		I generally use apt-get when i know exactly what I want and synaptic when I was to read all the neat descriptions or do a keyword search
2010-01-25T17:52:00.000Z	retry		like removing kde ...very useful to have synaptic for that
2010-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	gdb	retry	You can do that in aptitude, on the command line.
2010-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	retry		there's a whole group section called kde desktop or something to that effect

2010-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	gdb		aptitude is the recommended tool over apt
2010-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	gdb		They are not the same.
2010-01-25T17:54:00.000Z	retry		aptitude is a curses based version of synaptic pretty much
2010-01-25T17:54:00.000Z	gdb		A bicyle works fine, too.  I prefer driving a car.
2010-01-25T17:54:00.000Z	retry		they all call apt
2010-01-25T17:54:00.000Z	gdb	retry	No, it's not.
2010-01-25T17:54:00.000Z	gdb	retry	It has a curses UI, it's a command line tool just like apt-get is.
