2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	if you search the package manager for "irc" you'll see many clients
2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	system -> administration -> synaptic
2009-02-24T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	sure
2009-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	what said that ?
2009-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	ubuntu is linux
2009-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	ok - well ubuntu uses the linux kernel
2009-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	ok, good luck with it
2009-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	you heard wrong, and that is not ontopic for this channel
2009-02-24T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	yes, I don't personally rate it as a technology but I do appreciate some people will need it as there is no other tehnology
2009-02-24T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	it won't work nativley if there is no Linux kernel module for it nativly, hence why some people need to use ndiswrapper
2009-02-24T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	 you need to install it using the package manager
2009-02-24T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	it is in the ubuntu software repositories which are accessed through the package manager
2009-02-24T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	you will need to download from the ubuntu repos through the package manager
2009-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	use the package manager and the links I gave you
2009-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	as you're not running ubuntu yet you'll find it hard to discuss this
2009-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	try running it first
2009-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	hotbaby1	also read the documents ubottu just sent you
