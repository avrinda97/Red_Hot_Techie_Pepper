2005-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	it's probably power saving, it will only turn your processor up when it needs to be, you aren't missing anything.
2005-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	idiot	LeeJunFan	- I don't think so
2005-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	is it a laptop?
2005-11-28T09:10:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	try this: sudo echo "performance" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
2005-11-28T09:11:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	check your speed.
2005-11-28T09:12:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	and just how are you checking your speed?
2005-11-28T09:12:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	no, but now we have an idea of what's doing it.
2005-11-28T09:13:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	powernowd probably.
2005-11-28T09:13:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	remove it if you have it.
2005-11-28T09:14:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	sudo apt-get remove powernowd
2005-11-28T09:14:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	then it shouldn't put it into a power saving mode on your next boot.
2005-11-28T09:14:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	should be.
2005-11-28T09:17:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	idiot	yer welcome.
