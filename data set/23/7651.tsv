2005-06-05T08:08:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	you load the prism drivers eh
2005-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	They automatically get loaded using hotplug.
2005-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	*nod* Then all you need to do is set the essid and key using iwconfig (in wireless-tools)
2005-06-05T08:10:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	OK, I have tried iwconfig wlan0 essid "ATHENEOS".  That does not work I get an error
2005-06-05T08:10:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Did you run it as root?
2005-06-05T08:11:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	Yes, both as root and as sudo root.
2005-06-05T08:11:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	hoooold on. 'wlan0' ? That's not the prism driver.
2005-06-05T08:11:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Does 'ifconfig -a' show wlan0 at all?
2005-06-05T08:11:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	That is what gets loaded when I plug in the usb
2005-06-05T08:12:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	Yes, it does
2005-06-05T08:13:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	and just running 'iwconfig' lists it as having wireless extensions?
2005-06-05T08:13:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	Yes
2005-06-05T08:13:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Which error do you get when you try to set the essid?
2005-06-05T08:15:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Ah I see, you're probably using linux-wlan-ng drivers.
2005-06-05T08:15:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Do you have 'wlanctl' installed?
2005-06-05T08:16:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.
2005-06-05T08:16:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	I have wlanctl-ng
2005-06-05T08:17:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	try 'wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_autojoin ssid=ATHENEOS'
2005-06-05T08:19:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	It errors saying that authtype and resultcode are required
2005-06-05T08:19:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Ha, ok. that's promising :-)
2005-06-05T08:20:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	Check 'man wlanctl-ng' for the proper syntax to the essid line; I've never used it myself, so don't know.
2005-06-05T08:20:00.000Z	cafuego	neofax	I've been looking at http://www.fuw.edu.pl/~pliszka/hints/prism2.html
2005-06-05T08:21:00.000Z	neofax	cafuego	Thanks, that gave a result of success
