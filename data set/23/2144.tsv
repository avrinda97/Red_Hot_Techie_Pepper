2009-09-09T03:22:00.000Z	dannyD		I have a mac hfs+ USB stick that I need to write to in Ubuntu but for the life of me I can't. Can anyone help.
2009-09-09T03:24:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	there is a driver for it here http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-hfsplus/
2009-09-09T03:24:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	 I installed that but I still can't write.
2009-09-09T03:25:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	wait let me look at that carefully maybe I didn't install that
2009-09-09T03:25:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	have you considered formatting the drive and use an filesystem Linux and OSX can handle? Like fat32.
2009-09-09T03:26:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	well they must support have a FS in common that will handle large files
2009-09-09T03:27:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	hmm, dunno. it would be great if it was HFS+ though. I read that ubuntu can mount and r/w hfs+ parts but for some reason I can't get read privilges on this usb stick
2009-09-09T03:28:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	I hope you get the driver working. I don't have a mac, so never faced that problem before.
2009-09-09T03:28:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	thanks
2009-09-09T03:35:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	you still here?
2009-09-09T03:35:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	yeah sorry, was away for a bit
2009-09-09T03:37:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	so you can read, but not write?
2009-09-09T03:37:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	yes, I can read. ( i presume as it is empty) . sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/sdd2 /media/mac is what I am typing to mount.
2009-09-09T03:38:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	I'm not a guru on these things, and other members can join in. But have you tried chmod 777 the folder it's mounted too.
2009-09-09T03:39:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	when I mount, it shows it as being owned by root so I can't write to it.  Let me try chmod. I tried chowning it.
2009-09-09T03:42:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	have you tried open Nautilus as root and then trying to write too it?
2009-09-09T03:42:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	no..will try next
2009-09-09T03:46:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	try writing to it as root (alt+f2 gksu nautilus). That way we can determin if it's a driver issue or a permission one
2009-09-09T03:47:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	ok will do
2009-09-09T03:48:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	well that seems to be doing something. hmm so I guess it was permissions
2009-09-09T03:49:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	at least you got it working :p
2009-09-09T03:50:00.000Z	dannyD	rw	yeah, thanks millions for your help. I don't use these commands too often so I forget all the ins and outs
2009-09-09T03:50:00.000Z	rw	dannyD	no prob, that's why I'm here
