2008-08-15T06:03:00.000Z	macros		Hello, I just tried to encode a video with Avidemux under Linux. But surprisingly it's only 1/20 ! as fast as my Win with the same Programm. Whats wrong?
2008-08-15T06:03:00.000Z	macros		I'm encoding in x264
2008-08-15T06:04:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	thats quite cpu internsive
2008-08-15T06:05:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	I Know that, but the Windows XP on the same PC is so much faster, as I said, approximatly 20 times
2008-08-15T06:05:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	better algorhythem
2008-08-15T06:06:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	is your cpu multi-core, I think I remember something about this
2008-08-15T06:07:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	Yes it is
2008-08-15T06:07:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	I recall a similar situation with mencoder and as I recall, you have to pass specific options to get it (as in that codec) to be multicore aware
2008-08-15T06:12:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	if you do a "top" in one window, wach it encode, and I'll put money it's only using 1 core
2008-08-15T06:12:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	In the options of avidemux there is already a threads option enabled as automatic. It doesn't change the encoding speed.
2008-08-15T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	it's a funny option
2008-08-15T06:13:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	if i manually set it to 2 or 4
2008-08-15T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	I had to hardcode it
2008-08-15T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	that codec wasn't the same as others
2008-08-15T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	hence why I had to set it manually
2008-08-15T06:17:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	I don't see an option to pass an commandline parameter to x264 from avidemux.
2008-08-15T06:17:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	Also i cannot imagine that using only one core would decrease to speed to 1/20
2008-08-15T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	I don't use avidemux - so I don't know
2008-08-15T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	you'd be surprised,
2008-08-15T06:18:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	thank you very much for your help :) But it seems as if I have to use Windows for reencoding my Videos
2008-08-15T06:18:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	check out mencoder
2008-08-15T06:18:00.000Z	ikonia	macros	as another option
2008-08-15T06:20:00.000Z	macros	ikonia	I know Mencoder, but mencoder is only for encoding, I also trim the videos, cut some advertisments out and so on.
