2006-12-13T10:50:00.000Z	n2diy		What do you folks backup for a disaster recovery? Currently I backup /home, /etc, /usr, and /var. I'm I missing anything?
2006-12-13T10:51:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	if you backup /usr, then you might as well just backup the entire filesystem i guess...
2006-12-13T10:52:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	so I'm seeing, I'm taring it now and it has been cooking for an hour, and is no where near done.
2006-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	 how do you view private messages ,and don't tell Ubotu to send me one. :)
2006-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	...
2006-12-24T07:06:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	where you following the thread, he is trying to crack his "uncles" network.
2006-12-24T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	no i didn't follow from the start, i just noticed messages i shouldn't be seeing and backscrolled a little.
2006-12-24T07:09:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	roger that, he wanted help setting up port forwarding, and it turns out he didn't have access to the router, and then it got weird.
2006-12-24T10:10:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	I trying to figure out how to change my name as it appears here?
2006-12-24T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	/nick newnickname
2006-12-24T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	if you're on moderated channels (or you're muted somewhere), you won't be able to change your nickname
2006-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	are we moderated here? I want to figure this out, so when I'm working on my friends computer, I'll show up as n2diy, and not neil.
2006-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	no, we're not. type /mode #channelname, if +m shows up it means it's moderated. but we're not.
2006-12-24T10:16:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	roger that.
2007-01-25T14:16:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	channel topic
2007-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	?
2007-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	type /topic, it mentions the libc6 problems
2007-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	ah, ok.
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	seems the directory doesn't have the right permissions, to me
2007-02-01T16:43:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	it's probably a file that's only created while kppp is running, and then deleted (like a lock file). but if it can't write to the directory, it can't create the file.
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	n2diy	LjL	roger, that would explain why it doesn't exsist on the other box.
2007-02-01T16:45:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	do it for that directory that kppp.pid is supposed to reside in (if that's what you were talking about), and compare it with your other box
2007-02-01T16:45:00.000Z	LjL	n2diy	if the permissions are different, well...
