2010-04-25T12:59:00.000Z	Name141		is it possible to change where your updates come from? (the repos)
2010-04-25T12:59:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	sure, its in System -> Administration -> Synaptic -> Tools -> Repos
2010-04-25T13:00:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	that's the easiest way is with the GUI?
2010-04-25T13:00:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	ok, you could sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list, ctrl+alt+F2, sign-in, w3m google.com ...
2010-04-25T13:01:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	logging in is a good idea before doing anything on your system
2010-04-25T13:03:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	I was logged in over ssh
2010-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	oh, then through a new ssh, but you need to sudo apt-get update after you change the sources.list
2010-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	eh I was logged in to XFCE instead of Gnome.
2010-04-25T13:05:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	sudo synaptic in terminal should pull it up
2010-04-25T13:05:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	settings -> repos?
2010-04-25T13:05:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	assuming you have the -X (GUI) flag set with your SSH session
2010-04-25T13:05:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	yeah, its under Tools -> repos or Settings -> repos
2010-04-25T13:06:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	I just clicked "select best server"
2010-04-25T13:06:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	I assume that'll be ok?
2010-04-25T13:06:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	i usually do that as well, it pings them all to find the best one
2010-04-25T13:07:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	yeah, this should fix that problem
2010-04-25T13:07:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	there is also an experiemental package that does updates through bittorrent
2010-04-25T13:07:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	nothing suitable was found, maybe it's due to the high sat ping?
2010-04-25T13:08:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	you might want to check out apt-p2p which does the updates through bittorrent, assuming your isp doesn't throttle speeds
2010-04-25T13:08:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	or you could pick a repo nearest to you
2010-04-25T13:08:00.000Z	Name141	findsndcard	i can't use eMule/bitorrent with my HN7000S
2010-04-25T13:11:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	you might want to choose an ipv6 if you have that and have high latency; it handles handoffs better
2010-04-25T13:13:00.000Z	findsndcard	Name141	yes, but some a few hours after others
