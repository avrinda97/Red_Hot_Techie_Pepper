2007-03-27T11:51:00.000Z	|Amon|		basically device manager doesn't see my sound card at all, and i want to find out which driver to install. i don't know the exact model number but it's an older creative card.
2007-03-27T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	pastebin details from http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems
2007-03-27T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	I'm waiting for your pastebin entry.
2007-03-27T11:54:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	you want the pastebin from lspci -nv?
2007-03-27T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	that's just one of the things requested.
2007-03-27T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	it _is_ using alsa.
2007-03-27T11:59:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	yes, yes. Where's the pastebin?
2007-03-27T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-03-27T12:03:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	that paste is incomplete
2007-03-27T12:08:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	what do you mean it's incomplete
2007-03-27T12:09:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	it's missing output from the additional steps
2007-03-27T12:09:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	all save the last two steps
2007-03-27T12:15:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	that still only lists some output from dmesg (not complete) and /proc/interrupts
2007-03-27T12:15:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	thats not my fault
2007-03-27T12:15:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	then output it to a file, and post it on a public web site
2007-03-27T12:15:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	not everything is running because the sound card isnt installed
2007-03-27T12:17:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	err, it's _not installed_?
2007-03-27T12:17:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	meaning your pci peripheral isn't installed?
2007-03-27T12:18:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	I'm concerned about the _hardware_ being installed. Your computer does not recognize _any_ pci audio devices.
2007-03-27T12:19:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	Windows does, Ubuntu doesn't you mean
2007-03-27T12:19:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	so, reenable all sound devices in bios when you reboot. Then we'll resume debugging.
2007-03-27T12:20:00.000Z	|Amon|	crimsun	i disabled *just* the onboard in bios as that was the only selection
2007-03-27T12:20:00.000Z	crimsun	|Amon|	then power down the machine and physically read me the information from the peripheral.
