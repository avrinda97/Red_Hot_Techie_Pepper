2004-12-25T10:15:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	ubuntu warthy dog has the same keyboard bug as debian-installer fixed recently. It proposed me macintosh USB keymaps only while i am on a amd64 box.
2004-12-25T10:16:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	"Warty Warthog", not "warthy dog", please
2004-12-25T10:16:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	released-ubuntu :)
2004-12-25T10:16:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	ok, we import fixes (semi-)automatically from Debian, so that fix should be in the next release
2004-12-25T10:16:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	ok, just wanted to let you know.
2004-12-25T10:16:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	thanks
2004-12-25T10:17:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	I think I vaguely heard about that bug but it's good to know exactly ...
2004-12-25T10:17:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	the motherboard didn't like to boot from the scsi drive on the adaptec controller.
2004-12-26T06:15:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	isn't grub-installer a bit user-unfriendly asking me about the grub device name ?
2004-12-26T06:17:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	it only does that in complex situations. Normally it just says "Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?"
2004-12-26T06:18:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	well, i have two disks, that is hardly complex, isn't it.
2004-12-26T06:18:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	but well, i chose (hd0), since i configured the bios to have the sata disk first.
2004-12-26T06:20:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	it only drops to the boot device question if it detects an operating system installed that it can't recognise using os-prober (and therefore can't add to the grub menu.lst)
2004-12-26T06:21:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	well, i have a blank disk, and a disk with debian and windows installed. i want to install on the blank disk.
2004-12-26T06:44:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	can i build d-i on a ubuntu system, or is it best to do a clean install for that ? Particularly since i want to build a celeron class custom d-i, and am running pure amd64.
2004-12-26T06:45:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	better build a chroot, the libparted API change for example will cause pain
2004-12-26T06:47:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	will probably do a plain debian install in a separate partition then.
2004-12-26T06:49:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	nice.
2004-12-26T06:49:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	why doesn't grub has a nice graphical menu like it had on my self installed grub menu though ?
2004-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	Kamion	svenl	because we tried that and it broke on a number of systems depending on the graphics hardware, so we took the safer option
2004-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	ah. I can modify that manually though, withough breaking everything.
2004-12-26T07:46:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	oh.
2004-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	svenl	Kamion	how are bugs handled for the universe part of it ? Do you feed them to the debian BTS or something ?
