2007-01-25T14:08:00.000Z	ConstyXIV		has anyone used a sansa as MTP in ubuntu?
2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 MP3 player ?
2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	yes
2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 hehe just solved my MP3 MTP problem.
2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	what player?
2007-01-25T14:10:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 MTP is not really compatible (winblows thing) with linux.. BUT ! have you searched "ubuntu sansa" on google ? (how I found a way to make my MTP MP3 to become a UMS one)
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 I have a iriver t30 now UMS was MTp
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	it works in ums, but i want mtp to handle playlists and whatnot
2007-01-25T14:12:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	and mtp is actually an open standard
2007-01-25T14:12:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 humm I would search google .. I know a few apps (amarok for example) that should handle MTP
2007-01-25T14:13:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	banshee says it does, but nothing will ring it up
2007-02-01T08:16:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	is there a reason youre trying to compile it?
2007-02-01T08:17:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	something to do ? since aptget only have 0.6.3
2007-02-01T08:18:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	0.6.3 works just fine.  this isin't gentoo.  we try to make our software stable. :)
2007-02-01T08:18:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 wow a linux user that says, dontcompile your own software.... lol intresting...
2007-02-01T08:18:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	anyways... wont stop me front trying to
2007-02-04T14:30:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	because gaim's already running
2007-02-04T14:30:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 lol
2007-02-04T14:33:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	 the point is though I dont necceseraly want to be in GAIN but I want to be in CHAT, and I like things automated (liek no join/out, server messages all that crap removed making my chat screen nice and clea with just chat, not events)
2007-02-04T14:40:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	not in gnome
2007-02-04T14:40:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	why not I have it on gnome
2007-02-04T14:41:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	pbureau	gnome apps work better in gnome then kde, and vice versa (you dont have to load the other libs)
2007-02-04T14:41:00.000Z	pbureau	ConstyXIV	ah okay...
