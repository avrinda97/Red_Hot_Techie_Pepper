2010-10-02T09:07:00.000Z	Kheops		more than a back-up I don't think so :)
2010-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	what do you use to resize?
2010-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	Live CD
2010-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	well if those data are written on a disk... you have a filesystem
2010-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	Gparted.
2010-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	well backup, and be *careful*
2010-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	It's a force term.
2010-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	I can lose data during this long process of resizing ? :)
2010-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	ohhh yes you can
2010-10-02T09:11:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	it is perfectly possible :)
2010-10-02T09:12:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	during a resize, depending on the user approach, you manipulate the structure of the filesystem, which means you might damage it, and be unable to retrieve your data
2010-10-02T09:13:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	I understand..
2010-10-02T09:13:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	But what can I do instate of Backup ?
2010-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	AlbertoP	Kheops	nothing
2010-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	:)
2010-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	Kheops	AlbertoP	keep the data there till my end of my life ?
