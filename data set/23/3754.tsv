2008-01-30T16:12:00.000Z	peleg		I'm still looking for someone nice that could - maybe - help me with a quite urgent issue. I cannot login to my ubuntu because of $HOME/.dmrc problem.
2008-01-30T16:13:00.000Z	peleg		I just can't access my ubuntu (the GUI; I CAN access the terminal)
2008-01-30T16:13:00.000Z	peleg		I'm in the terminal (on a different computer)
2008-01-30T16:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	boot into recovery mode and check the ownership and permissions of the file... should be user: youruser; group: youruser; chmod 600
2008-01-30T16:15:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	I think that I've done that already.
2008-01-30T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	my .dmrc (umodified since install afaik contain tw simple lines 1: [Desktop] 2: Session=default
2008-02-18T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	firefox is know to use/leak huge amounts of memory
2008-02-18T21:17:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	annoying... still, in XP it took me up to 200, maybe 250 MB - but 1 GB ??
2008-11-12T18:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	sudo lsof /dev/snd/*
2008-11-12T18:31:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	thanks
2009-12-18T04:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	packages.ubuntu.com
2009-12-18T04:47:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	thanks; though, I don't find it... is it possible that it is not listed?
2010-09-23T22:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	looks like is fixed in maverick's mplayer
2010-09-23T22:47:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	oh, I see; how can I get it, if I can at all, then? (thanks for your reply!)
2010-09-23T22:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	dunno maybe you can request it to be backported to lucid
2010-09-23T22:48:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	don't you think I can find a .deb file of it somewhere?
2010-09-23T22:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	well you can try to install the maverick version but probably it wont work to well
2010-09-23T22:50:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	requesting such a thing sounds like a very long thing. All I want is to watch a movie tonight... and I am working on it for 3 hours already. I have also tried 3 times to compile it on my own, with no luck...
2010-09-23T22:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	vlc? xine? totem?
2010-09-23T22:52:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	vlc, for some weird reason, don't keep the pace of the hebrew subtitles -- no matter how I fix the delay and the rate, it ignores it. mplayer does it perfectly -- but shows the subtitles flipped.
2010-09-23T22:54:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	xine displays Gibberish instead of Hebrew (can't get the proper encoding)
2010-09-23T22:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	peleg	:S. as i said you can try to get the package from packages.ubuntu.com dunno if it would install ( dependencies )
2010-09-23T22:56:00.000Z	peleg	erUSUL	and totem kills my cpu, and the movie runs very slowly :)  --  I'll try to get the maverick one. thanks!
