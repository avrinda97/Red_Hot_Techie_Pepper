2011-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510		?
2011-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	Yes. Version is version.
2011-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	awesome, thanks
2011-04-05T16:25:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	amd64?
2011-04-05T16:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	preferably i686
2011-04-05T16:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	its for my T60
2011-04-05T16:27:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	I found http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ -- but I don't know if that quality as mini.iso (because it was under netboot)
2011-04-05T16:27:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	Oh it is. Also...
2011-04-05T16:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	is it LTS?
2011-04-05T16:28:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	10.04 is.
2011-04-05T16:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	and that applies to the mini iso / netboot
2011-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	See that? 10.04. :)
2011-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	Np.
2011-04-05T16:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	the thing is, i was looking at xubuntu 10.04 and it doesn't specify it as LTS, only the ubuntu (gnome) versions
2011-04-05T16:33:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	Ah, I see. That's a good question. I know 10.04 to be LTS -- and it should apply the same to all -- regardless of which variant you use.
2011-04-05T16:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	it certainly doesn't apply to kubuntu last i looked
2011-04-05T16:34:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	Check Update Sources (make sure it's still on LTS; not latest release).
2011-04-05T16:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	i was always under the impression only the gnome releases were LTS
2011-04-05T16:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	will do, thanks
2011-04-05T16:34:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	That may be the case, I'm not sure. I like bleeding edges, not LTS.
2011-04-05T16:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	red2kic	me too, thats why i run arch, but this is for something different (right tool for the job)
2011-04-05T16:36:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	I run arch here too. Yeah. I always have been to give debian a try because it's a rocking solid stable.
2011-04-19T17:57:00.000Z	red2kic	ThinkT510	He was banging on the laptop. :P
