2008-04-10T20:48:00.000Z	dave421		(sorry if I get the terminology wrong - this is an area of linux I've yet to dabble with extensively)
2008-04-10T20:49:00.000Z	dave421		I'm pretty sure there is one, Seveas ;)
2008-04-10T20:49:00.000Z	dave421		as in here: http://www.rkeene.org/projects/info/wiki/77
2008-04-10T20:50:00.000Z	dave421		so I'm going to make a seperate network on my EC2 instance which routes through the actual eth0 interface
2008-04-10T20:51:00.000Z	dave421		and that's where this dummy interface comes in :)
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421		but yes, that is the general idea.  It's more to identify the user of the software (ie me) to the company, than fooling anything or getting round licensing
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421		:)
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421		they even gave me a week's long licence to try this out
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421		so I don't have to fork over â‚¬3000 if it doesn't work
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421		(3000 euros)
2008-04-10T20:53:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	if you must use it, i suggest you take a look at tunctl to create a tap device which you can route to your eth0.
2008-04-10T20:54:00.000Z	dave421	hischild	- that sounds like a great idea
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	if you're using xen, you should be able to just add a second NIC and route it through dom0
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	dave421	hischild	- it's Amazon's xen, though
2008-04-10T20:56:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	well, then please explain to me why you need ubuntu support if you're running a domU kernel, while you could just add a second nic to it and route dom0 for it?
2008-04-10T20:57:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	it is not
2008-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	ubuntu kernels DO have the dummy package. xen support isn't here.
2008-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	dave421	hischild	- this one is obviously not your stock Ubuntu, but it definitely is Ubuntu
2008-04-10T20:59:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	ubuntu means that you run the ubuntu kernel. You run the xen kernel. It might be build for ubuntu, but it isn't the ubuntu kernel. Please ask amazon for help if they run dom0.
2008-04-10T21:02:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	ok. Despite the doubts i'll give you a hand. it should be provided in a package.
2008-04-10T21:03:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	uml-utilities
2008-04-10T21:03:00.000Z	hischild	dave421	and not to be rude or anything, but the man page of that should provide you with all the info you need.
2008-04-10T21:03:00.000Z	dave421	hischild	- thanks - I installed that package and now I have it :)
