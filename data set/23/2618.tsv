2009-06-07T17:52:00.000Z	orthodoc	vigo	what could the error msg mean?
2009-06-07T17:53:00.000Z	vigo	orthodoc	Yes, sounds like a conflict, did you also do the Qt thing?
2009-06-07T17:53:00.000Z	orthodoc		no i did no qt thingy, vigo
2009-06-07T17:54:00.000Z	orthodoc	vigo	what do i do to set it right?
2009-06-07T17:54:00.000Z	vigo	orthodoc	Look it up on the forums, I have no idea about the game or its source code restrictions, but there is always a solution.
2009-06-07T17:54:00.000Z	orthodoc	vigo	thanks
2009-06-07T17:55:00.000Z	vigo	orthodoc	The Qt thing was a suggestion for a possible fix, most all sound issues are lack of Pulse or some strange alien thing.
