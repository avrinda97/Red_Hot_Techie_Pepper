2010-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	nisulid		hi... can't find any rules... mey I just shout my question out there?
2010-10-09T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	yep!
2010-10-09T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Do you want to dual boot?
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	yes
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	but actually xp won't boot anyway
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	You can't partition the drive (I am assuming) because the partition has errors on it.  You need to boot some sort of Windows recovery and use chkdsk command.  Not sure if that's possible with a netbook.
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	so my point would be not erase the data that is there
2010-10-09T07:23:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Yeah, that's gonna be hard
2010-10-09T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Do you have a recovery partition or anything?
2010-10-09T07:24:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	i have seen that suggestion in some forums... but i was expecting some other solution was possible
2010-10-09T07:25:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	no i dont
2010-10-09T07:25:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	No.  The Linux community does not have much vested interest in creating an NTFS checker.
2010-10-09T07:25:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	hd is as it came with the mini
2010-10-09T07:26:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	yes, i figured... tried fsck with no success
2010-10-09T07:26:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Sorry! :(
2010-10-09T07:28:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	wireless should work even when booting from the flash drive?
2010-10-09T07:28:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Using Ubuntu yeah.
2010-10-09T07:28:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Booting from a USB drive should be (in theory) no different from booting from a hdd
2010-10-09T07:29:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	couldn't install the drives... ubuntu 10.04. Ethernet ok.
2010-10-09T07:33:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	thanks anyway...
2010-10-09T07:33:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	yeah.  Good luck! Call the laptop maker, get tech support. They might have an answer for you (it might delete all your data)
2010-10-09T07:35:00.000Z	nisulid	edbian	yep, that's what i was trying to avoid. i have backed it up, but not the way i wanted. Thanks
2010-10-09T07:36:00.000Z	edbian	nisulid	Yep, sorry
