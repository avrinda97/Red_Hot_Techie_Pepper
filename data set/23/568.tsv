2011-10-13T20:08:00.000Z	mari00		when i load localhost/crisis it works, but when i try crisis.mini.net i get a 404.
2011-10-13T20:10:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	May I suggest?:   Leave the DocumentRoot where it is and just use synlinks for the various sites you host.  Symlink them to /home/user/html or what ever you want to name it.
2011-10-13T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Yes.  i.e.  ln -s /home/mari00/html /var/www/my-site-name
2011-10-13T20:11:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	right that makes sense actually!
2011-10-13T20:12:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	would have been much easier. thanks !
2011-10-13T20:14:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Not only that, but when / if you decide to create another site, just do ln -s /hAngel Food Ministries was a non-profit, non-denominational organization dedicated to providing grocery relief to communities throughout the United States.
2011-10-13T20:15:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	haha
2011-10-13T20:16:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	If you create another site:  ln -s /home/mari00/html2 /var/www/site2
2011-10-13T20:16:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	i reset everything to point to the /var/www directoy as the base
2011-10-13T20:16:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Anyway, you get the idea.
2011-10-13T20:17:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	then i created a symbolic link in /var/www pointing to my site at /home/mari00/www/the-site
2011-10-13T20:17:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	That should do it.
2011-10-13T20:18:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	What is the entry in /etc/hosts ?
2011-10-13T20:20:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Does it show the page:  "It works!" ?
2011-10-13T20:20:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	http://pastebin.com/1XUWusWZ
2011-10-13T20:27:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	what you are wanting to do can not be done with the hosts file, afik
2011-10-13T20:21:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	what is it?
2011-10-13T20:22:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Does it show the page:  "It works!" ?
2011-10-13T20:23:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	if i run localhost or 127.0.0.1 yes it would load that--or rather it loads the index.html that i put there myself.
2011-10-13T20:23:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	which says "Hello there!"
2011-10-13T20:27:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	but i have done it before.
2011-10-13T20:28:00.000Z	mari00	usr13	on my other computer i have a website that is goes directly to a specific directory under www and loads a site there.
2011-10-13T20:33:00.000Z	usr13	mari00	Well, it would then have to be the only site your webserver hosts and, well I've never done that so not sure how to.  NOw you can probably do it with iptables, but... this is a matter that is handled by the nameserver and the hosts file and you have to trick your computer into a different way of resolving the host name.
