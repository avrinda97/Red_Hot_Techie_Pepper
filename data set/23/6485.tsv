2006-03-30T17:05:00.000Z	Init5		any advice on howto make windows transparent or nifty in 5.10?
2006-03-30T17:06:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	composite manager, what gfx card do you have?
2006-03-30T17:07:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	its not stable and you need a nvidia gfx card or ati radeon < 9200
2006-03-30T17:07:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	is it more stable with fluxbox, or E?
2006-03-30T17:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	it has nothing todo with the desktop environment, its related to the X server
2006-03-30T17:08:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	okay, so all these nice looking desktop screenshots around can be considered unstable?
2006-03-30T17:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	it depends on your computer, on some its very stable (like @ mine) and on some its very unstable and slow
2006-03-30T17:09:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	ok, tnx
2006-03-30T17:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	but you need to know what gfx card you have :P
2006-03-30T17:09:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	is there a command to find that out, I only know how to see it in bios
2006-03-30T17:11:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	um... i dont know a command that works for all gfx cards, but you could look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see what driver module is loaded
2006-03-30T17:12:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	then its some kind of onboard card right?
2006-03-30T17:13:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	i dont know much about that cards, but i guess composite is not working with them
2006-03-30T17:13:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	seems you have to wait till xgl is stable to use fancy desktop effects then
2006-03-30T17:13:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	okay, I'll avoid it than, -I don't like errors
2006-03-30T17:17:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	thats it
2006-03-30T17:19:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	i dont know, but you would have to mess in the console for that + you might get some errors - which you dont like
2006-03-30T17:20:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	I have made my terminal transparent, and it works just perfect, -but the rest of the windows I'm not sure how to do
2006-03-30T17:20:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	the terminal uses "faked" transparency :)
2006-03-30T17:20:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	lmao  ok
2006-03-30T17:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	the faked transparency also puts on much load on the cpu
2006-03-30T17:22:00.000Z	Init5	gfxstyler	ok, tnx for the help anyway  ;] 
2006-03-30T17:22:00.000Z	gfxstyler	Init5	no problem :)
