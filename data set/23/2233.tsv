2009-05-20T10:56:00.000Z	g0wda		what is the best way to partition your hard disk?
2009-05-20T10:57:00.000Z	g0wda		one for /home?? and one for /etc??
2009-05-20T10:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	it's most common to use one for swap, one for /, and one for /home
2009-05-20T10:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	/ should be fairly large since it would then contain everything not under /home
2009-05-20T11:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	everything
2009-05-23T10:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	not practically
2009-05-23T10:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	user's password
2009-05-23T10:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	you can limit what she does by messing with /etc/sudoers
2009-05-23T10:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	by default, you can't do anything without being in the admin group, but that group lets you do anything
2009-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	you can add her account to /etc/sudoers without putting her in the admin group
2009-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	also, you should use a toll such as visudo to edit /etc/sudoers
2009-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	don't edit it directly though.  visudo will indirectly edit it
2009-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	did you want to give her some admin access but not full admin access, or just no admin access?
2009-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	g0wda	lstarnes	ok, i want to keep her from seeing some of my files and from installing/removing packages
2009-05-23T10:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	do you want her to not be able to mess with anything out of her home directory?
2009-05-23T10:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	then don't add her to the admin group
2009-05-23T10:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	by default, that will bewhat priviliges she has: editing anything she owns, but nothing else
2009-05-23T10:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	yes, unless you add her to /etc/sudoers
2009-05-23T10:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	then ask its developers about it
2009-05-23T10:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	might be time to change passwords
2009-05-23T10:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	that's why I use the switch user feature
2009-05-23T10:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	so?  it's your computer, isn't it?
2009-05-23T11:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	g0wda	if you need to hide files from others, there's also encfs
