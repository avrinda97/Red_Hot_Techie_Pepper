2006-08-16T14:23:00.000Z	FirstStrike		AMD bought them out
2006-08-16T14:23:00.000Z	FirstStrike		well, only the future can tell
2006-08-16T14:23:00.000Z	FirstStrike		i know they're doing away with the ATI name
2006-08-16T14:24:00.000Z	FirstStrike		the whole time it's open
2006-08-16T14:24:00.000Z	FirstStrike		i compiled 2.6.17-7 tonight..it's much faster than 2.6.15
2006-08-16T14:25:00.000Z	FirstStrike		it boots about twice as fast
2006-08-16T14:25:00.000Z	FirstStrike		and runs noticeably quicker
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		there's a guide on the 2nd page of the how-to forum that walks you through getting adn compiling the kernel
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		it's cake
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		make sure you read though..there's a bit of into around page 11 that you will need otherwise it won't compile.

2006-08-16T14:30:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	ahh.. wonderful!
2006-08-16T14:31:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	i guess i stick around here if I have any simple questions... =)
2006-08-16T14:32:00.000Z	FirstStrike	nahoj	sure thing.
2006-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	I haven't got my sound to work before on this laptop, is there anything I can do about that while compiling the kernel?
2006-08-16T14:35:00.000Z	FirstStrike	nahoj	there's a lot of options you can edit while compiling a kernel. many related to sound.
2006-08-16T14:35:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	so the thing I can do is to "check" everything sound-related??
2006-08-16T14:36:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	hmm.. guess I will have to trust in google on this one
2006-08-16T14:37:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	yes, is there any thing i can write in terminal to find out exactly?
2006-08-16T14:39:00.000Z	FirstStrike	nahoj	lspci
2006-08-16T14:41:00.000Z	nahoj	FirstStrike	ah, that one was very helpful! seems like I have the following, maybe anyone else here has got it to work???0000:00:1b.0 0403: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High De finition Audio Controller (rev 04)
