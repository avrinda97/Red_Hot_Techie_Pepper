2011-08-23T21:18:00.000Z	intrader		Anyone, I am unable to reboot 10.10 goes to the terminal screen.
2011-08-23T21:20:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	have you changed/updated anything? Did it work earlier or is it a fresh installation?
2011-08-23T21:21:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, yes - on recommendation I unistalled CUPS and other stuff that synaptic labeled as cups related. The desktop disappeared.
2011-08-23T21:24:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	log in your terminal and do a "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
2011-08-23T21:26:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, I need to bring the laptop here - that simple? Would I need to be connected, or can the 10.10 disk work
2011-08-23T21:27:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	you can just login the console and try it, maybe the packages you need are still in the package cache, if not it will require network connection
2011-08-23T21:28:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	and better keep little cups, he gets sad and removes ubuntu-desktop too :)
2011-08-23T21:30:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, I have tried the install - tells me that it was unable to fetch some of the archives
2011-08-23T21:32:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	maybe try a "sudo apt-get update" first to fetch package informations
2011-08-23T21:33:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, I tried the update - still a bunch fail to load. I have place the CD for 10.10 in tray
2011-08-23T21:35:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	are you sure you have a working internet connection on that laptop?
2011-08-23T21:36:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, no it is being used by the laptop I am using to communicate with you - this laptop is running Windows Vista and I am unable to connect to the wifi on it. Can we try connecting the ubuntu to wife while on terminal?
2011-08-23T21:44:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	not sure if your cd is still in the package source list (/etc/apt/sources.list), you may try inserting the cd and then use sudo apt-cdrom add
2011-08-23T21:45:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	im trying it here but can't find my cd at the moment, still searching :p
2011-08-23T21:45:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, I will try the sudo apt-cdrom add
2011-08-23T21:48:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, glebihan, is it possible to connect the wifi to the ubuntu running the terminal? By the wayt the sudo apt-cdrom add did something with errors and finally settled back to the prompt where I reissued the 'sudo apt-get update' with same results.
2011-08-23T21:50:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, glebihan, I could temporarily disconnect the ethernet and connect it to the ubuntu laptop and reissue the update
2011-08-23T21:50:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	ye, neither did it work here =/
2011-08-23T21:51:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	when you have internet it should be a lot easier :)
2011-08-23T21:51:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, glebihan, I would have to disconnect the chat. I will try that - be back
2011-08-23T22:07:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, glebihan, wow, guys that seems to have worked - I have desktop on the ubuntu. I will continue from there with wifi in a few minutes to continue working on the initialz problem of getting print to work. The CUPS server is on a mac on the network.
2011-08-23T22:07:00.000Z	dc5ala	intrader	great! :)
2011-08-23T22:08:00.000Z	intrader	dc5ala	, glebihan, amazing help - I will be back on the ubuntu. I need to say bye for now
