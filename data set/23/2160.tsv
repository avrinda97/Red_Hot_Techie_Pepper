2010-03-14T16:50:00.000Z	AceKing		Can someone help me to merge partitions? I have a Toshiba laptop that I want to dual boot with Ubuntu. For some reason Toshiba as 3 partitions on the drive. I tried deleting the 2 small partitions and seeing if I could resize the main partition and it's not working.
2010-03-14T16:51:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	a dual boot of windows and linux usually has three partitions
2010-03-14T16:51:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	windows, linux, and swap
2010-03-14T16:51:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	I know but windows is setup with three partitions already
2010-03-14T16:52:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	Ubuntu wants to write over Vista
2010-03-14T16:52:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	boot with the ubuntu livecd and use gparted to modify your disk
2010-03-14T16:53:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	be thoughtful of which partitions you edit, as youll likely lose data in the process
2010-03-14T16:53:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	that's what I want to know.. How do I do that with 3 partitions already on the disk?
2010-03-14T16:53:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	they have a 1.5gb and a 7 gb partion that I'mt rying to delete
2010-03-14T16:56:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	the 1.5 gb is before the vista partition, and the 7 gb is after. I deleted both partitions and have unallocated space that I can't seem to do anything with
2010-03-14T16:56:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	gparted will allow you to move partitions on the disk
2010-03-14T16:57:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	I'm going to boot in to live CD right now.
2010-03-14T17:06:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	I clicked on the vista drive and clicked on Resize/ Move. I moved the slider all the way over and clicked on apply. I keep getting an error occurred while applying operations
2010-03-14T17:07:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	even thought it's unallocated space?
2010-03-14T17:07:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	just use that small 1.5g space at the start as your swap space
2010-03-14T17:09:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	I tried that. another thing I'm noticing is that the ntfs drive has a yellow triangle with an exclamation point
2010-03-14T17:10:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	my ntfs drive has the same icon
2010-03-14T17:10:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	ok
2010-03-14T17:11:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	even when I clicked on "Check" for the ntfs partition I get an error
2010-03-14T17:12:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	i dont know what to say about that, i cant even try the check command on mine, its greyed out
2010-03-14T20:32:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	I figured out the problem with the partitions on my hard drive. I ran chkdsk and the disk had errors. I am now able to resize the partition
2010-03-14T20:32:00.000Z	vivid	AceKing	glad to hear youve gotten it figured out
2010-03-14T20:33:00.000Z	AceKing	vivid	thanks for your help before
