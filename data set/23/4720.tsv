2007-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	`AnthraX		E: The package secondlife-install needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2007-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	`AnthraX		who will help me with that?
2007-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	`AnthraX		pf :(
2007-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 redownload the .deb and reinstall it.
2007-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 how did you install secondlife the first time?
2007-05-24T08:15:00.000Z	`AnthraX	dr_willis	 can i uninstall it somehow?
2007-05-24T08:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 so you installed it from .deb and now want to uninstall it?
2007-05-24T08:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 thats a different issue then. :)
2007-05-24T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 only the initial first created Linux user has sudo access.
2007-05-24T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 the sources.list has nothing todo with sudo access. :)
2007-05-24T08:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 im curious as to how you even broke sudo access.
2007-05-24T08:25:00.000Z	`AnthraX	dr_willis	what shall i do? :)
2007-05-24T08:26:00.000Z	`AnthraX	dr_willis	the problem is caused by second-life
2007-05-24T08:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 i think reading a few fundamentals of ubuntu books/guides would be in order.. while you backup/reinstall the system
2007-05-24T08:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 i seriously doubt that installing second life broke sudo
2007-05-24T08:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 install stuff like that on a per user basis. not system wide also is a good idea.
2007-05-24T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	   wget being broken is a sign of a bigger issue.
2007-05-24T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 souurces.list is not going to affect sudo.
2007-05-24T08:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 sources.list can NOT affect the sudo stuff.
2007-05-24T08:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	`AnthraX	 in the future - rember to backup files you edit by hand.
