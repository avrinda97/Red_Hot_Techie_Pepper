2005-05-08T16:31:00.000Z	Choubaka		no? :D
2005-05-08T16:31:00.000Z	Choubaka		hey, latex is made for stuff like that.
2005-05-08T16:32:00.000Z	Choubaka		nowadays people just word and crap like that when they should be using latex.
2005-05-08T16:32:00.000Z	Choubaka		+use
2005-05-08T16:33:00.000Z	Choubaka		latex is actually quite simple.
2005-05-08T16:33:00.000Z	Choubaka		whereas breezy will break.
2005-05-08T16:33:00.000Z	Choubaka		ok
2005-05-08T16:34:00.000Z	Choubaka		"will break worse than you can possibly imagine"
2005-05-08T16:34:00.000Z	Choubaka		I made debian packages for the earlier versions.
2005-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	hypno	Choubaka	feh, latex is 20 years old and designed with the limitations of past systems in mind. it's not inherently better
2005-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	Choubaka	hypno	latex isn't meant to do the same as word.
2005-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	Choubaka		also, word is not meant to do what latex does.
2005-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	Choubaka		but nowadays Amyedit it's using autotools and crap like that and I don't know how to debianise :(
2005-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	hypno	Choubaka	what does latex do that a wordprocessor doesn't?
2005-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	Choubaka	hypno	in latex, you just type the content.
2005-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	Choubaka		and the compiler takes care of formatting.
2005-05-08T16:37:00.000Z	hypno	Choubaka	and a load of markup mixed in with your text
2005-05-08T16:37:00.000Z	Choubaka		in word, you need to format things yourself.
2005-05-08T16:37:00.000Z	hypno	Choubaka	overfull hbox!
2005-05-08T16:37:00.000Z	Choubaka		and then the stuff may not be the same on another machine with the same version of word! .p
2005-05-08T16:38:00.000Z	Choubaka	hypno	latex markup is simple.
2005-05-08T16:39:00.000Z	hypno	Choubaka	\begin{tabular}[t] {|c|l|c|}!
2005-05-08T16:40:00.000Z	Choubaka	hypno	well, at least you can be sure the table doesn't fuck up when you open it in another program :P
