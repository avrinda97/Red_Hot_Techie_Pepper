2008-12-24T12:27:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	jaunty is on 2.6.28. just grab our .config
2008-12-24T12:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	ah-ha!
2008-12-24T12:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	thank you! where to get it easily tho?
2008-12-24T12:28:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	download the kernel source package for jaunty from packages.ubuntu.com and then pbuild it
2008-12-24T12:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	roger that. not sure what pbuild is tho. however, for myself, i already have a custom .config for 2.6.28. the guy who would want the jauny one is almark1
2008-12-24T12:31:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	pbuilder is an app that builds source packages into binary packages
2008-12-24T12:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	why not use  kernel-package  to make it?
2008-12-24T12:32:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	never heard of it
2008-12-24T12:33:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	pbuilder's what i always use for building packages
2008-12-24T12:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	 i use kernel-package... it makes kernel .deb packages from compiling kernel from source. made for this specific purpose in debian and debian based system
2008-12-24T12:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	but i may check out pbuild for compiling source apps! thanks
2008-12-27T12:49:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	depends on your hardware
2008-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	i have a fairly new system. don't know how much difference that makes tho
2008-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	much more specifically. for example, specific wireless cards can have issues
2008-12-27T12:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	roger. i have no wireless. dekstop system with good plain old wired cable connection
2008-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	-s, you mean?
2008-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	doh, yeah
2008-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	i don't do the sudo -i or sudo -c very often, but i just checked. i do the sudo -i, same as su it says --> sudo -i     (equivalent to sudo su - , gives you roots environment configuration)
2008-12-27T14:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	it's want i like because then it doesn't clobber any regular user
2008-12-27T14:59:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	yes
2008-12-27T14:59:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	its like eclipse
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	maco	onetinsoldier	thats correct
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	maco	roger. thanks for confirmation :-) didn't know for certain
