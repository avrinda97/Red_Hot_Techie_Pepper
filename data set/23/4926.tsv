2007-08-04T12:54:00.000Z	YoG		Hi, I'd like the keyboard volume keys to control a "softMaster" volume instead the "Master" volume, is there a way to change that?
2007-08-04T12:55:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	hm possibly, not certain how to achieve it
2007-08-04T12:56:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	are this keyboard volume control like a special hotkey?
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	yes, I have several buttons such as e-mail, calculator, and two buttons for volume up and down...
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	mm, laptop?
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	Nope. It's a wireless logitech keyboard...
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	ahh nice.. well if it's a really fancy one.. i think it might have specific drivers for extra features, i dont really know what else it can do
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	if so.. and if the drivers are also for linux.. i would imagine it could be easier
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	for example my logitech wireless mouse has a CD with software, drivers etc
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	for ubuntu???
2007-08-04T13:01:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	well its linux based.. but even then.. still not likely any support for linux ether
2007-08-04T13:02:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	mine doesnt atleast, but your might? if you have any
2007-08-04T13:03:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	I don't think so...
2007-08-04T13:04:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	mm, well i am pretty sure there should be like.. a document somewhere.. that you should beable to open.. and can probably edit the key of any key
2007-08-04T13:05:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	*shrugs* like.. with my logitech mouse i couldnt use my extra buttons.. but there was software out there that enabled me to.. and set whatever value of the keys i wanted
2007-08-04T13:06:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	search up your keyboard model.. with ubuntu perhaps
2007-08-04T13:07:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	I can use them. They worked out of the box for me. But when I press the volume buttons they change the "master" volume. Which controls only the front speakers. I'd like it to control a "softMaster" which I created and which controls all four channels...
2007-08-04T13:08:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	yeah.. well i mean.. thats what btnx did.. allowed me to not only use them.. but use them for whatever i want.. so if you can find something similar.. you can specify it to change the softmaster perhaps?
2007-08-04T13:57:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	n2diy: Thanx for the help, I've found the solution: Under system->preference->sound you can change the "default mixer tracks" to control via keyboard...
2007-08-04T13:58:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	ahh, great, lucky it was so easy
2007-08-04T13:58:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	looks like i underestimated how well thought out ubuntu system is ;)
2007-08-04T13:59:00.000Z	YoG	Jaikkanen	Yes, and it's even getting better with time (just like wine) ;-)
2007-08-04T14:00:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	YoG	i look forward to trying wine again soon, as it develops
