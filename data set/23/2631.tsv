2009-01-06T06:51:00.000Z	mas2_		was going to extract some .rar files and found out that archive manager couldn't handle .rar files so I searched and found free-unrar in synaptic. And now archive manager can open .rar but when I choose a location to extract to it says complete just after a few seconds but no file. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but in archive manager it says the file name and Read Only after the title.
2009-01-06T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	use 'unrar', not unrar-free
2009-01-06T06:52:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	ok will try it out
2009-01-06T06:56:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	I found unrar in synaptic but why does it says non free version?
2009-01-06T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	because it's not free in the "freedom" sense
2009-01-06T06:57:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	but it's free for me to download? but not free in the matter of license and stuff?
2009-01-06T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	yes
2009-01-06T06:58:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	ok thanks cool. would you happend to know where to turn of pc speaker beep sound?
2009-01-06T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	what ubuntu version?
2009-01-06T06:59:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	8.10
2009-01-06T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	xset b 0   should work.  Or 'set bell-style none' in ~/.inputrc apparently
2009-01-06T07:01:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	in the termnial? there isn't any way of doing it graphical? just had ubuntu for a couple of hours hehe
2009-01-06T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	not that I know of
2009-01-06T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	there used to be, but it went away when pulseaudio entered the scene for some reason
2009-01-06T07:02:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	I read that I had to remove pulseaudio to get another application that I want to work, XBMC. but that is a project for tomrow. Maybe the beep will go away when I take it away and replace it with what ever they said.
2009-01-06T07:02:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	thanks for the help
2009-01-06T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	removing pulseaudio sounds is probably a bad idea and sounds like overkill anyway
2009-01-06T07:04:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	the guide said that it created lagg and that there was a better option but I have no Idea if that is true. Worked fine with xset b 0 how can you know these things??
2009-01-06T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	experience I guess.  You'll want to add the command to ~/.xprofile or use system -> preferences -> sessions -> startup
2009-01-06T07:05:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	or else I have to do it every time?
2009-01-06T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	right
2009-01-06T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	mas2_	either, you'll probably actually have to create the file
2009-01-06T07:06:00.000Z	mas2_	jrib	oh okey I see. Thanks alot! Appriciate it!
