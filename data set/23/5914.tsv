2006-10-21T07:36:00.000Z	jrib	davin	does http://info.linspire.com/lindows/audiovideo/TSS_Lindows.rm work for you?
2006-10-21T07:36:00.000Z	davin	jrib	yeah it does
2006-10-21T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	davin	yeah, this is what I get when I run mplayer from a terminal with your link:  You need to obtain a new player to play this clip. Please point your web browser to http://www.real.com and download the latest RealOne Player from RealNetworks. Once you have installed it you should try this clip again.
2006-10-21T07:37:00.000Z	davin	jrib	thanks mate
2006-10-21T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	davin	I'm not sure if it's just an identification problem
2006-10-21T07:38:00.000Z	davin	jrib	I cant find RealOne, only RealPlayer
2006-10-21T07:40:00.000Z	davin	jrib	and I cant see any linux version either
2006-10-21T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	davin	realplayer 10 is in the repositories, idk about real one
2006-10-21T07:40:00.000Z	davin	jrib	sudo apt-get install realplayer gives me some error about xlibs
2006-10-21T07:43:00.000Z	jrib	davin	'realplay' should be the name of the package.  It is in edgy commercial
2006-10-21T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	davin	I mean dapper commercial
2006-10-21T07:45:00.000Z	davin	jrib	cant find realplay, only realplayer
2006-10-21T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	davin	have you enabled the dapper-commercial repository?
