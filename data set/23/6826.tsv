2008-07-28T18:30:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	how did you install it?
2008-07-28T18:30:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	anything running via /etc/rc.*/ will run as root
2008-07-28T18:37:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	i didnt find gproftpd in any of the /etc/rc*.d folders
2008-07-28T18:37:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	how did you install it?
2008-07-28T18:38:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	(and look for proftp, gproftp is just a frontend)
2008-07-28T18:38:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	then yes, that appeared starting rc3.d
2008-07-28T18:39:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	so it's starting then
2008-07-28T18:39:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	gproftp (the ui) will still require a password, and this is a good thing
2008-07-28T18:39:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	but it's only a frontend, the service itself will run regardless
2008-07-28T18:39:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	ok
2008-07-28T18:40:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	when i try accessing server without gproftpd running, i get nothing, but when its started, it works fine
2008-07-28T18:41:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	proftp only showed up in /etc/rc.3/ you said?
2008-07-28T18:41:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	not rc.2?
2008-07-28T18:42:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	you were correct, it started there
2008-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	sorry, it _wasn't_ in rc2?
2008-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	no it was
2008-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	yes proftpd was in /etc/rc2.d
2008-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	not dead sure then, it should be running (have you started it or rebooted since you installed?)
2008-07-28T18:45:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	yes the power cuts out occasionally, and the backup normally covers it but we had a 3 hour outage a few weeks ago
2008-07-28T18:45:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	"sudo /etc/init.d/proftpd start" should start it, but the two may not be communicating (gproftpd might be doing something independant of the actual ftp config stored in /etc or whever proftpd normally stores it)
2008-07-28T18:45:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	ok, but how do i set it up so that it does automatically start?
2008-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	cwillu	will00	it already is if it's in rc.2
2008-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	will00	cwillu	wols, yes it should start
