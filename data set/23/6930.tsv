2005-11-22T17:47:00.000Z	remote		does anyone in here use bluetooth with ubuntu?
2005-11-22T17:48:00.000Z	remote		I have ordered a usb bluetooth hub and a BT headset so I can use skype from my kitchen
2005-11-22T17:48:00.000Z	remote		does BT work pretty well in Ubuntu?
2005-11-22T17:49:00.000Z	remote		also - when ripping cd's I am experiencing extremely slow cd read speeds
2005-11-22T17:49:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	you need to make sure DMA is enabled on your CD drive
2005-11-22T17:49:00.000Z	remote		like 1.1-1.2x, whereas in windows, I was getting like 8x ripping
2005-11-22T17:50:00.000Z	remote	bobbyd	can you help me make sure, I thought that was the default...
2005-11-22T17:50:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	in a console: hdparm -d /dev/cdrom
2005-11-22T17:50:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	 if dma says 0 do: hdparm -d 1 /dev/cdrom
2005-11-22T17:51:00.000Z	remote	bobbyd	do you mind if we have private chat so you can walk me through this
2005-11-22T17:51:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	yes, just do it in the chan :)
2005-11-22T17:51:00.000Z	remote	bobbyd	sounds good - sorry about the output
2005-11-22T17:51:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	just open a console and do those commands with 'sudo' in front of them
2005-11-22T17:52:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	you should see transfer rates jump to 8x
2005-11-22T17:52:00.000Z	remote		it is off, your are right
2005-11-22T17:52:00.000Z	remote		brilliant channel
2005-11-22T17:53:00.000Z	bobbyd	remote	however i don't know the best way to enable it by default under ubuntu
