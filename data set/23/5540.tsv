2007-07-05T15:33:00.000Z	nich0s		I just recently installed the most recent version of Ubuntu from Windows and my resolution is pathetic. Would someone be able to help me out with establishing a less "senior" look/
2007-07-05T15:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	What GPU?
2007-07-05T15:34:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	Where would I find that information?
2007-07-05T15:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	System -> Preferenes -> Hardware information
2007-07-05T15:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	All you probably need to know is the brand ( ATI, Nvidia, intel )
2007-07-05T15:36:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	 I will just have to message you in a moment, I'm going to attack this with the HowTo really fast. :P)
2007-07-05T15:59:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	Whenever I try to boot now, it keeps telling me that it was unable to initialized xserver.
2007-07-06T16:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	What did you do to try to fix the resolution?
2007-07-06T16:02:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-07-06T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	What GPu do you have?
2007-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	Have you tried installing the -intel driver?
2007-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	I wouldn't even begin to know how.
2007-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	Ok, do you know how to install packages in Ubuntu?
2007-07-06T16:04:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	Not from prompt./
2007-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	Oh, forgot you are stuck at a terminal, ok, from a terminal run these commands to install and configure the driver first: "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel " then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" and choose "intel" as the driver
2007-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	I'll try that.  Be right back.
2007-07-06T16:08:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	I entered that information, shall I reboot?
2007-07-06T16:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	You can either reboot or just run: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-07-06T16:11:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	Hey! Awesome! It's working now... I did get a message saying, "Failed to Initialize HAL"
2007-07-06T16:11:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	Do you know what that means?
2007-07-06T16:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	I am not sure but it may mean that you will have problems with things like auto mounting external drives when they are plugged in
2007-07-06T16:12:00.000Z	nich0s	Jordan_U	OK, thanks again!
2007-07-06T16:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nich0s	np
