2009-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	why not?
2009-05-26T18:35:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	if you want to get down to it like that, most things asked in here are not ubuntu specific questions.
2009-05-26T18:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	And they get booted when they are not.
2009-05-26T18:36:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	orly? What about dingleberry's question? of System404's question? Hell, my question earlier?
2009-05-26T18:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	Watch the language thankd
2009-05-26T18:37:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	and if you're going to be so discriminatying, why not point him to a place where the answer can be found, like TLDP, or google, or ##linux ?
2009-05-26T18:37:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	sorry about language. Will keep in mind.
2009-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	Please stop your line of discussion, we are not here to point everyone to where they should be ad in debian, or linux or other non-ubuntu channels, we try to be helpful, but thee are limits
2009-05-26T18:40:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	well; if you're not going to be helpful, then don't say anything. Either point someone in the right direction, or ignore them. Anything else is rude.
2009-05-29T17:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	xinerama and compiz are not friends
2009-05-29T17:34:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	then how do I disable compiz, if that, indeed, is the problem?
2009-05-29T17:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	right click desktop , change wallpaper, last tab on wallpaper is visual effects
2009-05-29T17:35:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	ah ... I'm running kubuntu, but I have disabled visual effects.
2009-05-29T17:36:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	agreed :)
2009-05-29T17:37:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	can you think of any other good references offhand? I've been scouring google, but I only found one possible solution in the ubuntu forums, and it didn't work for me :/
2009-05-29T17:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	ati has a channel here somewhere
2009-05-29T17:37:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	kk, I'm on it, thanks.
2009-05-29T17:59:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	could you add the "smart questions" factoid to ubotu, referencing this link: http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html ?
2009-05-29T18:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	I will read through it later
2009-05-29T18:00:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	thanks for considering it :)
2009-05-29T18:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eurythmia	thanks for the suggestion
2009-06-08T22:57:00.000Z	eurythmia	Jack_Sparrow	you beat me to it :)
