2006-05-13T14:27:00.000Z	rusakk0		hello please someone help.. i want to save a picture where I still have the layers unflattened.. what would be like tiff or psd on gimp?
2006-05-13T14:29:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	save it as .xcf
2006-05-13T14:29:00.000Z	rusakk0		thanks kevin!
2006-05-13T14:29:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	np ;)
2006-05-13T14:30:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	actually there seems to be something else wrong with it, since it wont even save it as that
2006-05-13T14:30:00.000Z	rusakk0		:(
2006-05-13T14:31:00.000Z	rusakk0		but maybe I will just go to school tomorrow and do it there :)
2006-05-13T14:31:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	what does the error say?
2006-05-13T14:31:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	make sure you are saving it to a place you have permission to save it to
2006-05-13T14:32:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	it is my own computer
2006-05-13T14:32:00.000Z	rusakk0		maybe the layers are wrong somehow
2006-05-13T14:32:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	I mean don't save it to a spot for administrators, try saving it to your home directory or desktop for example
2006-05-13T14:34:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	if you tell me what the error says I might be able to help, I don't think it would be a problem with layers
2006-05-13T14:34:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	it says it is an unknown filetype
2006-05-13T14:35:00.000Z	kevin		save it as testpic.xcf  (no spaces or anything), what happens?
2006-05-13T14:35:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	but i think i have saved tiff files before and i am picking the file types from gimps own list
2006-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	did you try doing what I said?
2006-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	yes i tried saving it in the filetype you told me to and to save it in the desktop etc
2006-05-13T14:40:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	I'm not sure what the problem would be then. There is also an option under Save As that says "Select By Filetype", if that also doesn't work, then I don't know what else could be wrong
2006-05-13T14:43:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	that worked! thanks so much.. so weird that it was refusing so much :)
2006-05-13T14:44:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	you just saved me a trip to another part of the city and a lot of work
2006-05-13T14:59:00.000Z	kevin	rusakk0	glad to see it worked! take care :)
2006-05-13T15:00:00.000Z	rusakk0	kevin	you too!
