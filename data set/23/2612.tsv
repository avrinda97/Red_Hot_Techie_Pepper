2009-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	alsamixer
2009-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	commandline ? or the gui :(
2009-01-08T11:38:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	gui
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	are you comfortable working with terminal ? then I can help you quick
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	kinda
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	should be fine
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	start a terminal and type alsamixer
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	jop
2009-01-08T11:40:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	good .. now do you see mic ?
2009-01-08T11:40:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	this is where i mut/unmute
2009-01-08T11:40:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	thought thats kinda an gui
2009-01-08T11:41:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	do you see mic boost ? press m to mute unmute it .. and use arrow keys tomove about .. and use tab to go between different sttings .. out in and both
2009-01-08T11:41:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	yes kind of gui .. but its better organized than the alsa-mixer-gui ...
2009-01-08T11:43:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	hm.. thatb does not quite solve the problem
2009-01-08T11:43:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	its just less loud, but still not recording when muted
2009-01-08T11:44:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	00
2009-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	: so its not MM on any of them ...
2009-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	 no..
2009-01-08T11:46:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	n the top .. are u in Playback  or capture or ALL ?
2009-01-08T11:46:00.000Z	Soorlag	rxs	tried eeverything.. mute Mic in playback results the same
2009-01-08T11:47:00.000Z	rxs	Soorlag	can you raise the volumes on the mic... one of them should feed the mic sound back to speakers and there is one that chooses between external and internal mic
