2012-10-18T22:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 im on my phone, so im not reloading that site every 5 sec like others. ;)
2012-10-18T22:08:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	not need to reload , that's actually the first time i load that page since like 5 days
2012-10-18T22:09:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	just go to cdimages.ubuntu.com, the lastest daily of quantal is bit-wise the same Iso everyone is rushing for
2012-10-18T22:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 i dont think i need to download it to my phone. ;)
2012-10-18T22:10:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	yeah, though that would be great :)
2012-10-18T22:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 plus i updated my beta box 6 hrs ago. :0
2012-10-18T22:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 you on a laptop?
2012-10-18T22:11:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	yes
2012-10-18T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 worried it may get stolen and people may get your stuff? if so encrype. ;)
2012-10-18T22:11:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	does it really slow down everything ?
2012-10-18T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 no idea. i never use it. i see way to many people with issues  with it in here
2012-10-18T22:18:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	ok so If I don't REALLY need, I should avoid ?
2012-10-18T22:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 i perfer to keep things simple. ;)
2012-10-18T22:21:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	ok, maybe better that way... and also I backed up my /etc/folder with permissions and stuff as well as passwd and shadow, to keep my groups and users. Will it be okay to overwrite the fresh /etc/ of 12.10 with my backup ?
2012-10-18T22:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	 never tried it. i only have 3 users. so i always readd them in the same order
2012-10-31T19:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	lxde works well
2012-10-31T19:43:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	thanks, I was asking because I once tried XFCE in 12.04 and it was crashing several times. I'll give LXDE a try then.
2012-10-31T19:48:00.000Z	DX099	dr_willis	yes, but it's strange, when installing lubuntu-desktop package, it would pick up several packages that I remember were part of xfce, like 'xfburn
2012-10-31T19:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	DX099	because they liked the xfce tools...
