2009-09-19T12:11:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		has any one played half life 2 on ubuntu with wine?
2009-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	give playonlinux a try
2009-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		i have a fairly decent media pc that i installed wine on. anyway half life 2 is very laggy even though i turned off the fancy graphics on my computer
2009-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	it will easy the install and set all settings correctly..
2009-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		trying to figure out if i need to update my video card driver, or mess with the wine congif to make the FPS faster
2009-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	which 3d card do you have?
2009-09-19T12:13:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		my video card is asus nvidia geforce 6200
2009-09-19T12:14:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		amd athlon 64 x2 6000 with 4gb ram couple TB it should run fairly fast
2009-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	i ran HL2 on a 2Ghz Athlan64 with 1GB and an Nvidia 5800 back then... it was very playable..
2009-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	not saying i got 60 frames or so, some bits were slow, but mostly it was fine on that HW
2009-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	nix_chix0r	dirk_	yeah there should be no reason for the lag which is why i thought i would ask in here instead of wine
2009-09-19T12:16:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	make sure 3d accell is enabled
2009-09-19T12:16:00.000Z	nix_chix0r	dirk_	how do i do that
2009-09-19T12:16:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	have you tried installing with playonlinux? http://www.playonlinux.com/en/
2009-09-19T12:17:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	dirk@dirk-laptop:~$ glxinfo | egrep -i rendering
2009-09-19T12:17:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	should say - yes
2009-09-19T12:17:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		oh yeah it's enabled
2009-09-19T12:17:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		i was doing that earlier
2009-09-19T12:19:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		i think i'll give that play on linux a try
2009-09-19T12:19:00.000Z	nix_chix0r		maybe the fps will be faster
2009-09-19T12:20:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	did you follow the recommendations on http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=2890
2009-09-19T12:20:00.000Z	dirk_	nix_chix0r	basically those are the things playonlinux will do for you
