2011-05-25T23:49:00.000Z	bergLNX		Help! I want to install Ubuntu over my current Arch, but booting from USB drive only loads the bootloader from my disk! How should I get around this?
2011-05-25T23:50:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Change your boot priority to prioritize USB over Harddrive
2011-05-25T23:51:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	nit-wit: I am booting from the USB device, no doubt, but I still end up at the GRUB from my disk
2011-05-25T23:51:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	What computer are you using? What did you make it with?
2011-05-25T23:53:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	nit-wit Im using a Lenovo laptop, and I did press F12, and it tells me Im loading the USB drive, it reads Ubuntu and all that, and then I end up at my local GRUB
2011-05-25T23:53:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	What did you make it with? Just copying the files over?
2011-05-25T23:54:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Just out of curiousity, why do you want to install ubuntu?
2011-05-25T23:55:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	nit-wit Using win32diskimager, and creating a bootable USB... worked for Arch before...
2011-05-25T23:55:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Have you done an MD5sum check of the ISO?
2011-05-25T23:55:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	Just temp for the weekend, dont have a working Arch and need Ubuntu to play music and stuff :)
2011-05-25T23:56:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	I would also advise unetbootin as nit-wit suggested
2011-05-25T23:56:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	nit-wit Yeah it might be the USB creator who messes up
2011-05-25T23:57:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	I think it's either your USB creator or the ISO integrity
2011-05-25T23:58:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Do you not have any DVDs? As a last resort?
2011-05-25T23:59:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	No :(
2011-05-25T23:59:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	New place, havent moved 100% yet :P
2011-05-25T23:59:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Ahh ok
2011-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	nit-wit unetbootin didn't make a difference :( This is so wierd, it's like I can't boot from anything else
2011-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	You have done a USB install before right?
2011-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Also have you tried redownloading the ISO?
2011-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	Worked with USB loader before, yes, but never tried while I had Arch installed
2011-05-26T00:07:00.000Z	kwikshot	bergLNX	Do an MD5 check on the ISO
2011-05-26T00:07:00.000Z	bergLNX	kwikshot	Yeah, redownloading now, will check
