2006-10-21T09:32:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	I am sorry dude I mean this way
2006-10-21T09:32:00.000Z	h00t	SAM_theman	the proper way to do it (just figured it out) is to Enable "configuration editor" in "system tools" w/ "Alacarte Menu Editor"  ... then in config manager you just go to  /apps/nautilus/desktop ... and check enable home icon visible
2006-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	no go in your termianl as the user and type gconf-editor
2006-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	then a window pops up go to where it says apps
2006-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	then go down and look for nautilus
2006-10-21T09:34:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	then go to desktop and check 'home_icon_visible"
2006-10-21T09:35:00.000Z	h00t	SAM_theman	do you know how to cleanly install Firefox 2.0 latest RC
2006-10-21T09:37:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	umm first you willing to remove the current ubutnu version of FF?
2006-10-21T09:38:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	then again you taking that risk?
2006-10-21T09:39:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	there is no need for the rc2-3 versions yet wait till the Ubuntu urepositories come out with their version
2006-10-21T09:39:00.000Z	h00t	SAM_theman	i like to live on the edge... (still won't install Gentoo though)
2006-10-21T09:42:00.000Z	SAM_theman	h00t	go here http://everythingelse.wordpress.com/2006/07/15/howto-install-firefox-20-bon-echo-in-ubuntu/
2006-10-21T09:44:00.000Z	h00t	SAM_theman	nice ... worked like a charm ... the only thing is that you have to replace RC2 w/ RC3 if you want the latest
