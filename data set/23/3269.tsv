2008-05-31T06:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Hi! After installing Hardy, I find that my audacity does not recognize output devices.  I tried reinstalling audacity.  No use.  Is there a way to let audacity detect my audio device?
2008-05-31T06:17:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	What do you mean? Under "preferences" what audio driver are you using?
2008-05-31T06:18:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	Under preferences, there is none listed. I am not able to enter anything there.
2008-05-31T06:19:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Under "preferences" in Audacity--under "audio I/O" what devices can you select?
2008-05-31T06:23:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	As you said, I was able to select between ALSA and another restricted ATI driver before upgrading to Hardy. Now the device field under -preferences/audio IO - nothing is listed. It is blank and I am not able to select anything.  However, under input (Microphone) I have-OSS,ALSA still listed.
2008-05-31T06:24:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	OK, if you go under System > Admin/Prefs > Sound, do you have ALSA selected for everything? That would be a good thing to check.
2008-05-31T06:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	let me check.- It is OK under sound. ALSA is displayed in all the fields.
2008-05-31T06:28:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Is your problem only in Audacity? Can you play sound from other programs?
2008-05-31T06:30:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	Yes. My other apps like Amarok,Rhythmbox, mplayer etc., do work great.
2008-05-31T06:32:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Are you using version 1.3.x from the repositories? I had problems with that beta version crashing, so I went with the official stable release, 1.2.x. That might be your problem.
2008-05-31T06:35:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Have you tried running audacity from the terminal? You could then see if it returns any errors that might help you figure out what is wrong.
2008-05-31T06:37:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Before you do that, try running audacity in a terminal to see if it returns any errors (just type "audacity" in a terminal).
2008-05-31T06:38:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	I also want to report this audio detection problem  with this beta version to help the developers? (Hoping it will be of a wee-bit help)
2008-05-31T06:39:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Yes, but first see what errors (if any) you get when you run the program, and try to select an audio driver.
2008-05-31T06:44:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	Running in terminal gave a lot of errors. However audacity just popped up with the same error. May I PM the error to you? I cannot flood the errors here.( about 20 lines)
2008-05-31T06:45:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Please pastebin the errors (pastebin.com)
2008-05-31T06:49:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	I have selected just two lines from the error lot for reference. quote: -Expression 'parameters->channelCount <= maxChans' failed in 'src/hostapi/alsa/pa_linux_alsa.c', line: 924 second line: Expression 'ValidateParameters( outputParameters, hostApi, StreamDirection_Out )' failed in 'src/hostapi/alsa/pa_linux_alsa.c', line: 1142
2008-05-31T06:50:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Can't you pastebin all the errors please?
2008-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Steve-Cal	The URL is -http://pastebin.com/d6d6fc336
2008-05-31T06:56:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	Did you install Audacity through the repositories or did you compile it yourself?
2008-05-31T07:00:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	I think your best bet is give the 1.2.x version a try. Be sure to first uninstall your 1.3 version, and uou can download the 1.2.6 version here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty-updates/i386/audacity/download
2008-05-31T07:18:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	I see, well I suggested going ahead and trying the 1.2.6 stable release, which you can get at: http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty-updates/i386/audacity/download  (be sure to uninstall the 1.3 version first)
2008-05-31T07:22:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	ksbalaji	No problem, good luck with it. :)
