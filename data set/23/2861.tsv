2008-10-25T20:43:00.000Z	seronis		so anyone have an answer to how to reload (remount?) a dvd that is loading its mac partition?  I need access to its WinXP partition
2008-10-25T20:44:00.000Z	seronis		no
2008-10-25T20:44:00.000Z	seronis		dualbooting  8.04 with xp
2008-10-25T20:44:00.000Z	seronis		no vm
2008-10-25T20:45:00.000Z	seronis		i put one of my game dvd's in the drive to install it via Wine and its showing me a  apple installer
2008-10-25T20:46:00.000Z	seronis		choose  ubuntu at boot loader, (kernel .21 if that matters?),  insert dvd after logging in,   dvd icon shows on desktop
2008-10-25T20:46:00.000Z	seronis		open icon and see apple looking contents instead of windows contents
2008-10-25T20:47:00.000Z	seronis		scunizi
2008-10-25T20:47:00.000Z	seronis		setup.exe isnt visible
2008-10-25T20:48:00.000Z	[admin]	seronis	see the contents of autorun.info
2008-10-25T20:48:00.000Z	seronis	graingert	 yes its spore,  but i have other multiformat disks and id like to know the general fix for loading the windows partition of a multi format disk
2008-10-25T20:48:00.000Z	[admin]		there is a part called run=[some exe]
2008-10-25T20:49:00.000Z	seronis		it does work if i download the iso and install it
2008-10-25T20:49:00.000Z	seronis		im not worried about that
2008-10-25T20:49:00.000Z	seronis		just how do i make the dvd load the winxp contents instead of the apple partition
2008-10-25T20:50:00.000Z	seronis		not when viewing it in ubuntu
2008-10-25T20:50:00.000Z	seronis		yes when i boot into XP
2008-10-25T20:50:00.000Z	seronis		dr willis,  isnt there a method to just  'properly mount' the disk to show the XP partition ?
2008-10-25T20:51:00.000Z	seronis		im not interested in WINE instructions
2008-10-25T20:51:00.000Z	seronis		just mounting instructions
2008-10-25T20:51:00.000Z	seronis		how to properly mount a cd or dvd that is multiformat so that i can choose which section gets loaded
2008-10-25T20:52:00.000Z	[admin]	seronis	try mount -o loop
