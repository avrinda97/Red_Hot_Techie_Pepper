2009-01-17T21:01:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	that's good logic.. 40 apps on startup would slow you system start..
2009-01-17T21:02:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	are you talking about programs or services ?
2009-01-17T21:04:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	40 services won't slow your boot time.. if you have a lot of "extras" on your panels, like weather, system monitor, tracker etc.. that would slow it by some.
2009-01-17T21:07:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	might just be your video driver.. what kind of card do you have ?
2009-01-17T21:07:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	which version?
2009-01-17T21:08:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	is it 30 secs from the time you enter your uname and password
2009-01-17T21:08:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	lspci
2009-01-17T21:09:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	in a terminal type lspci and it will give you info that you can find which card you have.
2009-01-17T21:10:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	that's not long..
2009-01-17T21:11:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	look for the nvidia references
2009-01-17T21:12:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	close.. you're looking for something like "gforce 8200" 6100 etc.
2009-01-17T21:14:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	you're fine with that and the preinstalled restricted drivers.. the 6000 series cards are pretty solid.
2009-01-17T21:15:00.000Z	scunizi	marine1`	nothing.. you system seems to be just fine.. if you're looking to tweek it .. google.
2009-01-17T21:17:00.000Z	marine1`	scunizi	any ones
