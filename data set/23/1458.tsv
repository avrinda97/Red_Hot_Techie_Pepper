2010-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	do you have a network / lan and another box you can either log to or lattemt sshing in from?
2010-05-14T06:11:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	If possible:  set up a networked logserver, direct your sysklogd to it, and install the netconsole kernel module (this logs kernel panics over the net to the designated host).

2010-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	generally, random lock-ups are either hardware or kernel driver issues.
2010-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	the only other comp i have is my sisters windows xp comp =/
2010-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	Burn a knoppix disk and boot it with that.
2010-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	You can turn it into a temporary Linux box, enable netlogging, and see if you can't debug the problem.
2010-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	... or you can buy a cheap POS for $20-$50 for diagnostic purposes.
2010-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	minimal used system, natch.
2010-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	lol, she gets mad at me if i so much as add a chrome extension =/
2010-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	Dont have the money, i dont even have a comp right now, mine fried :(
2010-05-14T06:16:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	booting knoppix changes nothing on her system (now, reformatting the HD while you're running Knoppix is another story).
2010-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	.... and if you don't have any resources, well, that's sort of your problem.
2010-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	point is, she things every little thing i do will mess up her comp
2010-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	Look, she's your sister, not your wife.  It's not like she can divorce yu or something ;-)
2010-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	but since my comp is fried, the only one i can use is hers
2010-05-14T06:18:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	disconnect the HD cable.  Keeps you from making any persistent changes.
2010-05-14T06:18:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	Yeah,I hear you. Trying ot be funny.
2010-05-14T06:19:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	the other day her dvd drive died, and she thought if i opened her comp up to replace it i would mess it up
2010-05-14T06:19:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	Maybe you don't need to upgrade your computer ...
2010-05-14T06:19:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	... upgrade your sister instead.
2010-05-14T06:20:00.000Z	[Screamo]	karsten	lol.. only reason i changed the dvd is she broke her ankle (stupidly) and i wanted to laugh at the xrays :D
2010-05-14T06:21:00.000Z	karsten	[Screamo]	I was wondering what the broken ankle/DVD link was....
