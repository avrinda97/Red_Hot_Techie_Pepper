2008-07-02T19:10:00.000Z	ASULutzy		﻿﻿﻿﻿So as far as I can tell this is a Windows problem, not an Intrepid/Hardy/Ubuntu/Virtualbox problem, but figured I'd ask to make sure... I've got a .vdi image that has XP on it, it boots fine in Hardy, but when I use Virtualbox in Intrepid it goes to the Windows menu about safe mode, or boot normally etc, and no matter what I pick it blue screens and reboots immediately. Who's to blame? :P I want to say Windows since VB is tech

2008-07-02T19:13:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	nope
2008-07-02T19:11:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	I'd use amarok, it's a really good music playing app
2008-07-02T19:13:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	Do you have more than one package manager open at once? (You can't have synaptic, and update manager, and aptitude, etc) going at once
2008-07-02T19:14:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	should i apt-get dpkg ??
2008-07-02T19:14:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	No lol
2008-07-02T19:15:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	well ??
2008-07-02T19:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	﻿ sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-07-02T19:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	Thenyou could do sudo apt-get install amarok (or audacious, or whatever) I prefer amarok, lots of others in here voted for audacious
2008-07-02T19:16:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	already done ... i get the same error ...
2008-07-02T19:17:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	Did you do the first command I gave? ﻿ sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-07-02T19:18:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	yes i did ... it accpeted that .. as in came back to the bash prompt .. so i assume there were no errors
2008-07-02T19:18:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	And what does sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade say?
2008-07-02T19:19:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	ok i didnt update ... now it updated i guess .. there was a huge list of stuff .. lemme try installing it now
2008-07-02T19:20:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	Maybe try restarting lol, you are doing this with sudo right?
2008-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	type this, gedit /etc/apt/sources.list then copy and paste it into ubuntu's pastebin
2008-07-02T19:27:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	http://paste.ubuntu.com/24480/
2008-07-02T19:27:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	heh, I would restart at this point, but maybe Jack_Sparrow has better advice ;)
2008-07-07T21:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	whenever you need to know about a particular thing, you can usually type man PackageHere and it will open the manual page. For help with apt-get, man apt-get
2008-07-07T21:01:00.000Z	Vegombrei	ASULutzy	is there an uninstall command to remove a certain software ?
2008-07-07T21:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Vegombrei	apt-get remove, but again, for simple stuff like that, try reading the manual. man apt-get
