2008-09-16T21:15:00.000Z	Miles_Lane		Hello.  I have a SATA drive that I had removed my extended partition from, and then resized my /dev/sda1 WinXP partition to use the whole drive.  (I was planning to install WUBI 8.04.1 and then upgrade it to 8.10).  Anyhow, my Grub bootloader no longer boots, so I am unable to get into WinXP and run fixmbr.  Also, the WinXP Rescue CD doesn't see my drive any longer.  I have tried loading WDC...
2008-09-16T21:15:00.000Z	Miles_Lane		...drivers for the drive, but that has not worked.  Furthermore, I have been unable to reinstall Grub into /dev/sda.  I guess this is due to not having a /boot/grub directory on the drive any longer?  The SATA drive is seen by the SATA controller, but not by the BIOS.  I think this is okay, though.  Not sure.
2008-09-16T21:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	is this an addon sata card?
2008-09-16T21:17:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 It in an onboard SI 3112a controller.
2008-09-16T21:18:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 When I go into the SATA boot UI, it sees the drive, and I have the option of creating a RAID set or formatting the drive.
2008-09-16T21:20:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 Unfortunately, my other machine has no floppy drive, and I haven't been able to locate my USB floppy drive or floppy discs for that matter.
2008-09-16T21:21:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 I tried these instructions:  http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-natively.html

2008-09-16T21:23:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 I am puzzled why the WinXP install CD isn't seeing the Windows installation and the drive and allowing me to run fixmbr.
2008-09-16T21:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	sudo fdisk -l  to see your partitions from cli
2008-09-16T21:31:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 When I run "fdisk -l", it shows /dev/sda1 with the NTFS partition on it.
2008-09-16T21:33:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 I suppose I could use gparted to shrink the NTFS partition a little, create a small extended and logical partition and then install ubuntu to that.  Then I might be able to get the Grub working, boot WinXP and then run fixmbr.
2008-09-16T21:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	see if the livecd will boot the hd install
2008-09-16T21:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	Does it boot to buntu now?
2008-09-16T21:34:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 It doesn't boot off the HD presently.  I have a 8.10 daily cd running currently.  I am trying the Install from there.
2008-09-16T21:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	Does the last line in the live menu allow you to boot off the hd
2008-09-16T21:35:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 No.  Grub hangs.
2008-09-16T21:36:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 I forget the error, but can quickly trigger it, if you need it.
2008-09-16T21:36:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 The LiveCD is starting the partition manager now.
2008-09-16T21:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Miles_Lane	I am sorry but I just dont have the time
2008-09-16T21:36:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 Okay.
2008-09-16T21:36:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 Thanks for your help.
2008-09-16T21:37:00.000Z	Miles_Lane	Jack_Sparrow	 We need a couple other support people here, I guess.  :-)  Cheers.
