2006-08-04T05:12:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	yeah thats your public IP, your network has a NAT layer between it and the world that handles the local 10.0.x.x subnet
2006-08-04T05:13:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	do people  see 10.0.x.x or 85.100.y.y from remote ?
2006-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	the 10.0.x.x. is a public IP class (one of three) that allows for private networks to not use the public IP space
2006-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	always the 85.100.y.y
2006-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	what command to see from terminal 85.100.y.y , because i cant see by ifconfig
2006-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	if the tried to get to the 10.0 address, they'd get blocked by 90% of big iron routers, as they block PFC addressing to keep certain attacks at bay
2006-08-04T05:15:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	try traceroute www.google.com
2006-08-04T05:15:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	i know traceroute, but i ask the command in ubuntu, it is tracert in xp
2006-08-04T05:15:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	it should say something like ***** 10.0.0.1 , then ***** 85.100.X.X as it traces your route from your PC to google
2006-08-04T05:16:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	its "traceroute"
2006-08-04T05:17:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	you have a broswer available?
2006-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	yes i have firefox
2006-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	you can also google for "What is my IP" and click (make sure you follow the link) to see what your public IP is...
2006-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	if I wasn't stuck in a terminal with BitchX IRC, I would just check in the client to see your IP :\
2006-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	it says comman not found for traceroute ??
2006-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	so it does, try tracepath
2006-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	tab complete is a blessing
2006-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	just google for "what is my IP"
2006-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	i know google thing, just trying to learn from terminal
2006-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	eh ok well then yeah traceroute6 should be cool
2006-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	nny	tracepath is ok too:)
2006-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	need to check it out myself :)
2006-08-04T05:23:00.000Z	nny	IRCMonkeyX	another good way from term is just to ssh into a remote box, it'll tell you what your public IP is either with "who" or at the system prompt
