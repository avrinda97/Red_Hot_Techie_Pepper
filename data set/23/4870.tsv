2007-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	usser		hm, does anyone know if wine for amd64 in the repo is actually a 64 bit package and not a hack?
2007-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	usser	what repo did you find that in? Have you tried 'apt-cache show wine'?
2007-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	usser	soundray	http://wine.budgetdedicated.com
2007-05-04T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	usser	no amd64 packages in sight...
2007-05-04T14:02:00.000Z	usser	soundray	http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/pool/main/w/wine/ sorry there's aamd64 package there for feisty
2007-05-04T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	usser	downloading, will have a look
2007-05-04T14:04:00.000Z	usser	soundray	never mind its the same 32bit package apparently depends on ia32
2007-05-04T14:04:00.000Z	soundray	usser	yes, the package list indicates that
2007-05-04T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	usser	do you know about the chroot option?
2007-05-04T14:05:00.000Z	usser	soundray	what? no, what about it?
2007-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	soundray	usser	to run inherently-32bit software on an amd64 arch system, set up a 32bit chroot environment. Ubotu has more, see private message
2007-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	soundray	usser	it's more work than grafting 32bit libs in, but it's a cleaner solution.
2007-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	usser	no, it's a text-based GUI
2007-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	usser	soundray	yea i understand but it doesnt need nothing meaning i can run it through ssh?
2007-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	usser	you can
2008-05-31T04:02:00.000Z	soundray	usser	is that relevant to the chipset [KS] uses?
2008-05-31T04:03:00.000Z	soundray	usser	what do you suggest to install from backports? ([KS])
2008-05-31T04:04:00.000Z	usser	soundray	^^ it has latest iwlwifi driver
2008-05-31T04:28:00.000Z	soundray	usser	pretty sure the backports package needs the most recent kernel...
2008-05-31T04:29:00.000Z	usser	soundray	im thinking he should ditch backports if hes having troubles with -17 kernel
2008-05-31T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	usser	no X, so 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' [KS]
2008-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	usser	soundray	oh i see sorry then
2008-10-13T01:37:00.000Z	soundray	usser	I just thought that the instructions would come in handy
