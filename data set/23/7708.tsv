2005-05-21T11:47:00.000Z	kestas		am I wrong in saying that ubuntu is debian with shorter release cycles?
2005-05-21T11:48:00.000Z	kestas		whats in it for the company sponsoring ubuntu?
2005-05-21T11:48:00.000Z	kestas		cascade or something
2005-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	kestas		why are they sponsoring ubuntu and debian?
2005-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	only ubuntu
2005-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	not debian
2005-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	that doesn't mean they sponsor debian
2005-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	IBM, Red Hat, Novell, all those companies pay people to work on linux, but that doesn't mean they sponsor it
2005-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	they "advocate" it
2005-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	but not sponsor the same way Canonical sponsors ubuntu
2005-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	lol
2005-05-21T11:53:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	that was just an example, lol
2005-05-21T11:54:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	Ubuntu is GPL. and if they make it closed-source, it'll be forked most likely
2005-05-21T12:22:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	theres actually an Ubuntu media center edition on the way
2005-05-21T12:22:00.000Z	kestas	cyphase	is it for xbox?
2005-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	no, just a general media center edition
2005-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	for whatever
2005-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	kestas	cyphase	isnt ubuntu a good enough media center already for the pc?
2005-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	its not ubuntu for a specifc device. its ubuntu with certain things pre-installed, i.e. MythTV, etc
2006-01-12T16:28:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	yes
2006-01-12T16:29:00.000Z	kestas	cyphase	okay... :) can you guess what my next question will be?
2006-01-12T16:29:00.000Z	cyphase	kestas	i think so
