2010-10-25T17:24:00.000Z	Scarra3		What do you think about ubuntu 10.10 I just got a new laptop that came with windows 7 on it so im trying to decide if I should stay with Windows 7 or go with ubuntu
2010-10-25T17:26:00.000Z	Scarra3		Well I use ubuntu on my older laptop
2010-10-25T17:27:00.000Z	Scarra3		Im learning to do C++ and OpenGL but one question is can I compile it to work on windows
2010-10-25T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	opengl and C++ are standardized so if you stick to standards it will work on both

2010-10-25T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	this is ubuntu support ONLY. Please take all other chats to #ubuntu-offtopic   thanks
2010-10-29T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	I've seen this.you need a boot option. I think its something like proto=imps
2010-10-29T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	you'll need that as a modprobe option in one of the files in /etc/modprobe.d
2010-10-29T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	open one of the conf files in /etc/modprobe.d and add; options psmouse prot=imps ,save the new file andclose the editor
2010-10-29T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	then run: sudo modprobe -r psmouse; sleep 5; sudo modprobe psmouse
2011-05-09T09:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	depends on tastes and requirements
2011-05-09T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	then its great, it can do all thatstuff
2011-05-09T09:06:00.000Z	Scarra3	ActionParsnip	The question is does it work with all my hardware
2011-05-09T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	should be ok, you may need some tweaks
2011-05-09T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	most of your stuff will be fine
2011-05-09T09:13:00.000Z	Scarra3	ActionParsnip	This is my laptop
2011-05-09T09:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	should be fine, you may need a boot option to get the touchpad to play well, otherwise it a standard lappy
2011-05-09T09:16:00.000Z	Scarra3	ActionParsnip	well I booted the livecd and my touchpad worked btw what version should I go with the x86 or x64 its an amd athlon x2 dual core 2.2 GHz and it has 4GB of ram
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	it's a 64bit chip so you can use either. I'd go for 64bit personally, it will help your compiling.
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Scarra3	ActionParsnip	Ok thanks btw do you program at all
2012-02-09T22:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	how does it connect to the system?
2012-02-09T22:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	run:    lsusb    and use the 8 character hex ID to find guides.
2012-02-09T22:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scarra3	most times, Netgear uses ndiswrapper (ndisgtk) plus the windows driver
