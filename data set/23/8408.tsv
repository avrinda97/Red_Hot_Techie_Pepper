2012-08-16T21:38:00.000Z	kaylee		hey, I've got what's probably a stupid question for ya... I've got something that's looking for libmtp, but I've got libmtp9 installed... what's the best way to go about directing it to look for 9?
2012-08-16T21:38:00.000Z	kaylee		can I just to a symlink or somethign?
2012-08-16T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaylee	 some precompiled binary not from the repos wants an older version?
2012-08-16T21:41:00.000Z	kaylee		no, not a precompiled binary
2012-08-16T21:41:00.000Z	kaylee		trying to compile, and didn't want to muck with the config file unless I have to
2012-08-16T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaylee	what then exactly?
2012-08-16T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaylee	 ahh.. thats. different then
2012-08-16T21:41:00.000Z	kaylee		yeah, sorry :)
2012-08-16T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaylee	 you may need to compile the older lib also
2012-08-16T21:43:00.000Z	kaylee		is there even any possibility that something as simple as a symlink may work?
2012-08-16T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaylee	 it may need the older version for a reason. but i guess you could try..
2012-08-16T21:44:00.000Z	kaylee		I guess my main question is ... is that a retard option that's going to fubar stuff?
2012-08-16T21:44:00.000Z	kaylee		or is it just something that probably won't work?
2012-08-16T21:45:00.000Z	kaylee	histo	not that I've found, but probably ought to doublecheck
