2008-01-21T10:35:00.000Z	brandon		hey im in terminal and i just need clarification of what a message I just got means...
2008-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	brandon		Please, run the configure script as first...
2008-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	brandon		brandon@ubuntu:~/src/alsa/alsa-driver-1.0.12$ sudo make install
2008-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	genii	brandon	it means do:  ./configure;make install
2008-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	brandon		i hear no sound right now because i have an nVidia soundcard, so i am doing some updating
2008-01-21T10:38:00.000Z	brandon	genii	do i write that directly after what it has written then?
2008-01-21T10:39:00.000Z	genii	brandon	You can do them separately if you like. Eg:   ./configure                    and then when that finishes do:   make install
2008-01-21T10:40:00.000Z	brandon		so press enter on what it has now then when it is clear type ./configure;make install
2008-01-21T10:40:00.000Z	brandon		genii should I type sudo first?
2008-01-21T10:42:00.000Z	genii	brandon	needing sudo depends on what you are "making". Usually you should do something like:  more README   or for the similar file instead of README that comes with the source code
2008-01-21T10:43:00.000Z	brandon	genii	ok, but my question is do i type the "configure" part in now after the "brandon@ubuntu:~/src/alsa/alsa-driver-1.0.12$ sudo make install
2008-01-21T10:43:00.000Z	brandon		" part?
2008-01-21T10:44:00.000Z	genii	brandon	put it after the brandon@ubuntu:~/src/alsa/alsa-driver-1.1.12$          part
2008-01-21T10:44:00.000Z	genii	brandon	remember it is ./configure   and not just configure
2008-01-21T10:45:00.000Z	genii	brandon	And to save you reading the README since alsa is a sytem app and not a localised app for that user, afterwards: make                  then after that: sudo make install
2008-01-21T10:46:00.000Z	brandon		genii ok... thx will try that
2008-01-21T10:47:00.000Z	genii	brandon	If after the "sudo make install" part you do not see near the last few lines "depmod -a"     then issue that afterwards as well but with sudo, eg: sudo depmod -a
2008-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	genii	brandon	I just noticed the alsa version you are trying to compile. It is quite old now.
2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	brandon	genii	i have one more question, its about a message i get everytime i load up.  it says failed to initialize HAL
2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	brandon		any Ideas on that?
2008-01-21T10:58:00.000Z	genii	brandon	I ghosted a couple times, my connection is flakey.May have missed some messages. I'll repeat the last 2 I sent
2008-01-21T10:58:00.000Z	genii	brandon	For the HAL message I'm not much help. Someone else may know.
2008-01-21T10:58:00.000Z	brandon	genii	ok
