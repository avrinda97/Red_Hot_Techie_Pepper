2007-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	bowmann		hi I'm installing ubuntu on my laptop. I manage to boot from the cd alright but when I select "Start or Install" I get a loading bar for one minute then just a back screen with a blinking underscore at the top. Anything I can do to fix this?
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	wait
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	If that doesn't work, I would try another CD or distro
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Otherwise, you'll be in front of hours of mind-disturbind hard work
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Yeah, it's long enough
2007-01-20T07:15:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Laptops are difficult for Linux, as some stuff are not very well supported
2007-01-20T07:15:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	You can even try to read logs, by changing the current console, but that will only waste your time
2007-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	You'll have to spend days to fix it
2007-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	I don't know, try a live CD first
2007-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	And then SuSE maybe
2007-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Otherwise, stick to what already works
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	You're just testing Linux, right?
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Install windows
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	The original
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	And then VMWare
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	And Linux inside it.
2007-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Better than spending hours fixing the obvious
2007-01-20T07:18:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Ubuntu works really fine inside VMWare
2007-01-20T07:18:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	How old?
2007-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Then you don't need it in your laptop for that
2007-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	Try it inside VMWare
2007-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	VMWare Player is free
2007-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	Shizuo	bowmann	And you can create Virtual Machines using EasyVMX (google it)
