2007-06-10T11:50:00.000Z	KEEV		How can i make my xterm trans? By editing my profile? if so where can it be found?
2007-06-10T11:50:00.000Z	aubade	KEEV	What emulator you using?
2007-06-10T11:51:00.000Z	KEEV		xterm? forgive me aubade this is my first week on ubuntu(linux period).
2007-06-10T11:51:00.000Z	aubade		Ah, xterm doesn't support psuedo or actual transparency from what I know.
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		Ok..
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		When i installed it via synaptic manager...
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	aubade		If you want to retain settings, most terminals rely on .Xdefaults. gnome-terminal, konsole, and xfce4-terminal all have menus and save their settings elsewhere.
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		i cant find the icon
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		or maybe its a command to run it?
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	aubade		Command to run what? :o
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		xterm
2007-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	KEEV		or
2007-06-10T11:53:00.000Z	KEEV		aterm
2007-06-10T11:53:00.000Z	aubade		It's simply 'aterm'.
2007-06-10T11:53:00.000Z	KEEV		hum
2007-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	aubade		Can you disable the onboard entirely in the BIOS, David?
2007-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	KEEV	aubade	i'll right i have it installed.. how do i look at its config>
2007-06-10T11:56:00.000Z	aubade	KEEV	Have what installed, aterm?
2007-06-10T11:56:00.000Z	KEEV	aubade	yes
2007-06-10T11:58:00.000Z	aubade	KEEV	aterm itself doesn't have a configuration all to its own, it uses the .Xdefaults file in your home directory. There's a plethora of options listed in aterm's manual.
2007-06-10T11:59:00.000Z	KEEV	aubade	humm so how can i make it trans?
2007-06-10T11:59:00.000Z	aubade	KEEV	http://linuxreviews.org/software/x11-terms/aterm/Xdefaults.aterm.txt <-- Good example.
2007-06-10T11:59:00.000Z	KEEV	aubade	thank you!
