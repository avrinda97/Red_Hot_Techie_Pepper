2007-09-16T09:49:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	Where is that folder?

2007-09-16T09:50:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	What type of system scan are you doing?
2007-09-16T09:51:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	If its in the trash, its probably some temp file that should be deleted.
2007-09-16T09:51:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	You said it was in the recycle bin? didnt you?
2007-09-16T09:52:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	Or did you mean its in the recycle bin on your windows parition?
2007-09-16T09:53:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	Don't worry about it. lost+found is for file fragements that get picked up by the filesystem checker.  It is safe to delete it.

2007-09-16T09:57:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	What is the full path to the file?
2007-09-16T09:58:00.000Z	Pici	doug__	I woudln't worry about it.  If even I went asking about every file I didnt know about I'd be here for a long time, and I concider myself a very savvy linux user.
