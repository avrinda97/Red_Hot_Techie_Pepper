2007-06-27T09:04:00.000Z	psyber_		does anyone in here run fiesty 64bit version?
2007-06-27T09:04:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139	psyber_	what do ya need?
2007-06-27T09:05:00.000Z	psyber_	scoobydoo28139	 I am a bit concerned that half of the system tools are unavailable for amd64 systems..... did I do something wrong during the install?
2007-06-27T09:06:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139		psyber_:In my experience it ran good on this machine , but some tools were diferent, also other progy's too
2007-06-27T09:08:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139	psyber_	I did note though, in my novice experience, that the 64 edition was faster on my amd duel core.
2007-06-27T09:09:00.000Z	psyber_	scoobydoo28139	cool thanks.  I am trying to install gnome partion but it says that the program is unavailable on amd64
2007-06-27T09:10:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139	psyber_	thats stuff is why I re-installed this 32 bit edition
2007-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	psyber_	scoobydoo28139	yeah... that is what I am thinking about doing too.  Was just wondering if this was a common issue or if I did something dumb
2007-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139	psyber_	If you did then i did rite along with ya so, your not alone:)
2007-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	psyber_		lol another 64bit issue I think I am gonna go back to 32
2007-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	psyber_		it looks like gusty might be a bit more 64bit friendly
