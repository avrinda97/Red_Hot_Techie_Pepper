2008-12-20T03:56:00.000Z	FreeFull		How do I find out which driver is used for my wireless card?
2008-12-20T03:57:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	if you want to know which driver is CURRENTLY used, you can use lshw. if you want to find out which driver you should be using...google
2008-12-20T03:57:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	Thanks for the lshw tip
2008-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	It doesn't say which driver is used
2008-12-20T04:00:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	i get a line like this under my wireless card: "configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath_pci ip=192.168.1.101 latency=168 maxlatency=28 mingnt=10 module=ath_pci multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11g" there, the module=ath_pci indicates the driver
2008-12-20T04:01:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	or better yet, the driver=ath_pci indicates it. are you running lshw as sudo?
2008-12-20T04:01:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	I don't get the driver= part
2008-12-20T04:01:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	and yes, i'm running it as sudo
2008-12-20T04:02:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	I can pastebin it to show you
2008-12-20T04:03:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	http://pastebin.com/m20c4b1d0
2008-12-20T04:04:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	Also, google doesn't return any relevant results
2008-12-20T04:05:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	Any ideas?
2008-12-20T04:05:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	sorry, i don't know. you have an IP so i'm guessing it's working fine...you just don't know which module is making it work? i don't know then, sorry
2008-12-20T04:06:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	It's just that I need to set up WPA and can't use networkmanager to do that
2008-12-20T04:09:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	my wifi card is netgear wg111v3, and it worked out of the box. ndiswrapper doesn't show any windows drivers installed, so I assume it's not using ndiswrapper
2008-12-20T04:12:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	it might be p54. http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Devices <-- look under the table for PCI and USB and look for your card
2008-12-20T04:12:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	thanks
2008-12-20T04:13:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	under USB, i see this line: p54usb   Netgear   WG111 V2
2008-12-20T04:14:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	v3 doesn't seem to be listed
2008-12-20T04:16:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	hopefully, it just means the table is out of date, and hopefully WG111v2 and WG111v3 use the same driver. also, are you sure it's not WG511v3 under PCI? i can't really offer any help beyond pointing you to those speadsheets. look around on wireless.kernel.org, there might be a mailing list you can ask for further detail
2008-12-20T04:17:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	It is USB and it is model WG111v3
2008-12-20T04:21:00.000Z	FreeFull	ganymede	lsusb says Bus 004 Device 003: ID 0846:4260 NetGear, Inc. WG111v3 802.11g Adapter [realtek RTL8187B]
2008-12-20T04:22:00.000Z	ganymede	FreeFull	i don't know what to do with that information if it's not on the device spreadsheets, sorry
