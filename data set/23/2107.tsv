2009-06-27T23:11:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		Can anyone help me set up a printer by any chance?
2009-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		I don't think it's being detected
2009-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	have you tried going through the web interface to set up the printer?
2009-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		HP DeskJet 920c attached to my computer
2009-06-27T23:13:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		Not network or anything
2009-06-27T23:13:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	open your web browser and go to localhost:631
2009-06-27T23:14:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		localhost:631-> Manage Printers = No Printers found
2009-06-27T23:14:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	AddPrinter
2009-06-27T23:14:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		already there
2009-06-27T23:15:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		I have no idea what to input, I've never set up a Printer before
2009-06-27T23:15:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	name, location and description are just for you. Then you will be asked what type of printer. If you can't find your printer in the list, choose something close. You won't hurt anything by trying a few different ones til you find one that fits
2009-06-27T23:16:00.000Z	ArchEnigma	th0r	It's the location I'm confused about
2009-06-27T23:16:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	although you might go through an aggravating amount of paper. location is just for you....put where it is...on the desk, in the fridge, whereever...it isn't iimportant
2009-06-27T23:17:00.000Z	ArchEnigma	th0r	OH! lol, I thought it meant the port or something
2009-06-27T23:17:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	the name, location and description will show up when you try to manage printers....so if you were on a network you would need that info to find the right printer
2009-06-27T23:18:00.000Z	ArchEnigma	th0r	I'm on the next page, "Device URI"
2009-06-27T23:18:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	give me a sec to pull it up
2009-06-27T23:19:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	the next page should be Device for test, and it gives you a  drop down list
2009-06-27T23:20:00.000Z	ArchEnigma	th0r	I selected Hp Printer
2009-06-27T23:20:00.000Z	ArchEnigma		I'm on the page after
2009-06-27T23:22:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	checking....they have changed it since I last used this
2009-06-27T23:23:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	jeez....they changed it a lot.
2009-06-27T23:25:00.000Z	th0r	ArchEnigma	check this ..... looks like it might help.... http://www.pubbs.net/ubuntu/200905/74849/
