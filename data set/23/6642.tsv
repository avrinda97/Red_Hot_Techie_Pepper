2006-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	Kube	intelikey	and in the login scree, before I login. I clicked Languages it showed a blank dialog with no "X" "Close" or any other uttons. No buttons no text at all.. and it cannot  be closed.
2006-02-25T08:53:00.000Z	intelikey	Kube	maybe use the console and reconfigure the x server.     " [crtl]  [alt]  [f2]  "  and login then  do " sufo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg "   answer all the questions carefully and correctly. (don't chhose to set the monitor size in inches)   then  " [ctrl]  [alt]  [f7]   "  " [ctrl]  [alt]  [backspace]  "  to reset x and test the new configuration....

2006-02-25T09:00:00.000Z	intelikey	Kube	are you saying that ubuntu is no longer installed ?  because if you are, then no i'm not saying to reinstall it at all.       (installed generally means that the software is on the hdd in the expanded and usable format, whether or not it is "running")
