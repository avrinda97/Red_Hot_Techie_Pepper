2006-02-24T16:02:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 i don't know if this will help but you might want to look at tpconfig
2006-02-24T16:04:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 sudo tpconfig -t 1    should do what you want
2006-02-24T16:04:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 tap and drag, right?
2006-02-24T16:05:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 try 1, 2 or 3  and see which one you like :] 
2006-02-24T16:06:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 this seems to be a single tap then drag
2006-02-24T16:06:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 without removing finger
2006-02-24T16:12:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 hmm i think tpconfig isn't working in breezy....    i saw a reference to  /usr/share/doc/xorg-driver-synatptics/README.gz  for info on configuring tappad behaivor in xorg.conf
2006-02-24T16:22:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 you still there?  i just activated locked drags in my xorg.conf
2006-02-24T16:23:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 added           Option          "LockedDrags"           "1"
2006-02-24T16:23:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 do you have tap actions at all?   like tap=click?   i'm not using gpm at all...
2006-02-24T16:24:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 i don't think xorg.conf is managed by debconf
2006-02-24T16:25:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 yes this should work for you i think
2006-02-24T16:25:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 yes that will just replace the existing file, it doesn't look at the data inside AFAIK
2006-02-24T16:28:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 this is what mine looks like  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8906
2006-02-24T16:39:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 np was a learning experience for me ;] 
2006-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 there's a page on the wiki about setting that up
2006-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	MrKeuner	wastrel	but they do not by default right?
2006-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	MrKeuner	wastrel	Or is it only me
2006-10-15T14:23:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	not by default.
2006-10-15T14:23:00.000Z	MrKeuner	wastrel	is it cups' wiki you are mentioning/
2006-10-15T14:25:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 this is what i used   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu?highlight=%28print%29
2006-10-15T14:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	wastrel	soundray thanks but one last question. To print from Dapper A to Dapper B's printer Do I have to play with settings of Dapper A too? Or will I just change settings with the one with printer?
2006-10-15T14:28:00.000Z	wastrel	MrKeuner	 the howto i used replaced cupsd.conf on both machines.
