2008-10-04T10:04:00.000Z	JasonWoof		I'm having a weird mouse problem where I cannot select text in xterm by dragging, or use pulldowns in firefox. I played with xev for a while, and discovered
2008-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	JasonWoof		that when I press fn+up (brightness increase) I get an unending stream of these events:

2008-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	JasonWoof		although the screen only brightens the once
2008-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	JasonWoof		same things happens with brightness-down
2008-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	JasonWoof		only way to stop it seems to be to press fn+somethingelse, like fn+pageDn (which is vol-down) or fn+f12 which is scroll lk
2008-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	do the buttons react like "increase brightness" / "decrease brightness" when they are pressed?
2008-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	then they work fine. better check if they conflict with some system shortcut
2008-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	but according to xev there sticking
2008-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	how do I check for system shortcuts?
2008-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	System > Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts
2008-10-04T10:12:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	oh, I'm not running gnome. I've got wmii, you think it's a problem with wmii?
2008-10-04T10:13:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	ok, although i dont think that gnome's showtcuts will work on some other wm
2008-10-04T10:15:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	i found something about keyboard shortcuts in wmii
2008-10-04T10:20:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	I logged out of my session, and had the same problem with the pulldowns on the gdm screen
2008-10-04T10:21:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	i found some documentation, but it is in greek :( http://foss.ntua.gr/wiki/index.php/WMII_howto
2008-10-04T10:21:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	pm me if you want to translate anything, i am greek
2008-10-04T10:21:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	I know how to remap my keys in wmii
2008-10-04T10:25:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	huh, just noticed my trackpad works fine
2008-10-04T10:27:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	well, I'll be damned. New mouse batteries fixed it. Thank you for your help!
2008-10-04T10:28:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	mouse? you said the Fn keys!! anyway, you are welcome
2008-10-04T10:28:00.000Z	JasonWoof	jim_p	still does weird stuff in xev, but I guess that's unrelated
2008-10-04T10:29:00.000Z	jim_p	JasonWoof	lets hope not
