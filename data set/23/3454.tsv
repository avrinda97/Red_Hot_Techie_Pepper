2011-05-22T11:34:00.000Z	Firestorm		Is there a way to make a bootable usb of Ubuntu without using a program like Unetbootin?  UAC on windows is being temperamental with me and this computer has no optical.
2011-05-22T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	There is no way to do it without writing to the mbr, which is probably what is prompting UAC.
2011-05-22T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	Do you have another computer you can boot from a LiveCD?
2011-05-22T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	You can use grub from your 64 bit install to loop boot an Ubuntu iso stored on the flash drive.
2011-05-22T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	Boot from your 64 bit install's drive while holding shift to get to the grub menu, then press 'c' to get to the grub shell.
2011-05-22T11:45:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	so the 64-bit version has the 32-bit version as well?
2011-05-22T11:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	No, but it's the kernel that's 64 bit, not grub. The reason you're getting UAC prompts is from the need to install a bootloader to the flash drive. If you use grub from your 64 bit install then you don't need to install any bootloader to the flash drive.
2011-05-22T11:47:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	I can't boot into the 64-bit version, this atom won't support it
2011-05-22T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	You *can* use grub from the 64 bit version, as grub is always 32 bit. You'll use grub on the 64 bit install's drive to boot a 32 bit iso stored on the flash drive.
2011-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	could you verify if I understand?  I download a 32-bit copy of ubuntu, copy it onto the flash drive through drag and drop, then use grub to launch it?
2011-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	Correct.
2011-05-22T11:51:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	no special steps or version to make it bootable?  If it already gets to the version selection screen I just need to add an iso?
2011-05-22T11:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	No special iso needed, but there are special commands you'll need to run at the grub shell.
2011-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	step 1, download an iso and place it on the USB drive along side the working (on 64-bit capable machines) distro?
2011-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	step 2?
2011-05-22T11:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	Before going into the exact steps. How long will it take you to download the iso and will you be able to be on IRC from another computer / phone while you're at the grub shell on the netbook?
2011-05-22T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	I ask how long as I'm planning to go to sleep fairly soon.
2011-05-22T11:55:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	I can see if there is an IRC client for my WM6.1 phone...
2011-05-22T11:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	It's probably easiest to use the browser and http://webchat.freenode.net
2011-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	I think it's safe to say that my issue isn't more important than your sleep.  It's something I can afford to wait on if I don't figure it out tonight
2011-05-22T12:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	Once you're at the grub menu you press 'c' to get to the grub shell, then you run the commands in this menu entry to loop boot the iso: http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg#How_do_you_use_a_loopback.cfg_to_boot_an_iso.3F
2011-05-22T12:05:00.000Z	Firestorm	Jordan_U	thanks, I'll see if it works
2011-05-22T12:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Firestorm	You're welcome, and goodnight :)
