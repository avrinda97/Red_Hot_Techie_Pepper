2007-07-13T13:38:00.000Z	Tanman		i uninistalled Vsftpd
2007-07-13T13:38:00.000Z	Tanman		and then removed the conf manually...
2007-07-13T13:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	why didn't you just purge it?
2007-07-13T13:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	apt-get remove --purge package, or via synaptic "complete removal"
2007-07-13T13:42:00.000Z	Tanman	Flannel	thanks a million!
2007-07-29T16:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	because you're not port forwarding on your router
2007-07-29T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	What program are you connecting to?
2007-07-29T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	And you've installed openssh-server?
2007-07-29T16:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	You've got a bad password then, or you're typing it wrong, or whatnot.
2007-07-29T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	make sure you don't have capslock on, or whatever
2007-07-29T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	Not by default, no.
2007-07-29T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	I'd check the router first.  Since unless you've tweaked things (which you'd know about), it's not a firewall issue either
2007-07-29T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	ssh isn't telnet.  telnet is port 80, you need to be forwarding port 22
2007-07-29T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	It depends.  What do each look like?  Locally looks like 192.168.x.x? or 127.0.0.1? or what?
2007-07-29T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	Make sure that the IP youre logging into from remote is infact your IP
2007-07-29T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	So you have your router set to forward port 22?  Are you getting rejection entries in auth.log?
2007-07-29T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	You setup forwarding on your router?
2007-07-29T16:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Tanman	Not if your router has a ssh interface.  I'm asking you, did you actually *do* something with port forwarding on your router?
2007-07-29T16:32:00.000Z	Tanman	Flannel	the only think i am going to go for is to try and investigate the router side in regards to my ssh issue
2007-07-30T07:32:00.000Z	Tanman	Flannel	are you there?
2007-07-30T07:33:00.000Z	Tanman	Flannel	i solved that little issue of mine with the ssh problem that i was having
2007-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	Tanman	Flannel	are you there? i want to say thanks for replying to my problem about ssh the other day
