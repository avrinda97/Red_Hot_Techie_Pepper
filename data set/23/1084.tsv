2010-09-13T12:35:00.000Z	Katsumi32	c0mrade	 whats wrong with you ? open kismet website and check up if your card is supported or not. if it is everything u have to do is to install kismet and everything should work straight away
2010-09-13T12:35:00.000Z	Katsumi32	c0mrade	check up also #kismet

2010-09-13T12:45:00.000Z	Katsumi32	c0mrade	cuz i have to patch your driver
2010-09-13T12:48:00.000Z	Katsumi32	c0mrade	 its bit compilicated and u will have to remove your driver u got already installed. you will have to download other driver for your wifi also maybe some patches needed than u will have install it and it will work both internet and kismet etc.  u could use compat-wireless drivers
2010-09-13T12:48:00.000Z	Katsumi32	c0mrade	if you new to ubuntu it will be difficult for you
