2006-01-11T17:47:00.000Z	mcquaid		hello, i finally upgarded from oo1 to oo2
2006-01-11T17:47:00.000Z	mcquaid		it doesn't seem to have any native theme support at all.  is there a pkg I'm missing?
2006-01-11T06:24:00.000Z	mcquaid		Hello, I only do I run X apps as root? I get this error cannot connect to X server :0.0
2006-01-11T06:24:00.000Z	mcquaid		i solved this before in debian sid, but can't remember how
2006-01-11T06:25:00.000Z	mcquaid		and just to clarify i mean as root not via sudo
2006-01-11T06:25:00.000Z	mcquaid		as sudo apps run fine
2006-01-11T06:25:00.000Z	mcquaid		but i can't change file permissions with sudo
2006-01-11T06:26:00.000Z	mcquaid		yes, but when i run a gui app like konqueror it doesn't let me
2006-01-11T06:27:00.000Z	mcquaid		i understand normally i don't but right now i'm migrating some old home stuff from another box, and the userid was different
2006-01-11T06:27:00.000Z	mcquaid		so i want to change file permissions and bring them over
2006-01-11T06:28:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	do you want to just enable the root account and use it/
2006-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	"grab" ?
2006-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	running what as root? trying to log in as root, or running an X program?
2006-01-11T06:30:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	sudo gedit... does that work?
2006-01-11T06:31:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	then i don't understand the problem?
2006-01-11T06:32:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	sudo nautilus works fine.. not for you though?
2006-01-11T06:34:00.000Z	mcquaid	kameron	huh sudo works fine with nautilus
2006-01-11T06:35:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	then.. is there a problem.. or it's all good in the hood?
2006-01-11T06:37:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	konq, as in konqueror? i just tried it, no problems.
2006-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	kameron	mcquaid	any luck?
