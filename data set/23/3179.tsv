2008-07-01T19:55:00.000Z	vasily		Am I at the right channel to fix Audacity in Ubuntu?

2008-07-01T19:59:00.000Z	vasily		Does someone see my posts?
2008-07-01T19:59:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	no, nobody
2008-07-01T19:59:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	System-Preferences-Sound -- select your USB  device as the capture device
2008-07-01T20:05:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	I got a message: Your audio capture settings are invalid. Please correct them in the Multimedia settings
2008-07-01T20:06:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	I got the message: Your audio capture settings are invalid. Please correct them in the Multimedia settings
2008-07-01T20:07:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	I heard you. I'm not familiar with this error.
2008-07-01T20:08:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	is there a specific channel for audio in Ubuntu?
2008-07-01T20:08:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	no, but there are some troubleshooting pages on the wiki -- I'll get the bot to pm you
2008-07-01T20:34:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	have you read the wiki help?
2008-07-01T20:35:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	yes, thank you very much for that link. I tryed EVERY setting in the volume control but it does not help!
2008-07-01T20:36:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	your question in the channel should reflect what you have tried.
2008-07-01T20:45:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	My sound works well under autodetect, alsa, oss etc. So, the sound manuals will not help. I have one very specific problem: I need to make USB mic working. This is the only option for me since my soundcard does not have a mic jack. I tryed so far EVERY option in System-preferenses-sound and in volume control. I do not have any sound from my mic. It was recognized by the system since I got DSP1 in my devises as I read in Googl
2008-07-01T20:53:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	which program do you want to use for capturing/recording -- audacity?
2008-07-01T20:55:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	yes, audacity. I just intalled it
2008-07-01T20:55:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	can you make it see your microphone sound device?
2008-07-01T20:57:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	I don't think so: it only sees oss and two types of alsa
2008-07-01T21:00:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	sorry I haven't got a solution for you. I have a similar problem on a laptop, where I can record from a microphone that's plugged into the mic input, but not from the builtin microphone.
2008-07-01T21:01:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	I suggest you repeat your question patiently every 20 minutes or so -- there's bound to be someone who can help.
2008-07-01T21:01:00.000Z	vasily	soundray	thank you for your advice :)
2008-07-01T21:03:00.000Z	soundray	vasily	I'm just remembering one thing that you could try (but didn't help in my case): the Volume Control panel sometimes "hides" inputs. You can enable them through Edit-Preferences.
