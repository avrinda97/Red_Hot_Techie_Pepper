2005-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	jeff303		does anyone know... is there the equivalent of a "make uninstall"?
2005-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	make clean?
2005-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	wait
2005-09-29T12:08:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	I thought that just delets the objects from your source directory
2005-09-29T12:08:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	not like /usr/local/  or wherever it installed to
2005-09-29T12:08:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	I think make clean clears all objs in the local source folder so you can re-compile... but am not sure
2005-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	yeah it does
2005-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	essentially forces a recompile
2005-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	I mean I suppose you could go through and figure out what directories the make install put things into, manually delete them, etc
2005-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	but that is a pain
2005-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	absolutely
2005-09-29T12:10:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	so you "hand compiled it"?
2005-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	yeah...
2005-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	oh interesting, sometimes the Makefile does specify an uninstall rule
2005-09-29T12:12:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	that seemed to work
2005-09-29T12:12:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	share the info...  ;)
2005-09-29T12:12:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	how...?
2005-09-29T12:12:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	by telling me if it does have the unistall parameter...  ;)
2005-09-29T12:13:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	well in my case, for this source code, it must have, cause I tried it and it worked
2005-09-29T12:13:00.000Z	GnuKemist	jeff303	I'll take your word for it then  ;)
2005-09-29T12:14:00.000Z	jeff303	GnuKemist	furthermore... it looks like GNU Autoconf automatically makes the uninstall rule
