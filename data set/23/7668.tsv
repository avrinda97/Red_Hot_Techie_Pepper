2005-07-21T14:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	those are very nice chips. I'm using an XP-M right now. not all "XP" branded stuff is junk...
2005-07-21T14:24:00.000Z	IceDC571	Madpilot	im planning to get a linux box for around $300, im sure you're familar with the XP-M chips.. what shall i get?
2005-07-21T14:25:00.000Z	IceDC571	Madpilot	where are you at?
2005-07-21T14:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	$300 USD? See if you can't find a 2500+.
2005-07-21T14:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	Canada. BC.
2005-07-21T14:26:00.000Z	IceDC571	Madpilot	do those XP-M's still have unlocked multipliers?
2005-07-21T14:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	AFAIK, yes. my OC's quite happily. 1.8 stock, currently running at 2.0
2005-07-21T14:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	I think it was the regular XP CPUs that got locked
2005-07-21T14:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	XPM are actually laptop CPUs by design, they can't be locked (power conservation)
2005-07-21T14:29:00.000Z	IceDC571	Madpilot	yep.. as for memory, im not doing anything really productive.. do you think 512mb is enough?
2005-07-21T14:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	can you squeeze 1Gb out of your budget?
2005-07-21T14:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	/msg me, this is getting off topic
2005-07-21T14:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	Ubuntu seems quite happy to play in a 1Gb box! XP too...
2005-07-22T13:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	install firestarter if you want
2005-08-28T13:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	Linux is smarter than Windows
2005-09-16T08:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	IceDC571	was about to point that out to you... ;)
