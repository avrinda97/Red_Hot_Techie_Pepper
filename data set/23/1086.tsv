2011-04-02T21:35:00.000Z	Autonomiser		Hi there all
2011-04-02T21:36:00.000Z	Autonomiser		I am just trying to set up the freeCAD svn repo so I can stay up to date and boy am I lost
2011-04-02T21:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	have you checked out the source?
2011-04-02T21:37:00.000Z	Autonomiser		Every guide I come across is for setting up a svn repo for my own code
2011-04-02T21:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	getting the source is usually as easy as 'svn co <url to svn repo> trunk'
2011-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding		#ubuntu+1
2011-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	Autonomiser		All I want to do is access the dev version of FreeCad and stay up to date with the latest code
2011-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	have you done the svn co command yet?
2011-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	Autonomiser		Okay sure tensorpudding but where is the source going?
2011-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the command listed on sourceforge is 'svn co https://free-cad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/free-cad free-cad'
2011-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	Autonomiser		How do I tell subversion where to put the FreeCAD code?
2011-04-02T21:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding		what that would do, is put the source in a directory called free-cad under the current working directory
2011-04-02T21:41:00.000Z	Autonomiser		I would like it to go in /home/svn/free-cad
2011-04-02T21:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	so enter the /home/svn directory, and run that command
2011-04-02T21:42:00.000Z	Autonomiser		But this step seems to be left out of every guide I can find
2011-04-02T21:42:00.000Z	Autonomiser		Oh okay thanks
2011-04-02T21:42:00.000Z	Autonomiser		Easy pezy japonezy
2011-04-02T21:51:00.000Z	Autonomiser	tensorpudding	I ran this command: svn co https://free-cad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/free-cad free-cad
2011-04-02T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	okay, so there should be a free-cad directory with the source in it
2011-04-02T21:52:00.000Z	Autonomiser	tensorpudding	As listed here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/free-cad/develop
2011-04-02T21:52:00.000Z	Autonomiser	tensorpudding	Cool
2011-04-02T21:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	you can keep it up to date by pulling the latest revisions
2011-04-02T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Autonomiser	you go into the free-cad directory and do 'svn up', and that will pull the latest changes from the server
