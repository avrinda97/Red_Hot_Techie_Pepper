2009-08-16T04:27:00.000Z	cjae		HI I installed the proprietary ati drivers in jaunty abd apparently the card is not supported anymore, I need to revert to the open source drivers (is that what was installed with the distro) and can I use them with tv out?
2009-08-16T04:27:00.000Z	cjae		was going to follow this http://www.leong.nl/2009/04/ubuntu-jaunty-upgrade-with-atiamd-graphics/
2009-08-16T04:29:00.000Z	cjae		Do I still edit xorg to setup dual screens when not using the proprietary drivers?
2009-08-16T04:30:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	: whih card ? ati is off the place with xorg 7.4 mostly
2009-08-16T04:30:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	ati 9600
2009-08-16T04:31:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	: hard case, I'm not sure for ope sorce n dual, what works is you can downgrade xorg or even use hardy
2009-08-16T04:35:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	: the open source driver least supports dualhed, also :
2009-08-16T04:35:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	opensource support separate x screens?
2009-08-16T04:37:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	: sorry, seperate screens, generally yes, but the 9600 is the " biggest of the older ones", so not sure for that model
2009-08-16T04:40:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	basically I would I have a xorg that would resemble this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=98456 and substitute whatever the opensource driver is for nvidia geirha
2009-08-16T04:46:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	I can make the separate screens work if the driver (open) supports it, or would I just be better off to use a older proprietary driver and how would I do that?
2009-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	not switching to 8.04 have lvm setup already can I use a older ati driver in jaunty at all?
2009-08-16T04:48:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	either you get the propi thing from 8.04 to get the config or must now, as I become tired ask again or google your 9600 jaunty dualhead;  you can for sure downgrade xorg and have aticontrolcenter with propitary driver
2009-08-16T04:53:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	decribed in same post
2009-08-16T04:54:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	sorry I missed which post that was

2009-08-16T05:00:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	geirha  ok thanks just wanted to get the low down on things before as the box in question is in another room ...will give it a shot
2009-08-16T05:00:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	sorry for me being too up today for a walkthrough
2009-08-16T05:02:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	geirha if all else fails I think I have a spare nvidia agp around ;P np thanks anyway I think I ll get it
2010-02-17T06:03:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	man tunefs, or use a live cd and ceckk manually
2010-02-17T06:06:00.000Z	cjae	DasEi	that is way over her head, I just need a way to not be able to boot until fsck is done
2010-02-17T06:10:00.000Z	DasEi	cjae	I don't know how to disable the esc-function of fsck; elese hae to create a script in low runlevel, over the head is relative
