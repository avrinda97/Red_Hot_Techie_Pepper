2007-10-26T14:44:00.000Z	Greyfox		So I've got Wine installed and I've downloaded the SteamInstall.msi file, and when I run "wine start SteamInstall.msi" I'm presented with the following:
2007-10-26T14:44:00.000Z	Greyfox		wine start SteamInstall.msi
2007-10-26T14:44:00.000Z	Greyfox		Application could not be started, or no application associated with the specified file.
2007-10-26T14:44:00.000Z	Greyfox		ShellExecuteEx failed: File not found
2007-10-26T14:44:00.000Z	Greyfox		The file is sitting on my desktop
2007-10-26T14:45:00.000Z	Greyfox		What might be the problem?
2007-10-26T14:46:00.000Z	Greyfox		Just found the room, thanks Atomic_UE. :)
2007-10-26T14:47:00.000Z	troopa	Greyfox	The problem is that "start" is not part of the command, and it is not a recongized command.
2007-10-26T14:48:00.000Z	troopa		Therefore, please issue the command "wine applicationhere" without quotes, and replacing applicationhere with whatever you are wanting to run.
2007-10-26T14:49:00.000Z	Greyfox	troopa	So when I'm given the error, "wine: could not load L"c:\\windows\\system32\\SteamInstall.msi": Module not found" I need to move the file into that directory?
2007-10-26T14:49:00.000Z	Greyfox		I'm new to all this, my apologies.
2007-10-26T14:50:00.000Z	troopa	Greyfox	Open a terminal, and navigate to the directory where the installer is. Then issue the command; wine SteamInstall.msi or whatever the application is.
2007-10-26T14:50:00.000Z	Greyfox		Aye that's what I tried.
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox	troopa	What I typed and the results follow:
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox	troopa	greyfox@greyfox-desktop:~$ wine start SteamInstall.msi
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox		fixme:exec:SHELL_execute flags ignored: 0x00000500
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox		Application could not be started, or no application associated with the specified file.
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox		ShellExecuteEx failed: File not found
2007-10-26T14:52:00.000Z	Greyfox		I've also tried it without the "start" troopa.
2007-10-26T14:53:00.000Z	Greyfox		And it says, "wine: could not load L"c:\\windows\\system32\\SteamInstall.exe": Module not found"
2007-10-26T14:54:00.000Z	troopa	Greyfox	The "start" is what is causing the "no application associated" error. However, I am not sure why wine is attempting to load the installer from the system32 directory.
2007-10-26T14:54:00.000Z	Greyfox		It's also only looking for .exe files troopa, which is odd.
2007-10-26T14:55:00.000Z	troopa	Greyfox	Well, you might want to check the wine channel. My knowledge with wine is fairly limited. I have not experienced such an error before.
