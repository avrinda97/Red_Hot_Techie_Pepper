2009-11-26T21:51:00.000Z	q0_0p		where can i find libgtk2.0-0?
2009-11-26T21:51:00.000Z	q0_0p		devede depends on libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.16.0); however:
2009-11-26T21:51:00.000Z	q0_0p		ii'm not understanding (>= 2.16.0)
2009-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	 that might mean ...if you are compiling something...that you need to install the .dev pacakge for libgtk2
2009-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	cool thx
2009-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	   if on gnome...go to system/adminstration/synaptic package maanger
2009-11-26T21:53:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	  hit Search  and type in   ligtk2
2009-11-26T21:53:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	  there is a   libgtk2.0-dev  package there
2009-11-26T21:53:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	cool
2009-11-26T21:54:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	 and when compiling anythingi that requires development pacakges  or other libraries ...it is usually safer  to go into synaptic to find those dependencies...with the histroy option in  synaptic...it makes it easier to remove those pacakges if they fail or  screw something up
2009-11-26T21:55:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	was trying to install devede using a deb but it telling me dependency problems
2009-11-26T21:55:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	  are you installing with the terminal?
2009-11-26T21:55:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	yes
2009-11-26T21:56:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	   then in that same terminal try   sudo apt-get install -f
2009-11-26T21:56:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	u can do sudo apt-cache search it the same as using synaptic
2009-11-26T21:56:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	  that should pull in all the required dependencies
2009-11-26T21:56:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	` that works only works with a deb package installation as far as I know
2009-11-26T21:57:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	sudo apt-get -f install is dangerous
2009-11-26T21:57:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	it might remove things u dont want to get removed
2009-11-26T21:57:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	 no not generally and I have never had issues with t hat
2009-11-26T21:57:00.000Z	q0_0p	coz_	i just did aptitude install gtk2
2009-11-26T21:58:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	  mm   I never use apititude  only apt-get  here  so I may not be the best to discuss that
2009-11-26T21:58:00.000Z	coz_	q0_0p	   but  a  sudo apt-get install -f  has never been dangerous on this end
