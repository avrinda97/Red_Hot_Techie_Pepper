2009-07-20T08:52:00.000Z	trelayne		hi all, I'm running Jaunty and trying out 2.6.30RC1. But my wireless' driver needs to be recompile. I understand that all I have to do is install bcmwl-kernel-source.. but's it's not in the Jaunty repos?
2009-07-20T08:54:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	dmsg-reconfigure bcmwl-.....
2009-07-20T08:54:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	o dont thank me unless it works
2009-07-20T08:54:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	while crazy guess
2009-07-20T08:55:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	 hmmm   I don't see such at command ?
2009-07-20T08:55:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	dmsg-reconfigure
2009-07-20T08:58:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	o sorry dpkg-reconfigure
2009-07-20T09:02:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	thanks for the suggestion but I don't know that dpkg-reconfigure would recompile the package against the loaded kernel?
2009-07-20T09:03:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	well i guess you could try and remove the bcmwl-* packages, reset then add them back
2009-07-20T09:04:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	or maby check your blacklist
2009-07-20T09:05:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	I actually want to try the solution posted by Amaranth: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1147055&page=2
2009-07-20T09:06:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	ok cool... ya i guess i shouda asked what you wirless card was first :P
2009-07-20T09:22:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	just to let you know: mission accomplished, simply had to add karmic repos, and installed the package -- which did a dkms install of the driver so that it recompiles against the running kernel--i think ?
2009-07-20T09:23:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	cool, ya i have them karmic repos in my box already so that couda bin the problm
2009-07-20T09:23:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	good job
2009-07-20T09:25:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	well jsut came back to thank you for your help. I've been fighting to figure out why compiz freezes my Xserver ... been dragging on for weeks. So wanted to try a later kernel... too many hoops :-(
2009-07-20T09:25:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	what video card?
2009-07-20T09:26:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	nvida Quadro FX 770m
2009-07-20T09:27:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	 I've even tried updating to the latest 185.18.14 but the problem comes back.. the freeze happens, It allows me to  swicth to console (Ctrl-Alt-F1)  after about 20 seconds then I can switch back and recover, but subsequent freezes results in corrupted windows when swithing back
2009-07-20T09:29:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	i would try and install the latest build
2009-07-20T09:29:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	like http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/20090719/
2009-07-20T09:30:00.000Z	trelayne	Steve_	 anyway never mind about it, I'll see if the problem manifests tomorrow at work again. I've become dependant on compiz workspace switching, effects, etc . On the build, Hmmm.. tempting but I'm much too cautious to try it :-)  But thanks for the link!
2009-07-20T09:31:00.000Z	Steve_	trelayne	lol ya good luke
