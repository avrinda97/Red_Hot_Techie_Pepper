2012-10-14T00:57:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	gnome extensions?
2012-10-14T00:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	gnome extensions? what do you mean. I am referring to gnome shell default. Know it? has clock on the top panel, but in the middle not next to the username in the right corner as used to be
2012-10-14T00:59:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	gnome shell default or gnom "classic" ?
2012-10-14T01:00:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	gnome-tweak-tool might allow showing seconds.. might remember wrong
2012-10-14T01:01:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	it should allow showing seconds in the clock in the middle of the upper panel
2012-10-14T01:01:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	you can install it with "sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool" i think
2012-10-14T01:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	thx. couldn't find it ;) should be included, no?
2012-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	hum wich version of ubuntu you are using btw?
2012-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	you should be able to start it by writing gnome-tweak-tool in terminal
2012-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	oh, I had it before, but it was called Advanced settings simply
2012-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	yeah its bit misleading
2012-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	you should be able to add seconds in the "shell" section
2012-10-14T01:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	yup, nizze one - thx!
2012-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	depends what you want
2012-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	not sure what the difference is. Whatever is best for laptop really
2012-10-14T01:14:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	hibernation uses 0 battery and saves the state to disc, suspend uses little battery and saves the state to ram
2012-10-14T01:14:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	thx for explaining. Sounds like I shouuld set to hibernation on battery and suspend on ac
2012-10-14T01:14:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	starting from ram is lot quicker and its a great way to save some energy if you go to make some coffee etc while not on ac power
2012-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	that one way, personally while ac i don't suspend or hibernate my laptop on lid close but do it manyally if i have to
2012-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	as on ac there is no risk for battery running out
2012-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	allu3	but you don't want the machine running while the lid is down, do you? or makes no difference? I guess not
2012-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	allu3	livingdaylight	well then on ac suspend, and battery hibernate seems good
