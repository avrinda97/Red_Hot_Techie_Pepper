2007-03-21T15:14:00.000Z	Slart		Anyone know how to find out the device name of a cd/dvd drive?
2007-03-21T15:14:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	dmesg | grep -i CD
2007-03-21T15:14:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	dmesg | grep -i DVD
2007-03-21T15:15:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	except.. it didn't work =/
2007-03-21T15:16:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	trry this then: dmesg | egrep -A 10 -B 10 -i 'CD|DVD'
2007-03-21T15:16:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	it will not show anything if the driver is not loaded!
2007-03-21T15:17:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	find out with: lsmod | grep -i cd
2007-03-21T15:19:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	hmm.. it still doesn't find my dvd drive.. odd
2007-03-21T15:19:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	try: sudo modprobe cdrom
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	does it make a difference that I'm using a usb-connected DVD drive?
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	yes
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	you need more drivers; probably lots of usb stuff
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	'cdrom' module is just for IDE drives
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	ah.. that explains it.. thanks
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	usb cd drives will have names like /dev/scd0
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	not /dev/hdc
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	mm.. that's what I have for mine.. just couldn't find a way to get the device name without checking output from mount.. thought there might be a better way
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	not quite sure which modules you need, but they will be related to mass storage
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	aha, you already have the drivers then, good
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	lugod	this was just to find the device name to use for "readcd"
2007-03-21T15:24:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	for that you can read the files in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*
2007-03-21T15:24:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	not sure about that actually
2007-03-21T15:25:00.000Z	lugod	Slart	probably dmesg | grep is still best
