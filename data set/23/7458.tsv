2005-08-01T16:34:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 NFS
2005-08-01T16:34:00.000Z	basti	kemik	what is it called in apt-get?
2005-08-01T16:35:00.000Z	kemik	basti	portmap and some more stuff, think you should follow a How-To, and also NFS only works between *nix OS's
2005-08-01T16:35:00.000Z	kemik	basti	ie; if you got windows on your net, its not a good solution
2005-08-01T16:35:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 dont get samba to work?
2005-08-01T16:39:00.000Z	basti	kemik	samba sais I got no rights even though it isnt pass protected ;S
2005-08-01T16:41:00.000Z	kemik	basti	you got how many pcs?
2005-08-01T16:41:00.000Z	kemik	basti	you can ping their IP addys etc?
2005-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 maybe unrar-nonfree ?
2005-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	basti	kemik	gonna try
2005-10-04T07:29:00.000Z	basti	kemik	there was unrar-free and it installed but I still cant extract
2005-10-04T07:34:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 that's because you need the "non-free" version.. and it could be in multiverse/universe
2005-10-04T07:37:00.000Z	basti	kemik	ah yes thx was in multiverse
2005-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 "man chmod"
2005-10-04T09:19:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 and yes chmod is the 'program' ...
2005-10-04T09:23:00.000Z	basti	kemik	seriously that manually isnt written very pedagogic...
2005-10-04T09:24:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 the man-pages seldom are.. but you should make an effort to learn howto read them..  :)
2005-10-04T09:24:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 the way to set the executeflag is "chmod +x file"
2005-10-04T09:25:00.000Z	basti	kemik	thats what I wrote but the file didnt turn green :S
2005-10-04T09:26:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 - removes ;)
2005-10-04T09:26:00.000Z	kemik	basti	 if you learn to use the man-pages, you'll be far along 'mastering linux' ;)
