2007-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	Krige^		I have a problem trying to save my firewall rules to a file: when I do "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules" I get the error "bash: /etc/iptables.up.rules: Permission denied"
2007-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	this file is writable by root only
2007-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	I did that through sudo
2007-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	 I did "sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules"
2007-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	how about redirecting the output to another file and than coping it over to /etc/...?
2007-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	you mean to write that to another directory?
2007-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	"sudo iptables-save > tmpfile; sudo cp tmpfile /etc/..."
2007-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	same result: permission denied
2007-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	is this the first user you created?
2007-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	yes, brand new :)
2007-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	only the first user is allowed to issue sudo
2007-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	what permissions does this file have? the /etc/... one?
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	drwxr-xr-x 109 root root
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	this is a directory, not a file. you cannot cat to a directory
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	yes, /etc/ is a directory, so?
2007-04-22T09:23:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	you are trying to put the output of a command into a file. but you got permission denied. my question is what permissions does have the file you are trying to output to
2007-04-22T09:23:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	the file does not exist yet
2007-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	you cannot create a file in a directory to which you have write access? this is very, very unlikely
2007-04-22T09:25:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	I agree, that's really weird, it never happened before
2007-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	I can't write to /etc/ nor to /opt/
2007-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	Krige^	velko	despite the fact I am using sudo
2007-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	maybe the filesystem is mounted read only? check if your /etc/fstab have an option like "remount-readonly" for the / file system
2007-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	velko	Krige^	it does exist. just it's not enabled by default. check in /etc/passwd
