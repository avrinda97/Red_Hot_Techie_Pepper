2008-10-16T05:05:00.000Z	xomp		ubuntu now has 60% of my hdd space and windows only has 40% :D I'm slowly making the transition (if only games were a little more stable in linux I'd be 100% linux) :D :D :D

2008-10-16T05:10:00.000Z	Perezz	xomp	i use ndiswrapper for my laptop but my situation is that the internet went down, after it came back up the wifi isnt being picked up on the laptop

2008-10-16T05:12:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	have ye tried to reboot since the network went down?
2008-10-16T05:12:00.000Z	Perezz	xomp	yes a bunch of times
2008-10-16T05:13:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	hmm, have you tried resetting your modem/router? My wifi tends to get a little crazy during say, a power outage or blip in the connection during outages and usually a quick reset of both modem and router clears it up.
2008-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	Perezz	xomp	did that as well :/
2008-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	sorry :( I'm all out of ideas lol, wireless in linux is like 2 boys dancing, it just ain't right :(
2008-10-16T05:15:00.000Z	Perezz	xomp	it happed after the new update
2008-10-16T05:16:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	what model wifi you use?
2008-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	Perezz	xomp	its this intel wifi link 5100, i use ndiswrapper
2008-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	I've always heard Intel are THE KINGS O LINUX SUPPORT as far as drivers in linux go. You sure there's no native drivers for it so you can dump NDISWrapper?

2008-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	xomp	Perezz	ouch :( looks like I was misinformed back when I was having wifi issues and everyone was "Oh! Buy and Intel card, they're super supported in Ubuntu!" lol
2008-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	Perezz		i just booted up in a different kernel
2008-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	Perezz		my wifi works now :/
