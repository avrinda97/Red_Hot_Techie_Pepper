2009-09-10T03:02:00.000Z	unr3a1		what file is it in Ubuntu that controls the hostname and DNS settings?
2009-09-10T03:03:00.000Z	osotogari	unr3a1	/etc/hosts
2009-09-10T03:06:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	danbhfive1, there was a way that I was able to set ubuntu to automatically over write my hosts file so I could always have custom dns servers setup.  but I do not remember how I did it, as it was quite a while ago.  do either of you know?
2009-09-10T03:11:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	yea, but I do not remember the script or where it would be in the old filesystem
2009-09-10T03:12:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	where would I have to put a script like that?
2009-09-10T03:13:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	do you know?
2009-09-10T03:16:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	well, that keeps it from being overwritten, and that works for the resolv.conf file, but I if I remember correctly, the /etc/hosts file still gets overwritten by the DHCP server, which would still effect the local loopback to look at www.search.net
2009-09-10T03:16:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	that is similar though, yes, it is a setting in a file somewhere
2009-09-10T03:18:00.000Z	osotogari	unr3a1	so you dont want your hosts file to be over written?
2009-09-10T03:18:00.000Z	osotogari	unr3a1	try this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=372420
2009-09-10T03:18:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	losher, its the dhclient.conf file in /etc/dhcp3
2009-09-10T03:19:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	losher, now i remember.  you change the settings in that to pull the DHCP server for certain information, but then generate its own for other settings such as DNS, and local loopback.
2009-09-10T03:20:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	losher, thank you both.
2009-09-10T03:20:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	losher, thats awesome.  now I dont have to worry about www.search.net anymore... YAY
2009-09-10T03:21:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	yes, its awesome, and i thank you for your help.  of course, I just realized that this conf file does not run at startup, it runs when dhclient pulls DHCP for info.
2009-09-10T03:22:00.000Z	osotogari	unr3a1	Its good to know thats how it works, i didnt even know you could do that before. ha!
2009-09-10T03:29:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	craic?
2009-09-10T03:30:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	ah... well, thank you again
2009-09-10T03:36:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	alright, I am rebooting so I can see how dhclient.conf works for me... :)
2009-09-10T03:41:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	works like a charm.... :)
2009-09-10T03:42:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	losher, both my hosts and resolv.conf file were set properly.
2009-09-10T03:43:00.000Z	unr3a1	osotogari	yes it is
