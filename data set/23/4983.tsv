2007-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	floresc7		I had to leave to class earlier, anyone here know anything about DRBL?
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	floresc7		I cannot boot a DRBL client with a SATA hard drive using Feisty
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	floresc7		Are there compatiblity issues with using ubuntu with SATA hard drives?
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	Set your bios for SATA to be in IDE compatability mode
2007-08-28T10:05:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	If you have jmicron chipset you may be ok to insert the driver manually. If another chipset like Marvell or so it could be problemmatic
2007-08-28T10:05:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	how can I tell which chipset I am using on the client?
2007-08-28T10:06:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	look up your motherboard specs, or try lspci and see if it has some device from jmicron or marvell there
2007-08-28T10:08:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	My Asus mb install cd came with source code for Marvell Sata/IDE controller but it's that catch-22 of needing a working system to compile it etc
2007-08-28T10:09:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	ok, I'll look up the specs real quick on the dell support site
2007-08-28T10:44:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	i did run lspci, i didnt get any information about the driver from that
2007-08-28T10:44:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	sorry, i meant chipset
2007-08-28T10:44:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	lspci shows you a list of PCI devices and where possible, the manufacturer names it can deduce for that hardware. it doesn't have driver info, just hardware info
2007-08-28T10:45:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	its all intel
2007-08-28T10:45:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	Likely then Marvell chipset
2007-08-28T10:46:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	so if it is a Marvell chipset, just google to find the drivers?
2007-08-28T10:46:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	feisty did not work on my Marvell chipset but Gutsy did
2007-08-28T10:47:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	You could try to find a deb for that
2007-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	is gutsy stable enought right now to upgrade to/
2007-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	I do not think i would recommend it yet for a production machine.
2007-08-28T10:49:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	Although i personally have not had any extreme problems with it that were irrecoverable
2007-08-28T10:51:00.000Z	floresc7	genii	ok, where would i start to find the deb for marvell?
2007-08-28T10:52:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	Perhaps google for such things as: "marvell ide" driver deb
2007-08-28T10:53:00.000Z	genii	floresc7	I compiled the source that was on my motherboard cdrom on a second computer into a deb and then transplanted over the deb and installed it that way.
