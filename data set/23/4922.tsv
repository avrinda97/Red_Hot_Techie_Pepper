2007-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	foug		i don't know if they are gui problems exactly...
2007-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	foug		o, ok well
2007-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	foug		i tell my taskbar to not expand, but it never listens. It's always expanded. Also, anytime I restart my comp my two bars (taskbar and the bar with applications, system, places) never stay where i put them. And i have to go through hell getting them back toi where they were
2007-04-11T12:26:00.000Z	foug		also, I don't think my memory monitor works correctly. It never changes either
2007-04-11T12:26:00.000Z	foug		Other times, all my Windows will kind of flicker. Like when I alt tab or sometimes log on
2007-04-11T12:28:00.000Z	foug		lol
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		I just want everything to work. So far i'm not impressed with linux
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		See, my music player (Eviale) just changed song, and all my windows flickered
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		someone earlier said it might be terminal issues?
2007-04-11T12:30:00.000Z	foug		what's the diff between KDE and Gnome?
2007-04-11T12:30:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	I agree, flickering is definately a video card driver issue
2007-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	depends on the vid card ;)
2007-04-11T12:36:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	probably not configured correctly
2007-04-11T12:36:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	ahh
2007-04-11T12:50:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	mmm i was hoping for a command similar to how i installed vid card drivers
2007-04-11T12:55:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	I like amarok
2007-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	you install the nvidia driver?
2007-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	yup
2007-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	 you type nvidia-xconfig in a terminal?
2007-04-11T12:58:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	no let me try
2007-04-11T12:58:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	error
2007-04-13T14:59:00.000Z	mjbrooks	foug	In firefox  Edit -> Preferences   then Privacy btton and uncheck the box that says "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar"
2007-04-13T14:59:00.000Z	foug	mjbrooks	nice thanks, i don't think this option was there for windows, that's why i used opera
