2010-08-23T07:46:00.000Z	boobsbr		How can I diagnose why my USB2.0 transfers reach only 5 MB/s?
2010-08-23T07:46:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	same probem --
2010-08-23T07:47:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	been having this problem since forever
2010-08-23T07:47:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	I didn't have this problem with another distro seems unique to ubuntu
2010-08-23T07:48:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	this makes me really sad, I really like using ubuntu. but my backups take forever and ever
2010-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	yup why they run at 1:05 am every day....
2010-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	what software are you using to backup?
2010-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	simple bash script
2010-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	no what programme, like rysnc maybe?
2010-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	nope, just cp -a
2010-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	 yeah change that to rysnc
2010-08-23T07:51:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	I have a simple script but its got a weird bug in it, but you can see the rsync...
2010-08-23T07:51:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	I used rsnapshot, which in turn uses rsync, but performance is the same
2010-08-23T07:51:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	okay -- only speedup I could think of
2010-08-23T07:52:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	speeding up the backup is nice, but when I want to move something to the external HD it just takes forever, it's painful. it's the main issue right now
2010-08-23T07:53:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	what kind of drive do you have?
2010-08-23T07:53:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	WD MyBook
2010-08-23T07:54:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	those are pretty good -- what fs are you using on your backup drive?
2010-08-23T07:54:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	ext3, didn't want to risk ext4 at the time
2010-08-23T07:55:00.000Z	Blue1	boobsbr	yeah that should work - i have a seagate usb backup unit.
2010-08-23T07:57:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	good lord, 21 minutes for a 6 gb file
2010-08-23T08:07:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	have you seen this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8124833&postcount=294
2010-08-23T08:51:00.000Z	boobsbr	Blue1	mounting the external drive manually with the 'async' option increased performance to 11 MB/s
