2004-11-28T11:18:00.000Z	Rene_S		HDTV, hmm I am not sure I need to see the commercials that clearly.
2004-11-28T11:19:00.000Z	Rene_S		Like really do we need to see Alway's adds in all its digital splendor ?  or how about the prep H ones ?
2004-11-28T11:21:00.000Z	Rene_S		I watched the Matrix on a HDTV and I never want to see Keannu Reeve's pores that closely again
2004-11-28T11:21:00.000Z	Rene_S		Hang on Ill get it around to Ubuntu in a second
2004-11-28T11:22:00.000Z	Rene_S		Somehow ......
2004-11-28T11:23:00.000Z	Rene_S		Ok, I can embed Ubuntu into my Microwave then use that to retune my Satellite dish that is hooked to my HDTV ?
2004-11-28T11:24:00.000Z	Rene_S		It "could" happen
2004-11-28T11:25:00.000Z	Rene_S		Not sure, I don't use there products
2004-11-28T11:26:00.000Z	Rene_S		Hmm you could always just yank the chip outta it
2004-11-28T11:28:00.000Z	Rene_S		I have always found a well placed screwdriver used in conjuction with a live MOBO an excellent stress relief
2004-11-28T11:29:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	ill take that into consideration
2004-12-11T06:13:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	what seems to be your problem?
2004-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	Rene_S	GotD0t	not everything updated cleanly, as a matter of fact it didnt download the panel or the control centre
2004-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	define not updated cleanly
2004-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	what packages were not updated
2004-12-11T06:17:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	i dont think its a problem... you can try selecting them by hand if you want
2004-12-13T09:56:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	WHAT? you dont have a PhD in math?! thats pathetic...
2004-12-15T12:17:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	just a bit... its on my middle fingers knuckle on my right hand
2004-12-15T12:18:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	i got a bit over zealous with my soldering iron
2004-12-15T12:20:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	you haven't lived until you've tried to solder the wire-mesh inside of a coax onto another wire...
2004-12-15T12:20:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	its such a pain, because its such low quality metal...
2004-12-15T13:06:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	not me ;-)
2004-12-24T11:09:00.000Z	GotD0t	Rene_S	good question
