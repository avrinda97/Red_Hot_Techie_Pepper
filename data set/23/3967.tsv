2008-05-22T17:37:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	where have you got the awn widgets packet you're using from?
2008-05-22T17:38:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	: http://wiki.awn-project.org/index.php?title=Awn_Extras:Installation#Ubuntu
2008-05-22T17:39:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	so are you using the awn testing team package or the reacocard one?
2008-05-22T17:40:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	I really have no idea
2008-05-22T17:41:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	I think the testing , thats what I added to sources.list
2008-05-22T17:41:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	ok, https://launchpad.net/~awn-testing/+archive go there and add that repository, and install the awn packages from there instead of the ones in universe
2008-05-22T17:42:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	thats exactly what I added to my sources.list
2008-05-22T17:44:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	ok, in that case the packages you need to have installed are orgonurg yes, go to System > Preferences > Sound and set the Default Mixer Track to be the PCM for the correct card
2008-05-22T17:45:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	install avant-window-navigator-trunk awn-extra-applets-trunk awn-manager-trunk
2008-05-22T17:47:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	did you get my replies?
2008-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	: I just installed the extras again and it removed my AWN
2008-05-22T17:53:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	install the awn trunk package

2008-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	I don't know what else to suggest, I've got avant-window-navigator-trunk awn-extras-applets-trunk and awn-manager-trunk installed fine...
2008-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	it might remove some libawn packages to install those, that's fine
2008-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	: thanx it worked =)
2008-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	funkyhat	amerio	cool :)
2008-05-22T18:00:00.000Z	amerio	funkyhat	I was trying to get the awn manager without trunk , but now I've installed the trunk one and it worked
