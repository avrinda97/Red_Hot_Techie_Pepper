2008-11-15T17:47:00.000Z	sum-it		no desktop
2008-11-15T17:48:00.000Z	sum-it		it just hangs up no display and no harddisk activity
2008-11-15T17:48:00.000Z	sum-it		because it doesnt give me option of shutdown from the desktop
2008-11-15T17:49:00.000Z	sum-it		and if it does then too it must hibernate

2008-11-15T17:52:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	can you check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and see if it lists the 'nvidia' driver?
2008-11-15T17:45:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	dpkg-reconfigure gdm (maybe?)
2008-11-15T17:46:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	- np but lookin gup the list jrib beat me to it :)
2008-11-15T17:46:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	I can hibernate but not suspend
2008-11-15T17:47:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	do you get to the point where it shuts down and then it locks starting up?
2008-11-15T17:47:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	laptop?
2008-11-15T17:48:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	why would you suspend/hibernate?
2008-11-15T17:49:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	what desktop are you using?
2008-11-15T17:50:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	what driver are you using for the nvidia card?
2008-11-15T17:51:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	just to clarify -- you didn't install the proprietary nvidia driver?
2008-11-15T17:52:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	go to System-Administration-Hardware Drivers and it should give you the option to install the nvidia driver.
2008-11-15T17:52:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	oh
2008-11-15T17:54:00.000Z	markginter31	sum-it	-- that's the driver you're using -- the nvidia-new one?
