2009-05-12T19:10:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	what router? or ISP router?
2009-05-12T19:12:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	ok,you could ask in #ubuntu-in for the router address just to confirm,but i think its 192.168.1.1 since i use airtel
2009-05-12T19:13:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	try 192.168.2.1
2009-05-12T19:18:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	different site,this one says level_15_access
2009-05-12T19:19:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	it should say router XXXX or something like that
2009-05-12T19:20:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	username is administrator and password is password right?
2009-05-12T19:20:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	why do you want to login to the router btw?
2009-05-12T19:21:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	such as?
2009-05-12T19:44:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	yes
2009-05-12T19:50:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	didnt ifconfig give the local ip?
2009-05-12T19:51:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	did it give the ip address?
2009-05-12T19:52:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	i still have no idea why you want to edit the router config
2009-05-12T19:52:00.000Z	shadeslayer	devendra	but you have a working internet connection in ubuntu
