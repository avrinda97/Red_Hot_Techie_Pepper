2007-10-07T10:13:00.000Z	Kronos		god why is video drivers such a pain with ubuntu?... i just enabled the desktop 3d support or something like that, and it automaticly downloaded some nvidia driver now it wont start up after the loading bar any ideas how to sort it out?
2007-10-07T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 blame nvidia. :)
2007-10-07T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 kernel versions/driver versions/ often are the sticking point.. what is your exact card?
2007-10-07T10:15:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	gainward 6800GS AGP 512 Mb
2007-10-07T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 ok. at least its not an 8800 or some other odd card. :)
2007-10-07T10:17:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	as far as odd goes it is a rather odd one since they "never" released 6800GS' with 512 mb in agp, but divers wise no it isnt it works on the normal 6800 drivers just fine
2007-10-07T10:18:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	sunray helped me earlyer to get it working with a simmilar problem we edited a file but i'm so new at the whole linux thing i honestly cant rememnber the commands we used
2007-10-07T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 if you used the shell. try the 'history' command. :)
2007-10-07T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 was it editing the /etc/xorg.conf to enable 'Driver 'nvidia'' ?
2007-10-07T10:20:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	yep it was and i just typed history it says 1 history
2007-10-07T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 heh..  yea.. all the histories get merged when ya exit. :(
2007-10-07T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf' :) and look for the Driver 'nv' line - i guess.. Not sure why the restircted-manager tool dident change it for ya.
2007-10-07T10:23:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	that doesnt seem to work i seem to remember he told me to use something called "nano edditor"
2007-10-07T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 nano is yet another editor you can use instead of gedit
2007-10-07T10:25:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	i just tryed gedit and it didnt work how could i use nano?
2007-10-07T10:26:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	nano /etc/X11/xorg.confg
2007-10-07T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 use 'nano' instead of gedit.. and of course you NEED the sudo stuff . its a system file. so you need root access
2007-10-07T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 and get the name of the file right. :) use the <tab> key for name completion
2007-10-07T10:27:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	alllrightt... we're learning... good tips
2007-10-07T10:29:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	any command to restart from kernel? or just good old power button?
2007-10-07T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 use the icons for reboot......
2007-10-07T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kronos	 your windows training is showing. :)
2007-10-07T10:31:00.000Z	Kronos	Dr_willis	which icons? i couldnt get into ubuntu if u think i'm the the desktop enviroment... i'm in the kernel shell thingy, or DOS as i would call it (lol)
