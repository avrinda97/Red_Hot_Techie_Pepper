2007-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	ishock		Help, I'm trying to set up an eggdrop, what TCL package should I install?
2007-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	you should just install the 'eggdrop' package
2007-09-18T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	yep, in universe
2007-09-18T06:14:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	^
2007-09-18T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	forget about "tcl", there is no such package.  Installing "eggdrop" will pull in everything you need
2007-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	it won't install cause of that
2007-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	pastebin the output of 'sudo aptitude install eggdrop'
2007-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	I wasn't paying attention, and typed tcl -.-
2007-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	ah :)
2007-09-18T06:16:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	where does it install to?
2007-09-18T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	shouldn't matter, but 'dpkg -L eggdrop' tells you where everything went
2007-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	all I have is a "modules" folder...
2007-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	type 'eggdrop' (and then it will tell you it wants the config file you create)
2007-09-18T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	you create it.  There's probably an example one in /usr/share/doc/eggdrop/ but there are a lot of websites that will generate one too if you search
2007-09-18T06:20:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	what file should I put it in? /usr/lib/eggdrop?
2007-09-18T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	I don't think it matters, you just specify the path.  I've never used eggdrop though
2007-09-18T06:35:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	how can I find eggdrop file?
2007-09-18T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	you need to create one
2007-09-18T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	with the settings you want.  Google for 'eggdrop configuration', there are several websites that generate one.  Also, you may want to try #eggdrop
2007-09-18T06:40:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	know any sites off the top of your head that generate a conf file for it?
2007-09-18T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	ishock	I don't use any, so I can't recommend them.  Try googling 'eggdrop generate conf'
2007-09-18T06:55:00.000Z	ishock	jrib	may I PM you, or can we join a seperate channel?
