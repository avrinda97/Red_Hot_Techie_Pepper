2008-07-25T06:32:00.000Z	FAJALOU		Help please my kernel is messed up!  i just installed the new kernel, and that kernel will not work at all!  I tried reinstalling it, to no avail!.
2008-07-25T06:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	the 2.6.24-20 ? that has known critical issues on launchpad ..
2008-07-25T06:33:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 then why was it released into the repos?!  b/c it will not get past the "starting up" script for me.
2008-07-25T06:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	actually it is in proposed, so you can expect glitches if you have that enabled :)
2008-07-25T06:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	for now there's still no fix
2008-07-25T06:35:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	i have another question, in software sources i am not able to click important security updates, is there a way i can check it anyhoo?
2008-07-25T06:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	you can try via synaptic .. settings > repositories > updates
2008-07-25T06:36:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 when i try to click on the security ones in the software sources, it doesn't work...
2008-07-25T06:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	could be they are missing in your /etc/apt/sources.list ..
2008-07-25T06:37:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 when i click on it in there, all it does is pretend click, and then no check :|
2008-07-25T06:37:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 then how to fix...
2008-07-25T06:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	check that file with an editor and uncomment the sources entress if they are commented out
2008-07-25T06:40:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	what ones EXACTLY am i looking for... i don't see anything commented out that shouldn't be, and  what is this:  http://ppa.launchpad.net/flam3/ubuntu hardy main?
2008-07-25T06:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	i don't know, no bell sringing with that ppa sorry .. as for the sources issue, could you paste your sources.list somewhere ?
2008-07-25T06:42:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 yes.
2008-07-25T06:42:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	http://paste.ubuntu.com/30157/
2008-07-25T06:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	checking, give me a minute
2008-07-25T06:43:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 kk
2008-07-25T06:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	looks okay .. and in software sources, first tab labeled 'Ubuntu Software' you can't activate the 'source code' entree ?
2008-07-25T06:46:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 correct, it is set to a negative button
2008-07-25T06:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	can't explain that, but perhaps try and change that by running it under sudo ..
2008-07-25T06:47:00.000Z	glitsj16	FAJALOU	okay, no problem
2008-07-25T06:47:00.000Z	FAJALOU	glitsj16	 so now i can click sources, but still no security.
