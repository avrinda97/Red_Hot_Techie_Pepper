2012-04-24T07:39:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		and then you can look into what makes that condition true at bootup but not once boot is complete
2012-04-24T07:41:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		i dont know
2012-04-24T07:41:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		but thats not the issue, or atleast your not seeing it that way
2012-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		the issue is why is the python script (quake) exiting at startup but not once you system is booted
2012-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		maybe it is not compatible with gnome-shell?
2012-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		'sleep 10; guake' in startup
2012-04-24T07:44:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		just inside the quotes naryfa
2012-04-24T07:44:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		chown it back to your perms if its yours (as root or priv account)
2012-04-24T07:44:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		ok
2012-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		i think rsync has an option to call sudo on the remote end
2012-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	profxavier	SolarisBoy	are you replying to me ?
2012-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		sort of
2012-04-24T07:46:00.000Z	profxavier	SolarisBoy	could you sort of supply me with the command and flags? an example perhaps ?

2012-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	profxavier		merci
2012-04-24T07:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	profxavier	sorry if you took that the wrong way, i was saying i didn't recall it so i was more so speaking in general that @ you
2012-04-24T07:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		but i found the article quickly no worries - your welcome
2012-04-24T07:48:00.000Z	profxavier		yes, thanks
2012-04-24T07:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	profxavier	your going to need NOPASSWD set in sudo it seems..
2012-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	profxavier		yeah, on first glance
2012-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	profxavier		i think ill just change the permissions on the remote server, for a moment
2012-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	profxavier		and just complete the scp and change them back
2012-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	profxavier	should they actually be owned by root?
