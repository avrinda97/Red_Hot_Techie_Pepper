2010-11-09T12:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	ft_mn	I understand that you want to feed your script, there is few ways to do it. you can make extra (spoof) column and use grep or tail it or many more
2010-11-09T12:39:00.000Z	ft_mn	shcherbak	ill try to find a trick .... thanks for ur time though :D
2010-11-09T12:40:00.000Z	shcherbak	ft_mn	have you thought of (is there only one world in file) variable=$(cat that/file)
