2007-10-25T12:24:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Yes
2007-10-25T12:24:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	xrandr is your friend
2007-10-25T12:24:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Are you registered?
2007-10-25T12:25:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	i know about that tool...but what if the monitor is plugged in while X is running?
2007-10-25T12:25:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Hmm I don't know, I would think it would work
2007-10-25T12:25:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	xrandr is just for changing the rotation / res
2007-10-25T12:26:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	No, the new version of xrandr (in Gutsy) can change screens and all kinds of fancy whizbang
2007-10-25T12:26:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	xrandr --output VGA --mode 1280x960 --output LVDS --off
2007-10-25T12:28:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Have you tried xrandr?
2007-10-25T12:29:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	yes - xrandr sees the monitot
2007-10-25T12:29:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	is there a graphical tool for gnome?
2007-10-25T12:29:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Not that I know of
2007-10-25T12:34:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	I lied, grandr
2007-10-25T12:34:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Although I've setup hotkeys via compiz to switch between laptop and external monitor
2007-10-25T12:47:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	does grandr work for you
2007-10-25T12:48:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	when I start it and click on one of the detected monitors at the left the programm produces a segfault
2007-10-25T12:49:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Yeah, that's what I found out :/
2007-10-25T12:49:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	something missing here?
2007-10-25T12:50:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Wha?
2007-10-25T12:51:00.000Z	Layer8	fiveofoh	could it be that some packets whicht are needed are not installed?
2007-10-25T12:53:00.000Z	fiveofoh	Layer8	Hmm, bad dependencies?  I don't know
