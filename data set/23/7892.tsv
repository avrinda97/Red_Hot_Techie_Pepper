2005-04-01T09:44:00.000Z	caffinated		either that, or they're using the gecko engine anyway
2005-04-01T09:45:00.000Z	caffinated		those are all gecko browsers iirc
2005-04-01T09:45:00.000Z	caffinated		so they're all going to be a bit hungry
2005-04-01T09:46:00.000Z	caffinated		heh
2005-04-01T09:47:00.000Z	caffinated		or good ol' elinks even
2005-04-01T09:47:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 thats to much work for most ppl
2005-04-01T09:55:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	it's not a question of believing or disbelieving things on /. - it's to do with using your brain, and doing some follow-up research if you're interested in being in the know.
2005-04-01T09:59:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	right, but this is different because people will order it just because it's free, and it doesn't use up their time.  beos also didn't have a livecd, had sub-par hardware support, and it lacked a lot of software.
2005-04-01T10:00:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	someone is more likely to try something if a friend hands them a cd and says "keep it, i have 9 more at home" than if they're given a link
2005-04-01T10:04:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 best way to avoid going back is fdisk and nukeing cds
2005-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	i'm not pro-windows.  i'm not pro-linux.  i'm pro-having-it-my-way. :)
2005-04-01T11:05:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 i beg ti differ on that last statement
2005-04-01T11:05:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	i figured you might :)
2005-04-01T11:06:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 i dont think you were around in the early days
2005-04-01T11:07:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	that's possible, but how far back is "the early days" for you?
2005-04-01T11:07:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	i mean, i started programming on a TI-99/4A
2005-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 why dont you guys start a channel for kde vs gnome
2005-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	at some point you should think about adjusting your attitude.
2005-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	friendly debate is not an argument.
2005-04-11T07:00:00.000Z	geneo93	caffinated	 i just so sick of ppl saying gnome is better kde is better
2005-04-11T07:00:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	so don't watch :)
2005-04-11T07:01:00.000Z	caffinated	geneo93	terms like 'M$' don't really go a long way to support opensource.
