2007-04-11T15:28:00.000Z	clouder`grr		I had my smb server working great for 27 days, and then I rebooted and now it won't show up in the windows network.  Any ideas?
2007-04-11T15:30:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Might seem like a dumb question, but are you sure the services are set to start on boot?
2007-04-11T15:33:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	any other ideas? I'll take anything atm
2007-04-11T15:35:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Did you check to see if the services are running?  If so, I missed your reply.  Can you connect to the machine by IP or by name?  I assume you mean that you can not browse to it.
2007-04-11T15:37:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	The services are running, I can do $ smbclient -L localhost and it shows information but I can't use nautilus, or my xbox, or a windows machine to browse it
2007-04-11T15:39:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Can you connect to the share directly from your Windows machine?  Just type \\machinename\sharename in the address bar of your explorer window?
2007-04-11T15:39:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Or use the IP address...
2007-04-11T15:41:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	let me give that a shot real quick
2007-04-11T15:42:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Okay
2007-04-11T15:44:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	no dice
2007-04-11T15:45:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 You haven't inadvertently activated a firewall, have you?
2007-04-11T15:45:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	Mmm, not that I know of.  How would I check?
2007-04-11T15:46:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	 Hmm...  In Ubuntu?  Not sure.  Try "sudo iptables -L".
2007-04-11T15:49:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	I have a whole mess of stuff in there.  The last time I did that I remember it being empty
2007-04-11T15:49:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	perhaps I should look into this :X
2007-04-11T15:49:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	Sounds like you have a firewall.
2007-04-11T15:51:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	If you don't, you should see three chains (INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD) with empty rule lists.
2007-04-11T15:51:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	would the firewall also prevent me from seeing my share in nautilus?
2007-04-11T15:51:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	Quite possibly.
2007-04-11T15:53:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	ahh, I'm an idiot.  You were so right.  I had installed firestarter a long time ago but turned it off.  Hasn't rebooted in 27 days and it kicked back in on restart
2007-04-11T15:54:00.000Z	clouder`grr	YetiChick	thank you so much for the help
2007-04-11T15:54:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	I've done worse.  :)
2007-04-11T15:54:00.000Z	YetiChick	clouder`grr	Any time.
