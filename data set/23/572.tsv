2011-06-09T01:46:00.000Z	nincompooop		hey guys
2011-06-09T01:46:00.000Z	nincompooop		where do I find what DNS servers my computer is using?
2011-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	nincompooop		guys?
2011-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2011-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	have some patience
2011-06-09T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	try setting the interface to DHCP (address only) then set the DNS servers to: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
2011-06-09T02:03:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	can do.
2011-06-09T02:04:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	so, I edit /etc/resolv.conf to do that, right?
2011-06-09T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	fornow, yes if its good then we can make the change permanent
2011-06-09T02:05:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	hm, so do I have to restart the network in order to have the DNS servers apply?
2011-06-09T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	no, they are used immediately
2011-06-09T02:06:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	I'll go ahead and ping the DNS servers...
2011-06-09T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2011-06-09T02:07:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	yup, looks like it's a port forwarding problem or the ISP hates me...
2011-06-09T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	how is port forwarding a factor?
2011-06-09T02:09:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	dunno, I just thought I might have blocked that port for no apparent reason...
2011-06-09T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	port forwarding only concerns incoming traffic
2011-06-09T02:09:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	ahhh... K
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	so, I guess I should restart my modem and see what happens, right?
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	if you run:   route    do you have the route setup? Can you ping your router's internal IP?
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	I can.
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	nincompooop	ActionParsnip	route?
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nincompooop	yes, its a terminal command
