2007-12-12T08:12:00.000Z	mssever	mutable	That's the software for CJK input, itsn't it? Unless it's installed by default, I don't have
2007-12-12T08:13:00.000Z	mutable	mssever	yes, it's installed by default. hmm, strange, at least now I know that it isn't bug in Java :(
2007-12-12T08:14:00.000Z	mssever	mutable	Well, I don't use it, unless it's doing something behind the scenes that I don't know about
2007-12-12T08:16:00.000Z	mutable	mssever	But it runs by default, doesn't it (is this prope ? :)
2007-12-12T08:16:00.000Z	mutable	mssever	bad type
2007-12-12T08:17:00.000Z	mssever	mutable	I really don't know about SCIM; If I understand correctly, it deals with languages I don't know
2007-12-12T08:18:00.000Z	mutable	mssever	Yes, I also don't know anything about it. I just found some information that it has something to do with SCIM. But it is installed and run by default so maybe it isn't true.

2007-12-12T08:29:00.000Z	mssever	mutable	I tried a beta version of netbeans, but I don't use it anymore since I didn't like it
