2007-11-24T16:58:00.000Z	Times_Witness		hey.. im new using ubuntu.. or any kind of linux.. im having a boring problem with it: each time i reboot pc linux seems not to save any configuration, like keyboard, it goes back into a wrong setup, i have to change it.. amsn organizing contacts by online/offline, i have to sort them by groups again... well, it seems not to be saving almost any configs at all
2007-11-24T16:58:00.000Z	Times_Witness		any idea of what could be causing this please ?
2007-11-24T16:59:00.000Z	Times_Witness		i installed it.
2007-11-24T16:59:00.000Z	Times_Witness		I am currently running it from the hard drive
2007-11-24T17:00:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	most of those configs are application-specific, sounds like...
2007-11-24T17:00:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	but you could try quitting out of the application before you reboot
2007-11-24T17:00:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	rebooting just sends a kill signal, and some applications might respond better to a manual quit command in terms of config
2007-11-24T17:01:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	also try logging out before rebooting
2007-11-24T17:01:00.000Z	Times_Witness		how about the keyboard..? i cant really "quit the keyboard" :S and i have no applications running that... config keyboard
2007-11-24T17:01:00.000Z	Times_Witness		but  i will try that now
2007-11-24T17:01:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	what keyboard config?
2007-11-24T17:02:00.000Z	Times_Witness		well, it keeps going back to the weird keyboard where most of special characters are changed: @ being shift+2, ? being _ and vice-versa; = being on Â« key... and so on
2007-11-24T17:02:00.000Z	Times_Witness		i have to go to system->keyboard and set the correct layout at each reboot
2007-11-24T17:03:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	erm. so it's like a french keyboard or something?
2007-11-24T17:03:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	might be that X is setup for the wrong keyboard
2007-11-24T17:04:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	and gnome is reverting to the X default when it starts
2007-11-24T17:04:00.000Z	Times_Witness		not french, french is azerty.. i dont know which kind of keyboard, i know where some of the keys are just because i used to play some game which console had that config and we could not change it; i dont know which keyboard is... in system->keybord , its set as english keyboard, 104 keys.. or 105 idont remember, however its not english keyboard aswell
2007-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	Times_Witness	graft_	about X and gnome.. :S well im still too new in linux to really know what they are ..  :p for now im trying to make myself "confortable" saving configs and then i might explore :D heh :X
2007-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	oic... well, hm.
2007-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	Times_Witness		well, i am going to try to reboot frst closing the applications to test it... then we'll see :p thank you graft_ :)
2007-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	well i would suggest just looking in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see what your keyboard configuration is - I suspect the "XkbLayout" setting is not "us" as you would like
2007-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	but maybe you should save that for later...
2007-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	graft_	Times_Witness	anywho i have to go, apologies
