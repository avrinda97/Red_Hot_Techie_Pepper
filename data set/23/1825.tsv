2009-10-13T12:02:00.000Z	Laque		My nvidia-settings is lacking 1600x1200, how can i specify it?
2009-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	gksudo nvidia-settings           write the X config file, then edit the file manually to set the resolution you want
2009-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	I'll try that
2009-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	its old school but works
2009-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	Also, the settings state that my NVidia 8400 card has 512MB of memory and that my onboard NVidia 8300 is using 512MB (taking some of my ram). Is it benefiting me that the onboard has VRAM? If not, how to i stop it from taking my RAM?
2009-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	if you only want 1 dispay, disable the onboard.
2009-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	well my motherboard supports hybrid SLI so they could very well be working together. I just want to know if they are in ubuntu, or if disabling the onboard would be better.
2009-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	well if you need the ram and the cad uses the system ram, disable it
2009-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	amount of ram isn't really an issue, i just more want to find out if the onboard is doing anything
2009-10-13T12:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	disable it and bootup, see what happens. You can always reboot and re-enable it
2009-10-13T13:18:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	couldn't get your advice to work
2009-10-13T13:18:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	no matter what i do to xorg.conf nothing changes
2009-10-13T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	so you wrote the X config to the xorg.conf file, you will see resolutions in the screen section. Change them to what you desire and restart the x server
2009-10-13T13:21:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	i did so, in fact i even tried copying the line of resolutions from the backup of my 8.04
2009-10-13T13:21:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	no change at all
2009-10-13T13:21:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	i'm starting to think xorg.conf doesn't do anything LOL
2009-10-13T13:23:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	I'll try using the entire xorg.conf i used on 8.04 and see if it does anything at all
2009-10-13T13:24:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	going to reboot to see if it works, let me know if you think of anything else when i get back if you will XD
2009-10-13T13:29:00.000Z	Laque	ActionParsnip	first attempt at the failed but i changed the @s to _s in the resolutions and it works perfect now
2009-10-13T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	awesome
2009-10-13T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	backup the file now :)
2009-10-13T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	then if you reinstall you can simply install the driver then drop the good file in
2009-10-13T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laque	was all you duder, i only pointed the right way
