2009-12-11T17:56:00.000Z	always_smile		hello everyone,I get this message when i try to play some vido DVD's,: The file contains an unsupported video format. The needed codec is not installed on your system. (file:///media/cdrom0/Main.swf),anyone to help?
2009-12-11T17:57:00.000Z	always_smile		i've got VLC,but still can't play the video
2009-12-11T17:58:00.000Z	always_smile		it's auto dvd file
2009-12-11T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 auto dvd ?
2009-12-11T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 i can play 'dvdmovie.iso' files here in vlc -  but im not sure if i have that decss stuff installed or not
2009-12-11T18:04:00.000Z	always_smile	Dr_Willis	i can play audio cd's they work fine,but I can't play auto CD's,DVD's
2009-12-11T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 err.. auto ruynning is a feature of the OS. not the cd
2009-12-11T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 at Medibuntu repos
2009-12-11T18:06:00.000Z	always_smile	Dr_Willis	does that mean ,i can't play auto cd's with OS?
2009-12-11T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 your use of the term 'auto' cd is just.. weird..  the OS sees the cd get changed and auto launches/does stuff.. theres no 'auto cd'  its just a music cd. or video dvd
2009-12-11T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 the w32codecs pack is also at mediubuntu repos
2009-12-11T18:30:00.000Z	always_smile	Dr_Willis	I got all codecs relvant to playing cd'dvs's already
2009-12-11T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 you can try playing the file via the command line with vlc or mplayer.  'mplayer whatever.avi' and it may tell you what codecs its trying to use and whats missing.
2009-12-11T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 needs our help and support.. :)
2009-12-11T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 i never use openoffice
2009-12-11T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 ask your questions in the channel if you want answers - not pming me..  Im here then gone for hours at a time
2009-12-11T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 use the package manager tools to install the software mentioned
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 theres several 'chm' viewers in the package manager listing. gnochm i think is one.
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 so 'sudo apt-get install gnochm' will install that one
2009-12-11T20:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 try loading them into openoffice
2009-12-11T20:08:00.000Z	always_smile	Dr_Willis	the openoffice doesn't have something similar to access though,does it?
2009-12-11T20:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	always_smile	 try   double clicking on it and see if OpenOffice Opens it.
2009-12-11T20:15:00.000Z	always_smile	Dr_Willis	the CHM files now r working thank you very much
