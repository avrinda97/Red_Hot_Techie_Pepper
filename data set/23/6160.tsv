2007-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	Fructose		Anyone know of any documentation explaining how ALSA/OSS work and why there are so many problems with sound in Linux?
2007-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	there are not so many problems with sound in linux. OSS is the old sound implementation that sucked, ALSA is new and works great. Sometimes legacy apps that still use OSS can pose problems but that is very rare
2007-06-03T05:54:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Well, I have problems and the only sound applications I'm using are Totem, VLC, and Firefox with Flash
2007-06-03T05:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	oh well if you have problems, then very clearly it is an OS wide problem
2007-06-03T05:55:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	I'm afraid it's not just this machine or even just this distro.
2007-06-03T05:56:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Which certainly makes it seem like a problem with ALSA/OSS.
2007-06-03T05:56:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	perhaps it is your hardware or yoru configuration. I have never had any problems, I can have all three of those things you mentioned plus exaile and mplayer going and it all works
2007-06-03T05:56:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Often, I can run several at once as well. However, often I run into issues like the one I have now, where absolutely no sound is coming out at all.
2007-06-03T05:57:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	This is an improvement, at least. In older versions of Ubuntu, I could only play one sound app at a time, in many cases.
2007-06-03T05:57:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	sounds almost like you are using flash 7 which I doubt. Either way, it is your computer and your setup not the kernel or something as preposterous
2007-06-03T05:58:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	ALSA is a kernel module, no?
2007-06-03T05:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	you miss the point, it is you, not alsa
2007-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Is that what you tell everyone who comes in here with a problem that doesn't have an obvious solution?
2007-06-03T06:00:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	people who come in here and go "what is the matter with linux, my sound doesn't work" yeah, those people. or "when I click firefox from the menu, nothing happens, linux sucks"
2007-06-03T06:01:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Well, then why me? I've been using Linux for years and I continue to encounter sound issues. I asked if there was any documentation on such issues. I didn't say "Linux sucks".
2007-06-03T06:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	it is the generalization and the arrogance accompanying such a generalization that if you have a problem, it must be a flaw in linux. Unless you can literally cite the bug, such as this here doesn't work because X, it is annoying to me when you automatically assume such a bug exists
2007-06-03T06:04:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Again, I never said those things. You're imagining it. I came here to understand the problem. There is a problem, I assure you. If I understand it, maybe I can fix it. That's my line of thought, not "it's not working, it sucks." Otherwise, I would continue to pay the M$ tax.
2007-06-03T06:05:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Yes, "in Linux" not "because Linux sucks"
2007-06-03T06:07:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Hardware, user error, bad configuration, etc. can all occur "in Linux". I'm not saying it's the kernel's code that is the issue. It may be crappy vendor drivers and such. It's still "in Linux".
2007-06-03T06:09:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	And I continuously encounter such issues. It's not just me. It's not just my hardware. It has begun to get better with more recently releases, but it can't be perfect if I'm encountering one right now.
2007-06-03T06:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	perhaps semantically there is a way out there. It is however analogous to me saying "there is a problem with service in this restaurant" and then later clarify saying "well I didn't mean that the restaurant service has a problem, just that service inside the restaurant is bad, like cable service" weak, but technically sound I believe
2007-06-03T06:11:00.000Z	Fructose	bruenig	Faulty analogy. Let me fix it. All I know is that when I order my meal, it gets to me cold. I don't know if it's the waiter's fault. I don't know if it's the chef's fault. Maybe the menu should say to ask for it warm. Maybe it's a cultural expectation to do so. All I know, is that my food is cold and I don't want it that way.
2007-06-03T06:12:00.000Z	bruenig	Fructose	right but if the way you reported it to me was "this restaurant serves cold food" the implication is that the restaurant caused it, while not necessarily the only correct interpretation of that statement, the most likely way
