2006-01-08T16:51:00.000Z	cary	polpak	any ideas?
2006-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	polpak	cary	I believe the problem is that you are not an administrative user
2006-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	cary	polpak	how can i change that?
2006-01-09T17:06:00.000Z	polpak	cary	you cannot
2006-01-09T17:07:00.000Z	polpak	cary	the only possible option is to boot into single user mode
2006-01-09T17:07:00.000Z	cary	polpak	so how can i create a user that CAN see the package manager? i only want one account and i want it to be named cary, and i want it to be an admin
2006-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	cary	polpak	is SUM command line only? and should it be this hard to be able to see the freaking package manager? it worked straight away last time i installed
2006-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	polpak	cary	the problem is that the first time you installed it created your user as admin
2006-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	polpak	cary	(which is the default)
2006-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	polpak	cary	if you created a new user that did not have admin priveleges and are using that one then a secure system should not allow you to upgrade your privileges
2006-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	cary	polpak	so...i am fine with totally reinstalling the system. ive not  modified hardly anything. im basically defautl setup as i am. so on reintstall what should to avoid this?
2006-01-09T17:10:00.000Z	cary	polpak	this is th eonly user i created other than root
2006-01-09T17:10:00.000Z	cary	polpak	and it snot like i really "created" root
2006-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	polpak	cary	pastebin your /etc/group file
2006-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	cary	polpak	what is the command to open "group" up to be able to copy it. i can see it in /etc  but...how do i open i
2006-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	polpak	cary	cat /etc/group
2006-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	cary	polpak	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6554
2006-01-09T17:18:00.000Z	polpak	cary	you've somehow removed your admin group..
2006-01-09T17:18:00.000Z	cary	polpak	ahahaha fantastic. what does that even mean.
2006-01-09T17:20:00.000Z	polpak	cary	my group file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6555
2006-01-09T17:20:00.000Z	polpak	cary	as you can see, the group admin (just after scanner) is missing in your file
2006-01-09T17:21:00.000Z	polpak	cary	it needs to be there, and your user needs to be in it in order to access sudo
2006-01-09T17:21:00.000Z	cary	polpak	so what can i do about this?
