2007-12-03T06:42:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	do you know how to grow a window?  I've tried C^a + but its not working
2007-12-03T06:45:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	you can do Ctrl-A : then type "resize +10" to grow by 10, and probably bind that to a key
2007-12-03T06:45:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	don't know if that's bound by default
2007-12-03T06:45:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	ty thank you.
2007-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	aparently its default in gentoo but not ubuntu
2007-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	makes sense, a lot of gentoo's default settings are nice
2007-12-03T06:47:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	yeah default in there according to the howto was C^a + increased by 3 lines
2007-12-03T08:11:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	lol
2007-12-03T08:30:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	better how?
2007-12-03T08:30:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	well gmail on links2 is kind of annoying.  And I can only run in graphics mode if I use sudo for some jacked reason.
2007-12-03T08:31:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	Then the mouse speed is like i'm on crack.
2007-12-03T08:31:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	I think w3m has a console mode etc, but theren't aren't too many others with grahics
2007-12-03T08:31:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	just links2 has graphics?  Any idea why i have to use sudo for links2 -g
2007-12-03T08:33:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	is your user in the group "video"?
2007-12-03T08:33:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	yes
2007-12-03T08:35:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	did you try -driver fb and -driver directfb
2007-12-03T08:36:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	nah just specified teh -g option. with sudo. let me try that
2007-12-03T08:37:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	on the the fb driver just errors.  The directfb driver says permission denied Error opening /dev/tty0
2007-12-03T08:38:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	now I'm just guessing but maybe add yourself to the tty group?
2007-12-03T08:38:00.000Z	h1st0	kelsin	i'll have to give it a shot.
2007-12-03T08:38:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	past that I don't know, maybe udev rules to make /dev/tty0 the proper permissions :-(
2007-12-04T09:37:00.000Z	kelsin	h1st0	he's trying to change the button layout
