2007-11-26T03:32:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	scp myfile username@friendspc:/some/path/
2007-11-26T03:33:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	i tried that, but it came back ssh: cannot connect to host: connection refused
2007-11-26T03:34:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	is sshd running on the remote pc
2007-11-26T03:34:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	i dont know, how can i tell
2007-11-26T03:34:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	is it a Linux box?
2007-11-26T03:35:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	yes
2007-11-26T03:35:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	sudo netstat -atnp
2007-11-26T03:37:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	 what should it say
2007-11-26T03:37:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	Look for sshd in the last column of the output
2007-11-26T03:38:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	nope, there is no sshd anywhere
2007-11-26T03:38:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	then you need to start sshd /etc/init.d/sshd start
2007-11-26T03:38:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	but you'll possibly need to install it first
2007-11-26T03:39:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	ok. When writing the command, do i type friendsusername@his-ip or @his-computer's-name
2007-11-26T03:40:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	his-ip will always work, name will only work if you have DNS set up or an entry in your /etc/hosts file
2007-11-26T03:41:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	ok, if we both have sshd running it should work right? or is there anything else we have to do first?
2007-11-26T03:42:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	only the remote machine needs sshd, provided firewall rules (if you have one between the machines) allow the connection on port 22, that should be all you need
2007-11-26T03:43:00.000Z	Bruno1	mpeters	ok, thanks for your help
2007-11-26T03:43:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	no problem
2007-11-26T03:58:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	/etc/init.d/sshd start
2007-11-26T04:00:00.000Z	mpeters	Bruno1	actually that should be "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start"
