2005-09-01T10:13:00.000Z	dabar	nima	got wine yet?
2005-09-01T10:14:00.000Z	dabar	nima	ok, let us put this this way.
2005-09-01T10:14:00.000Z	dabar	nima	your synaptic pulls a list of packages from a file, that is located at /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-09-01T10:15:00.000Z	dabar	nima	also, synaptic has a function to add repositories, so, you could add the repository manually into the file, or you could do it through synaptic.
2005-09-01T10:16:00.000Z	nima	dabar	what are you trying to tell me to do ? chek the file?
2005-09-01T10:17:00.000Z	dabar	nima	to learn how to do it through synaptic, visit http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingRepositoriesHowto . to add it manually, you would open the file with sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, and replace what is in it with http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/969 , then save, close, and then reload your package list.
2005-09-01T10:18:00.000Z	dabar	nima	I am giving you knowledge, not instructions.
2005-09-01T10:19:00.000Z	dabar	nima	to reload, you either hit the reload button in synaptic, or you do it in a terminal. in a terminal, you would type in sudo apt-get update, or sudo aptitude update. aptitude is the new preffered debian way.
2005-09-01T10:19:00.000Z	dabar	nima	I told you above, read as many times till you dont get it.
2005-09-01T10:19:00.000Z	dabar	nima	I did not miss one thing.
2005-09-01T10:45:00.000Z	dabar	nima	are you really sorry?
2005-09-01T10:38:00.000Z	dabar	nima	please do this. open a terminal, do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-09-01T10:40:00.000Z	dabar	nima	that downloads my sources.list file, from the server, to your folder.
2005-09-01T10:41:00.000Z	dabar	nima	now, yuou need to put it into the right folder.
2005-09-01T10:42:00.000Z	dabar	nima	all those instructions are for you.
2005-09-01T10:45:00.000Z	dabar	nima	I would like to point out the scroll up ability of todays windows.
2005-09-01T10:53:00.000Z	dabar	nima	how'd that work?
2005-09-01T10:55:00.000Z	dabar	nima	did not work how?
2005-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	dabar	nima	if you have a sources.list file in your current folder, you will be able to do that command.
