2011-02-25T19:51:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	go to monitor settings or use buttons on your monitor if you have any
2011-02-25T19:52:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	monitor settings(depending on vendor) are at system > preferences > monitors
2011-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	, that doesnt work
2011-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	does it give an error?
2011-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	wizash		yes
2011-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	wizash		graphics driver
2011-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	is your graphics driver the latest version?
2011-02-25T19:54:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	, It appears that your graphics driver does not support the necessary extensions to use this tool.  Do you want to use your graphics driver vendor's tool instead?
2011-02-25T19:54:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	press yes
2011-02-25T19:54:00.000Z	wizash		that takes me to nvidia control panel
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	go to color correction
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	brightness settings are there
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	where is color correction?
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	found it
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	is it X server nvidia?
2011-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	ah ok
2011-02-25T19:56:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	I was able to run the Fn key with the F5 anf F6 buttons to change the settings
2011-02-25T19:56:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	ok
2011-02-25T19:56:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	how do I enable those?
2011-02-25T19:57:00.000Z	wizash		its been disabled somehow
2011-02-25T19:57:00.000Z	ruan	wizash	i don't know
2011-02-25T19:58:00.000Z	wizash	ruan	this isnt reducing the output of the screen, just changing the levels, I am actually worried about the excessive heat from the screen. Doesnt become so hot in windows
