2007-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	maybe your driver is old, try the iwpriv command instead
2007-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	I think it is   sudo iwpriv ath0 mode monitor
2007-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	also, I'm not sure all drivers support monitor mode
2007-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	speedy_	Enselic	u know wich one does?
2007-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	also definitly an alternative
2007-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	the Intel driver for example
2007-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	but you cant use Intel drivers unless you have an Intel card...
2007-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	speedy_	Enselic	how bout wlan-ng ? does that driver support atheros?
2007-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	no idea
2007-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	generally there is one driver per card
2007-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	speedy_	Enselic	can i do it with the network manager applet?
2007-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	do what? change driver? not afaik
2007-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	but I susepct the driver you have now is the one that exists for your card
2007-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	speedy_	Enselic	change the mode to monitor?
2007-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	well not if your driver does not support it, which appears to be the case
2007-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	what brand do you have?
2007-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	speedy_	Enselic	atheros
2007-10-13T14:12:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy_	not heard of them, not sure if they make good Linux drivers. you can try google for the rdrivers
