2008-05-04T09:16:00.000Z	OzFalcon	MP2E	what do you want to do?
2008-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	MP2E		Well I'm not really happy with the midi output from freepats OzFalcon, So I want to convert the Windows General midi to a patch
2008-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	MP2E		just wondering if that could happe
2008-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	MP2E		*happen
2008-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	MP2E		Hehe yeah windows likes doing "shortcuts" like that
2008-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	MP2E		The only thing I love about windows is it's MIDI
2008-05-04T09:19:00.000Z	OzFalcon	MP2E	Is free pats a soundfont or something?
2008-05-04T09:20:00.000Z	MP2E	OzFalcon	- Yes... it's just the instruments that allow linux to play midi. But they don't sound anywhere near Windows MIDI output
2008-05-04T09:21:00.000Z	OzFalcon		MP2e yeah, I was playing some midi files, And they sound pretty bad.
2008-05-04T09:22:00.000Z	OzFalcon	MP2E	I have tried qsynth - (fluidsynth frontent), But couldnt get it to work. (fluidsynth has two different sound fonts available to use)
2008-05-04T09:23:00.000Z	MP2E	OzFalcon	- What is it?
2008-05-04T09:23:00.000Z	MP2E	OzFalcon	- just another sound patch?
2008-05-04T09:24:00.000Z	OzFalcon	MP2E	It's a player as far as I can tell. Like timidity I guess. (But timidity plays very poorly - ie do anything on the machine and it kills the audio smoothness)
2008-05-04T09:26:00.000Z	MP2E		brb
2008-05-04T09:31:00.000Z	OzFalcon		MP2E
2008-05-04T09:31:00.000Z	OzFalcon	MP2E	if you get fluidsynth working, Let me know
