2007-01-03T06:52:00.000Z	svish		Totem Movie Player?
2007-01-03T06:52:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	totem can use either gstreamer or xine at the backend (Ubuntu installs totem-gstreamer by default)
2007-01-03T06:53:00.000Z	svish	bimberi	so xine version is better or?
2007-01-03T06:54:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	in my experience totem-xine is more stable and plays more formats.  Others' mmv.

2007-01-03T07:20:00.000Z	svish	bimberi	well, I can make one, which is Super_L but it wont let me have anything after that :(
2007-01-03T07:20:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	yes, you need to use the procedure described in that factoid

2007-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	they aren't the same, su needs the password of the user you are becoming (eg. root)
2007-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	svish	bimberi	so how do I use the root abilities i thought my user already have?
2007-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	using sudo. eg. 'sudo -i' gets you a root shell
2007-01-03T08:17:00.000Z	bimberi	svish	alt-F2
2007-01-04T17:20:00.000Z	svish	bimberi	aaaaah.. im SuppoSed to uSe <mod4>? not <Super_L>?
