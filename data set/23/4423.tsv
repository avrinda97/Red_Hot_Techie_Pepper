2007-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	eontastico		I have Ubuntu 7.04 Server and some files are getting checksum errors after i copy them over to it
2007-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	eontastico		i tried all new hardware
2007-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	eontastico		same thing
2007-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	eontastico		is this a bug?  and if so can I fix it
2007-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	how are you 'copying them over' ?
2007-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	SMB, flash drive, ftp, doesnt matter --- actually i can even download a file from the web straight to teh box
2007-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	eontastico		and it still corrupts
2007-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	everything is going through your network card, and is becoming corrupt?
2007-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	well i have transferred via flash drive
2007-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	eontastico		and it still corrupts
2007-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	i replaced the NIC too
2007-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	are the original files on a corrupt system?
2007-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	no, the original files pass md5sum on the original box
2007-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	you need to narrow your 'issue search' down more
2007-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	meaning?
2007-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	is it the hard drive your writing to?
2007-08-16T08:26:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	what types of files, are they different file systems?
2007-08-16T08:26:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	is your checksum tool working properly
2007-08-16T08:27:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	well, the files are readable on the first system if they past the checksum
2007-08-16T08:27:00.000Z	eontastico	wolferine	so i know the files are being corrupted on the second system
2007-08-16T08:27:00.000Z	eontastico		i just dont know how
2007-08-16T08:28:00.000Z	wolferine	eontastico	well, read my previous posts...
