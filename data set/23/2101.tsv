2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	cheater__		:-)
2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	cheater__		how do I get httpd and php installed on ubuntu?
2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	cheater__		splendid
2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	cheater__		i'm on the desktop tho
2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	cheater__		i'll check stuff out
2009-07-03T22:24:00.000Z	cheater__		does the desktop come with httpd on its own?
2009-07-03T22:24:00.000Z	cheater__		or do you need to specifically add it?
2009-07-03T22:24:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	for the desktop you might consider something a little easier than apache...like nginx
2009-07-03T22:45:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	would you have any idea how to uninstall lamp-server?
2009-07-03T22:45:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	nope...I would imagine just remove apache, php, and mysql
2009-07-03T22:46:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	although I would probably just turn them off and leave the software installed
2009-07-03T22:47:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	now, is there any easy way to install httpd, php and mysql in its *normal* forms?
2009-07-03T22:48:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	that is all lamp is. First, there is no httpd, there are a number of http servers, apache, nginx, etc and any of them will work. in a lamp server the http server software is apache.
2009-07-03T22:48:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	but the inis are reeeeeally weird
2009-07-03T22:48:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	i mean specifically apache httpd. sorry.
2009-07-03T22:49:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	I haven't used apache in a couple of years since I only need a local server...that is why I earlier suggested nginx if you just want something on your desktop. Apache, I know, has gotten quite complex
2009-07-03T22:50:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	i am a web developer. i can make use of it :-)
2009-07-03T22:50:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	the apache, php, and mysql you get with lamp should be the same packages that are available separately through the repos.
2009-07-03T22:51:00.000Z	cheater__	th0r	the location and form of ini files is completely different. that's the whole point.
2009-07-03T23:31:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	you probably need the -dev for libtermcap and libcurses
2009-07-03T23:31:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	go to synaptic and look for something like libtermcap-dev
2009-07-03T23:31:00.000Z	th0r	cheater__	or maybe termcap-dev
