2011-02-21T08:57:00.000Z	coraxx	apet4u	have you tried to install the "backport-kernel-modules" package ? ...just curious.
2011-02-21T08:59:00.000Z	apet4u	coraxx	were can i find those?
2011-02-21T09:00:00.000Z	coraxx	apet4u	ever since the ath5k and its predessesor was includes in the kernel modules they have been nothing but trouble ... some of the fixes (not all) how been known to be included in the backport-packages (used it once myself, when I couldn't even get the card to work at all)
2011-02-21T09:02:00.000Z	apet4u	coraxx	Im willing to try it... cause it seems to work fine as long as the connection is unsecured
2011-02-21T09:03:00.000Z	coraxx	apet4u	in the repository you should find something like "linux-backports-modules-wireless-" (and the depeding on your Ubuntu dist, the name of it)
2011-02-21T09:04:00.000Z	coraxx	apet4u	is it installed on a HP Laptop ...just curious as some of them have problem with that card.

2011-02-21T09:09:00.000Z	coraxx	apet4u	I'm not sure what you mean ...what do you mean ?
