2005-06-21T06:47:00.000Z	nate		Can't anybody take a look at my problem??  I posted it http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=41533
2005-06-21T06:47:00.000Z	nate		I'm seriously out of ideas
2005-06-21T06:47:00.000Z	mdke	nate	when does that problem occur?
2005-06-21T06:48:00.000Z	nate	mdke	Anytime I try and play anything from Cedega
2005-06-21T06:48:00.000Z	nate	mdke	but it never happened till I installed Wine
2005-06-21T06:49:00.000Z	nate	mdke	even if I remove the packages for wine it still does it
2005-06-21T06:49:00.000Z	mdke	nate	did you try the command it suggests ("LANG=etc")
2005-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	nate	mdke	Is that in the /etc/enviroment file??  Is that what its refering to?
2005-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	mdke	nate	on my system I just use that command
2005-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	mdke	nate	but I'm not on Ubuntu right now, its worth a try!
2005-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	nate	mdke	ok so...what do I need to do to try this?
2005-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	mdke	nate	open a terminal, and type LANG=whatever
2005-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	nate	mdke	I just put LANG=en_US
2005-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	nate	mdke	It didn't return with anything...
2005-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	mdke	nate	see if its worked with "env|grep LANG"
2005-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	nate	mdke	yes that command checks out
2005-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	mdke	nate	has it helped?
2005-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	nate	mdke	nah same thing
2005-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	mdke	nate	have you tried running winex from the terminal
2005-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	nate	mdke	I run Point2Play from the terminal to see the error
2005-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	mdke	nate	ok i'm spent
2005-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	nate	mdke	If I don't run it from the terminal you don't see anything and nothing happens
2005-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	nate	mdke	lol.... It doesn't make any sense...everything on my system checks out
