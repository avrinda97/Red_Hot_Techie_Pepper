2004-11-12T06:30:00.000Z	noda		(unless it's on the CD...)
2004-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	noda		np
2004-11-12T06:32:00.000Z	noda		(that's what I like about Ubuntu -- people always ask about how to do very complicated stuff to get a certain goal... and it's actually damned easy)
2004-11-12T06:34:00.000Z	noda		Erm, "planned"
2004-11-12T06:35:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	what can we expect from 2.10, do you know that?
2004-11-12T06:36:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	I only know my little subset: epiphany extensions will have a nice UI and you'll be able to load/unload them while Epiphany is running :P
2004-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	epiphany is a browser right?
2004-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Yep
2004-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	don't be offended, but why is gnome developing it's own browser when there is something as smooth as mozilla to compete against?
2004-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Maybe there'll be audio CD burning... GNOME really needs that :)
2004-11-12T06:38:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Have you tried Epiphany? :)
2004-11-12T06:38:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	It's light years ahead of Firefox in terms of usability.
2004-11-12T06:38:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Simple, and Just Works -- it's a GNOME browser.
2004-11-12T06:38:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	And it fits in better with GNOME -- follows your theme better.
2004-11-12T06:42:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	how is epihany ahead of firefox then, in usability?
2004-11-12T06:42:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Like half as many menu entries, and follows the HIG :)
2004-11-12T06:42:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	All GNOME apps follow the HIG. Human Interface Guidelines
2004-11-12T06:43:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	ah. :-)
2004-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	And my Error Viewer extension is awesome, too. Though I think on Ubuntu it doesn't work with xhtml. I'll have to reproduce then file a bug :)
2004-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	Yes, BUT
2004-11-12T06:45:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	http://gtk-webcore.sf.net
2004-11-12T06:49:00.000Z	HWolf	noda	sorry for the comment, but it looks a lot like IE to me. Makes me shiver. :-)
2004-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	noda	HWolf	1. It Just Works :)
