2008-09-09T07:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	is that the only way to connect to your harddrive at this point?
2008-09-09T07:54:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	well, I have swapped harddrives with ubuntu to a different computer, and it worked fine.  But im not sure how to install ubuntu to a usb drive
2008-09-09T07:55:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	that gives me the idea to research install procedures to a flash drive
2008-09-09T07:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	im looking here atm: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
2008-09-09T07:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	I think ScheissDroge has the answer
2008-09-09T08:54:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	another option would be to use an older version of ubuntu.  That was you can stay true to the directions.  Then, just upgrade using the built in systems
2008-09-09T08:56:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	yeah. noted. I can certainly try that. I just didnt happen to have a 7.x ISO on hand.
2008-09-09T08:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	O M G, new direction:  this page: https://launchpad.net/liveusb
2008-09-09T08:59:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	looking....
2008-09-09T09:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	just one problem I think, it formats fat32?  wtf?
2008-09-09T09:01:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	ick. would much prefer ext2
2008-09-09T09:01:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	i just need to figure out the new magic for syslinux
2008-09-09T09:01:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	heck, I'll even update the wiki.
2008-09-09T09:02:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	have you tried here? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Manual%20Approach
2008-09-09T09:04:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	those are largely the same as the instructions I followed. again, the devil seems to be in the details of the syslinux.cfg
2008-09-09T09:05:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	well, this is the last thing I found: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4404569
2008-09-09T09:07:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	hmm. those instructions seem to be a corrective action if you tried to use the alternative cd/iso, but I am using the standard distro
2008-09-09T09:10:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	does one of those steps present a problem, im starting to understand it.  I don't think using a livecd will fail.  I think it should work
2008-09-09T09:12:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	it looks like you are just setting the drive up to be bootable, and then start up a disc image, that you copy to the drive.  I don't think it matters which image you copy to the drive, as long as it is 32bit
2008-09-09T09:13:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	yes. its just that syslinux is then unable to boot me into the installer
2008-09-09T09:14:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	i see
2008-09-09T09:34:00.000Z	justinpitts	danbhfive	(and others) thanks for your help. gonna crash for the evening. I know I am at least started down the right path.
2008-09-09T09:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	justinpitts	take care, and good luck
