2006-01-23T15:30:00.000Z	leku-		god
2006-01-23T15:30:00.000Z	leku-		maybe it's all this KDE crap I'm running
2006-01-23T15:31:00.000Z	leku-		I guess before I just had fluxbox
2006-01-23T15:31:00.000Z	leku-		true true.. once it is done though
2006-01-23T15:31:00.000Z	leku-		i can't evne say for sure if i was faster because of gentoo or not
2006-01-23T15:31:00.000Z	leku-		thinking about it, i don't know if it mattered.. right now it seems slow probably because before I didn't run all this kde nonsense
2006-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	leku-		the problem is now I kind of like this KDE business, it's just extremely unusable if it's not fast
2006-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	leku-		yeah my box isn't even doing anything right now
2006-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	leku-		load avg 1.29
2006-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	leku-		Xorg and xmms the culprits
2006-01-23T15:33:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	I used to use gnome on brezzy. When I switched to kde 3.5 is was night and day. Kde is so much faster at everything.
2006-01-23T15:35:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	sounds like speedstep
2006-01-23T15:35:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	it will speed up when it needs too. you won't gain any performance
2006-01-23T15:36:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	is this a laptop?
2006-01-23T15:36:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	same as the one I'm typeing this on.
2006-01-23T15:37:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	don't turn it off. it increase the chance of overheating. it was designed to use speedstep.
2006-01-23T15:38:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	sorry. I'm not going to help you destory your laptop. It will run at 1.3 when you run an app. when idle, it drops the frequency.
2006-01-23T15:38:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	don't be stupid
2006-01-23T15:39:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	you are actiing stupid, and not listening to people you know more about it then you. leave it alone.
2006-01-23T15:41:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	you just said you don't care if it overheats becouse someone will buy you a new one.
2006-01-23T15:41:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	your parrents?
2006-01-23T15:41:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	thats what you sound like, sorry.
2006-01-23T15:43:00.000Z	bipolar	leku-	I suguest you go to google and figure it out yourself. the system is working at it's peek effency and you will only hurt it by changing it.
