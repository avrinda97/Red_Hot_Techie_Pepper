2011-11-13T23:14:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		salihk: what?
2011-11-13T23:15:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		kkiabyte: not better, it is just choice.
2011-11-13T23:16:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		killabyte: i used linux mint, but inorder for the greater good and ubuntu 11.10, i switched to ubuntu again
2011-11-13T23:16:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		ulrick: what does?
2011-11-13T23:16:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		vsingh: might want to try, gnome-shell, liking it.
2011-11-13T23:17:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	the new gnome is kind of annoying, though
2011-11-13T23:18:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn	vsingh165	well, i prefer it over unity currently since i get to see all my open windows as soon as i move mymouse over the home button
2011-11-13T23:19:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 it's your preference.  I prefer unity since I use OSX and the layout/functionality is similar
2011-11-13T23:19:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 the sidebar especially keeps things neat when you have lots of stuff open on multiple desktops
2011-11-13T23:19:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn	vsingh165	gnome shell is same thing with a few things different.
2011-11-13T23:20:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 gnome 3 is slow though...gnome 2 was much faster and more streamlined
2011-11-13T23:20:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		vsingh: i was comparing unity to gnome shell. not to gnome 2.
2011-11-13T23:20:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 I would rather use gnome 3 on a tablet, since it seems to be more touch-friendly with its android-like interface
2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		is anyone else having issue with flash and firefox? it is choppy and slow
2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		i deleted flash 11
2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		and installed flash 10
2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn		and went to chrome, and it seems better
2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	vsingh165		hhhzzarn:  flash 11 is actually pretty good.  at least now they have 64-bit version that's really fast.
2011-11-13T23:22:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn	vsingh165	do you mean for 64 bit os?
2011-11-13T23:22:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 yes.  and chrome is nice with how it bundles flash in.  updates when the browser does :)
2011-11-13T23:22:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn	vsingh165	question: flash 64 for 64 bit os or 64 bit system?
2011-11-13T23:23:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 64-bit os on 64-bit system
2011-11-13T23:23:00.000Z	vsingh165	hhhzzzarn	 I don't run 32-bit anymore
