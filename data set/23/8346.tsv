2004-10-14T15:49:00.000Z	Sleeper		can someone explain to me the greatness of ubuntu? 
2004-10-14T15:51:00.000Z	Sleeper		whats the best version out?
2004-10-14T15:51:00.000Z	Sleeper		i am currently downloading the warty preview one... is that good?
2004-10-14T15:51:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	you should rather download the latest daily cd
2004-10-14T15:51:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	we fixed a lot of bugs since the preview
2004-10-14T15:52:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	how would i download the latest daily cd? Is this the one with the single mirror from the UK?
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	never mind..
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/daily/current/
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	one more quick question.. is it only one iso
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	thanks
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	you can also use rsync, its faster if you already have an older iso
2004-10-14T15:53:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	yes, only one CD
2004-10-14T15:54:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	oh i don't have it.. i am starting from scratch
2004-10-14T15:54:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	currently you need to download universe packages from the network
2004-10-14T15:54:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	okay. But if you want to upgrade the CD, then rsync is faster (it downloads only the difference)
2004-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	thanks... is there instructions on downloading the universe packages?
2004-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	does ubuntu have a tool that will do it for me?
2004-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	synaptic (the package manager) supports this quite nicely
2004-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	Sleeper	pitti	k thanks
2004-10-14T15:56:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	in synaptic: Settings -> Package sources, there you can enable Universe
2004-10-14T15:56:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	but you do not need it for the most common stuff
2004-10-14T15:56:00.000Z	pitti	Sleeper	all Desktop pacakges already come on the CD
