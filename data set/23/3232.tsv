2008-11-08T06:35:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	doesnt work man
2008-11-08T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	Works for me on intrepid
2008-11-08T06:36:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	everything works for everyone on intrepid, not me though
2008-11-08T06:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	What happens when you try to play a video?
2008-11-08T06:37:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	it works..., lol
2008-11-08T06:37:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	okay ill reprhase, sound works, its nice, but flash sound does not work at all
2008-11-08T06:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	So the totem video plugin works but you still want sound in flash, or does totem's youtube plugin not work for you?
2008-11-08T06:39:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	they both share the same symptoms, video plays perfect, no sound however
2008-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	Are there any apps that play sound?
2008-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	yes, and they all work
2008-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	local vids and mp3s work
2008-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	So local vids play in totem with sound but not vids from totem's youtube plugin?
2008-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	yes.
2008-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	That's odd
2008-11-08T06:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	What happens if you go into /tmp and try to play one of the files that starts with "Flash" while a youtube video page is open in the browser?
2008-11-08T06:52:00.000Z	christo_m	Jordan_U	nothing, no sound in both totem and firefox
2008-11-08T06:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	christo_m	Try running "asoundconf set-pulseaudio" and see if sounds play then ( you may need to stop any programs playing sound for it to start working )
