2007-12-31T12:34:00.000Z	loudnlownoma		Anyone familiar with changing the priority of the network connections?  My specific problem is trying to make sure that my dial-up(of sorts) connection stays the primary when the Ethernet cable is connected to my router, for local network access...
2007-12-31T12:34:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	i have to do that in my bios
2007-12-31T12:35:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	Wouldn't a BIOS setting cause it to have trouble in Windows as well(this machine is dual-booted, Gutsy and Vista)
2007-12-31T12:35:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	ah
2007-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	it didn't affect me
2007-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	my machine is partitioned but I also don't use both partitions consecutively
2007-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	Hmmm....   I looked through there the other night but didn't really notice anything that looked related
2007-12-31T12:37:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	do you not want your dial up as priority when using Windows?
2007-12-31T12:37:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	The other thing along with it (because it wouldn't be fun if it was just something simple) is that the dialup is via a USB connection from my cell phone.  Would that also possibly be BIOS related?
2007-12-31T12:39:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	absolutely.  but you want to make sure that your BIOS settings include all available network connections
2007-12-31T12:39:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	What I meant above was that in Vista, even with the Ethernet connected, the dial-up will stay connecting, and it will use either connection to get online.  Because the router has no incoming connection outside the network, it goes back to the dial-up.  That's basically what I want to do in Linux, but it acts like the Ethernet being connected means nothing else needs to connect.
2007-12-31T12:40:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	make ethernet your primary connection then
2007-12-31T12:40:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	and if it's not available, it will carry over to the next network connection you specify in the bios
2007-12-31T12:41:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	I'll have to look again and see if anything seems to mention that...  Any other ideas if that doesn't do it?
2007-12-31T12:43:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	no, sorry.  I'm a linux n00b  :)
2007-12-31T12:43:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	No worries.  Thanks for the tip, and trust me, I'm not expert myself.  :)
2007-12-31T12:43:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	Back in a few.  :)
2007-12-31T12:44:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	i had to modify the preference of my network order in my bios when i installed ubuntu on a partition
2007-12-31T12:45:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	what kind of computer are you using
2007-12-31T12:53:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	Well, no luck...  :(   Nothing in Bios about the Network card, other than enabling or disabling the onboard card
2007-12-31T12:55:00.000Z	MooMooM	loudnlownoma	are you using your system's most current bios available?
2007-12-31T12:56:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	As far as I can tell.  It's a re-built HP.  I know, I know.  But it was a good deal, a powerful rig, and most everything works outof the box with Gutsy
2007-12-31T12:58:00.000Z	loudnlownoma	MooMooM	But it still seems strange to be a BIOS issue.  I mean I have seen stranger, but just seems like Ubuntu starts ignoring the connection from the dial up.  It's still running, the adapter still gets an IP the whole time, it just bumps all connections over to eth0 instead of the dial up.  If I disconnect the ethernet cable, my connection works again as normal, without doing anything
