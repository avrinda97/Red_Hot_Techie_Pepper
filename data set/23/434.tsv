2012-01-22T16:46:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	there is no such thing as intel64
2012-01-22T16:46:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	http://mirror01.th.ifl.net/releases/11.10/ubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso is what you are looking for
2012-01-22T16:46:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	amd64 just means 64bit, which your processor can do.
2012-01-22T16:46:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	it's titled amd64 because amd invented it
2012-01-22T16:46:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	just like 32bit is x86
2012-01-22T16:47:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	x86 is the arch
2012-01-22T16:47:00.000Z	ryannathans	cameron	ARM is the arch for most mobile devices, for example.
