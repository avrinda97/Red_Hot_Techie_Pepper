2007-05-21T15:18:00.000Z	deCon		umm, can someone help me check something quick
2007-05-21T15:18:00.000Z	deCon		for some reason, all my sudo commands are having issues being denied and its getting really irritating
2007-05-21T15:19:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	either your user is not member of the admin-group, or your /etc/sudoers is broken
2007-05-21T15:20:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	is there a way to check if /etc/sudoers is broken?
2007-05-21T15:21:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	thanks, ill figure it out later, if i continue ill end up smashing my box with a hammer
2007-05-21T15:21:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	not without root priv's :-). if you are the only user, and this is not member of admin you are locked out.
2007-05-21T15:21:00.000Z	deCon		bash .playlist denied?!?!! aksdjfkasjfkewieifwefklwejioferwoihteidgj
2007-05-21T15:21:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	boot in recovery mode and issue : adduser <username> admin
2007-05-21T15:22:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	do i have to set that up? Or by default after install..isn't my user automatically a superuser? using sudo...?
2007-05-21T15:23:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	of course by default the *first* user is member of admin... but if you add a second one, and delete the first one later you just threw away the key to your box :-)
2007-05-21T15:23:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	except for moving things and such, most everything in my last session has been denied. "bash: /xxx/xxxx/xxx Permission denied"
2007-05-21T15:23:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	i am the only user
2007-05-21T15:24:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	what did you tinker with your box?
2007-05-21T15:24:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	nothing i know of
2007-05-21T15:24:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	but now i haven't been able to install a few things, and all kinds of ******* things have been not working as instructed
2007-05-21T15:25:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	there's not much that you can do, if you're locked out of root-priv's... so does sudo not work at all or doesn't it work partly?
2007-05-21T15:25:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	i'm trying to install something from DVD, that won't work. I'm trying to edit a cron file for setting up an alarm, that wont work. I'm trying to edit or fix that
2007-05-21T15:26:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	does sudo -s work ?
2007-05-21T15:26:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	it works for editing commands, but for some reason...either my syntax is poor, or i have no freaking clue
2007-05-21T15:26:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	sure does
2007-05-21T15:27:00.000Z	stefg	deCon	so i think your syntax is poor :-)... check in the user-control applet if you are member of admin. and if you are read !root
2007-05-21T15:28:00.000Z	deCon		!root
2007-05-21T15:28:00.000Z	deCon	stefg	grrr, i have no time to learn CLI, but everything i need to do uses it and when i seek the information or help on here, it rarely helps, thank you anyway...ill just restart
