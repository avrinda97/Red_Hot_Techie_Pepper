2011-07-24T09:53:00.000Z	fedy		hello need help w/ ufw
2011-07-24T09:53:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	what question
2011-07-24T09:54:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	just by first enabling -- then adding rules in the gui
2011-07-24T09:54:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	download gufw
2011-07-24T09:55:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	it will show up under administration
2011-07-24T09:55:00.000Z	fedy	Tigerboy	i have al ready installed
2011-07-24T09:56:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	just worry about opening ports for inbound things such as samba ports or webserver so people from outside can get in
2011-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	fedy	Tigerboy	what do i enable incoming and outgoing?
2011-07-24T09:58:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	you can enable all outgoing (up to you) and then just only the ports you need for incoming-- by default enabling ufw will make it so all outgoling are allowed and all incoming are closed.
2011-07-24T10:01:00.000Z	fedy	Tigerboy	when you deny incoming it stop the all internet access
2011-07-24T10:02:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	no
2011-07-24T10:04:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	by default all connections from outside to internal servers are blocked
2011-07-24T10:05:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	if you have an internal webserver you can open port 80 (and other ports if you offer ssl as an example)
2011-07-24T10:06:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	that allows people from the outside in only on port 80
2011-07-24T10:06:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	than you don't need to open ports for internal servers so just enable ufw
2011-07-24T10:07:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	the default is fine for you
2011-07-24T10:07:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	in the gui (gufw) just unlock it and click the box to enable it. You just need to do that one time.
2011-07-24T10:12:00.000Z	fedy	Tigerboy	when I restart the computer the gufw automatically disables. what did I do wrong.
2011-07-24T10:16:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	just go to terminal and type sudo ufw --enable
2011-07-24T10:17:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	first type ufw --status
2011-07-24T10:17:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	you only need to set enable one time
2011-07-24T10:19:00.000Z	fedy	Tigerboy	it saids Status; active
2011-07-24T10:19:00.000Z	Tigerboy	fedy	that means you are fine
