2010-08-11T06:54:00.000Z	bonhoffer		it doesn't look like my tasks in crontab are running. can i troubleshoot?
2010-08-11T06:55:00.000Z	bonhoffer		or enable crontab in some way
2010-08-11T06:56:00.000Z	bonhoffer		does /etc/crontab need to be enabled in ubuntu?
2010-08-11T06:56:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	you just need to enter jobs
2010-08-11T06:56:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	enter jobs?
2010-08-11T06:57:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	you just need to define jobs in crontab....there is nothing to enable

2010-08-11T06:59:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	where is my own crontab -- and why doesn't the system crontab work?
2010-08-11T07:00:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	what makes you think the system crontab doesn't work?
2010-08-11T07:02:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	well, first I suspect your passing parameters in the cron job is messing things up. Create a script that passes all that so you are using a one word command, or put the command in quotes
2010-08-11T07:02:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	got it
2010-08-11T07:02:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	thanks
2011-06-06T04:44:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	that is a group, the password belongs to the user
2011-06-06T04:44:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	so i want to create a user named passenger to deploy apps on my server
2011-06-06T04:45:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish, but you can't change the password because it is a group and not a user
2011-06-06T04:45:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	i am just trying to add a user named 'passenger'
2011-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	didn't this start with a question about 'sudo passwd passenger'?
2011-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	then use either adduser or useradd, or do it through the gui
2011-06-06T04:47:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	that is a group
2011-06-06T04:47:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	those won't work because the group exists
2011-06-06T04:47:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	if you defined the group by mistake remove it first, then add the user
2011-06-06T04:48:00.000Z	th0r	bonhoffer	bonhoffer: th0r: those won't work because the group exists
2011-06-06T05:02:00.000Z	bonhoffer	th0r	ZykoticK9 : a problem remains, i just created .ssh in ~ for passenger, look at the permissions: drwx------ 2       108 passenger 4096 Apr  9  2009 .ssh
