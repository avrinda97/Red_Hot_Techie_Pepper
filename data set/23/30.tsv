2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		So far, so good. According to that thread, I now need to run 'sudo apt-get upgrade -f'. I try running it and I get a bunch of messages like "could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'". OK, so there is some kind of network problem. I know the network is up because I can access it via other computers. I can't even ping IP addresses, so it's not a DNS problem.
2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		ahh, crumbs, sorry FloodBot!
2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		ok, I'll try again
2012-10-28T20:33:00.000Z	jfries		@hhzzzarn: the network is up, but for some reason the machine won't connect to it, hence I can't upgrade
2012-10-28T20:34:00.000Z	jfries		even when I plug in the cable directly
2012-10-28T20:35:00.000Z	jfries		hi hhhzzdarn! yeah, it doesn't connect
2012-10-28T20:36:00.000Z	jfries		(but take into account this is from the maintenance shell, so something has gone wrong ahead of time)
2012-10-28T20:37:00.000Z	jfries		ok, thanks anyway hhhzzzarn
2012-10-28T20:38:00.000Z	jfries		the files aren't a huge deal, but I was hoping there was some way to complete the upgrade
2012-10-28T20:40:00.000Z	jfries		right now the problem (as I perceive it) is that I am not able to run apt-get update because it can't connect to the network. so I am treating this like a network configuration problem, and once I fix that I'll go back to worrying about finishing the upgrade
2012-10-28T20:40:00.000Z	compdoc	jfries	thats sounds like the correct way to proceed
2012-10-28T20:41:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	so, I don't think network manager is even running in this maintenance shell, b/c when I run "ps aux | grep Network" I don't see any result
2012-10-28T20:42:00.000Z	jfries		so, if NetworkManager isn't running, and /etc/network/interfaces doesn't contain an entry for eth0, then it seems like it won't be able to connect to the network, no?
2012-10-28T20:43:00.000Z	compdoc	jfries	pastebin.org this output: ifconfig  and: cat /etc/resolv.conf
2012-10-28T20:44:00.000Z	jfries		@menkeletor: I think that was addressed to me, right? I ran 'ps aux | grep httpd' and it doesn't show anything.
2012-10-28T20:44:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	in progress, just a moment
2012-10-28T20:45:00.000Z	compdoc		I like how you elevate me to Op
2012-10-28T20:45:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	I don't need paste bin for the output b/c there is virtually none. ifconfig doesn't return *anything* and cat /etc/resolv.conf just has one line "#Generated by Network Manager"
2012-10-28T20:45:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	what is Op?
2012-10-28T20:45:00.000Z	compdoc	jfries	what does this show:  sudo ifconfig
2012-10-28T20:46:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	sudo ifconfig also shows no result
2012-10-28T20:46:00.000Z	compdoc	jfries	is this a computer or a virtual machine, or what?
2012-10-28T20:47:00.000Z	jfries	compdoc	this is a physical machine sitting right in front of me. It worked fine until I upgraded :(
