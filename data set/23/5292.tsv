2007-04-06T10:38:00.000Z	xtknight	Magilla_	gdm reboots when the gnome splash reports a progress of ~50?

2007-04-06T10:40:00.000Z	xtknight	Magilla_	i suggest creating a new user so you can start gnome properly.  you can do this from a virtual terminal.
2007-04-06T10:41:00.000Z	xtknight	Magilla_	sudo adduser --home=/home/debuguser debuguser
2007-04-06T10:42:00.000Z	Magilla_	xtknight	I can't log in with any of the normal accounts
2007-04-06T10:42:00.000Z	xtknight	Magilla_	yes try logging in with debugusers
