2007-10-03T13:30:00.000Z	dmitry_		i am trying to install xchat 2.6.8 on feisty fawn, but the package returned an error, "dependency is not satisfiable: libdbus-1-2". how could i get around that?
2007-10-03T13:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	afaik you get that version of xchat just enabling backports
2007-10-03T13:31:00.000Z	dmitry_	erUSUL	could you elaborate?
2007-10-03T13:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	i lied it is 2.8.4 in backports
2007-10-03T13:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	if you have the feisty-backports repository enabled you get xchat 2.8.4
2007-10-03T13:32:00.000Z	dmitry_	erUSUL	are they enabled by default?
2007-10-03T13:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	no, i get them using source-o-matic to generate a sources.lst
2007-10-03T13:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	add a line like this to your /etc/apt/sources.list  >> deb http://es.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu feisty-backports main restricted universe multiverse <<
2007-10-03T13:35:00.000Z	dmitry_	erUSUL	done. next step?
2007-10-03T13:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	well instead of http://es.archive... you should have used your country code (es: --> Spain)
2007-10-03T13:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	where are you from?
2007-10-03T13:36:00.000Z	dmitry_	erUSUL	located in england.
2007-10-03T13:36:00.000Z	dmitry_	erUSUL	would it be uk?
2007-10-03T13:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmitry_	instead of es on that line you should use uk
