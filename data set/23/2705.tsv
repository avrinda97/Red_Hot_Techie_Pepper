2010-06-18T11:47:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	Try clearing the cache on the firefox that's not working
2010-06-18T11:48:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	I've tried this several times, clearing all possible caches
2010-06-18T11:49:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	How exactly is the faulty content different?
2010-06-18T11:50:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	the Applet requests a file from the server it comes from. When I look at the file which it requests I see what it SHOULD receive - however in the JAVA console it complains about ">>>> <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
2010-06-18T11:54:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	That line wouldn't be the same as you would see from the source of an error page from the server would it?
2010-06-18T12:00:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	say again?
2010-06-18T12:01:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	what is the last thing you meant?
2010-06-18T12:01:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	Get an error from the server (request a non-existent file) and look at the first line in the source of that page.
2010-06-18T12:02:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	I know what you are getting at and I assume that yes, this is an error page the Java applet sees - but why...
2010-06-18T12:02:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	yes, it could be an error page
2010-06-18T12:02:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	How about installing the tamper data plugin on firefox and use it to make sure that your applet is requesting the right file
2010-06-18T12:04:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	you sure that works with JAVA ? It's not just a Firebug clone for Ajax?
2010-06-18T12:04:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	I know it works for Flash, so It may work for java
2010-06-18T12:10:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	unless I'm using the plugin wrongly TamperData does not account for what JAVA does
2010-06-18T12:10:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	I sure could find other ways to figure that out
2010-06-18T12:10:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	Well, you could try using wireshark, then, which will definitely catch Java traffic.
2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	I'll ask #linux whether anyone can think of a convenient way to sniff http requests nicely
2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	wait
2010-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	/var/log/apache2/access.log assuming that apache is the web server
2010-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	of the server? Not quite - even if I started an instance of the server locally it's not a http server and I dont know about how and where it logs
2010-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	Oh, no idea about that then...
2010-06-18T12:20:00.000Z	undecim	ManDay	Quick note: if the server is on localhost, use the lo interface
2010-06-18T12:21:00.000Z	ManDay	undecim	yes, ill start the server locally that narrows it down
