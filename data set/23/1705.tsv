2010-05-10T03:11:00.000Z	shawnboy		I can't believe I can't find the answer to this in the forums-- how do I check CompactFlash card for errors. Will fsck work? If so, what options do I use?
2010-05-10T03:13:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	I _think_ fsck just checks the file system which checks the card indirectly.  There might be a program called badblocks that checks more directly
2010-05-10T03:14:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	when I do fsck /dev/sdb1 it just returns filesystem type, # of files, and # of clusters.
2010-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	I just wanted to tell you about badblocks.  I don't really know how to use fsck, sorry
2010-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	that's ok. Thanks for the tip. I've already found some info about badblocks. It may help me.

2010-08-18T06:06:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	can you check your logs?
2010-08-18T06:07:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	was only question I could think of.. but I've never done that, so would need some guidance (seeing what's going on when it freezes).
2010-08-18T06:08:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	I would check kern.log then Xorg.?.log or something   both in /var/log
2010-08-18T06:12:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	looks like last signif entry in kern.log is loading (or trying) kernel.
2010-08-18T06:15:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	yeah, I dunno, maybe coz_ has an idea?  Are you booting into recovery mode?
2010-08-18T06:17:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	yes, I'm in recovery mode now... CLI root w/ networking.
2010-08-18T06:18:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	can you pastebin your kern.log?  pastebinit makes it easy
2010-08-18T06:19:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	I think. I'd have to check really quick if I have lynx installed and if it will be lynx friendly. Won't tak long. You'd only want latest few screens I'm guessing.
2010-08-18T06:20:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	just use: pastebinit kern.log
2010-08-18T06:26:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	I have log file in one screen, lynx paste-bin in another, but don't know how get part or all of log file into paste-bin without GUI.  :(
2010-08-18T06:26:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	did pastebinit not work?
2010-08-18T06:27:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	I am not familiar with pasti-binit. Is it command line utility package I can install?
2010-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	hmm, your wifi is getting there.  Have you tried alt+sysrq+k?
2010-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	I'm only guessing about the wifi actually
2010-08-19T03:15:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	Remember I was having lock ups at boot? I don't know what changed, but I uninstalled fglrx ati proprietary driver and reinstalled. That fixed it. FYI.
2010-08-19T03:16:00.000Z	ChogyDan	shawnboy	maybe it was just a harddrive error
2010-08-19T03:25:00.000Z	shawnboy	ChogyDan	sometimes I run my notebook on AC with removed battery. Could've been low power "dip." Who knows. Glad I didn't have to reinstall.
