2009-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	dante123		 iLoveWindows now there is a flamebait name if I ever saw one
2009-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	I was thinking that maybe they should change their name as well
2009-11-07T05:39:00.000Z	dante123	sebsebseb	u think I should go to 9.10 or is it still too early?
2009-11-07T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Did we talk about it before or?
2009-11-07T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	9.10 has some issues
2009-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	  randomusr   I don't think  saying Ext4 has loads of bugs is quite true
2009-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Your on 9.04 now or?
2009-11-07T05:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Many people have ended up with problems after upgrading 9.04 to 9.10.
2009-11-07T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Also if you check out the release notes you can find out about common 9.10 issues.
2009-11-07T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	yes
2009-11-07T05:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	some no problem,  but many problems after upgrading from 9.04
2009-11-07T05:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	  Bob1  in Windows yeah maybe,   in Ubuntu well only security updates from the default repos
2009-12-16T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	dual booting 9.10 and 9.04?
2009-12-16T05:03:00.000Z	dante123	sebsebseb	basically yes, I have 9.10 on partition one.....installed 9.04 derivative (Jolicloud) on second partition.....did not install bootloader when doing that so it would not overwrite 9.10 version.....
2009-12-16T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	ok so I guess you need to edit the file for Grub 2 so it can boot up 9.04 as well or something.  By the way why are you dual booting the two versions?
2009-12-16T05:05:00.000Z	dante123	sebsebseb	really like the Jolicloud for my daughter....cloud based, facebook etc.  nice interface too (like UNR but even slicker I feel)
2009-12-16T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	jolicloud???
2009-12-16T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Ext4 in 9.04 hmm
2009-12-16T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	well in your case something based on 9.04
2009-12-16T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	Anyway in Ubuntu 9.04, Ext4 is not properly stable, because of the kernel they have and such.  Well it's been fine for me with 9.04.
2009-12-16T05:11:00.000Z	dante123	sebsebseb	http://www.jolicloud.com/
2009-12-16T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	yeah thanks :)  something I can vm
2009-12-16T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dante123	plus I quite like Ubuntu 9.04, except a thing or two
