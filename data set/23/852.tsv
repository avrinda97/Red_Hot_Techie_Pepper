2012-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	dboehmer		hello
2012-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	dboehmer		i need some help with KVM (libvirt) and busybox installed
2012-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	dboehmer		after i installed busybox KVM fails to start VMs
2012-04-02T16:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	 does the kvm start script uses tools not availlable in busybox?
2012-04-02T16:31:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	i don't know. hoped to get information about that here.
2012-04-02T16:31:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	i use busybox in the initrd to open LUKS encrypted root fs. ordinary shell is bash
2012-04-02T16:33:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	 hmm, what happens if you start kvm later on in a terminal? Does it still not start? Does the syslog tells you something about a problem?
2012-04-02T16:33:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	the error i got complains about an error in '"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/connection.py", line 996'
2012-04-02T16:34:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	the whole text: http://paste.ubuntu.com/911417/
2012-04-02T16:35:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	 so the problem is somehow more a ssh connection problem and you try to connect from remote?
2012-04-02T16:37:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	argh, yes, the pasted error was a problem with the SSH config. the username was incorrect. however, there is still the problem. just a different error message m(

2012-04-02T16:39:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	sure that root has a bash shell?
2012-04-02T16:39:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	i changed the host to login as my user
2012-04-02T16:39:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	and it worked logging in as your user?
2012-04-02T16:40:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	no, when logging in as my user i come to the VM list but cannot start any, error message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/911419/
2012-04-02T16:41:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	so you've changed severall things, now its not working. How do you relate your problem to busybox?
2012-04-02T16:42:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	never mind that SSH problem. i had tested this in my local network before moving the host box to the "ISP". i removed and installed busybox and could verify that ONLY doing that changed the ability to start VMs
2012-04-02T16:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	can you use su on busybox. I'm not an expert for busybox, so I'm just guessing
2012-04-02T16:47:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	i tried to open a shell with "busybox" but i only get a help text... *surprised*
2012-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	i read the error message again and removed the serial device from the VM. it is now running. i promise I checked (de)installing busybox but i have NO clue how that could cause that error!
2012-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	dboehmer	schnuffle	nevertheless. thank you for your effort! because i don't need serial i'll stick with removing serial devices from my VMs
2012-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	schnuffle	dboehmer	 sorry I could be more helpfull
