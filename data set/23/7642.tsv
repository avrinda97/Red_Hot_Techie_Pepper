2005-05-31T12:39:00.000Z	tweakism_		I need to upgrade my wireless nic drivers to use a version not packaged by ubuntu.  dpkg -S says linux-image-2.6.10-5-386 is the package that contains the modules I will be replacing.  http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/INSTALL details the normal build proceedure for this module.  What's the correct way to make a new kernel image package, with these modules included?
2005-05-31T12:40:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	download the sources, adapt the kernel config and use make-kpkg and install the deb it generates
2005-05-31T12:41:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	OK, that's what I mostly have figured out.  The INSTALL file details instructions for building as an external module, though, so how do I incorporate that into the kernel package?
2005-05-31T12:41:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	you do not *need* a kernel package then
2005-05-31T12:42:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	Well, no, but I like to keep things in package management.  If I just delete the modules the package installed, and install my own, it won't be covered by package management.
2005-05-31T12:43:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	true, but i think it's too much effort for such a simple thing
2005-05-31T12:43:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	OK, I'll just do it that way then.  Thanks.
2005-05-31T12:52:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	killp ...
2005-05-31T12:57:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	I haven't used clamav.  How is it?  Particularly, does it have a good DB, or is it lacking lots of common viruses?
2005-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	no friggin clue :) but al newbies want a virusscanner...
2005-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	I'm thinking of installing it on our mailserver.  I never have, because I always had a sneaking suspicion that an open source project couldn't have the resources to properly catalog a large number of Windows viruses, like money farms like Norton and McAffe can.
2005-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	my thoughtd exactly..
2005-05-31T13:10:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	Well, looks like I'm going to be building my own kernel package anyway (just to have a build directory for this other module), so after I do the build, but before I make the kernel package, can I just substitute in the .ko files I want for the ones in the kernel tree (they're build for the exact same version and configuration), and it will install those when I dpkg -i the kernel package?
2005-05-31T13:11:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	i think so, but don't kill me if i am wrong :)
2005-05-31T13:11:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	:P
2005-05-31T13:16:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	Is this the correct process to make a kernel package?  Note the distressing lack of make-kpkg.  http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/KernelBuildpackageHowto
2005-05-31T13:17:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	no idea, i must confess that i have never made a kernel package myself
2005-06-20T06:31:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	it is not ok
2005-06-20T06:31:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	:/  Why not?
2005-06-20T06:32:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	well, basically it can (and will) break stuff...
2005-06-20T06:33:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	Ok...  I could compile my own kernel, and that would work.  What exactly does Ubuntu do to warty kernels to break them on hoary?
2005-06-23T09:33:00.000Z	Seveas	tweakism_	you should not run sshd manually...
2005-06-24T07:33:00.000Z	tweakism_	Seveas	eh?  I don't.
