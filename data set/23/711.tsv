2011-09-15T16:16:00.000Z	Mr_Bond		I think grub-install in ubuntu 10.04 is semi-broken. The "fix grub" option in the install cd dosn't do the right thing either.
2011-09-15T16:16:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	It works for me
2011-09-15T16:16:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	me too usually. But I'm getting it installed with the wrong "prefix" set in grub.
2011-09-15T16:16:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	what's your machine config
2011-09-15T16:17:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	the wrong prefix? Elaborate
2011-09-15T16:17:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	I'm running in vmware. One ext2 /boot and ext4 / on LVM. I cloned this system from another server
2011-09-15T16:18:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	after installing grub, "prefix" is set to (hd0,1)/boot/grub in grub-prompt. But the correct value would be (hd0,1)/grub
2011-09-15T16:19:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	/boot/grub is the standard location. why do you want to put it under /grub?
2011-09-15T16:20:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	since "/boot" is a seperat partition, it is a folder on the "root" partition, not the "boot" partition
2011-09-15T16:20:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	(hd0,1) is the boot partition, not the root-partition.
2011-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	whye is there a root-partion
2011-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	you need a root-partition to be able to run Linux
2011-09-15T16:22:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	yes, yes. but it is invariably also the boot partion. Except for you
2011-09-15T16:22:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	so are you saying that having a seperate /boot partition is not supported?
2011-09-15T16:23:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	I am sying you are doing something the designeres never contemplated
2011-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	then the designers are retarted. That has been a preferred way of doing it for many users for ages. It is also supposed to be supported by the install process, and works fine when configuring it under install.
2011-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	that may be true.
2011-09-15T16:25:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	but there you have it. Complain to Canonical.
2011-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	are you sure about this?
2011-09-15T16:27:00.000Z	Younder	Mr_Bond	I am now. This isn't my call though
2011-09-15T16:28:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	thanks for the input. I'm however not convinced that is the case.
2011-09-15T16:29:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	but reporting the issue I'm experiencing is probably a good idea anyway.
2011-09-15T16:46:00.000Z	Mr_Bond	Younder	I get the same error when I try without a seperate boot partition (I copied files from /boot), then I removed the filesystem on it, and set the "/"-partition to boot in "parted", then I did "dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc", and then "grub-install /dev/sda" and "update-grub". I noticed grub produced new grub.cfg which refers to the lvm-root as root-volume.
