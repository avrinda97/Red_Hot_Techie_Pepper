2008-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	mmilo		hello
2008-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	mmilo		is anyone able to lend a hand helping me set up my screen resolution?
2008-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	What's the problem?
2008-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	Did you try setting it up as a generic monitor?
2008-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	my res is 1920 x 1600 and the highest its giving me is 1600 x 1200
2008-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	If you've found the specs for the monitor (as provided by the manufacturer), you can update /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the values and get more options.
2008-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	i took a look at the xorg.conf and its detected my monitor as a dell
2008-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	but its actually a benq
2008-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	Well, the type doesn't really do anything except try to provide information on what's safe (in terms of signal speed) to the monitor.
2008-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	Take a look at the same sort of issue I had at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/180601
2008-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	All you have to do is look up the monitor's specs and enter the extra lines into xorg.conf.
2008-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	You may need to restart X for them to take effect. (CTRL-ALT-Backspace)
2008-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	Don't forget to back up xorg.conf before changing it! If it goes wrong, you can change it back on a tty terminal.
2008-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	how do i edit the xorg, cuz its not letting me do it in the text editor
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	im assuming i need to do it via sudo
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	It's a protected file, you have to sudo the command.
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	feisty
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	I meant, plain Ubuntu vs. Kubuntu vs. Xubuntu, etc.
2008-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	wait no, im using gutsy
2008-01-06T10:28:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	ahh, its just plain ubuntu
2008-01-06T10:31:00.000Z	mmilo	FactTech	thanks fact, im gonna restart x now and see if it works
2008-01-06T10:32:00.000Z	FactTech	mmilo	Good luck!
