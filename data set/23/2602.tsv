2009-01-10T04:25:00.000Z	SmokeyD1		hey people. What exactly does /etc/cron.daily/apt do? I know what a cron job does, but where does this particular one come from?
2009-01-10T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	did you try reading it?  It has some comments at the top
2009-01-10T04:27:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	yes, it 255 lines long
2009-01-10T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	not the comments at the top
2009-01-10T04:27:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	it only explains a couple of configuration options, but not where I can set them
2009-01-10T04:28:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	man apt.conf   would be my guess
2009-01-10T04:29:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	thanks. Didn't know it was there
2009-01-21T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	0.94 is what I see in intrepid's repositories.  What ubuntu version are you using?
2009-01-21T18:02:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	sorry I meant hardy
2009-01-21T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	usually security patches are cherrypicked, so the version you are using probably already has the security patches from 0.94 (check the changelog).  See: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy/+source/clamav/+bug/296704
2009-01-21T18:05:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	yeah but I remember from previous experiences that clamav always complains if you don't update it
2009-01-21T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	I don't use clamav.  Is it complaining?
2009-01-21T18:08:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	I didn't install yet. I assumed it would be since I experienced that before. I'll see first before wasting time :)
2009-01-21T18:08:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	I know debian has a volatile repository with clamav because of the clamav complaints when it 's not the newest version
2009-01-21T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	the bug mentions some ppa, but I would try with the default repositories first
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	apt-cache policy clamav   shows what version?
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	 Installed: 0.92.1~dfsg2-1.1ubuntu0.4
2009-01-21T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	why is that useless?
2009-01-21T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	did you see if the changelog mentions the 0.94 changes?
2009-01-21T18:15:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	since new virusses get released all the time that first try to disable the virusscanner so it can't be detected, even if the scanner knows about it.
2009-01-21T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	I really doubt that happens on linux, but like I said, security fixes are cherrypicked into -updates.  That's why I am asking you to check the changelog of the version you have now to see if it mentions the bug I linked you to
2009-01-21T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	SmokeyD1	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2008-December/005068.html mail mentioning the ppa in the bug report
2009-01-21T18:19:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	jrib	thanks for the info
