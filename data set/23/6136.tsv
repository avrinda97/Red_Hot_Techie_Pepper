2006-06-25T14:35:00.000Z	hareem		can some one tell me how to install QT 3.x
2006-06-25T14:35:00.000Z	hareem		please
2006-06-25T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	may i ask you why you need it?
2006-06-25T14:37:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	by "install" you mean "compile"?
2006-06-25T14:37:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	then sudo aptitude install libqt3-mt
2006-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	hareem	LjL	i followed your instructions
2006-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	perhaps it's really going to be compiled, after all. try installing libqt3-mt-dev
2006-06-25T14:40:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	sudo aptitude install libqt3-mt-dev
2006-06-25T14:42:00.000Z	hareem	LjL	your command does not work
2006-06-25T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	my command does work for installing QT3 and it's development files. that Open Kiosk installer is probably broken in some way.
2006-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	you've been asked for the URL to the file. please give that. otherwise few people will be able to help, if they don't *have* the program.
2006-06-26T05:40:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	so it's not even the actual openkiosk that you're installed, but this nodeview module?
2006-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	look, do me a favor and tell me the package you used for berkeley db. i'm not sure which one i should install
2006-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	oh, it's not a package in dapper? hmm
2006-06-26T05:50:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	hmm, what about if you try after doing "export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3"
2006-06-26T05:52:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	just type that in the shell. if it doesn't work, try also "export QTDIR=/usr/lib", and/or   "export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3"
2006-06-26T05:52:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	and/or "export QTDIR=/usr/include/qt3"
2006-06-26T05:53:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	yes, try with that, then try installing, and if it doesn't work, try with the others i just told you
2006-06-26T05:54:00.000Z	hareem	LjL	man you are one hell of a genius
2006-06-26T05:54:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	works?
2006-06-26T05:54:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	as i suspected, that's a pretty horrible configure script
2006-06-26T05:55:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	anyway, there's really no guarantee make and make install will work. but try
2006-06-26T05:56:00.000Z	LjL	hareem	you weren't doing anything wrong. it's the script that's stupid
