2006-10-08T10:37:00.000Z	jenda		I have trouble networking my dapper and edgy boxes. Openssh-server is installed on both, but connecting always ends up with 'no host could be found'. They are both connected to the LAN, one with DHCP and the other with static IP. The error occurs on both ends.
2006-10-08T10:38:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	sudo iptable -L shows input forward and output all set to accept?
2006-10-08T10:38:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	sudo iptables -L i mean
2006-10-08T10:38:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	yes on the edgy...
2006-10-08T10:39:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	and on the dapper too.
2006-10-08T10:39:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	and your connecting by ipaddress like ssh 192.168.1.3 -l username  ?
2006-10-08T10:40:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	I used nautilus
2006-10-08T10:40:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	are you wanting ftp or a remote shell or a remote desktop?
2006-10-08T10:40:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	remote file browsing
2006-10-08T10:41:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	ssh fails with 'no route to host'
2006-10-08T10:41:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	and on the other machine with 'network is unreachable'
2006-10-08T10:43:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	yes
2006-10-08T10:44:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	can you paste the output of ifconfig to a pastebin site?
2006-10-08T10:45:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	Umm... lart me :) It's a PEBKAC :)
2006-10-08T10:46:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	cable unplugged :) You can easily not notice on 80 meters of connection between them.
2006-10-08T10:47:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	hah :)
2006-10-08T10:47:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	sorry :) and thanks
2006-12-22T08:04:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	regular old ps2 keyboard? maybe just sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-26T16:29:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	no idea.. sudo sed -i 's/edgy/feisty//' /etc/apt/sources.list; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  should assuming youre on edgy
2007-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	Yes, I am. The wiki says that method is not very reliable - why would that be?
2007-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	er youd want to use g there to that i left out so ignore that
2007-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	jenda	pike_	of course :)
2007-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	pike_	jenda	honestly though i dont know why you wouldnt just edit the sources.list it is dependable ive never really even used the gui update tool
