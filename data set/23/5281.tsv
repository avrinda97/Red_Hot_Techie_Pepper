2007-08-20T12:08:00.000Z	NemesisD		can anyone help me with ssh? i can ping the target machine but I cannot connect or telnet, it times out\
2007-08-20T12:09:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	ssh and telnet are different... are you trying to ssh, or to telnet?
2007-08-20T12:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	i tried telnet because someone who was helping me earlier asked me to try it and then left
2007-08-20T12:09:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	if ssh server is installed, and you're trying to connect to the correct port - then check the firewall setting on the server
2007-08-20T12:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	22 is set to forward on his firewall, through a router, we are in different states
2007-08-20T12:10:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	ah i see. so, what happens when you try "ssh <his ip> 22" or "telnet <his ip> 22" ?
2007-08-20T12:11:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	just times out, no rejection messages, no nothing?
2007-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	just sits there right then times out
2007-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	can he connect to his own machine? has he tried - just to make sure it works?
2007-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	i believe it might be his only linux computer
2007-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	he should try both a "ssh localhost", and a "ssh <his lan ip>" and a "ssh <his wan ip>" and see if any of that works
2007-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	he doesn't need another computer to try :)
2007-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	ok im going to have him do that, btw what does it mean if i do that to myself and 22 is refused
2007-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	technically i'm the client so im assuming thats why
2007-08-20T12:16:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	well, if you do an "ssh localhost" yourself, and it's refused, it's because you are not running an ssh server on your machine.
2007-08-20T12:17:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	he's the one that should be doing it, to test whether his ssh server is operational
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	the authenticity of the localhost could not be established
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	test in steps: ssh localhost tests whether server is up at all. ssh <lan ip> tests if the server is listening on his net interface as it should. ssh <wan ip> tests whether the router is forwarding things along properly. that way you can isolate the problem
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	is that what he says he gets when he tries ssh localhost?
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	yep
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	the thing about authenticity, and maybe about accepting a new key?
2008-12-20T00:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	NemesisD	run "gnome-panel" from the terminal?
2008-12-20T00:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	therealnanotube	says a panel is already running. when you kill it, it instantly respons the proc but i can't see the panel anywhere
