2009-08-24T08:54:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	sudo aptitude install bridge-utils
2009-08-24T08:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Use Network Manager (nm-applet) on your Notification Area and create a new connection.
2009-08-24T08:56:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	It's on Notification Area -- Where you can see "Wireless/Wired Connection" icon.
2009-08-24T08:56:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Edit Connection.  Create a new one. Name it "Bridging" and check out IPv4 -- Set the method to --> Shared to other computers.
2009-08-24T08:57:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Ya.
2009-08-24T09:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Working?
2009-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Type "leaf" and use TAB to autocomplete my nickname so I get highlighted messages.
2009-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Did you set up a new connection? "Bridging" --> Shared to other computer under IPv4 setting?
2009-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	That's it. :3
2009-08-24T09:23:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Hmm.
2009-08-24T09:23:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	Did you create a new connection?
2009-08-24T09:24:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	This all takes 5 minutes, really.  Make a new connection -- Name it "Bridging" --> Look in IPv4 setting.  Toggle on "Shared to other computer" and you're done.  Test the network.
2009-08-24T09:27:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	nation	You want a new setting connection in wired, not wireless.
2009-08-24T09:32:00.000Z	nation	leaf-sheep	 man tested it and the bridge works im using my laptop as a bridge for my x box cause im too poor to buy the wireless thingy haha it works but says its slow acting as a nat is there some firewall settings or ports i can open in ubuntu is there a firewall??
