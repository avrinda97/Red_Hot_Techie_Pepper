2006-04-02T12:54:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	do you have /etc/sudoers ?
2006-04-02T12:54:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	looking
2006-04-02T12:55:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	try dpkg-reconfigure sudo
2006-04-02T12:56:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	I dont have /etc/sudoers
2006-04-02T12:56:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	 the dpkg must b run as root
2006-04-02T12:56:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	definitely try `dpkg-reconfigure sudo`
2006-04-02T12:56:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	hmmm... yeah.  haha
2006-04-02T12:57:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	ok, how is that done? have no root priv (having no sudo...)
2006-04-02T12:57:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	that's tough.  might have to reboot into single-user mode.
2006-04-02T12:57:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	I'll try, thanx!
2006-04-02T13:06:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	ok I have /etc/sudoers and still have the same sudo problem. I do belive I destroyed my /etc/hosts...
2006-04-02T13:08:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	r u with me?
2006-04-02T13:15:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	sorry, was working on something.  you don't have an /etc/hosts file?
2006-04-02T13:16:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	got help from _jason , working on it, thanx!
2006-04-02T13:17:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	oh, cool.  was it /etc/hosts ?
2006-04-02T13:18:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	_jason : ok, the sudo problem is fixed (adding the localhost to /etc/host) but that's the only line I have there. shouldn't there be anything else (it used to be much longer filled with fe00:: ... and so on
2006-04-02T13:26:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	_jason last problem for this evening: when I unmount my usb-disk its link-light does not go off. any ideas?
2006-04-02T13:27:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	i don't know for sure about that... my guess is that when you dismount it linux is leaving the power to the port on.
2006-04-02T13:27:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	mine's the same way in linux.
2006-04-02T13:27:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	how can u tell it was umounted correctly?
2006-04-02T13:28:00.000Z	lullabud	curley_sue	`mount` or `tail /var/log/syslog` or `dmesg` ?
2006-04-02T13:34:00.000Z	curley_sue	lullabud	_jason I'll appreciate u taking look at this outputs (after 'umount /media/Flash_disk/) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10997
