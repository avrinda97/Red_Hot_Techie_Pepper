2008-07-28T03:49:00.000Z	mlLK		when running a virtual machine are the guest's drivers irrelevant?
2008-07-28T03:50:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	no they are needed to use things like dynamic display size and pulse-audio interaction work properly
2008-07-28T03:50:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	so the host takes care of everything?
2008-07-28T03:51:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	as far as hardware
2008-07-28T03:51:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	in most VM software you set up the host, install the guest then in the guest environment setup the drivers
2008-07-28T03:53:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	what about laptops
2008-07-28T03:53:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	windows is running naked w/o its hp drivers
2008-07-28T03:54:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	you dont need to worry about the HP drivers, you need to install the host drivers, remeber the guest OS boesnt know what hardware its running in, it only sees the host environment and therefore things the host (or virtual machine) is real hardware and therefore needs the host drivers
2008-07-28T03:56:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	i see; it's like a bloated app
2008-07-28T03:57:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	what as far as my memory?
2008-07-28T03:58:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	the VM will reserve a portion of memory determined by you for the VM client to use
2008-07-28T04:01:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	vm is not a good solution for gaming
2008-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	dustrial ya wine seems to cover it pretty well
2008-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	dustrial haven't really ventured there yet tho
2008-07-28T04:03:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	i have found wine very hit and miss, some apps are really good, some not so,
2008-07-28T04:04:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	i'm only running 80gigs and dual-booting was just a waste of time for school work
2008-07-28T04:05:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	it sucks cuz i have all sorts of space on my desktop, but always get my laptop the way i want everything setup
2008-07-28T04:05:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	i guess if you were seeking a VM solution using windows as a host and ubuntu as guest may be viable,
2008-07-28T04:06:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	windows is boring
2008-07-28T04:08:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	i was using cygwin for quite awhile, but, it, is still not nearly as complete
2008-07-28T04:14:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	c is pretty portable, so if yu have the source code you can recompile...anyway i guess the subject is at rest now we have determined VM is not a suitable gaming solution]
2008-07-28T04:17:00.000Z	mlLK	koshari	ya i'm actually suprised there isn't an entry for virtualbox yet on ubuntuguide
2008-07-28T04:24:00.000Z	koshari	mlLK	vmware was so streigt forward it hardly need a guide, the only gotcha i came across was not setting the sound to pulseaudio as it grabbed the also and wouldnt share it
