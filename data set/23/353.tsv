2011-11-15T21:13:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook		hey. i'm trying to maintain a repository for lucid and for other versions (natty, oneiric). I have now build my deb for the 3, but problem is if i put them all with reprepro, the deb name conflicts. what's does experience dictate? will it overwrite the old ones? (i.e. the blah.deb for lucid with the blah.deb for oneiric)
2011-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	putting a 11.10 deb overwrite a 10.10 deb should not be done
2011-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	what is the proper way for mixing versions?
2011-11-15T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	you should never mix versions like that
2011-11-15T21:13:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	what do you mean?
2011-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	you are not meant to mix versions, it makes your system unusable/unstable
2011-11-15T21:15:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	i want to avoid this, but most guides refer to maintaining only a one-version repository (i.e. do this and you get a lucid one, and hey, you can also set multiple if you want)
2011-11-15T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	I don't know what guides you are using, but they are wrong, versions should be seperate, a seperate repo for each ubuntu version
2011-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	i don't understand how then the standard ubuntu distro has for lucid: "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted" and for oneiric: "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric main restricted"
2011-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	they are different repos, just one server
2011-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	look lucid/oneiric, 2 different repos
2011-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	if you look, they are two seperate repos
2011-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	they are just hosted on the same server
2011-11-15T21:35:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	i'm looking at the source differences from the debian folders between natty and lucid for this deb, and there is nothing but a changelog entry in the launchpad repos i pulled from to build my deb (well, i need a different version of it, and also to distribute it internally to my "friends")
2011-11-15T21:36:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	the actual source won't be the same as they are the same versions, but the end package will be different
2011-11-15T21:38:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	not sure if you noticed my questions above :)
2011-11-15T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	they don't, they are in TWO REPOS
2011-11-15T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	they are two different packages in 2 different repos
2011-11-15T21:48:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	here's the scenario: bzr checkout lp:ubuntu/lucid/poco && cd poco && dpkg-buildpackage, which gives me say libpoco-dev_1.3.6p1-1_amd64.deb built for lucid. next if I bzr checkout lp:ubuntu/natty/poco, i get the exact same deb, this time built for natty (different odbc), i.e. libpoco-dev_1.3.6p1-1_amd64.deb . If i now run reprepro on the lucid one, it works, and next the natty .deb is conflicting with the lucid one. how does ubuntu handle
2011-11-15T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	CMoH-notebook	I'll be with your shortly, just a little busy
2011-11-15T21:49:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	ty
2011-11-15T22:26:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	i've figured it out: the -0ubuntu1- (or similar cryptic suffixes that avoid name conflicts) are controlled via the changelog
2011-11-15T22:26:00.000Z	CMoH-notebook	ikonia	thanks for your help :)
