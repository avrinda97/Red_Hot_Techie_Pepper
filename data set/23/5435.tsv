2007-09-24T12:03:00.000Z	sethk	genii	macogw, it's perfectly possible to configure something so numpad + works and normal + does not.  The commands to scroll through X resolutions work this way on a standard keyboard.
2007-11-27T09:00:00.000Z	sethk	genii	no, no, you have to use a blow torch
2007-11-27T09:00:00.000Z	genii	sethk	, phrantik You may have a point
2008-01-11T10:30:00.000Z	genii	sethk	There is gaim and not pidgin in 7.04
2008-01-11T10:32:00.000Z	sethk	genii	it has been available for ages; why was it removed from the repostories, do you know?
2008-01-11T10:33:00.000Z	genii	sethk	Perhaps now it is available in backports. But afaik still gaim is standard in feisty, pidgin in gutsy
2008-01-19T09:44:00.000Z	genii	sethk	I got lost in scroll. Is his issue that he has 2 screens overlaid?
2008-01-19T09:45:00.000Z	sethk	genii	I don't think so, but I could be confused also.  :)
2008-01-19T09:47:00.000Z	genii	sethk	Just because I saw someone earlier with that but could not recall who. Then it happened to my friend here, what it turned out to be is he put the dvi out and the vga out cords from his dual-head adapter both at once into his lcd panel which has also both plugs
2008-01-19T09:47:00.000Z	sethk	genii	that shouldn't actually kill the file system, but then again, who knows?
2008-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	genii	sethk	From his latest post he is not the guy (who was having console screen superimposed ghostlike over his dsktop)
2008-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	sethk	genii	k
2008-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	sethk	genii	in general, that's not true
2008-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	sethk	genii	in general, between two partitions is better
2008-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	sethk	genii	because the average head travel time is greatly reduced
2008-01-22T08:32:00.000Z	sethk	genii	many systems deliberately use centered partitions for swap
2008-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	genii	sethk	Traditionally the start of drive, because access times are slightly shorter there. but since swap partition gets a lot of hard use. So if it starts degrading the drive and positioned at end of one active os partition or beginning of an active os partition it's less damaging
2008-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	sethk	genii	well, in modern systems swap is rarely heavily used.  Nevertheless, you are wrong
2008-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	sethk	genii	even if heavily used, seek time greatly dwarfs other factors
2008-03-08T01:00:00.000Z	sethk	genii	you can link to the entire drive
2008-03-08T01:00:00.000Z	sethk	genii	you just need to use an offset to skip the first track
2008-03-08T01:00:00.000Z	genii	sethk	Hmm, haven't attempted that
2008-03-08T01:01:00.000Z	sethk	genii	simple.   losetup /dev/loop/0 /filename
