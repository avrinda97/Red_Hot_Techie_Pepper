2011-01-08T16:15:00.000Z	hovefirse		Sorry for nagging...but is it at all possible to install a package for a previous release? An LL-package to MM?
2011-01-08T16:16:00.000Z	hovefirse		PoshePocket: Try cat /etc/issue
2011-01-08T16:17:00.000Z	hovefirse		Of course, I'd like to do it automagically, through apt-get
2011-01-08T16:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	that's dependent on it's dependancies
2011-01-08T16:18:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	It's a plugin to VDR (a video recorder), so methinks it should be quite safe...
2011-01-08T16:18:00.000Z	hovefirse		What would I need to tweak to install it with apt-get?
2011-01-08T16:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	you can set pin in synaptic to set a version of a package you want to keep or move to
2011-01-08T16:19:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	Where di I do that (I run my server in terminal mode - no GUI).
2011-01-08T16:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
2011-01-08T16:20:00.000Z	hovefirse		sacarson: Cheers!
2011-01-08T16:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	it can be done in apt-get also
2011-01-08T16:21:00.000Z	hovefirse		sacarson: "Pinning is a process that allows you to remain on a stable release of Ubuntu (or any other debian system) while grabbing packages from a more recent version." But I'd like to grab packages from *earlier* versions...same procedure, anyway?
2011-01-08T16:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	I guess worst case you run with both repositories in your list but not very wise in my opinion
2011-01-08T16:24:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	Doing it temporarily? Just while installing the desired package, then removing the old repo?
2011-01-08T16:24:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	Would that feel safer...?
2011-01-08T16:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	I guess you could just download the deb file and try load it and find what dependinses you end up seeing at install with dpkg
2011-01-08T16:25:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	Probably smarter...I'm not too familiar with that process...any walkthroughs on the net you'd recommend?
2011-01-08T16:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	you sure just the pinning won't work?
2011-01-08T16:27:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	No, never done it - I just quoted the link you sent me.
2011-01-08T16:27:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	But, experimenting is half the fun! I'll start by downloading the .deb-file and fool around with it!
2011-01-08T16:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	hovefirse	in my case danger experiments I keep in virtualbox,  I just delete them after I have my fun with an idea
2011-01-08T16:29:00.000Z	hovefirse	sacarlson	Probably clever - but this is just a plugin to an application I use, so I consider it somewhat safe...
