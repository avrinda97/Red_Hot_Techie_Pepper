2007-03-17T06:56:00.000Z	BigLebowski		dhval: whats wrong with gcc on edgy?
2007-03-17T06:56:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	^^
2007-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	I've had no problems compiling under edgy, after installing build-essential that is
2007-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	well, my kernel locked up
2007-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	i downgraded to gcc-3.4 and compiled, and there were no issues
2007-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	i have no idea, I'm using a previously compiled kernel, so i dunno about kernel compilation under edgy
2007-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	but my apps compile fine under edgy :-/
2007-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	OTOH, gcc on FC 6 (4.1.x), i had no issues
2007-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	i have not had any app compile problems. well, the kernel is quite tricky
2007-03-17T06:59:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	don't want unwanted compiler optimizations
2007-03-17T06:59:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	fair enough, i'll try compiling a kernel later.
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	one of them being gcc :)
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	what i basically meant was that it is far simpler to develop on linux as you have far more *standard* tools available.. eg, gcc
2007-03-17T07:21:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	is it possible to apply the ubuntu patches to a vanilla kernel?
2007-03-17T07:21:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	it is, but it is a major pain
2007-03-17T07:22:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	so not worth it then?
2007-03-17T07:22:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	well, you can use the morton kernels, those are bleeding edge
2007-03-17T07:22:00.000Z	BigLebowski	dhaval	ehh ok, i should just cry 'DIFF!!!"
2007-03-17T07:23:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	:)
2007-03-17T07:33:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	ok, if someone can help me here. after completing the apt-get install downloads, is it normal for it to remain stuck at 99% [Working]  ?
2007-03-17T07:33:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	just to attract attention :)
2007-03-17T07:34:00.000Z	dhaval	BigLebowski	enyc any ideas how do debug it
