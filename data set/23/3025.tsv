2009-09-03T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	install apache2
2009-09-03T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	you can then portforward port 80 to the apache service on your PC and the page will show when people web browse to you ip address
2009-09-03T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	you will need to configure virtual server / port forwarding
2009-09-03T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	it varys wildly from router to router, you will have to RTFM
2009-09-03T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	read the fat manual
2009-09-03T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	rtfm == read the fat manual
2009-09-03T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	great, now setup the port forward in your router to the apache service and you have a web server
2009-09-03T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	ok then PM me the name and I will attempt to connect to the service if you like?
2009-09-03T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	it resolves to 118.137.40.78 here
2009-09-03T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	have you had the account at dydns long?

2009-09-03T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	port 80 TCP to the port you are running apache on?
2009-09-03T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	if you browse: http://localhost
2009-09-03T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	do you get a page?
2009-09-03T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	ok and did you tell it to forward to the IP of your we serving system?
2009-09-03T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	this is why the manual is useful
2009-09-03T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	great move
2009-09-03T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	and you told the router to forward all requests on port 90 to .1.138 port 80
2009-09-03T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bong	ok and is apache running?
