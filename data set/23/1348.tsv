2010-05-07T05:17:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	with 2gb would there be any benefit really on 64bit?
2010-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	sure, there is more than just being able to use >4GiB of RAM
2010-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	I haven't used 64 bit in a good while, so I am asking like?
2010-05-07T05:20:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	some of the technical stuff is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit#32-_vs_64-bit
2010-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	also, see Pros and Cons on that wiki page
2010-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	is there a flash problem on 64bit? you would know since your on it?
2010-05-07T05:22:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	I'm not having any problems with the flash version in the repos. Occasionally, clicks are screwy and don't work on YouTube and things
2010-05-07T05:22:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	but YMMV I suppose
2010-05-07T05:22:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	okay I am going to give 64bit a shot, but going to install the minimal one, that way I can use my trusty openbox lol
2010-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	Yeah, I don't really have any software that I can't use, it's fast, my hardware is alright, give it a shot
2010-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	well my machine is a core 2 duo, 2gb ram, so good 64 bit or bad performance wise you think?
2010-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	that's all mine is, except I have 3gb ram, it's quick
2010-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	okay well wish me luck here I go lol...bbiab
2010-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	do you have your /home separate?
2010-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	no but I have everything like my downloads stuff I need etc on a different partition on the drive.
2010-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	consider separating /home because it'll make your settings and everything really easy if you reinstall
2010-05-07T05:25:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	okay I will remember that, bbiab going to give this a shot
2010-05-07T05:25:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	good luck
2010-05-07T05:25:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	thanks
2010-05-07T07:52:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	Well in 64bit, just having a little trouble getting gnome-do to run besides that all working so far lol
2010-05-07T07:55:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	cool.
2010-05-07T07:55:00.000Z	h00k	UbuntuJeff	and I know gnome-do should work, I'm using it now ;)
2010-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	h00k	yeah but are you on openbox?
