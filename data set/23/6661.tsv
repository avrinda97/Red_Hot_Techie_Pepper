2006-05-02T11:51:00.000Z	mzuverink		how do I map gcc to version 3.4.5, currently it is 4.0?
2006-05-02T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	sudo apt-get install gcc-3.4
2006-05-02T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	then export CC=gcc-3.4
2006-05-02T11:56:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	it reports that the export CC=gcc-3.4 does not exist
2006-05-02T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	did you ``sudo apt-get install gcc-3.4''?
2006-05-02T11:57:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	and then you typed ``export CC=gcc-3.4''?
2006-05-02T11:57:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	pastebin the output from ``gcc-3.4 -v''
2006-05-02T11:58:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	I sudo'd it, that was my mistake, it is working now, thank you
2006-05-02T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	np
2006-06-19T10:35:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	we backport stuff to 2.6.15. No new versions will go into the pool proper, so it won't ever "catch up."
2006-06-19T10:35:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	 Any idea if the EFI bug regarding ipod will be resolved?
2006-06-19T10:36:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	bug #?
2006-06-19T10:36:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	37163
2006-06-19T10:40:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	in what timeframe, I don't know.
2006-06-19T10:40:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	Cant use my ipod at all,  very disturbing
2006-06-19T10:40:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	meaning you /have/ to use a hub?
2006-06-19T10:41:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	there are more pressing reasons why EFI /has/ to be enabled
2006-06-19T10:42:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	mean that no matter how I mount it, directly to a usb2 port or a hub I get I/O errors and I end up having to forcefully unplug the ipod when mounted to get it to unmount
2006-06-19T10:43:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	welp, that's a pretty tough spot to be in. With the rest of the devs in Paris (or on their way), I can't say "it will be fixed by X"
2006-06-19T10:43:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	the ipod mounts fine, but any attempt to read/write to it causes i/o errors to get logged and the ipod is useless
2007-01-11T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	(you could just pull them from a loopback-mounted knoppix iso)
2007-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	mzuverink	crimsun	thanks, Ill try that
2007-03-19T16:30:00.000Z	crimsun	mzuverink	ex falso.
