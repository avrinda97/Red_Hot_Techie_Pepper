2005-08-05T06:25:00.000Z	vader1102		I may try a mac g3 desktop, any suggestions on how to install Linux on it?
2005-08-05T06:25:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Is is a beige one?
2005-08-05T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	With pain.
2005-08-05T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Those guys (I think) don't support booting from the Ubuntu CD.
2005-08-05T06:27:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Well...
2005-08-05T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	That would be a great idea if there as a bootable floppy image on the CD.
2005-08-05T06:30:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Do you have the ppc install cd yet?
2005-08-05T06:30:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Most people tend to eventually settle on either vim OR emacs.
2005-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	That went to the wrong person.
2005-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Do you have the ppc install cd yet?
2005-08-05T06:33:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Ah ok. Well, first get the install cd, see if it'll boot. if not, you will need a MacOS install CD as well.
2005-08-05T06:34:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	Plan B involved a tool called BootX.
2005-08-05T06:34:00.000Z	cafuego	vader1102	OS8 is fine.
2005-08-31T15:39:00.000Z	vader1102	cafuego	do I type that in?
