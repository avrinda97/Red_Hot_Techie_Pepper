2012-11-14T04:06:00.000Z	blackness		ive already tested VIA LiveCD..
2012-11-14T04:06:00.000Z	blackness		and i played 3Hrs of mp3s...this didnt happen till i went 12.04->12.10
2012-11-14T04:08:00.000Z	blackness		is there a newer kernel i can test? how far back can 12.10 go?
2012-11-14T04:09:00.000Z	blackness		i like 12.10..but how would i downgrade?
2012-11-14T04:09:00.000Z	blackness		eep! ill stay with 12.10 and wait for a LTS
2012-11-14T04:10:00.000Z	blackness		8 minutes? using what method?
2012-11-14T04:11:00.000Z	blackness		ill just stay with 12.10. where would i check alsa/kernel ?
2012-11-14T04:11:00.000Z	blackness		i cannt wait for 13.04
2012-11-14T04:13:00.000Z	blackness		so next LTS is 2yrs away? but the next rls is 13.04 ?
2012-11-14T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	18 months away; yes
2012-11-14T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	you should say how you are trynig
2012-11-14T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	so what key are you pressing?
2012-11-14T06:48:00.000Z	blackness	jrib	the volume up key
2012-11-14T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	are you sure that's recognized as XF86AuidoRaiseVolume?
2012-11-14T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	"but it looked funny"?
2012-11-14T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	yeah, kill xbindkeys.  Though that probably means it's working :)
2012-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	try /usr/bin/amixer instead of just amixer
2012-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	also, get rid of the semicolon
2012-11-14T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	no problem
2012-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	now use espeak to have some keys say random things
2012-11-14T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	haha my officemate loves them I'm sure
2012-11-18T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	blackness	no
