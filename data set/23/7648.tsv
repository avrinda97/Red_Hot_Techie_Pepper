2005-11-28T14:01:00.000Z	paganini		I wonder if anyone can help me to eject my DVD drive. :)
2005-11-28T14:01:00.000Z	paganini		I'm running Breezy now, but it did this in Hoary as well.
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		When I put a DVD or CD in the drive it mounts fine, and a little icon appears on my desktop that allows me to do intersting things with my DVD
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		But if I right click on that icon and tell it to "eject"
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		It says unable to eject media.
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		And tells me I have to be root
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		Obviously, in ubuntu, I can't be root.
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	paganini		So, is there anyway to get the icon to work right, or am I gonna have to keep doing sudo umount in a terminal to get my discs out of the drive?
2005-11-28T14:04:00.000Z	paganini		I have a symlink /media/cdrom0
2005-11-28T14:04:00.000Z	paganini		And a /dev/dvd
2005-11-28T14:05:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	also try 'sudo eject /dev/<cdrom device>' , that also works
2005-11-28T14:05:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	then?
2005-11-28T14:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	it works for me
2005-11-28T14:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	which icon? gnome?
2005-11-28T14:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	did you mount it as root?
2005-11-28T14:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	or did you use pmount (the right answer)?
2005-11-28T14:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	can you try this thing for me. Right click on your panel, and add drive mount applet
2005-11-28T14:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	gnome-volume-manager
2005-11-28T14:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	no, gnome-volume-manager , no volume-control
2005-11-28T14:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	type gnome-volume-manager in a terminal
2005-11-28T14:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	then apt-get install gnome-volume-manager
2005-11-28T14:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	it's weird, it should have been there by default
2005-11-28T14:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	paganini	well, as long as it works :)
