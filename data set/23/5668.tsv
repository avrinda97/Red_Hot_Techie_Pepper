2006-10-14T07:50:00.000Z	edouard_		Hello all! Do we have any certified linux gurus online at this time?
2006-10-14T07:51:00.000Z	edouard_		Because I have a *hard* question :-)
2006-10-14T07:52:00.000Z	edouard_		I've got a *very* old linux binary I wish to run under ubuntu 6.06. Under Red Hat (a couple of years ago) all I had to do was install libc 5 (including libm 5) and version 1 of the dynamic runtime linker.
2006-10-14T07:53:00.000Z	edouard_		I tried this under ubuntu, and the executable just seg faults straight away.
2006-10-14T07:53:00.000Z	edouard_		I tried running ldd on the binary, and *that* seg faulted.
2006-10-14T07:53:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	you can't install glibc in ubuntu, for some reason, ubuntu doesn't like it when you try
2006-10-14T07:55:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	Why not? Is it a kernel problem?
2006-10-14T07:55:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	no, glibc is statically linked, you can't change it
2006-10-14T07:56:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	That's doesn't sound like it relates to my problem. The kernel should load the runtime linker to load my binary - glibc shouldn't get involved at all.
2006-10-14T07:56:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	I thought you said you wanted to replace glibc
2006-10-14T07:56:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	I've installed libc5 already on my machine
2006-10-14T07:58:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	The problem is, even with the old libc5 and ld-linux1 I get a seg fault as soon as I try to run the binary.
2006-10-14T07:58:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	ldd seg faults when trying to list the dependancies of the binary.
2006-10-14T07:58:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	do the libc's conflict?
2006-10-14T07:59:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	I can't see how. They should install side by side as they have different names and versions
2006-10-14T07:59:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	just asking
2006-10-14T07:59:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	might I ask what you're trying to run?
2006-10-14T08:01:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	The fraunhofer mp3 encoder from circa 1997. I've encoded all my music with it for the last 8 years and wish to continue to do so.
2006-10-14T08:01:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	LAME *cough*
2006-10-14T08:01:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	Why it doesn't want to run it the issue I'm interested in.
2006-10-14T08:02:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	Yes, but I don't want to use LAME. I'm happy with the fraunhofer one.
2006-10-14T08:03:00.000Z	edouard_	anon32	Are there any resources on running old binaries under ubuntu? Like I said, this worked on fedora core, ooo, 2 I think, just fine.
2006-10-14T08:03:00.000Z	anon32	edouard_	dunno...
