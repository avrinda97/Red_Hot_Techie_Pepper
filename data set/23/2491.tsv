2010-08-05T07:13:00.000Z	antonio_		I'm going nuts..trying to transfer some files from my old lappy that is pretty muched effed up...
2010-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	antonio_		I can't burn a dvd...and I can't get files onto either flash drive (error reading from file: input/output error)
2010-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	antonio_		is there any kind of quick fix to get around this?
2010-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	Transfer across the network.
2010-08-05T07:16:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	a few gigs shouldn't take very long to copy using a samba share.
2010-08-05T07:17:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	unfortunately, I can't help with setting that up, because I'm here looking for help with that.
2010-08-05T07:18:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	that depends on the machines involved, but that usually would take me at most 15 minutes.
2010-08-05T07:25:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	what do you mean by "fix"?  What's wrong with it?
2010-08-05T07:26:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	what filesystem is it?
2010-08-05T07:28:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	if you're getting i/o errors from that drive, you need to check the filesystem for errors, and that's done differently on some filesystems
2010-08-05T07:30:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	mount (with no args/options)
2010-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	ProfOak: inability to sudo could really screw you.
2010-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	are you using a livecd?
2010-08-05T07:34:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	also, do you have or can you make one?
2010-08-05T07:34:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	can you make one
2010-08-05T07:35:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	That what I'm trying to tell you!
2010-08-05T07:37:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	without sudo working properly in your installed system, live-cd is the only reliable option.
2010-08-05T07:40:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	it works like any other ubuntu installation.  plug in your external.  the old drive should be listed in your places menu.  You should be able to click it to automatically mount and open it
2010-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	what type of filesystem is it?
2010-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	stop the copying for now
2010-08-05T07:46:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	it sounds like your disk is physically damaged.  if those files are important, you should consider taking it to a specialist.
2010-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	probably.  the proplem seems to be the drive, so i wouldn't expect it to work for any destination.
2010-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	Tecna	antonio_	if you're not willing to pay a specialist to recover the data, and it's not vital data, just copy in small chunks, shutting down after a minute of two to let it cool.  The drive will self-destruct if you keep using it, so if you do use it, only use it to very carefully back up the data
