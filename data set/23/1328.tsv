2010-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	iceroot	jvizzle	that has nothing to do with 64bit
2010-05-30T14:33:00.000Z	iceroot	jvizzle	with pae the system can adress more then 4gb of ram, but only 1.8gb for  a process
2010-05-30T14:38:00.000Z	jvizzle	iceroot	i ask because prior they had 64 available to download.
2010-05-30T14:38:00.000Z	iceroot	jvizzle	yes a real 64bit system can adress more then 4gb ram, with pae you can also adress more then 4gb ram but only 1.8gb for a single process
2010-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	jvizzle	iceroot	is a version that is needed?
