2006-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	if i try to install mozilla-mplayer then apt-get also install mplayer-386 (I dont want mplayer-386)
2006-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	then install mplayer-686 or mplayer-k7 first
2006-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	i did.
2006-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	it shouldn't do that then
2006-05-05T09:30:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	how do you know? have you tried it?
2006-05-05T09:30:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	instructions tell me that mplayer-plugin WILL NOT work with 1.0.8
2006-05-05T09:31:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	ignore them
2006-05-05T09:32:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	u sure? have u tried this?
2006-05-05T09:32:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	http://mplayerplug-in.sourceforge.net/install.php#plugin
2006-05-05T09:34:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	so I can actually apt-get the mplayerplugin then.. The thing is ..if I do...then it will ALSO get mplayer-386. And i dont want mplayer-386. Is there a way to NOT get mplayer-386?
2006-05-05T09:34:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	just the mplayer plugin.
2006-05-05T09:35:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	for me, if you get mplayer-686 or mplayer-k7, the 386 version isn't pulled in
2006-05-05T09:36:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	hmm.. for me it's a different story. I typed: apt-get install mplayer-mozilla and BAM! it tells me it will install mplayer-386.
2006-05-05T09:37:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	you're on breezy, right?
2006-05-05T09:37:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	breezy 5.10 i believe.
2006-05-05T09:38:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	are you using the apt-get or synaptic?
2006-05-05T09:38:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	apt-get BUT if Synaptic can select ONLY mplayer mozilla plugin then by all means.
2006-05-05T09:39:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	i was thinking the opposite
2006-05-05T09:40:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	hmm right now... it wants to install mplayer-386 no matter what. I compiled mplayer a while ago my own way...and it works perfectly. I dont want ubuntu's compiled mplayer.
2006-05-05T09:41:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	btw do u know how to clear apt-get memory of what packages it wants to install ?
2006-05-05T09:41:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	oh. i thought you installed one of ubuntu's other compiled mplayer pkgs. you're SOL, then
2006-05-05T09:41:00.000Z	sharpy	sn9	it seems whenever i type apt-get install anyprogram it wants to isntall other programs like mplayer-386, firefox-dev etc... no relevance to xmms.
2006-05-05T09:42:00.000Z	sn9	sharpy	sudo apt-get -f remove
