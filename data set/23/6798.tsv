2006-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	tar -zxvf <name of tar file>
2006-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	thank you
2006-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Of course, you might have to add sudo to that (sudo tar -zxvf <name of tar file>
2006-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	no, looks fine
2006-01-03T08:35:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	i opened the tar.gz but don't know which one to execute. And how ? is it ./filename? that hasn't worked with any of the ones i'v e tried
2006-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Buh?
2006-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Explain your problem. I didn't get it.
2006-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	i've opened the tar.gz like you said. Now i don't know how to proceed. i tried ./ filename but i'm getting constant errors back
2006-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Have you tried ./configure? If you're trying to install something, ./configure is usually what you do.
2006-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	try './configure' , then 'make', then
2006-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	i tarred ies4linux-1.3.3.tar.gz
2006-01-03T08:42:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	So it's extracted?
2006-01-03T08:43:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Now, cd that folder.
2006-01-03T08:43:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	yes, i did tar -zxvf like you said and it appears extracted
2006-01-03T08:43:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	run ls to see what folder was created.
2006-01-03T08:43:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	yes, did that i see in green ies4linux
2006-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	In green?
2006-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	yes, first in blue in /downloads next to the tar ball. Then when i ls ies4linux it is there in green along with a couple other folders
2006-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Okay, it's not a folder, so try 'ies4linux'
2006-01-03T08:45:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Yeah, what trappist said.
2006-01-03T08:47:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Malachi	thank you. It's getting there now. :)
2006-01-03T08:48:00.000Z	Malachi	sophtpaw	Mhmm...sorry, wasn't really concentrating (trying to fix Samba). Sorry if I confused you.
