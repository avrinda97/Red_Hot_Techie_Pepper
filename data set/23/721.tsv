2011-05-10T23:23:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	 reinstall grub
2011-05-10T23:24:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	 and this time to the primary drive's MBR
2011-05-10T23:24:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	What do you mean?
2011-05-10T23:29:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Show us your grub config file so we can see if it looks ok.
2011-05-10T23:29:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	pastebinit /etc/default/grub
2011-05-10T23:29:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	And send resulting RUL
2011-05-10T23:35:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	sudo update-grub
2011-05-10T23:35:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	done that :/
2011-05-10T23:37:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit  #And show us resulting URL
2011-05-10T23:39:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Oh, I see now that you have Linux on the primary disk and MS Windows on the slave drive.  There is no way to fix it.  You are stuck.  The only thing you can do is to use the F12 key or what ever to switch the drive the PC boots to.
2011-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	woah, hold on, are you saying I could just hit f12 to switch?
2011-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Sorry, but the limitation is particular to MS Windows, (MS Windows is limited and can only boot from primary drive).
2011-05-10T23:41:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Probably, it that option is enabled in your BIOS.  Not all have that feature but a lot of them do.
2011-05-10T23:41:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	my bios is quite old though...
2011-05-10T23:42:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Well, the F12 thing has been around for some time now.  You can look and see.  But the problem you have can not be fixed with grub.
2011-05-10T23:42:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	okay, thanks. :)
2011-05-10T23:43:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	Alternately, you could change the drives around so that the MS Windows drive is primary and the Ubuntu drive is slave. But if you do that, there will be a number of things in the Ubuntu configs that will need to be changed so that it will boot and run right.
2011-05-10T23:43:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	but try the F12 thing first.
2011-05-10T23:44:00.000Z	usr13	mang0	I don't know
2012-07-23T11:53:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	The only other stick I've got is 2GB, is that large enough?
2012-07-23T12:04:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	fishbait, kristof: Fixed it!
2012-07-23T12:05:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	fishbait, kristof: I had to turn on "USB Legacy Support" which is supoosed to be on by default
2012-07-23T12:07:00.000Z	mang0	usr13	Yeah apparantly so. Everything was so simple in my old MB's BIOS! :)
