2005-04-05T09:58:00.000Z	kkathman		one other, I'm sure very simple question, how would I go about making Opera my default browser, as opposed to what it is set to now, which is firefox?
2005-04-05T09:59:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	system->preferences->preferred apps
2005-04-05T10:00:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	thats in Gnome I suppose, and Im running XFCE :(
2005-04-22T10:54:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	in the grub set up, but the init level
2005-04-22T10:55:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	well I checked the inittab and my default level is 2, and my system boots into KDE right now.. Im doing another box that will default to gnome
2005-04-22T10:55:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	wait...by grub setup i meant menu.lst
2005-04-22T10:55:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	so, which file do I edit ?
2005-04-22T10:56:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	where is menu.lst??
2005-04-22T10:56:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	locate menu.lst
2005-04-22T10:57:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	in the first entry (i.e. the kernel thats booted) add the init level to the "kernel" line
2005-04-22T10:59:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	no mention of gdm/kdm/xdm in that file
2005-04-22T11:00:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	thats correct
2005-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	all it should be is like "kernel  /vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-686 root=/dev/hda6 ro quiet splash 3" where 3 is the init leve
2005-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	I saw several instances (stanzas) of that kind of thing in that file
2005-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	yes, thats just for the different kernels youve installed/updated
2005-04-22T11:07:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	you can put it in all, or just the one you boot into
2005-04-22T11:09:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	thats a line
2005-04-22T11:09:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	no run level after the splash?
2005-04-22T11:09:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	yes, now add a "3" or whatever to the end of it
2005-04-22T11:10:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	and what does that do exactly?
2005-04-22T11:10:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	it makes it boot into non graphical mode? i dunno the specifics, exactly
2005-04-22T11:15:00.000Z	kkathman	kdp	thank you by the way for your help :)
2005-04-22T11:15:00.000Z	kdp	kkathman	no problem, i had the same question a month ago
