2012-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		I failed to start up the ubuntu 12.04 amd64 installation.
2012-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		The screen kept black.
2012-04-29T12:19:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		How to fix it?
2012-04-29T12:21:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		It keeps black.
2012-04-29T12:21:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		Xorg failed to startup.
2012-04-29T12:21:00.000Z	rba1988	namoamitabuddha	what's your video card?
2012-04-29T12:23:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	radeon
2012-04-29T12:23:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha		Radeon HD 5000
2012-04-29T12:24:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	any idea?
2012-04-29T12:24:00.000Z	rba1988	namoamitabuddha	can you get to a tty terminal?
2012-04-29T12:25:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	yes, I added "text" into grub parameter.
2012-04-29T12:25:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	fbdev also failed to work.
2012-04-29T12:25:00.000Z	rba1988		you can try reconfiguring Xorg from there.
2012-04-29T12:26:00.000Z	rba1988		creating a new xorg.conf file
2012-04-29T12:27:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	Xorg -test ?
2012-04-29T12:28:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	Which configuration should I do?
2012-04-29T12:28:00.000Z	rba1988	namoamitabuddha	backup your old xorg.conf first (mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak) then Xorg -config
2012-04-29T12:28:00.000Z	rba1988		it should create a new .conf file
2012-04-29T12:29:00.000Z	rba1988		correction: Xorg -configure
2012-04-29T12:33:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	There's no xorg.conf. I read /var/log/Xorg.0.log. "Bus error"
2012-04-29T12:34:00.000Z	rba1988	namoamitabuddha	maybe it's a different problem then. Not entirely sure. Maybe your video card or something. Are you doing a clean install?
2012-04-29T12:34:00.000Z	namoamitabuddha	rba1988	I'm just running the installation
2012-04-29T12:35:00.000Z	rba1988	namoamitabuddha	sorry not sure now. maybe other people can help. paste your specs of your machine including video card details.
