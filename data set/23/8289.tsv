2006-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	TC_		anyone in here know what partition grub should be installed on?
2006-09-11T12:05:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	what do you mean...do you mean the actual program grub itself, or the boot image?
2006-09-11T12:08:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	you don't actually have to chroot, grub will be able to acess the harddrives even without your ubutnu drive mounted...it has low level access
2006-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	all you need to do is tell grub which partition has your grub information (should be hd1,0) and what disk is you boot disk (should be hd0), and you're good
2006-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	yeah, it did
2006-09-11T12:13:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	i'll help you in pm
2006-09-11T12:16:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	you get my pm?
2006-09-11T12:16:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	nope
2006-09-11T12:19:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	grub makes not differentiation between sata and ata
2006-09-11T12:21:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	no
2006-09-11T12:22:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	yes.
2006-09-11T12:22:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	grub has access to your hardware at a low-level, so mounting, chroot, etc does not matter...if the live CD booted on your hardware, grub has access to that hardware
2006-09-11T12:23:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	i need to think about this a little bit though...so give me a minute
2006-09-11T12:25:00.000Z	sp0rk	TC_	no, your grub version does not matter.
