2007-11-29T21:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	hairulfr	It could be that you are just experiencing problem connencting to the repos. Could be temp. Have you connected before?
2007-11-29T21:14:00.000Z	hairulfr	Odd-rationale	Yeah, I've never had any problems before, might be because i've dabbled with my network settings today, but, still, everything else works...
