2005-09-14T08:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	cube?
2005-09-14T08:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	enemy territory? That would be et or wet iirc try apt-cache search wolfenstein
2005-09-14T09:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	Running with esd?
2005-09-14T09:01:00.000Z	mik3	BlueEagle	esd?
2005-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	enlightnment sound daemon (or something else starting with e)
2005-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	It's gnomes way of handling sound. (Some consider it an utter piece of crap though)
2005-09-14T09:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	I know it is installed. Just because it is installed doesn't mean you have to use it. :)
2005-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	system->preferences->sound uncheck "enable sound server at startup"
2005-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	mik3	BlueEagle	ok well, if it's installed then why is doom being a nimrod
2005-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	System->Preferences->Multimedia selector  Choose alsa instead of ESD
2005-09-14T09:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	Will probably disable the annoying beeps and burps gnome makes when you open or close a window but I consider that an added bonus. :)
2005-09-14T09:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	You might need to restart gnome.
2005-09-14T09:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	You didn't uncheck sound server? o.O
2005-09-14T09:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	Music will still play, however you might need to add support for restricted media like mp3 and other licensed codecs.
2005-09-14T09:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	You might need to restart gnome after disabling the sound server, yes.
2005-09-14T09:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	But as quinthius sais you shouldn't have to but knowing esd (evil sound daemon) you might need to.
2005-09-15T09:29:00.000Z	mik3	BlueEagle	: hello sir
2005-09-15T09:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mik3	Hello mik3. (and it's more dude than sir or madam I guess) :p
