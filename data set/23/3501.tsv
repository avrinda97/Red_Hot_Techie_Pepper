2008-04-02T07:23:00.000Z	nikrud	linkinxp	ah, that one is blacklisted, see http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist . It has instructions for ignoring the blacklist if you like

2008-04-02T07:36:00.000Z	nikrud	linkinxp	in   ccsm , general button, commands tab -> keybindings you have something bad in command line 1
2008-04-02T07:37:00.000Z	linkinxp	nikrud	 Checking for Xgl: not present.
2008-04-02T07:39:00.000Z	nikrud	linkinxp	yup, that's right. You need to try   SKIP_CHECKS=yes  compiz    in a terminal to test your card
