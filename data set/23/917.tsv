2011-02-03T06:54:00.000Z	induz		I have dual boot with Xp and Lucid, when i am on Lucid my HD starts sounding like a whiny
2011-02-03T06:55:00.000Z	minimec	induz	It may be that your HD is doing some indexing or so. That should be gone after 1-2 minutes. That could be one explanation.
2011-02-03T06:56:00.000Z	induz	minimec	it sounds like running faster
2011-02-03T06:57:00.000Z	induz	minimec	should i do correct it and how
2011-02-03T06:57:00.000Z	minimec	induz	Did you use that machine a little longer now? Do you still think it's running 'faster' after 10 minutes of use?
2011-02-03T06:57:00.000Z	induz	minimec	something is not right with the HD, but it runs smooth, with no sound on XP
2011-02-03T06:58:00.000Z	induz	minimec	 when i am on Lucid it makes sound as " OOOOOOOOO'...or maybe the fan runs faster
2011-02-03T06:59:00.000Z	induz	minimec	i have used it for short period like 10 min and 10 hrs too , but it makes the sound
2011-02-03T06:59:00.000Z	minimec	induz	fan may be an issue. GPU may use more power, specially on ATI I guess.
2011-02-03T07:01:00.000Z	induz	minimec	its not ATI  but nvidia
2011-02-03T07:01:00.000Z	induz	minimec	how can i control the sound of the fan/HD?
2011-02-03T07:03:00.000Z	minimec	induz	Do you use the nvidia-property driver? You may have a possibility to undervolt the GPU. YOu could also try to undertvolt CPU.
2011-02-03T07:03:00.000Z	induz	minimec	no properietey driver
2011-02-03T07:03:00.000Z	minimec	induz	Try to install these once. That may help.
2011-02-03T07:04:00.000Z	induz	minimec	how?
2011-02-03T07:05:00.000Z	minimec	induz	Try >system >administration >Additional drivers. The software will tell you, if there is a driver for your GPU.
2011-02-03T07:07:00.000Z	induz	minimec	there is no . additional Driver listed
2011-02-03T07:07:00.000Z	minimec	induz	Ok. Is that a rather old nvidia card?
2011-02-03T07:07:00.000Z	induz	minimec	yes its a old card with came with Dell dimension
2011-02-03T07:08:00.000Z	minimec	induz	still... I am surprised.
2011-02-03T07:09:00.000Z	induz	minimec	 still its making sound
2011-02-03T07:12:00.000Z	induz	minimec	linuxpusher_ bye for now
2011-02-03T07:12:00.000Z	minimec	induz	cu
