2007-10-24T19:25:00.000Z	gribouille		how can I get bash completion to work ?
2007-10-24T19:26:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	to find the package it belongs to do dpkg -S /path/to/file
2007-10-24T19:26:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	ok, thanks
2007-10-30T19:04:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	yes...
2007-10-30T19:04:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	but there should be one
2007-10-30T19:04:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	really?
2007-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	that's how repositories are built
2007-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	obviously not these ones
2007-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	do you know the structure of a repository ?
2007-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	I know the structure of those repositories works
2007-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	it doesn't work completely : I didt apt-get install opera, and then  apt-file update. but if I do apt-file search /usr/bin/opera, there is no output
2007-10-30T19:12:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	because opera isn't in the repos?
2007-10-30T19:13:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	it is in http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu
2007-10-30T19:13:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	did you add the parter repository?
2007-10-30T19:13:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	of course I did
2007-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	then how is gutsy proposed repo anything to do with your question?
2007-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	what ?
2007-10-30T19:15:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	you were asking about gusty-updates (not proposed sorry)
2007-10-30T19:17:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	when you install a package P with apt-get, P'files must be displayed by apt-file search P
2007-10-30T19:18:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	perhaps you are thinking of dpkg -S package
2007-10-30T19:18:00.000Z	gribouille	mc44	obviously you don't know how apt works
2007-10-30T19:19:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	apt-file is nothing to do with what you've installed, it's to do with the repositories
2007-10-30T19:20:00.000Z	mc44	gribouille	anyway, I was talking about the repository structure of gutsy-updates and you started talking about a different repository altogether, so I'm not sure what the problem is
