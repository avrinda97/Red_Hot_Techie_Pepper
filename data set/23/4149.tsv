2007-10-27T05:01:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg		can any one help me with samba it wont associate the machines ip with there name
2007-10-27T05:02:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	did you tell the machines about your wins server?
2007-10-27T05:02:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	wins is dissabled though my windoze machine can see the file on unbuntu and ubuntu can see the file only when the ip is entered
2007-10-27T05:03:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	let your samba box do wins support and then tell the windoze box to look at the samba box for wins
2007-10-27T05:04:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	?
2007-10-27T05:04:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	I'm not sure how to do it using supported methods, but what you need to do is turn on wins support in samba, then point your windoze boxes at the samba box for wins support
2007-10-27T05:06:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	not shure just when ever i enable wins i cant seem to share anything
2007-10-27T05:06:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	do you have the windoze boxes pointed at the samba box for wins?
2007-10-27T05:07:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	win for wins?
2007-10-27T05:08:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	it is just and indepent computer sharing one folder not running any other services
2007-10-27T05:08:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	if you want to resolve names to ip you need wins or dns
2007-10-27T05:09:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	any idea how to set up wins since when ever i try i can share anything
2007-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	which unfortunately I dont know how to do using supported methods and they'll boo me if I say how I do it
2007-10-27T05:11:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	so the wins server right links the ip-to name just on my samba server
2007-10-27T05:12:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	coorect its not routable so itll stay in house
2007-10-27T05:19:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	does not the cd when you boot from it have a rescure option
2007-10-27T05:19:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	this is correct
2007-10-27T05:42:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	know any erros for samba that include cli_rpc_pipe_open
2007-10-27T05:43:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	google that one, it seems specific enough
2007-10-27T05:47:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	stuff that is really technical i catch mention of rpc
2007-10-27T05:48:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	sometimes it does get a bit geekish when playing with network file systems
2007-10-27T05:54:00.000Z	Hellclan|Oracleg	JimmyDee	oo any idea why it thinks the host mahcine is at a 208.69 naddres ?
2007-10-27T05:56:00.000Z	JimmyDee	Hellclan|Oracleg	ummm 208.69 hmmmm its dhcp'ing to someone elses dhcp box?
