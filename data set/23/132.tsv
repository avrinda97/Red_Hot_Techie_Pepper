2012-08-31T02:46:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	sure he does with extended
2012-08-31T02:51:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	extended containers take up space on the primary partition table.
2012-08-31T02:52:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	so he can create one extended container and then create four more inside there and so on
2012-08-31T02:52:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	the extended container has another partition table so to say also
2012-08-31T02:56:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	no
2012-08-31T02:56:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	easily with extended partitions
2012-08-31T03:09:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	you can have up to 26 drives or partitions assigned letters in windows. After that you can start mounting drives to folders with disk manager rather than assigning them a letter.
2012-08-31T03:10:00.000Z	mz|`	histo	show me your 26 partitions
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	mz|`	histo	then tell me how to install any linux system in a logical partition, to split into more partitions
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	I don't ahve windows and also it's easy to install linux on whatever partition you want.
2012-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	as long as grub is installed on the mbr

2012-08-31T03:13:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	there ya go give that a read if you don't believe me
2012-08-31T03:14:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	huh?
2012-08-31T03:14:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	I told him to grow the extended parition and add more logical parittions in side of there and install there
2012-08-31T03:15:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	you just told me you wanted to see more than 26 drive/partition in windows and there's your link.
2012-08-31T03:15:00.000Z	histo	mz|`	that's exactly what I told him
2012-08-31T03:32:00.000Z	mz|`	histo	nobody attacked you
