2006-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	fonscho		what package is needed for it?
2006-05-12T08:54:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	gnome-cups-manager package owns it on my system for hicolor icon theme
2006-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	well, this package is installed
2006-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	does /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/devices/gnome-dev-printer-new.png exist?
2006-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	yes it does
2006-05-12T08:57:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	actually, reading what you pasted, it seems to be only a warning.  What exactly is not working?
2006-05-12T08:57:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	put it up on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13572  I can delete a printer
2006-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	how come you have all those duplicate drivers?
2006-05-12T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	what icon theme are you using?
2006-05-12T09:04:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	well, you mean on xfce?
2006-05-12T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	oh right... hmm
2006-05-12T09:05:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	perhaps running my printer installing gnome? ;-)
2006-05-12T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	heh, how do the icons work in xfce?  can you choose to use the gnome icon theme?
2006-05-12T09:05:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	let me see
2006-05-12T09:06:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	no i cannot
2006-05-12T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	did the web interface not work?
2006-05-12T09:08:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	no, because it has problems with users
2006-05-12T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	what kind of problems?
2006-05-12T09:13:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	there are some crashing bugs on launchpad.  Maybe you can review them and see if they are the same.  If they are not, you may want to file your own
2006-05-12T09:13:00.000Z	fonscho	_jason	the "solution" is installing gnome
2006-05-12T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	fonscho	ok
