2005-07-29T10:43:00.000Z	evader		Is there an estimate how long it will be until Breezy is reasonably stable? So that X/Firefox isn't breaking all the time?
2005-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	evader		What's the date on that?
2005-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	as they say, "when it's ready'
2006-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	 /usr/share/xsessions
2006-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	from memory
2006-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	you can use an existing *.desktop file as a template
2006-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	evader	thoreauputic	what about this part: X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=xfce-utils
2006-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	you lost me...
2006-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	what does that do?
2006-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	evader	thoreauputic	that is the last line in my xfce.desktop file, that I am using as a template
2006-04-14T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	just alter the relevant lines
2006-04-14T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	the most important is the execute line
2006-04-14T07:20:00.000Z	evader	thoreauputic	ok, i'll try this, restart X
2006-04-14T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	or exec or whatever
2006-04-14T07:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	you rename the *.desktop file to suit, of course
2006-04-14T07:34:00.000Z	evader	thoreauputic	that .desktop stuff worked well thanks
2006-04-14T07:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	no worries :)
2006-04-14T07:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	 update-rc.d I think is what you mean
2006-04-14T07:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	you might prefer the "bum" GUI app
2006-04-14T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	start up scripts ( or acyually links to /etc/init.d )
2006-04-14T08:04:00.000Z	evader	thoreauputic	I understand you link the /etc/init.d/whatever file to the /etc/rc?.d file, but what is with the numbers, and letters S and K being in some files? and what is /etc/rcS.d?
2006-04-14T08:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	do a  ls -l /etc/rcS.d to see the links - S = start k= kill ( on shutdown)
2006-04-14T08:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	evader	later numbers >> later start etc
