2011-12-05T21:10:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	you using 11.10?
2011-12-05T21:10:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	yes
2011-12-05T21:11:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	is gnome-shell messing something up or do you just want to reclaim the space?
2011-12-05T21:11:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	I want to use Gnome-Shell but for some reason, after removing fglrx Gnome-Shell looks like Gnome-Classic
2011-12-05T21:13:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	i think it reverts to classic if you don't have the drivers to support gnome3
2011-12-05T21:14:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	I used to have Gnome-Shell working, so how do I get back the default driver?
2011-12-05T21:14:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	you'd need to reinstall the driver
2011-12-05T21:14:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	lanch the restricted drivers thingy
2011-12-05T21:14:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	ok
2011-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	additional drivers?
2011-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	thats the one.
2011-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	I had it working without installing any of the fglrx drivers.
2011-12-05T21:16:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	and when I installed these fglrx drivers, Gnome-shell was screwed up
2011-12-05T21:16:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	i see, hmm
2011-12-05T21:17:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	so maybe if I can just completely remove and reinstall gnome-shell, hopefully that would work
2011-12-05T21:17:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	i'm likely not the best person to help you, i use xfce and nvidia
2011-12-05T21:17:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	how about removing gnome-shell?
2011-12-05T21:17:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	like an "sudo apt-get remove ***"
2011-12-05T21:18:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	i'd imagine that would take a heap of dependancies with it
2011-12-05T21:18:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	okay, well thanks for ur time
2011-12-05T21:18:00.000Z	auronandace	avdeveloper	no worries, sorry i couldn't help
2011-12-05T21:19:00.000Z	avdeveloper	auronandace	no problem
