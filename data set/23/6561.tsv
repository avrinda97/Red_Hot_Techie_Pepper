2007-10-08T15:27:00.000Z	Scunizi		I curious, are permissions for a harddrive referenced on that drive or from within a file in the system?
2007-10-08T15:28:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	the permissions are a feature of the filesystem
2007-10-08T15:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	strange.. I have a "data" partition (vfat) that is accessable in Dapper.  When I boot into Feisty and try to access it, Feisty says it's only accessable by root and asks for the password.. why is this?
2007-10-08T15:30:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	my first guess would be fstab is not set up the same
2007-10-08T15:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	ah.. I hadn't thought of that.. I'll check it out.. Thanks.
2007-11-19T23:30:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	not really, but when the new home is mounted to /home, any files that are there will be unaccessible... really the old /home should be emptied
2007-11-19T23:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	it was kind of a post-facto question. The original /home was the default install, the new /home was my Dapper's orig. /home.  But I noticed that one of my directories has disappeared, Photos (emptied) & Pics (removed/disappeared).
2008-01-18T04:54:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	devede will handle it all automatically, it works pretty well
2008-01-18T04:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	I'll load it up and give it a try.. is it terminal based or gui?
2008-01-18T04:54:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	it's a gui
2008-01-18T04:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	thanks.. will it also reformat the avi smaller if needed.?
2008-01-18T04:56:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	I believe so
2008-01-18T04:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	cool.. I downloaded a copy of Elephant Dreams (opensource movie) and would like to burn it and put it on my GPS tha plays video.
2008-01-18T04:57:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	I've seen it ;)
2008-01-18T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	once the move has been crunched to a mpg, will k3b then take care of the burning to dvd?  also if I burn it as a straight mpg file will a dvd pick it up and play it.. I'm really dvd spec dumb.
2008-01-18T05:09:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	the output will be an .iso file you can burn with any program
2008-01-18T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	thanks.. looks like the file being created is an mpg.. maybe I chose the wrong option.
2008-01-18T05:10:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	maybe it's just showing intermediate progress?
2008-01-18T05:10:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	I only tried it once
2008-01-18T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	I hope so.. it takes a while
2008-01-18T05:10:00.000Z	astro76	Scunizi	it does, a couple of hours
2008-01-18T05:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	astro76	20% done right now if I can believe the progress bar.. p4 2.4ghs socket 478 (old) w 2gig ram.. not cooking but adequate
