2009-05-03T23:38:00.000Z	challengeman		am i visible here, or do i need to register
2009-05-03T23:38:00.000Z	challengeman		is there a better room for noobs trying to install linux?
2009-05-03T23:39:00.000Z	capiira	challengeman	choose the channel from the distribution you're running
2009-05-03T23:40:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	 i was running 8.10, but 9.04 upgrade crashed
2009-05-03T23:40:00.000Z	challengeman		now i have nothing
2009-05-03T23:41:00.000Z	capiira		did you try a fresh install after that crash ?
2009-05-03T23:42:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	now, i would prefer to keep my files/settings?
2009-05-03T23:42:00.000Z	challengeman		if i can
2009-05-03T23:42:00.000Z	challengeman		by crash -- i don't mean hardware failure
2009-05-03T23:43:00.000Z	capiira	challengeman	just copy your home to else where, in case you dont have an extra partition for /home
2009-05-03T23:45:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	but i have to get on the computer -- how can i copy home -- i can't boot/
2009-05-03T23:45:00.000Z	capiira		use the live CD
2009-05-03T23:46:00.000Z	capiira	challengeman	use the live cd, mount your partition and copy it to a usb stick or so
2009-05-03T23:46:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	o.k. so live cd will help -- but right now i the boot is hung on * Reloading system log daemon
2009-05-03T23:47:00.000Z	challengeman		is there a way to move past this?
2009-05-03T23:48:00.000Z	capiira	challengeman	dunno but try crtl+c :) maybe this helps. sometimes it works
2009-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	well i can see the ^C but nothing else
2009-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	capiira		ok then it does not work
2009-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	capiira		sorry, maybe anyone else know how to help
2009-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	how long should i wait before turning off
2009-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	challengeman		i had a lot of data/etc set up -- i really hate to go through the pain of a fresh install
2009-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	challengeman		ctl+alt+del stops the gnome display manager
2009-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	challengeman	capiira	so rebooting i guess
