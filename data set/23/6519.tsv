2006-03-23T09:31:00.000Z	ajnewbold		what is GTK?
2006-03-23T09:33:00.000Z	ajnewbold		I'm trying to install a theme and having a rough time, and I think I have to do something with a gtk, but don't even know where to start, heh
2006-03-23T09:33:00.000Z	ajnewbold		like I've got this "gtk" dir with lots of things in it, but I'm not sure where to put it or how to make them appear
2006-03-23T09:34:00.000Z	sline_crecature	ajnewbold	open your theme window and drag the theme folder onto it
2006-03-23T09:34:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	too easy :-) thanks!
2006-03-23T09:34:00.000Z	sline_crecature		any time
2006-03-23T09:35:00.000Z	sline_crecature		if that doesn't work, btw, you can put the folder in your .themes folder directly i think
2006-03-23T09:35:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	well, it's weird, I kept getting these "invalid file format" messages but it switched to the theme anyway :-)
2006-03-23T09:36:00.000Z	sline_crecature	ajnewbold	heh yeah i get that sometimes too
2006-03-23T09:36:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	actually, it didn't install it; I just clicked on another theme by accident, heh
2006-03-23T09:37:00.000Z	sline_crecature	ajnewbold	oh, well then did you try copying the folder into your .themes folder?
2006-03-23T09:37:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	not yet.... there are so many subfolders... should I just copy the main folder into .themes?
2006-03-23T09:38:00.000Z	sline_crecature	ajnewbold	yes, it should have a index.theme file in it
2006-03-23T09:38:00.000Z	sline_crecature		the theme folder i mean
2006-03-23T09:38:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	ah, yeah, one of the folders does -- cool, I'll mess with that
2006-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	sline_crecature		i have a similar question to tapox, as i have 2 hard drives
2006-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	sline_crecature		my boot drive is hdb, to switch it to hda all i need to edit is fstab and grub.conf?
2006-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	sline_crecature		thanks, i wasn't sure if there are any other configs i needed to edit
2006-03-23T09:52:00.000Z	ajnewbold		does anyone have any idea where this guy might have found this theme?  http://flickr.com/photos/ponderingteen/60224539/
2006-03-23T09:52:00.000Z	ajnewbold		I've googled and googled and no luck :/
2006-03-23T09:53:00.000Z	ajnewbold		that theme is goregous and I can't find it anywhere :/
2006-03-23T09:54:00.000Z	sline_crecature	ajnewbold	have you looked at gnome-look.org? they have some nice themes
2006-03-23T09:54:00.000Z	ajnewbold	sline_crecature	no, I'll check it out now, thanks!
