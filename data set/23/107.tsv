2012-08-16T17:41:00.000Z	kristenbb		does someone know why the toggle fullscreen shortcut doesn't work in some cases ?
2012-08-16T17:42:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	toogle full-screen in which application?
2012-08-16T17:42:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	in no specific application, just in any application. Most of them should allow that, there's a system shortcut for that.
2012-08-16T17:43:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	it's in system configuration->keyboard->shortcuts->window->toggle fullscreen
2012-08-16T17:46:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	It's disabled on my Precise install. I don't think anything responds to the event.
2012-08-16T17:46:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	well I have this working on one computer
2012-08-16T17:46:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	If you hold down the Super key (often the Windows key) you'll get a menu of available key shortcuts
2012-08-16T17:46:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	Same version of Ubuntu on the other PC?
2012-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	yes you're right there's no default shortcut assigned to it, but you can assign one. I did so. And it worked on one pc, not on the other.
2012-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	yes both 12.04 lts x64 desktop edition.
2012-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	one is a laptop (the one that doesn't work).
2012-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	Then something else has probably bound to the same keypress first... that used to be an issue with older gnome installations... trying to find out what was grabbing the keypress first
2012-08-16T17:48:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	and also, one is using 2d, the other 3d
2012-08-16T17:48:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	and which one won't do full-screen? 3D ?
2012-08-16T17:48:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	yes
2012-08-16T17:49:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	the laptop, with unity 3d, doesn't do fullscreen.
2012-08-16T17:50:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	ok as a matter of fact this is the problem, I've just tested using ubuntu 2d with the laptop, and it works
2012-08-16T17:50:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	so my question now is
2012-08-16T17:50:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	how to enable 'toggle fullscreen' on ubuntu 3D?
2012-08-16T17:51:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	My bet is, unity disables full-screen because of conflicts within compiz... I've found bugs about that already
2012-08-16T17:51:00.000Z	kristenbb	TJ-	unity 2D allows them though ... so maybe the conflict is not hard to solve
2012-08-16T17:54:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	Because '2D' doesn't use all the fancy 3D compositing
2012-08-16T17:56:00.000Z	TJ-	kristenbb	See bug #1007352
