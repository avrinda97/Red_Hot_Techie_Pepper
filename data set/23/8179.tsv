2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		yes i do, and the kernels
2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		all of them give me an error 17
2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		the only option in the list that boots is Windows XP
2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		yes
2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		and restored it using TestDisk
2007-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	tdizz1		ok
2007-10-02T05:02:00.000Z	tdizz1		yes it is
2007-10-02T05:02:00.000Z	tdizz1		what do u mean?
2007-10-02T05:02:00.000Z	tdizz1		u mean the mount point?
2007-10-02T05:03:00.000Z	tdizz1		yes
2007-10-02T05:03:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	you have restored the partition, but is the partition type "linux"?
2007-10-02T05:04:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	no, the partiton type. Presumably the filesystem will be ext3
2007-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	yes, but what is the partition type?
2007-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	use "sudo fdisk -l" and see what the "Id" column says
2007-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	so that's fine
2007-10-02T05:09:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	have you fsck'd your partition?
2007-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	performed a filesystem check? You should be able to do this from the live cd
2007-10-02T05:11:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	boot into the live cd, unmount the partition "sudo umount /dev/whatever" then "sudo e2fsck /dev/whatever"
2007-10-02T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	if it is a large partition prepare to give it half an hour or so
2007-10-02T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	which command?
2007-10-02T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	umount
2007-10-02T05:15:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	...just googling error17...
2007-10-02T05:21:00.000Z	mcphail	tdizz1	i'm struggling to work out why you should get an error17. The partition exists, and is clearly ext3...
