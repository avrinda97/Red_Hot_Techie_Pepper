2009-12-21T21:24:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	you're not making any sense
2009-12-21T21:27:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	i need to compile a module for kaffeine and i only foind it in source
2009-12-21T21:33:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	got itr?
2009-12-21T21:55:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	you probably don't have the _right_ libs then
2009-12-21T21:56:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	how do i see if i have the right libs?
2009-12-21T21:56:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	./configure will work if you have the right libs :p
2009-12-21T21:57:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	pastebin the entire output of ./configure
2009-12-21T21:58:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	it does not work it stops http://pastebin.com/m785d2031
2009-12-21T21:59:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	I know, that's how you know you don't have the right libs installed
2009-12-21T21:59:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	is that the entire output?
2009-12-21T21:59:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	including the command you're running
2009-12-21T22:25:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	this is the full output (sorry so late) http://pastebin.com/m7c449031
2009-12-21T22:26:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	you specified a prefix that doesn't have the libraries in it
2009-12-21T22:26:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	if this is a standard install, don't specify the prefix
2009-12-21T22:27:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	"./configure" should suffice
2009-12-21T22:32:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	what would be the desired location of the libraries?
2009-12-21T22:33:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	have you _tried_ just typing "./configure" with no args yet?
2009-12-21T22:33:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	yes of course
2009-12-21T22:34:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	and you're sure you've got the kde3 dev libs installed?
2009-12-21T22:35:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	how can i see if they really are
2009-12-21T22:37:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	BrixSat	http://www.eurocardsharing.com/f273/faq-for-kaffeine-with-sc-plugin-and-cccam-installation-69987 seems to be vaguely correct
2009-12-21T22:37:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	:D
2009-12-21T23:06:00.000Z	BrixSat	cwillu_at_work	thanks that solved half the problem now im stuck on the make http://pastebin.com/m15aad300
