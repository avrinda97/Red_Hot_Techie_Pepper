2008-02-15T05:24:00.000Z	sangprabo		Hi, everyone. I have downloaded a *.chm file, and it seemed I cannot open it until I "unblock active content" by (if I use Windows Explorer) select Properties -> Unblock. How do I do that in Linux? I am using Ubuntu Gutsy and xchm. Thanks
2008-02-15T05:24:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	have you tried the CHM reader?
2008-02-15T05:25:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	thank you for your response. No, I've not tried it. I will install it soon.
2008-02-15T05:25:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	check out the gnochm package, it's what I use
2008-02-15T05:26:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	gnochm? okay
2008-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	What kind of package should I install / configure?
2008-02-15T05:29:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	'sudo apt-get install gnochm' should work fine
2008-02-15T05:29:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	it will install "CHM Viewer" in the Applications - Accessories menu
2008-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	okay, thank you. I've installed it. Trying...
2008-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	I reopen the file, and it seemed that I only get strange characters like ËÉÿÅËÉÿÅËÉÿÅ... :(
2008-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	strange.. it's a .CHM file?
2008-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	similar with if I use xchm or another chm viewer..
2008-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	hrm, where'd you get the CHM ?
2008-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	yes, it came from http://www.supermemo.com/english/helpdown.htm
2008-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	I'll try it out over here
2008-02-15T05:33:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	Thank you. I've downloaded smhelp.chm, the latest one (2006)
2008-02-15T05:37:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	it looks like they're using some IE hooks... I don't know if you'll be able to get it to work out-of-the-box in linux
2008-02-15T05:38:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	is ther any other way to open it? If open it using Windows, could it opened in Linux after?
2008-02-15T05:38:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	I doubt it... but you can get it to work in Wine, I'd bet
2008-02-15T05:39:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	okay. I will try it. Thank you very much of your kind, nemilar :)
2008-02-15T05:39:00.000Z	nemilar	sangprabo	np.. hope it works for you
2008-02-15T06:16:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	I've downloaded it, and it works! Thank you very much... :)
2008-02-15T06:17:00.000Z	sangprabo	nemilar	May be only md5sum problem..
