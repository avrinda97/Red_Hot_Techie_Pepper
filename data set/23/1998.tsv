2010-11-12T13:14:00.000Z	MindVirus1		Anyone know libjack-dev for JACK2?
2010-11-12T13:16:00.000Z	MindVirus1		I don't know how else to ask it.
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		libjack-dev is for jackd 1 (I think).
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	well is jack 2 in the repositories ?
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	I have no idea.
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		But there is a jackd2.
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	that would be what I would check first
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		So I assume that's the same thing.
2010-11-12T13:17:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	ok, what is the package for jackd 2?
2010-11-12T13:18:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	I don't know. I just know there's a jackd2.
2010-11-12T13:18:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	how do you know that jackd 2 is in the repositories?
2010-11-12T13:18:00.000Z	MindVirus1		However, libjack-dev is removed when I try to install it.
2010-11-12T13:18:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	I don't know how you got that from what I said.
2010-11-12T13:19:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	"jrib: well is jack 2 in the repositories" "you: I have no idea.  But there is a jackd2."
2010-11-12T13:19:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	Right. I don't know what relation jackd2 has with JACK 2.
2010-11-12T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	what do you install that removes libjack-dev...?
2010-11-12T13:20:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	jackd2.
2010-11-12T13:21:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	what does « apt-cache depends jackd2 » return?
2010-11-12T13:21:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	Are you not on Ubuntu?
2010-11-12T13:22:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	erm, why?
2010-11-12T13:22:00.000Z	MindVirus1	jrib	Just a question.
2010-11-12T13:22:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	I am on ubuntu
2010-11-12T13:23:00.000Z	jrib	MindVirus1	oops, I meant "showsrc" not "depends"
