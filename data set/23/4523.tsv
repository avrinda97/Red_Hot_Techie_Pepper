2007-07-22T12:04:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	might want to tell orange__ :P
2007-07-22T12:25:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	that's the 'pager' (2x2 v 1x4)
2007-07-22T12:26:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	the name of the switcher, you mean?
2007-07-22T12:28:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	i've no idea what you mean with 'pager' :)
2007-07-22T12:29:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	the quasi-official term for that mechanism is the 'pager' under X11.  fvwm2 has one and it's more obvious there how to manipulate it.  I think in your case the panel applet is 'swallowing the pager' when present, and the pager reverts to its 'natural geometry' .. this is about the /geometry/ of the /pager/ under X11.
2007-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	right, following you now :) when I think of a pager in nix I think of the text file viewer (such as 'pager' on ubuntu)
2007-07-22T12:31:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	most importantly though, have any idea how to fix that? ;] 
2007-07-22T12:32:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	http://bardolph.ling.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/dwww?type=runman&location=Pager/1x seems to agree with you ;P
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	the problem is that the WM generally implements the pager in X11. Not all WM implement it.
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	I can change it by using the panel applet though
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	but once I remove the applet from panel again (because I don't want no stinkin' icon) it reverts back
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	you have to dissect what GNOME did to launch a pager.
2007-07-22T12:36:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	not certain! hehe. But maybe. If it's a task in the process table then surely.
2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	look at it this way: the 1x4 indicates /that/ has a geometry. Change /that/.
2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	i wish i even had half an idea where to start though :/
2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	I think it's under etc.
2007-07-22T12:48:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	I'd backdoor it and edit the underlying text file.  Not sure if it'd present in the GUI tool.
2007-07-22T12:48:00.000Z	bloobjib	tetonca	yea, but what's the underlying text file? ;P
2007-07-22T12:48:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	surf.  grep!
2007-07-22T12:49:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	'grep -i' is your friend.
2007-07-22T12:56:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	I kinda thot it was there all along. ;)
2007-07-22T12:57:00.000Z	tetonca	bloobjib	I've used so many different WM's they're all a blur .. features cross over in my recollections of them.
