2006-03-20T08:40:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	sudo apt-get install aterm
2006-03-20T08:40:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	aterm -bg black -fg grey -sr -sl 1000 -tr -trsb -sh 40 -tint red -geometry 80x40
2006-03-20T08:42:00.000Z	Darky	fluxt	it not what i mean..
2006-03-20T08:43:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	you don't want transparent? you can make it clear
2006-03-20T08:44:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	you want an invisible terminal but not see you're wallpaper? turn off your monitor
2006-03-20T08:45:00.000Z	Darky	fluxt	i want to see the background...
2006-03-20T08:45:00.000Z	Darky	fluxt	not only the wallpaper...
2006-03-20T08:45:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	oh, your prob is you can't see the apps behind the term?
2006-03-20T08:46:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	don't think it can be done
2006-03-20T08:47:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	i kinda like seeing my wallpaper through the aterm (it's the only chance i get to see it) :)
2006-03-20T08:48:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	forget about it till the next ubuntu release
2006-03-20T09:12:00.000Z	fluxt	Darky	from what i can tell, erasing the folder pretty much sums up wine uninstalls. other than that if  you kept the folder there may have been an uninst.exe or uninstall.exe but you should really ask that in #wine
