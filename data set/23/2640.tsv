2010-01-12T10:01:00.000Z	mcnellis		I'm commanding sudo kill -9 PID but it won't kill my process ... is there something else i need to do?
2010-01-12T10:03:00.000Z	mcnellis		Yeah Out_Cold the specific PID is 9805, just didn't include that in my message lol
2010-01-12T10:04:00.000Z	mcnellis		so my command was sudo kill -9 9805 but the process won't die
2010-01-12T10:04:00.000Z	mcnellis		it's a firefox process
2010-01-12T10:05:00.000Z	mcnellis		yeah Out_Cold that's what I used to to find the PID and verify that it's still running after I did "kill -9 9805"
2010-01-12T10:06:00.000Z	mcnellis		yeah I tried that too FiReSTaRT used sudo killall firefox
2010-01-12T10:06:00.000Z	mcnellis		still won't die :|
2010-01-12T10:06:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	what's the state of the process as per 'ps aux' ?
2010-01-12T10:07:00.000Z	mcnellis	unop	me      9805  2.0  5.6 983716 215592 ?       D    12:59  10:06 /usr/lib/firefox-3.5.5/firefox
2010-01-12T10:08:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	state D indicate "Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)" -- meaning that the process is waiting for some suspended IO to complete, things like a hung disk access, network, etc
2010-01-12T10:08:00.000Z	mcnellis		interesting unop ... is there anything i cna do to kill the process? I don't know why it's still running i don't have a window open i just see the process running when i run ps aux
2010-01-12T10:09:00.000Z	mcnellis		damn I was hoping that wouldn't be my only option but it seems it is :(
2010-01-12T10:09:00.000Z	mcnellis		such a pain to launch all my programs again lol
2010-01-12T10:10:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	Out_Cold - you cannot kill a process in state D -- you'll have to wait it out or fix the IO problem
2010-01-12T10:11:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	what was firefox doing before you attempted to kill it?
2010-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	mcnellis	unop	not sure I had just closed firefox before and when I came back to my comp i tried to open it again and got the message that it was still running so I used ps aux | grep firefox and here i am trying to kill it heh
2010-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	mcnellis		i guess it just never properly closed the window?
2010-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	and did you do a kill -9 right off the bat?
2010-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	mcnellis		no tried killall firefox first
2010-01-12T10:13:00.000Z	mcnellis		it was in state D from the beginning though
2010-01-12T10:13:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	can you open another instance of firefox?
2010-01-12T10:14:00.000Z	mcnellis	unop	only if I launch with the profile manager and use a dif profile
2010-01-12T10:14:00.000Z	unop	mcnellis	strange, guess a reboot is imminent then - it's probably the only thing you can do
