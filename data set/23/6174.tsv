2006-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		oops, guess nobody told jammer about pastebin :)
2006-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	pastebin is in the /topic - not that anyone ever reads it ;/
2006-12-20T11:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	I suggest short circuiting the issue with cafuego's firmware debs
2006-12-20T11:23:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	is that a site I can visit, or is that a repository?
2006-12-20T11:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	both - hang on
2006-12-20T11:24:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	hanging....
2006-12-20T11:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	go those?
2006-12-20T11:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	I use edgy...alrighty......
2006-12-20T11:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	fwiw I used cafuego's debs to get my bcm43xx going on my iBook G4 - worked well
2006-12-20T11:35:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	I'm trying to add the public key so I can access the repository...not having much luck doing so, though
2006-12-20T11:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	why not just download the deb ? It's right there afaics
2006-12-20T11:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	did you read the "front page" ? Gives the command for adding the key
2006-12-20T11:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	wget http://au.ubuntu.cafuego.net/969F3F57.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
2006-12-20T11:41:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	it downloaded, but the add command didn't seem to be working....so I simply downloaded it, went into Synaptic, and imported the key from there....whoever said there were many ways to skin a cat obviously used linux :)
2006-12-20T11:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	heh - yes I just tried the command here too ( to check) and it hangs... Nice work around :)
2006-12-20T11:44:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	I presume it's not a problem that the description says it's for the dapper kernel?
2006-12-20T11:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	hmm - did you grab the dapper or the edgy version?
2006-12-20T11:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	I have only used the dapper one here so i don't know frankly
2006-12-20T11:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	actually they both appear to be the same version...
2006-12-20T11:47:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	thoreauputic	should I be uninstalling any other firmware before installing this?
2006-12-20T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	I didn't :) But have you got something like ndiswrapper in there? That would have to be disabled I think
2006-12-20T11:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	bear in mind I did this on  PPC machine, not a "PC"
2006-12-20T11:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Geoffrey2	top be honest I don't know much about it - I just installed the deb then modprobed bcm43xx - not sure if I needed to put it in /etc/modules afterwards and I can't check as I'm on a different machine currently
