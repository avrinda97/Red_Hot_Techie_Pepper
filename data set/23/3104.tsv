2008-08-11T20:03:00.000Z	abchirk		Hi, I started the UbuntuinstallCD (Hardy) I tried to resetup my grub... but there aren't any usual device names under /dev/ only /dev/disk/aasjdi-part2 and else? How I can resetup grub then?
2008-08-11T20:05:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 I guess the easyest way to correct a grub installation is from a live-CD
2008-08-11T20:06:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	but how? I have to reinstall it with the stages and so on..
2008-08-11T20:07:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 you can mount --bind /your/boot /boo and then grub-install /dev/yourdevice, the update-grub
2008-08-11T20:08:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 so you also can install grub to an external usb-device.
2008-08-11T20:09:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	but you have an correct grub, to be able to make the grub operations...
2008-08-11T20:09:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	how correct grub? its installed yes?
2008-08-11T20:10:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	yes grub must be installed correctly. And it seem's to be impossible to install grub via a chrooted installation.
2008-08-11T20:33:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	when he makes the stages? because I need the new stages? with grub-install he doesn't or?
2008-08-11T20:35:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	I just also make a grub install...   grub-update creates the /boot/grub/files
2008-08-11T20:36:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 an grub-install installes it to where every you want it, for example in your mbr of your booting disk.
2008-08-11T20:36:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 the stage-files grub needs to boot, and they have to be placed somewhere...
2008-08-11T20:37:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 you know you can start many applications via grub, but you need only one grub installation.
2008-08-11T20:38:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 in /boot/grub/menu.lst all the installations can be added.
2008-08-11T20:39:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	I know but my other grub is broken. ;) because I put a hd from a other PC into it and it seems that the stage files doesn't match
2008-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	yap :)
2008-08-11T20:41:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 check the device.map in /boot/grub   sometimes results of grub are strange to me, but usually it installs...
2008-08-11T20:48:00.000Z	abchirk	pogay	stages weren't installed to... maybe stages get onl installed during installation?
2008-08-11T21:03:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	super!  my chroot things don't work...
2008-08-11T21:04:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 usually ists /boot/grub/... (with stages and menu.lst)
2008-08-11T21:06:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	 you can at least correct the drive-nr if they are not correct...
2008-08-11T21:32:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	yeah, dev/sda is the mbr
2008-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	pogay	abchirk	of your fiest hd.  the disk you start
