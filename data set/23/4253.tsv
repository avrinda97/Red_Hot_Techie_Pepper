2008-07-25T11:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	troubleshooting before you install?
2008-07-25T11:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	over vista or alongside it
2008-07-25T11:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	first step is to md5 the iso; let me get you a link
2008-07-25T11:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	you need to read the links
2008-07-25T11:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	is this wireless or wired
2008-07-25T11:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	once you have md5'd the iso (see bot link above) and burned the iso at low speed to cd, booted into livecd then we can determine how much troubleshooting you really need
2008-07-25T11:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	never used daemon tools; for checking compatibility it should be okay as long as you can do it ##windows for more info on that
2008-07-25T11:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	by all means go for it; best to be wired though when you do so unless you know your wireless chipset right now
2008-07-25T11:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	well that tells us very little; best to be wired then and we can examine from live cd
2008-07-25T11:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	that is the non-install part of the cd that lets you shop before you buy (in a manner of speaking); you look at the features and then can choose to install or not.
2008-07-25T11:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	it will give us a clue on how easy it will be to setup wireless
2008-07-25T11:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	you wont be able to install from the mount like afaik
2008-07-25T11:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	to mount sure, to install likely not
2008-07-25T11:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	best to see it before you really install (btw it will be quite a bit slower that way)
2008-07-25T11:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	same as on eeepc; will work with a bit of fiddling
2008-07-25T11:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	please dont curse
2008-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	best way to troubleshoot in that case is connect via a second machine (if you can) and do it that way
2008-07-25T11:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	good luck then; you are choosing the very most difficult path to follow (on what not need be).
2008-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	your install was awfully fast; this was via wubi or daemon tools mounted iso
2008-07-25T12:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Daniel_2	how long did the install process take?
