2011-04-15T17:45:00.000Z	needhelp		Hello, Problems with my internet connection. It is up in 1min, then goes down and goes back online after 1 min, etc. Signal strength is max. This 1min on-1min off-connection only happens in Ubuntu, not in Windows.
2011-04-15T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 and this is a wireless network?
2011-04-15T17:46:00.000Z	needhelp	Dr_Willis	yes
2011-04-15T17:46:00.000Z	needhelp	Dr_Willis	wireless
2011-05-06T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 tinycore linux = 10mb.  + whatever else you install.
2011-05-06T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 or lubuntu perhaps. :) if you want somthing more full featured
2011-05-06T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 you could always run the system from a usb flash drive. Ive seen 32gb ones for reasonable prices on sale
2011-05-06T19:08:00.000Z	needhelp	Dr_Willis	Yea and puppylinux is 130mb-140mb...
2011-05-06T19:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 i really wonder what OS was on it originally. Hope its not one of those WIndowsCE things ive seen in the past.
2011-05-06T19:12:00.000Z	needhelp	Dr_Willis	I heard it was some "LINPUS" or something, a linux nevertheless. I'd rather still format it. That guy she gets the computer from is a techwiz and he doesn't need it. My mom has always just wanted a very very light and cheap laptop that is almost "pocketable"... She knows how frustrating the web browsing will be, I told her... scrolling sideways is a bummer
2011-05-06T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 tinycore, or lubuntu would be my choices.
2011-05-06T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 then she cen keep her stuff on a sd/flash/whatever drive
2011-05-06T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 under 4gb i know. :) ive installed it to 4gb flash drives.
2011-05-06T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 smaller then ubuntu also.
2011-05-06T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 and ubuntu i recall fitting just barely on 4gb
2011-05-06T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 i dident say it was useable. :) it fit...
2011-05-06T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 your apt/cache will take up 1gb real fast..
2011-05-06T19:20:00.000Z	needhelp	Dr_Willis	Do you know if Xubuntu and Lubuntu have lots of differences in sizes or their usability? Think about a complete novice who just surfs the web, like most nowadays teens or old people
2011-05-06T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 lubuntu can proberly do all she needs
2011-05-06T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 that JoliOS might do what she wants.. its basically a webbrowser os. :)
2011-05-06T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	JoliOS is a ubuntu variant.
2011-05-06T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 its the smallest of the ubuntu variants.. so its under xubuntus size. :) even the iso is smaller.
2011-05-06T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp	 i have to wonder how they got 4gb in that eee also. If its an IDE-CF adaptor - you can get bigger CF cards.
