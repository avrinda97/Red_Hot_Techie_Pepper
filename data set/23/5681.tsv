2006-10-07T14:09:00.000Z	vlade33		can some1 help me with that monitor issue ? please..
2006-10-07T14:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	what video card do you have?
2006-10-07T14:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	are you running nvidia drivers, or nv drivers?
2006-10-07T14:12:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	what kind of monitor is it?
2006-10-07T14:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	which is the primary? the lcd or the crt?
2006-10-07T14:14:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	for win...crt..but i also tried to only use one .. and unplug the other one.. but still no deal..
2006-10-07T14:15:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	this also happened with fedora.. however i was able to install suse with no prob.
2006-10-07T14:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	okay, by default, only one monitor will work. If you have nvidia, chances are you are using the 'nv' drivers. Plug the LCD into the primary port on your card, reboot the machine. On reboot, you'll see mirror images on both screens. Tell me how far you get this way. Do you get to the logon screen?
2006-10-07T14:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	I have dual monitors running with nvidia -- its possible :)
2006-10-07T14:17:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	i don't even see the loging screen.. but let me restart and try it again .. and i'll brb if it works/doesn't work
2006-10-07T14:26:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	i booted and once it loaded the monitor went on crack.. there was a "safe graphics install" mode should i try that ?
2006-10-07T14:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	your system isn't installed yet?
2006-10-07T14:28:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	no .. i can't install it.. when i boot and select "start or install ubuntu" after it loads monitor goes nuts!
2006-10-07T14:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	then use the safe graphics mode
2006-10-07T14:28:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	ok .. is it a bitch to enable dual monitor?
2006-10-07T14:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	on nvidia? no, its not difficult (please keep it pg13 in here)
2006-10-07T14:29:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	sorry.. :)
2006-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	i installed it! how do i enable dual monitor?
2006-10-07T14:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	vlade33	first, install the binary nvidia drivers.
2006-10-07T14:48:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	ty
2006-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	vlade33	fyrestrtr	which linux-restricted-module should i use ?
