2005-04-28T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	blueprism	do you want to pick particular programs, or no desktop at all?
2005-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	blueprism	nickrud	well i want a xserver setup
2005-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	blueprism	ok, do a server install, then apt-get install x-window-system, and your favorite window manager.
2005-04-28T10:22:00.000Z	blueprism	nickrud	ah oki but i was wondering what if you want xorg instead?
2005-04-28T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	blueprism	that will get xorg :)
