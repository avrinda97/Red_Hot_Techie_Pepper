2004-12-17T15:00:00.000Z	tritium		This is strange...I just added universe and multiverse, and I can't find octave-forge with apt-cache search...
2004-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	tritium		I did that
2004-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	it is there
2004-12-17T15:02:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	I'm glad.  I do need it.  I wonder why I can't get it, though.
2004-12-17T15:02:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	try "sudo apt-get update" again
2004-12-17T15:02:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	I have done that a few times now.
2004-12-17T15:03:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	i dunno what to suggest. it's definitely in the hoary universe package. perhaps someone else will confirm warty
2004-12-17T15:25:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	:(
2004-12-17T15:26:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	Well, I guess I'll just dist-upgrade :)
2005-03-15T08:37:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	work is being done on usplash
2005-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	it hasn't been released?
2005-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	no, not yet.  But it's advantage over bootsplash is that it'll run in userspace.
2005-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	they've been working on it for ages haven't they?
2005-03-15T08:39:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	ubuntu has only been around since about October.  I wouldn't really call that "ages" yet ;)
2005-06-21T06:46:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	have you heard anything about the new drivers, whether they work and so on?
2005-06-21T06:46:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	no, I haven't...
2006-05-04T15:45:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	what kind of failure?
2006-05-04T15:46:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	 subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 2
2006-05-04T15:46:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	on occasion, I've edited the script
2006-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	good idea. lemme try that
2006-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	it sounds like a bug should be filed, but it'll help you remove it in the short term
2006-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	mdke	tritium	it's ok, it was my package. that's done the job, thanks
2006-05-04T15:48:00.000Z	tritium	mdke	:)
