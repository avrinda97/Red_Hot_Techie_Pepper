2012-09-10T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	ddrescue /dev/sda1  sda1.image logfile    ;)  if i remember
2012-09-10T20:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 took me about a month to recover 1tb befor.
2012-09-10T20:00:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	so it is normal?
2012-09-10T20:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 all sort of tricks/gimmicks to try to get the hd going.. none ive ever seen actually work
2012-09-10T20:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 its trying over and over.. it has settings to try just a few times. and move on.. check its docs.
2012-09-10T20:01:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	this hdd still seems to work, it is mounts, that's why I am trying
2012-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	I checked the docs, but no approximate data for this is provided so I was wandering if I should leave it copying
2012-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 you did use a logfile?
2012-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	yes
2012-09-10T20:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 then you can stop and start it again later, with differewnt options and so forth
2012-09-10T20:04:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	 ddrescue is reporting about 1000 errors up until now, I couldn't find what kind of errors are these
2012-09-10T20:04:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	I did stopped it and resumed
2012-09-10T20:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 file verify errors i imagine
2012-09-10T20:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 do a fast ddrewcue perhaps. then see if you recover what you need..
2012-09-10T20:06:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	I will check this 'fast' rescue and try
2012-09-10T20:07:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	thanks
2012-09-10T20:09:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	in the gddrescue docs nowhere I can find 'fast' option
2012-09-10T20:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	 use the options to make it faster.... ignore errors. retry ince. and  so on. the homepage has examples
2012-09-10T20:18:00.000Z	karamel4e	dr_willis	looking at it right now
2012-09-10T20:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	karamel4e	  last drive i tried to rescue started working. ( the ddrescue load freed it up?)  so i backed it up... then it died again a week later ;)
