2011-11-16T00:49:00.000Z	coder2		Hello. I have MP3 player. It is detected everywehere, except one computer. I have investigated that the player there is being detected as USB1.1 device. Please help.
2011-11-16T00:50:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	How old is the machine... Both the device and the mobo both have to support USB 2.0 etc for it to work.
2011-11-16T00:51:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	It might just be that the PC in question is too old to understand anything other that USB 1.1
2011-11-16T00:52:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	The mobo is GigaByte N650SLI-DS4 - NVidia 650i chipset. OS is lucid.
2011-11-16T00:53:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	The computer is working well with USB 2.0 flash
2011-11-16T00:55:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	OK... So the board is USB 2 capable.
2011-11-16T00:56:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	sure
2011-11-16T00:56:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Does the MP3 player detect as USB 2 in the other machines?
2011-11-16T00:57:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	Yes, It works well on my second computer. The same OS, but other mobo.
2011-11-16T00:58:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	I have a sneaking suspicion this might be a hardware issue, though exactly what, I'm not sure.
2011-11-16T00:59:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	What you could try doing is install another OS on this mobo and see if it detects it as USB 2. See whether it's down to the OS or the hardware.
2011-11-16T01:00:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	thanks.
2011-11-16T01:01:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	One note: the player was detected there only once.
2011-11-16T01:01:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Only once on which mobo... The Gigabyte in question or another?
2011-11-16T01:03:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	I have seen the player detected once on that gigabyte computer. And other USB2 devices: camera, flash, cellphone works well
2011-11-16T01:04:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Strange... Way strange. What changed since the MP3 player was detected sucessfully.
2011-11-16T01:05:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	nothing has changed.
2011-11-16T01:05:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	I'm having suspicions it may be a clash somewhere...
2011-11-16T01:08:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Maybe it's drawing too much power or something... A possibility.
2011-11-16T01:09:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Try fully charging it first, then connecting it up, if it detects it then, power is a possibility. Either that or connect it through a powered USB 2 hub.
2011-11-16T01:10:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	Either way, try and reduce the load on the USB.
2011-11-16T01:10:00.000Z	coder2	Gareth_Lock	I do not have powered USB hub. But I like your idea about charging, thanks
2011-11-16T01:11:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	coder2	No probs...
