2008-03-15T03:13:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	WMP11 v4
2008-03-15T03:14:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 have you looked into ndiswrapper?
2008-03-15T03:14:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	yes...
2008-03-15T03:15:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 and it didn't work?
2008-03-15T03:15:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	but how can I put that onto my server? lol n00b question... i know...
2008-03-15T03:15:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 you need to compile the source, and download the windows drivers for your card from linksys
2008-03-15T03:16:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 the ndiswrapper install doc explains how to do it
2008-03-15T03:16:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 also, check with synaptic, you should be able to download the binary direct
2008-03-15T03:16:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	ok, but how should i physically put it on my server... the source...
2008-03-15T03:16:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 flash drive, burned disc, ext HD
2008-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	is there an 'auto mount' because my USB controller is kinda weird on my server...
2008-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 plug in your usb drive, and type dmesg.
2008-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	ok i'll do that
2008-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 it should tell you the device node
2008-03-15T03:18:00.000Z	DrIP	inxane	:D thanks! i know what to do after that thanks again :)
2008-03-15T03:18:00.000Z	inxane	DrIP	 no problem... good luck
