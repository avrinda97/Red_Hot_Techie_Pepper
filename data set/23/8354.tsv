2008-04-16T23:20:00.000Z	littlerhody		hullo, can someone help me with my wireless card?
2008-04-16T23:20:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	can you type ifconfig in your terminal?
2008-04-16T23:21:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	i will try,
2008-04-16T23:22:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	so it says your wireless card is working
2008-04-16T23:23:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	it also says you have an ip address
2008-04-16T23:23:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	you there?
2008-04-16T23:34:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	what version of ubuntu are you running, and are you running gnome or kde?
2008-04-16T23:35:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	do you see other ssids?
2008-04-16T23:37:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	if you put the mouse over your wireless item up in the top right hand side of the menu, do you see other ssids?
2008-04-16T23:38:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	do you see yours?
2008-04-16T23:38:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	then the reason you cannot connect is because you have a wep key or something
2008-04-16T23:41:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	did you put the key in for the wpa?
2008-04-16T23:42:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	no, use the gui
2008-04-16T23:42:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	its easier
2008-04-16T23:44:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	wpa is picky, let me look at it for a second
2008-04-16T23:45:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	that is how you configure it, manual
2008-04-16T23:45:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	since you already have a good signal coming in, it will automatically connect after you exit x, which is control alt backspace
2008-04-16T23:47:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	reboot then
2008-04-16T23:47:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	you cant be on wired, and configure the wireless, it conflicts with the mac address
2008-04-16T23:47:00.000Z	adam_	littlerhody	no prob
