2009-12-02T03:11:00.000Z	mikepett		trying to install a package like: dpkg - i --ignore-depends=packagename.deb and I'm getting error: dpkg: need an action option. What am I doing wrong here?
2009-12-02T03:12:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	you're doing it backwards. the package name must follow "-i"
2009-12-02T03:12:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	ahhhh... thanks! Figured it was something simple.
2009-12-02T03:12:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	and what he said.
2009-12-02T03:13:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	wait... what? :)
2009-12-02T03:13:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	it's "-i" not "- i", as iceroot said. so dpkg --ignore-depends -i blah.deb
2009-12-02T03:14:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	ahhh, thought I had to follow depends with package name... I'll give it a shot
2009-12-02T03:15:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	doesn't work... says ignore-depends requires a legal package name. '-i' is not;
2009-12-02T03:15:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	maybe... --ignore-depends=packagename.deb -i packagename.deb?
2009-12-02T03:15:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	yes
2009-12-02T03:17:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	well, it still didn't ignore the dependency... it ran as if to install but still said error: dependency problems blah blah
2009-12-02T03:18:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	any ideas?
2009-12-02T03:18:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	note that the manpage says: " (actually, checking is performed, but only warnings about conflicts are given, nothing else). "
2009-12-02T03:18:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	so the fact itself that it gives you a message is normal
2009-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	doesn't appear to be so... it still won't allow me to install anything else.. so get the error saying the two packages must be removed because they have unmet dependcies. aarrrgg
2009-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	even if you tell dpkg to ignore dependencies, APT won't ignore them...
2009-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	LjL		!info equivs | mikepett maybe you should just use this instead?
2009-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	crap
2009-12-02T03:23:00.000Z	LjL		Sm0ke0ut: hi
2009-12-02T03:23:00.000Z	LjL		Sm0ke0ut: when i typed "!info equivs | mikepett maybe you should just use this instead?", that somehow made you send me a private notice. could you disable that?
2009-12-02T03:24:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	I'd love to but I don't see any option in Colloquy where that could be configured
2009-12-02T03:25:00.000Z	mikepett	LjL	thanks for the help btw.
2009-12-02T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	mikepett	uh, not you, Sm0ke0ut did that
