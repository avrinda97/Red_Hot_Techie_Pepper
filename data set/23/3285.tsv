2012-01-15T21:51:00.000Z	LjL	meco	then that points even further to what Seveas said, port 123 being blocked...
2012-01-15T22:17:00.000Z	LjL	meco	your ISP, don't ask me why
2012-01-15T22:18:00.000Z	meco	LjL	Is it possible for anyone here to try and connect to me on that protocol/port?
2012-01-15T22:20:00.000Z	LjL	meco	well NTP uses UDP so there isn't really a "connection" made, we could use netcat but i'm not entirely sure how
2012-01-15T22:22:00.000Z	LjL	meco	your current IP has all ports filtered, so you're running a firewall or something
2012-01-15T22:27:00.000Z	meco	LjL	But where would that firewall be? Surely not on this pc since I've installed Ubuntu on it and have never set up any firewalling.
2012-01-15T22:28:00.000Z	LjL	meco	i wouldn't know, actually i'm not even sure whether Ubuntu has a firewall enabled by default as of late. try typing "sudo ufw status"
2012-01-15T22:31:00.000Z	meco	LjL	Status: inactive
2012-01-15T22:31:00.000Z	LjL	meco	are you sure your modem isn't also a router (and a firewall)?
2012-01-15T22:32:00.000Z	meco	LjL	Nop, not at all, but I know there's a box between the pc and the router.
2012-01-15T22:33:00.000Z	LjL	meco	what does the command "route" say under "Gateway"?
2012-01-15T22:33:00.000Z	meco	LjL	All blank entries
2012-01-15T22:34:00.000Z	meco	LjL	There are three entries. The first one says 10.0.0.1 and the next two say *
2012-01-15T22:35:00.000Z	LjL	meco	ok, connect to http://10.0.0.1/ from a browser, that'll be your router
2012-01-15T22:35:00.000Z	meco	LjL	"A username and password are being requested by http://10.0.0.1. The site says: "Netopia 3351""
2012-01-15T22:37:00.000Z	LjL	meco	yeah, they might be "admin" "admin" or they might be something else
2012-01-15T22:38:00.000Z	meco	LjL	something else...
2012-01-15T22:39:00.000Z	LjL	meco	uhm, Google doesn't seem to know the default username/password for the Netopia 3351 :\
2012-01-15T22:40:00.000Z	LjL	meco	try empty and empty, or "netopia" and "netopia", or "admin" and "1234", or combinations
2012-01-15T22:45:00.000Z	meco	LjL	Nothing so far
2012-01-15T22:45:00.000Z	LjL	meco	check the physical modem, sometimes they have the default password and username printed underneath
2012-01-15T22:57:00.000Z	meco	LjL	Nah... the physical modem doesn't give any clue, at least not anything that looks like username/password to me.
