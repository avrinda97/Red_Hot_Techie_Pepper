2011-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	bteres		Hi all. I have a FAT32 hardrive and all my data appears to be missing. I can't view it but the drive is not empty. Is there any way for me to repair this?
2011-07-29T15:43:00.000Z	bteres		r00t: in terminal?
2011-07-29T15:43:00.000Z	bteres		*r000t
2011-07-29T15:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 what happened to the disk?  Can you mount it by hand?
2011-07-29T15:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 so df -h   shows it being full? empty? or what?
2011-07-29T15:47:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	how do I do that?
2011-07-29T15:48:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	Excuse that ignorant question.
2011-07-29T15:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 do what? 'df -h'  ? open a terminal.. type it in.. see what % used is..
2011-07-29T15:48:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	It shows 96% usage which is about right
2011-07-29T15:48:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	The drive did have very little availabel space before I had an issue
2011-07-29T15:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 so if you cd to the mountmoint and do a 'ls -R' it may or may not show the files...
2011-07-29T15:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 its possible they all got moved to some subdir
2011-07-29T15:50:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	What exactly should I be looking for in the 'ls -R'? Seems like a lot...
2011-07-29T15:54:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	How can I use 'ls-R' but only print one page at a time? It is removing all the important stuff from the terminal window
2011-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 so it is showing files then? and not just the directorie names?
2011-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 'ls -R | less'
2011-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 you said the disk looked empty.. so ls showing a lot is a good sign i guess. :)
2011-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	It only shows the _restore data. I'm sure there is a sector issue or something.
2011-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	All the expected data folders are empty.
2011-07-29T16:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 so where did _restore come from?
2011-07-29T16:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	bteres	 you may want to ask in #windows for advice on scan/repairing a fat filesystem.  theres numerous live cd's that can help fix/recover things. but i tend to just dd the whole drive  a image file and fsck it.. that may not be the 'best' way.
2011-07-29T16:08:00.000Z	bteres	dr_willis	Sorry, my connection dropped. The _restore stuff is in System Volume Information. I think its Windows stuff. Not too sure
