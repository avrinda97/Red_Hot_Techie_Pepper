2010-04-07T08:07:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	what happens when you select ubuntu in that menu?
2010-04-07T08:08:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	what happens when you select ubuntu in that menu?
2010-04-07T08:09:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	sure
2010-04-07T08:10:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	show a picture of what it shows when you boot to ubuntu
2010-04-07T08:15:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	the same way you started vista from that menu is how you start ubuntu
2010-04-07T08:15:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	if that is not starting ubuntu then it means there is something wrong with your ubuntu install
2010-04-07T08:24:00.000Z	Da-M-E-M-0	chelz	do u know my problem
2010-04-07T08:25:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	if you can somehow pastebin a picture of what your screen displays after you select ubuntu in Grub i might be able to make sense of it
2010-04-07T08:28:00.000Z	Da-M-E-M-0	chelz	im googling the problem. i saw many people having probs with it. it says something with the grub is defect

2010-04-07T08:46:00.000Z	chelz	Da-M-E-M-0	well i'm not sure why grub is doing that, but this might fix it: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover%20Grub%202%20via%20LiveCD
