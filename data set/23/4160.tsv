2008-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	Guiri		Just to clarify, the server is up and running with apache,php & sql. I just need to edit the current wordpress configuration, wherever it is, and tell it to only allow certain domains
2008-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	Guiri		and I'm looking into apache
2008-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	Guiri		.conf
2008-07-09T07:26:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	you can use a directory stanza and define what subnets to allow from
2008-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	Guiri	id10t	thanks. let me update on where I am: there's nothing in apache2.conf or /etc/wordpress like there is in dokuwiki. I do see a /var/www/wordpress symlink though. I'm just unsure where exactly to place my virtualhost command or my "directory stanza"
2008-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	if you have /var/www/wordpress then your main apache2 config file ... in /etc/apache2/sites-available
2008-07-09T07:28:00.000Z	Guiri	id10t	Pehrpas in httpd.conf?
2008-07-09T07:28:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	probably named 00default or something similar
2008-07-09T07:28:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	in fact, the default config has a limited access example for the /usr/share/doc directory allowed from localhost only
2008-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	so wp is available at yourdomain.com/wordpress now.
2008-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	there is an install/setup script that you load via a browser to do that part of it...
2008-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	Guiri		idyeah. I'm in the default file. It has Virtualhost *.80
2008-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	look at the bottom of that file
2008-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	Guiri		so essentially I want to deny any *80 not from a domain
2008-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	Guiri	id10t	in the bottom I have a custom https rewrite
2008-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	ah..
2008-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	one sec and i'll c/p it to you
2008-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	Guiri	id10t	the /doc alias?
2008-07-09T07:31:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	yup
2008-07-09T07:31:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	see the last line of it - Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
2008-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	Guiri	id10t	testing now. Allow from can be a domain right?
2008-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	Guiri		otherwise I'll have to lookup my dns servers
2008-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	id10t	Guiri	umm... dunno
