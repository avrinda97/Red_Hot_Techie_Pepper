2006-06-09T11:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight		someone know about about easy ubuntu?
2006-06-09T11:20:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	Yes, it works quite well
2006-06-09T11:30:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	It defaults to the highest available
2006-06-09T11:31:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	You can use xrandr to get a nice, small display on a nice, high resolution display :)
2006-06-09T11:31:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Warbo	ok, but why can't i change it like with any other distro at screen resolution? I don't like having ot manually edit xconf
2006-06-09T11:32:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-06-09T11:33:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-06-09T11:34:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	like I said before :)
2006-06-09T11:35:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	I SAID sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg !!
2006-06-09T11:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Warbo	thx. i don't like doing it that way, but i'll have to, hmpf...
2006-06-14T13:41:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	RealPlayer is available for Linux, but I find Totem better for realmedia since in RealPlayer the picture freezes and only updates every few seconds (in my experience)
2006-06-14T13:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Warbo	id use totem but it wont open  mms://202.184.158.12:3003/worldcup2006
2006-06-14T13:43:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	I have found Totems Internet capabilities lacking, yes (when playing RealPlayer files you cannot skip forwards or back, so if the stream loses it's connection halfway through you either have to start it again or [try to]  watch it in RealPlayer)
2006-06-14T13:45:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	copy it to a command line (gmplayer uses a GUI)
2006-06-14T13:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Warbo	i use xine backend
2006-06-14T13:47:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	MPlayer uses it's own engine which usually works (I prefer Totem for it's UI though :))
2006-06-14T14:02:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	Many applications are only accessible by default on the command line (you can put them in the menu with Alacarte)
2006-06-14T14:04:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	The server doesn't respond for me (don't even get as far as codec issues)
2006-07-11T05:19:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	KDE=Config tool GNOME=Drag 'n' Drop
2006-07-11T05:19:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	Put them in fonts:
2006-07-11T05:19:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	(with ctrl-L)
2006-07-11T05:20:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	Some are for your user, some are for the system
2006-08-22T15:37:00.000Z	Warbo	livingdaylight	read the topic ^^^^
