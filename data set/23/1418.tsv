2010-04-09T16:50:00.000Z	frootee		is there a way to stop your system from freezing when you're running a lot of applications on a low-medium end machine?
2010-04-09T16:51:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	don't use gnome
2010-04-09T16:51:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	use what then?
2010-04-09T16:52:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	sorry, wrong name in tab completion, i meant that to go to jeeez
2010-04-09T16:53:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	agh, getting everything messed up... that was for you... try fluxbox
2010-04-09T16:53:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	you can install fluxbox on ubuntu?
2010-04-09T16:53:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	yeah, 'sudo apt-get install fluxbox'
2010-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	wait, I thought that was for 10.04 onlt
2010-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	? fluxbox has been around for a long time... it's a light window manager
2010-04-09T16:55:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	will it make things more difficult?
2010-04-09T16:55:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	it's different than gnome, and takes a bit of setting up... if you want something closer to gnome, you can use xfce4
2010-04-09T16:57:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	i've found that memory doesn't tend to be the issue, it's usually processor speed
2010-04-09T16:57:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	my machines usually run steady around 150-200 Mb of RAM
2010-04-09T16:58:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	and these window managers free up cpu?
2010-04-09T16:59:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	what other applications are you running alot of? if you want to run alot of browser instances, that's actually probably your problem...
2010-04-09T17:00:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	low-medium end
2010-04-09T17:00:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	so stop running multiple browsers?
2010-04-09T17:01:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	not necesarilly... if you're using firefox, changing browsers would certainly help...
2010-04-09T17:01:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	but it really tends to be flash that eats everything
2010-04-09T17:03:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	and there's nothing we can do about flash x_x
2010-04-09T17:03:00.000Z	frootee	chao06	what about using no-script?
2010-04-09T17:03:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	that would definitely help : )
2010-04-09T17:04:00.000Z	chao06	frootee	no problem : )
