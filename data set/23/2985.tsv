2012-07-28T17:26:00.000Z	Roberto		Hi ! I have a question about installing an app manualy, Could you help me ?
2012-07-28T17:28:00.000Z	Roberto		I just installed hubiC-browser (something like dropbox|ubuntu one) in /opt. I would like to be able to call it in the term so i putted a symLink in /usr/local/bin
2012-07-28T17:30:00.000Z	Roberto		problem is: when I call it I got this error: /usr/local/bin/hubiC-browser: 18: /usr/local/bin/hubiC-browser: /usr/local/bin//opt/ovh/hubiC-browser/.hubiC-browser-bin: not found
2012-07-28T17:31:00.000Z	Roberto		why i try to go to /usr/local/bin//opt/... ?
2012-07-28T17:31:00.000Z	Roberto		*it
2012-07-28T17:31:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	because you called kn the wrong way.
2012-07-28T17:31:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	You did it wrong :)
2012-07-28T17:34:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	hunhun... I tried it before and just tried it again but still don't work... :S
2012-07-28T17:35:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	whats the full path to your original file?
2012-07-28T17:36:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	sudo ln -s /opt/ovh/hubiC-browser/hubiC-browser /usr/local/bin/hubiC-browser
2012-07-28T17:36:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	And where is /usr/local/bin/hubiC-browser now pointing to? Check it with ls -lha /usr/local/bin/hubiC-browser
2012-07-28T17:37:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	seems to be good...
2012-07-28T17:37:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	And /opt/ovh/hubiC-browser/hubiC-browser is executable? Check it with ls -lha too
2012-07-28T17:39:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	And how exactly are you trying to invoke that binary then?
2012-07-28T17:40:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	problem is: it seems it find the exec file but this file call an other wich is in /opt/..... but he try to find it in the wrong place
2012-07-28T17:40:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	And how exactly are you trying to invoke that binary then?
2012-07-28T17:40:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	using the terminal
2012-07-28T17:40:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	And then staring at it? :D Which command exactly are you running?
2012-07-28T17:41:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	then forget about the symlink, and use an alias instead.
2012-07-28T17:42:00.000Z	Roberto	bekks	cause it's a shity script ?
2012-07-28T17:42:00.000Z	bekks	Roberto	Exactly.
