2005-10-11T08:31:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	I've never heard of it

2005-10-11T08:33:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	ha ha
2005-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	troy14	DonL	That was great...
2005-10-11T08:38:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	fc4 messed my system up big time or I would maybe still be using Fedora and not knowing the benefits of Ubuntu
2005-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	troy14	DonL	I tried ubuntu on a tip from a friend, and have been hooked since.
2005-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	it really is nice the choice we have. The "other people" have no choice
2005-10-11T08:41:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	I haven't got that far yet. They call me network administrator because nobody knows dick about computers, but the most I've done is install Firefox on some machines
2005-10-11T08:42:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	me too, big time. Been almost five years now
2005-10-11T08:44:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	had to un virus a machine today. Took about 2 hours. Ad stuff, virus stuff. you name it
2005-10-11T08:48:00.000Z	troy14	DonL	I use Panda, and I have better luck with that than any other av software I have tried. I also use Ad Aware, Spybot and actually the M$ Anti-Spyware program is pretty good.
2005-10-11T08:48:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	haven't used any of those, but will keep them in mind. Thanks!
2005-10-11T08:49:00.000Z	DonL	troy14	sorry. I use SpyBot and AdAware
