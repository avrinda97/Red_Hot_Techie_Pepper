2007-03-29T14:25:00.000Z	mzracer360		how do I give my webserver permission to /home/derek/... ?
2007-03-29T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	make a public_html folder inside of your homedir.  then go to http://your.ip/~derek/
2007-03-29T14:28:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	the folder I want access to is already created, but when I try to access it through PHP i get a Permission Denied error
2007-03-29T14:28:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	You need to make sure it's readable by the php user (www-data).
2007-03-29T14:29:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	can you explain to me how I do that?  thanks
2007-03-29T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	set your homedir to be readable by others
2007-03-29T14:29:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	I've already done a chmod 777 on the folder without any luck
2007-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	777, eh?  Thats... not ever a good solution.
2007-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	I imagine it has soemthing to do with PHP being jailed.  You might ask in ##php, they'll be able to help more.
2007-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	thats what a teacher of mine had me do when i asked him
2007-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	your teacher doesn't care about your security, apparently.
2007-03-29T14:31:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	lol, guess not
2007-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	how are you restarting apache?
2007-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	wow.  That... howto is horrible.
2007-04-05T15:27:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	do you know of a better how-to, I really want to start streaming!
2007-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	Don't edit httpd.conf, Ubuntu doesn't use it.  In /mods-available/ you should have a .load and a .conf file for mod_musicindex, check and see.
2007-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	I didn't edit httpd.cond, I used Tragos' post from that same tread.  and I have a musicindex.load in /mods-available/
2007-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	Ah.  I didn't read down.  Glad someone has some sense ;)  Let me read the whole thread
2007-04-05T15:33:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	ah, right.  Glad he got that straightened out.  Also, in the future, you don't need to symlink, use a2enmod and a2ensite to enable mods and sites.  Anyway, that wouldn't cause this issue
2007-04-06T05:53:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	no idea.  I'e never used it.
2007-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	ok, i got it working BTW, i just needed to restart the whole machine, and not just Apache
2007-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	Flannel	mzracer360	thats... rather odd.
2007-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	mzracer360	Flannel	one last question before I go, how do I cd to a folder that has a space character in it
