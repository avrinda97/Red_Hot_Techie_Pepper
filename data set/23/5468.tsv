2006-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	webben		If you're using Edgy, best to use the packages from sid
2006-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	webben		put deb http://deb.opera.com/opera sid non-free in /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	webben		you'll need to install the GPG key too
2006-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	actually, you can load on the dapper deb.
2006-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	it works quite well.
2006-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	I'm not saying it won't work. It's just not what I recommend.
2006-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	AFAIK Canonical doesn't do the packaging for the commercial repo. So it's probably better to use the latest Opera packages.
2006-11-21T10:17:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	just offering alternatives.
2006-11-21T10:17:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	yeah, but I've run into major issues with debian debs before on edgy.
2006-11-21T10:17:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	deb's generally sure
2006-11-21T10:18:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	but the Opera deb is okay AFAIK.
2006-11-21T10:18:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	quite likely.
2006-11-21T10:18:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	generally the opera corp is pretty good about that.
2006-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	you aren't talking about pulling the source for opera are you?
2006-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	no
2006-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	not so much anymore. They've fixed a lot of the major ones.
2006-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	I'm talking about the backports stuff.
2006-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	ah. Good, got a bit freaked there.
2006-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	According to one of the two Linux Flash devs... still very broken in Opera.
2006-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	ah, well then I'm thinking of something else. Perhaps something with opera, flash and wine.
2006-11-21T10:21:00.000Z	webben	Dragonfyre	details here: http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/11/flash-player-9-for-linux-beta-2.html
2006-11-21T10:21:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	I'll check it out.
2006-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	Dragonfyre	webben	Ah, well that blows what I said out of the water. Definately thinking of something else then. Perhaps wine dev like I said.
