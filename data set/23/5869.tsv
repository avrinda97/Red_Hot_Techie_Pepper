2009-02-03T13:11:00.000Z	Gumby		Does anyone here know if a partition table can be changed from GPT to something that windows can recognize ?  My windows boot disk only sees the HDD as one partition even though it is 4 partitions.
2009-02-03T13:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	dangerous stuff
2009-02-03T13:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	I recommend backing up first
2009-02-03T13:12:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	so is create a partition table that other OS's cant read.
2009-02-03T13:12:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	not that I like windows at all, but why would ubuntu do this?
2009-02-03T13:13:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	what is the fs?
2009-02-03T13:13:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	I mean hell, even cfdisk cant read GTP.
2009-02-03T13:15:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	fs right now is irrelevant as the XP installer (as well as vista) dont even see a single partition.  Just an unformatted drive
2009-02-03T13:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	not familiar with that one.. like I said, back it up and format it accordingly
2009-02-03T13:15:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	however I have ntfs, fat32, and ext3 partition
2009-02-03T13:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	all those extentions are readable from within windows
2009-02-03T13:16:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	ext3 requires a plugin though
2009-02-03T13:16:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	IF  the windows installer (or windows) can even see a GPT
2009-02-03T13:16:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	which it can not
2009-02-03T13:17:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	what is GPT.. sorry ,don't recognize the accronym
2009-02-03T13:17:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	its the partition table format that intrepid uses
2009-02-03T13:17:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	k sorry
2009-02-03T13:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	I stuck with ext3...
2009-02-03T13:18:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	ext is a filesystem type, not a partition table
2009-02-03T13:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	yes with you so far
2009-02-03T13:19:00.000Z	Gumby	tyler_d	so sticking with ext3 doesnt mean anything in this case.  thats not the issue.  the issue is the partition table itself can not be read.
2009-02-03T13:19:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	sounds like you know more then me sir...
2009-02-03T13:19:00.000Z	tyler_d	Gumby	which really doesn't say alot though ;)
