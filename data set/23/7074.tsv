2005-12-20T13:17:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	just install the right packages
2005-12-20T13:18:00.000Z	AMDXP	LoppApan	i installed apache2 and php4
2005-12-20T13:18:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	libapache2-mod-php4
2005-12-20T13:19:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	php is also a scriptlanguage, you installed that. Not the apachemodule
2005-12-20T13:19:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	exactly
2005-12-20T13:20:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	yup
2005-12-20T13:20:00.000Z	AMDXP	LoppApan	thanks you are a life saver
2005-12-20T13:20:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	np
2005-12-20T13:24:00.000Z	AMDXP	LoppApan	should i remove and try reinstalling all the packages
2005-12-20T13:25:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	I guess that's a quick fix. But strange it is.
2005-12-20T13:26:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	gonna check a server out with breezy and php. Try removing and reinstall in the meantime
2005-12-20T13:27:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	no worry, this is solutionable :)
2005-12-20T13:28:00.000Z	AMDXP	LoppApan	i surfed the forums and a lot of people have been having the same issues no one has a real clear cut solution
2005-12-20T13:29:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	strange, I installed a number of servers, I always find breezy to be the fastest to set apache php mysql up on
2005-12-20T13:30:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	ok, well, it IS going to work :)
2005-12-20T13:30:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	you tried removing apache php libapache2-mod-php4? stopped the services, then install it all over again?
2005-12-20T13:34:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	good. I'm looking through some conf-files so we can compare later
2005-12-20T13:38:00.000Z	LoppApan	AMDXP	I'm off to a meeting, be back in a few hours, hope you solve it. You could pm me about it. Good luck!
