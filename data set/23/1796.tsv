2012-01-17T12:59:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		My installation keeps freezing on me.  It boots, and runs for varying times and then just freezes.  Can someone tell me how to run a harddisk check?
2012-01-17T12:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	check your ram too, memory
2012-01-17T13:00:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	HOw would I check it?  Take all RAM out, then put one back, boot and leave it to run, then add one and leave it running etc.?
2012-01-17T13:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	there is the memory check option on the grub menu, something that can be done at startup, also your machine must have it in the bios menu
2012-01-17T13:01:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	Thank you.
2012-01-17T13:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	must/may/hope
2012-01-17T13:04:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	It is an Lubuntu machine... no Grub menu appears.  It just goes straight into boot.
2012-01-17T13:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	how about in the bios?
2012-01-17T13:05:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	No :(
2012-01-17T13:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	i wont tell you how to configure grub, not comfortable doing it, but grub can be configured to allow you the time you need to use the 'check mem' option
2012-01-17T13:09:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	Nevermind Grub hehehe  The machine does not even boot anymore.  It starts up, BIOS shows devices etc and then where it usually would say "Starting Windows" or whatever on a Windows machine it just reboots, over and over and over.
2012-11-29T09:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	lets assume google-chat does, what would you do?
2012-11-29T09:33:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	Um, try to get Skyp working because all my contacts use it :)
2012-11-29T09:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	do you have vlc installed?
2012-11-29T09:34:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	Nope.
2012-11-29T09:35:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	Should I?
2012-11-29T09:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	there must be a settings screen for skype, what options do you have for 'camera'?
2012-11-29T09:36:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	None.  Skype dos not detct the camera, but lsusb shows that it is there.
2012-11-29T09:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	no setup area for the camera?
2012-11-29T09:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	in skype?
2012-11-29T09:37:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	No camera in Skype
2012-11-29T09:44:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	almoxarife	So Skype will not work :(
2012-11-29T10:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	Ascavasaion	heres a thought, install pidgin along with the skype plugin, install skype, use pidgin to control skype, pidgin does allow for setup of vid/voice
