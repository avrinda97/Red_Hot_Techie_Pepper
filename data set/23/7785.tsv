2006-01-22T12:59:00.000Z	something_else		gnome is so retarded sometimes it pisses me off
2006-01-22T12:59:00.000Z	something_else		ok I dunno where that came from :|
2006-01-22T13:00:00.000Z	something_else		have any of u seen equinox desktop environment?
2006-01-22T13:00:00.000Z	something_else		looks like windows, but looks better than both kde and gnome
2006-01-22T13:01:00.000Z	something_else		it actually looks like something thats designed to be used, rather than a few kids sitting there battling it out to win desktop wars
2006-01-22T13:02:00.000Z	something_else		u try it on urself
2006-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	something_else		i feel like killing gnome :|
2006-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	something_else		:|
2006-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	i feel like killing KDE -_-
2006-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	xfce? flux? e? :P
2006-01-22T13:08:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	try IceWM, and download Puppy Linux... see if you like either of the WM/DE included on there
2006-01-22T13:08:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	also, see if you like some minimal WM plus PerlPanel... it's an awesome panel
2006-01-22T13:17:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	are you looking for a panel as configurable as gnome-panel, but without the gnome-lib connections and heavy-weight?
2006-01-22T13:17:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	more configurable then gnome-panel
2006-01-22T13:18:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	good luck...
2006-01-22T13:18:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	thanks ... lol
2006-01-22T13:18:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	i've been searching for that majic panel for month
2006-01-22T13:19:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	its coz developers are reluctant to listen to users :|
2006-01-22T13:19:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	you figured this out when?
2006-01-22T13:20:00.000Z	benplaut	something_else	have you found the majik text editor yet?
2006-01-22T13:20:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	pico works fine
2006-01-22T13:22:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	no, eclipse is for that
2006-01-22T13:24:00.000Z	something_else	benplaut	I suppose ...
