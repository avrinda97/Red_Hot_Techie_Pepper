2007-10-05T16:45:00.000Z	bruenig		gaim I guess
2007-10-05T16:46:00.000Z	bruenig		!info irssi
2007-10-05T09:48:00.000Z	bruenig		it isn't automatically done for him, they all run as root
2007-10-05T09:48:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	oh - well, then I stand corrected :)
2007-10-05T09:53:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	thats right, you have to choose stability vs bleeding edge
2007-10-05T09:54:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	you misunderstand the issue
2007-10-05T09:55:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	sorry - what's the issue again?
2007-10-05T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	it's a fear of ubuntu's own incompetence that creates the biggest hesitation, not of the updated software per se
2007-10-05T09:55:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	I'm not sure I agree
2007-10-05T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	I assure you, there are rolling release distros which are constantly up to date, and they have no more problems, and in fact tend to have less due to the lack of enormous upgrading of all package simultaneously
2007-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	well it's a distro-philosophy difference. Ubuntu/Canonical wanted defined releases, not rolling releases
2007-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	right but my point is that, it isn't new software that is unstable, it is packagers who screw up that is unstable
2007-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	I disagree, but I don't think it's relevant to this channel
2007-10-05T09:59:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	you can't just assert disagreement, this is not even an opinion based analysis
2007-10-05T09:59:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	they fear what happened with X a while back, when the packager screwed up and people had to roam around console for a while, that X update was not even close to having problems, the package did
2007-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	I accept that packager error does happen. I dispute that it is the primary source of error.
2007-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	on what basis
2007-10-05T10:02:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	I agree that it is high stakes. I agree that packager error does happen. I don't know the breakdown of what causes the most errors, but my personal experience is that packager error is less frequent than software error, but I don't have any stats to back this up (if you do, I'd love to see them)
2007-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	please give an example then
2007-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	I think thta is an overgeneralisation
2007-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	yeah - i'm dropping it :)
2007-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	danielax	thinks that contradicting is equal to a real position
2007-10-05T10:15:00.000Z	danielax	bruenig	but it's so true!!! :P
