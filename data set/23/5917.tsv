2006-08-03T09:47:00.000Z	typhoid		how can you tell if your outbound is being redirected?  i think something fishy is going on w/ my wireless.. it is really really slow for most things, but.. like synaptic is really fast..
2006-08-03T09:48:00.000Z	typhoid		it takes forever to connect to irc servers, to im clients and to http sources &~&~
2006-08-03T09:49:00.000Z	typhoid		h3h.. im pretty sure you can
2006-08-03T09:49:00.000Z	typhoid		duocore/dual procs != x64
2006-08-03T09:51:00.000Z	typhoid		um...
2006-08-03T09:52:00.000Z	typhoid		im pretty sure duocores != x64...
2006-08-03T09:53:00.000Z	typhoid		nah.. duos is just like.. it acts like 2 cpus..   64 means it has 64 bits of memory addresses... you could i suppose have 64 bit duocores but they are not the same thing
2006-08-03T09:53:00.000Z	typhoid		64 bit is good .. if you have 64 bit proggies that can use the extra memory addressing..
2006-08-03T09:53:00.000Z	sasquatch	typhoid	but laptops don't have that many DIMMs anyways...
2006-08-03T09:54:00.000Z	sasquatch	typhoid	errr... 64-bit and dual core are unrelated
2006-08-03T09:55:00.000Z	sasquatch	typhoid	yes.. they have a wider bus... haha
2006-08-03T10:00:00.000Z	sasquatch	typhoid	but servers usually have more than 1 processor anyways :-)
