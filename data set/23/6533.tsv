2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	krang	kakashi	it's the latency of the RAM
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	krang	kakashi	I think you can set it in BIOS
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	krang	kakashi	smaller=faster
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	kakashi	krang	i know this already but what does mean latency?

2006-05-27T11:49:00.000Z	krang	kakashi	careful though, sometimes it gets unstable if it's too low, depends on the RAM you have
