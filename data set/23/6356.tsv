2007-08-04T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	 w or who
2007-08-04T09:23:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	and this will not erm give me repitions ?
2007-08-04T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	have you tried it?
2007-08-04T09:24:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	one sec.
2007-08-04T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	it just lists users and either uptime/load or some extra info
2007-08-04T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	either will do ( w or who )
2007-08-04T09:26:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	suppose a user is using two shells at the same time, it will show his name twice. the problem is i just need that name once.
2007-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	do you realise my problem ?
2007-08-04T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	who | cut -f1 -d" " | sort -u
2007-08-04T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	works for you?
2007-08-04T09:30:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	yes it does.
2007-08-04T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	:)
2007-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	no worries :)
2007-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	do you understand what I did?
2007-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	no.
2007-08-04T09:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	sort -u sorts by unique lines, the cut part cuts at the first field delimited by a space and discards the rest
2007-08-04T09:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	the | pipes output to the following commands
2007-08-04T09:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	 cut -f1 -d" "  <-- only print the bit before the first space
2007-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	shriphani	thoreauputic	i see.
2007-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	then sort to only get uniques lines
2007-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	it helps a lot, yeah :)
2007-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shriphani	hahah
