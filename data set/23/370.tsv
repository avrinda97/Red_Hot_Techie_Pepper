2011-10-30T02:06:00.000Z	syra		are there files in root you can't copy?
2011-10-30T02:06:00.000Z	syra		i know there are a few, anyone know which ones?
2011-10-30T02:08:00.000Z	syra		the customization choices are limited by your ability to program them
2011-10-30T02:09:00.000Z	syra		don't get on my case about running as root
2011-10-30T02:09:00.000Z	syra		i wan't to do it until i learn my lesson
2011-10-30T02:09:00.000Z	syra		otherwise /root acts like /home
2011-10-30T02:10:00.000Z	syra		but theres a difference.
2011-10-30T02:10:00.000Z	syra		and try logging on, it doesn't work for me
2011-10-30T02:12:00.000Z	syra		after doing all that, which worked... that user could not log in
2011-10-30T02:12:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	are you on backtrack?
2011-10-30T02:13:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	not for nuch longer
2011-10-30T02:13:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	just add the ubuntu repos and do an update and your system will be ubuntu with backtrack stuff perfectly
2011-10-30T02:14:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	didn't work for me, on the standard repos update -d failed
2011-10-30T02:14:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	i used the update manager and followed instructions exactly, but after the complete upgrade i had code erros on boot
2011-10-30T02:15:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	oh... alright idk then
2011-10-30T02:15:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	try installing normal ubuntu and just use a bt5 usb for pentesting
2011-10-30T02:16:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	no biggie, i'm going to give 11.10 a good live boot, see if my system likes it and then install various backtrack apps, aircrack, zenmap, the framework etc via the backtrack repos and it won't matter at all
2011-10-30T02:17:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	if you have onwership problems you can do chown [username here] -hR ./dir_with_ur_s3ttingz
2011-10-30T02:17:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	it will take care of all of the subdirs and files
2011-10-30T02:18:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	so, practically speaking... i might hit a few snags here and there, but root hidden and program files/folders must be recusivlely chowned and copied... i'm skeptical ;]
2011-10-30T02:19:00.000Z	[snake]	syra	why not use 10.04?
2011-10-30T02:20:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	am using 10.04 now and am satisfied
2011-10-30T02:20:00.000Z	syra	[snake]	just playing mate
