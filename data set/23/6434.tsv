2008-06-07T17:14:00.000Z	mnemo		can someone post their output of "sudo fdisk -l" using a working dual-boot windows+ubuntu installation ( at paste.ubuntu.com or similar) ??
2008-06-07T17:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 what do you plain on learning from that?
2008-06-07T17:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 my system -> 4 primary partitions. (windows) (windows) (linux) (swap)
2008-06-07T17:15:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	which one has the "boot" flag on it?
2008-06-07T17:16:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	  I belive the first one.. but i beliuve that grub dosent care about the boot flag.
2008-06-07T17:16:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	do you know if I can just edit menu.lst directly or do I need to run some command afterwards???
2008-06-07T17:16:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 on my all linux systems I dont think any of the partitions are bootable.
2008-06-07T17:17:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 depends on what you change.  The  config file has settings that grub uses,, then the special #commented settings - that update-grub uses..
2008-06-07T17:17:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 be sure to backup your existing config. :)
2008-06-07T17:20:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	  ive seen that error befor.. but dont rember what it means. You may want to check the grub homepage/manual and learn some more grub essentials.  and yes.. ive fought with grub/lilo over the ages.. and it can be frustrating. :)
2008-06-07T17:21:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 i would say either the  grub config is looking at the wrong filesystem, or the filesystem is currupted.  from what i am reading.
2008-06-07T17:23:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	since I just removed one partition I think that sounds reasonable... but I alredy edited menu.lst to fix it...
2008-06-07T17:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 you do rember that grub starts Numbering at 0? :)
2008-06-07T17:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 also dont try to boot a extended partition.. but the logical IN the extended.
2008-06-07T17:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 ive lerned from accidently trying to doo all this in the past. :P
2008-06-07T17:25:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	i think I have three primary partitions --> http://rafb.net/p/37ySVg40.html   looks correct, no?
2008-06-07T17:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 did you 'resize' these partitions with  gparted?  thers a gap in the Numbering of the cylinders I notice..
2008-06-07T17:27:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	nah, I used the built in partition resize in Vista to shrink my NTFS partition and then I also removed another NTFS partition completely
2008-06-07T17:28:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 so you just deleted some partitions in the middle. (thats why the #'s jump) eh?  Its possible the uuid's have changed. but i think thats only if you rezise the linux partitions.
2008-06-07T17:29:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	I believe there should be a big gap because I left unpartitioned space... because I wanted to let windows modify the NTFS and then let gparted expand my ext2 partitions later on (I wanted to let each tool do only what it does best)
2008-06-07T17:32:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 you could just try making a empty partition in the middle... :)  or use the grubs shell to 'find' the location of the  boot files.  and get the proper hd #.,#
2008-06-07T17:39:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mnemo	 so the empty space was still being numbered? goofing you up?  or what exactly webt wrong?
2008-06-07T17:41:00.000Z	mnemo	dr_Willis	since I deleted one my NTFS partitions the index in menu.lst was wrong... my linux partition used to be (hd0,2) but when I deleted the extra NTFS partition I had my linux partition at (hd0,1) instead.... I had already figured out how to boot a livecd and update the menu.lst chaning (hd0,2) into (hd0,1) but that was not sufficient.... the final step that fixed it for me was starting the grub command line tool using "sudo grub" and then running
