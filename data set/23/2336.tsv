2010-01-04T19:54:00.000Z	Dunkirk		Is there a way to `apt-get upgrade' only the security-related packages?
2010-01-04T19:55:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	nah don't do it
2010-01-04T19:55:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	can get the updates
2010-01-04T19:56:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	I'm not following you. What do you mean "can get the updates?"
2010-01-04T19:56:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	in update manager settings, can set to security updates only
2010-01-04T19:56:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	Ahh....
2010-01-04T20:00:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	what's broken about 9.10?
2010-01-04T20:01:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	my mouse don't work, the screensaver brakes the x session
2010-01-04T20:01:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	Ouch.
2010-01-04T20:04:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	What sort of video card do you have?
2010-01-04T20:05:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	Have you created an /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or are you just letting X configure itself?
2010-01-04T20:06:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	I would try an `Xorg -configure' and let X tell you what it thinks it sees.
2010-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	Also, pay attention to the mouse device. You might be needing to use the event device (/dev/event/mice), rather than psaux.
2010-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	says X server already active
2010-01-04T20:08:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	Yeah, you'll have to do it at the command line. Switch to a command prompt with ctrl-alt-f1, and then /etc/init.d/gdm stop.
2010-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	This will kill your X session. It would help to have a nother computer nearby for Googling while you tweak your config...
2010-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	YOu can test your modifications without starting gdm again by just doing `startx'.
2010-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	nope still dont'work
2010-01-04T20:16:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	that's correct.
2010-01-04T20:17:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	I've installed an operating system on my two main workstations a combined 6 times in the past 3 weeks.
2010-01-04T20:18:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	wow,
2010-01-04T20:18:00.000Z	Dunkirk	lowki	I keep all data on servers, so I can wipe any time.
2010-01-04T20:19:00.000Z	lowki	Dunkirk	i keep my backups on my server
