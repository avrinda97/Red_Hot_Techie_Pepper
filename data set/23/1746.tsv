2009-11-06T10:07:00.000Z	yoques_		where or how can I find now an older kernel and restore the system?
2009-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	yoques_		(I bean install ubuntu 9.04 this same night)
2009-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	If you have, or can download, an older live cd of ubuntu (like jaunty), you can use that kernel
2009-11-06T10:11:00.000Z	yoques_	Magnesium	now I'm in the live-CD, and the system is in /mnt/disk-1/boot/grub (...)
2009-11-06T10:14:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Just a sec.
2009-11-06T10:14:00.000Z	yoques_	Magnesium	OK
2009-11-06T10:16:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Sorry for taking so long...helping too many people!! So are you in the Jaunty CD?
2009-11-06T10:18:00.000Z	yoques_	Magnesium	I'm in the jaunty CD live
2009-11-06T10:22:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Okay. I had to do this a while back, so bear with me. Try going to the directory /casper/boot in the live cd.
2009-11-06T11:14:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Tell me when you've rebooted and if it works.
2009-11-06T11:15:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Does it work?
2009-11-06T11:17:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Uh Oh... what now?
2009-11-06T11:18:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	I don't understand.
2009-11-06T11:20:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Okay, everything boots correctly with sda2?
2009-11-06T11:22:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Does everything work correctly with sda2?
2009-11-06T11:23:00.000Z	yoques_	Magnesium	now another problem. It says me:
2009-11-06T11:27:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Did that work?
2009-11-06T11:29:00.000Z	Magnesium	yoques_	Well, I'm in USA, so it's 12:28 am here...I will go to sleep as well. Bye!
