2007-09-16T16:15:00.000Z	zetheroo		and How does one restore that Add and Remove button?
2007-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	zetheroo		is it possible to have UbuntuStudio installed on the same machine with ordinary Ubuntu Feisty installed?

2007-09-16T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	like two different partitions or what?
2007-09-16T10:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	well say I wanted to be able to have a UbuntuStudio session....is that possible?
2007-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	not really, I mean there is always a way, but to do so would be heavily involved with scripting and whatnot
2007-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	ubuntustudio is just some other applications, there really is no reason to
2007-09-16T10:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	I see.... i just liked the thought of having a session all setup for art and design
2007-09-16T10:08:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	to what extent though, like did you want different themes and stuff or just different apps showing up in the menus
2007-09-16T10:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	more like certain apps being available in that sesion along with a theme and overall unique desktop
2007-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	the theme part I don't know off hand, I could script something to make the menus change and if I had gnome could hunt around until I found the theme, but unless you are capable of scripting you probably don't want to mess with it
2007-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	I see... well thanks for your input!
2007-09-29T07:40:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	if you are going to obnoxiously repeat every 20 seconds at least have the decency to put your message on one line
2007-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	what is with you guy??? I am asking a small question here and everyone is acting like I broke the code of Linux Users....
2007-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	whats with having to have it on one line anyway?.....
2007-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	1044 users in here, now think in your head what that means
2007-09-29T07:43:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	so now that everyone has racked me over the coals of fire with the "thou shalt not's", would anyone care to help me .... please?
2007-09-29T07:44:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	OK.... I will ask very sweetly.... dear wonderful bruenig, will you please help me solve this problem I am having?
2007-12-03T06:13:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	bash setup.sh
2007-12-03T06:14:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	did not work means what
2007-12-03T06:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	bruenig	did not work.. did nothing... no error messages ... nothing
2007-12-03T06:15:00.000Z	bruenig	zetheroo	well then it must have worked if there were no error messages
