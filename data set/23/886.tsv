2010-12-27T19:17:00.000Z	redmarine		Hello. I just got around to try Ubuntu 10.10 and it looks awesome with these fancy graphics. However, my problem began when I decided to check for "Additional Drivers". Surely an Nvidia driver was available and it was recommended so I installed it, however, it appears that it broke my fancy graphics and now would occasionally throw me to the terminal, no GUI only text, whenever I restart.  Anyone knows what I should do to fix this?
2010-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	Is it random that it boots and drops to no GUI?
2010-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	not exactly. Whenever the terminal starts I have to do sudo reboot
2010-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	and access the recovery in the boot menu
2010-12-27T19:20:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	from there I reset the graphics to the default
2010-12-27T19:20:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	which would allow me to enter the OS with GUI but no fancy graphics with dragging etc.
2010-12-27T19:20:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	As soreau says, maybe you can try to get driver from the nvidia site? Which card do you have?
2010-12-27T19:21:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	Geforce GT 325M
2010-12-27T19:22:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	64 bit os
2010-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	Is the additional driver failing randomly or always?
2010-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	I don't think so
2010-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	That's not a valid answer..
2010-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	I've tried to remove it but the fancy graphicswon't return
2010-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	no
2010-12-27T19:24:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	So when the additional drive is there it always fails?
2010-12-27T19:24:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	only when you install it
2010-12-27T19:25:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	and since then I haven't been able to access any fancy graphics via the "Appearance" thing
2010-12-27T19:25:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-260.19.29-driver.html  <-- link to official driver download.
2010-12-27T19:25:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	okay thanks.
2010-12-27T19:27:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	Did you un-install the additional driver from nvidia before hand?
2010-12-27T19:28:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	well, no unless it comes via the "Update Manager"
2010-12-27T19:30:00.000Z	Diamondcite	redmarine	Err I mean to get it working at all again, you might still be in nvidia driver mode right now..
2010-12-27T19:30:00.000Z	redmarine	Diamondcite	ops ehm, I tried uninstalling the additional driver after I installed it, but I couldn't restore the graphics
