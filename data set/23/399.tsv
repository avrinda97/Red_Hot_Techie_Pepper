2011-11-11T17:19:00.000Z	noWay		hey guys , anyone have any idee why the hell I can't access anything even if I'm root :)
2011-11-11T17:19:00.000Z	noWay		p.s ( after restart everything works great )
2011-11-11T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	what are you trying to access and with what app?
2011-11-11T17:20:00.000Z	noWay	ActionParsnip	via terminal , files on desktop or anything
2011-11-11T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	is your $HOME owned by your user?
2011-11-11T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	you can double check by running:  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME
2011-11-11T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	covers all bases :)
2011-11-11T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	ok so when you access a folder, what happens when it goes wrong?
2011-11-11T17:22:00.000Z	noWay	ActionParsnip	I get "can't access , read mode only"
2011-11-11T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	is the partition healthy?
2011-11-11T17:22:00.000Z	noWay	ActionParsnip	I just checked , Yes

2011-11-11T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noWay	its worth exploring
