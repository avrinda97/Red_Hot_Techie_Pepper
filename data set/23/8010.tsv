2005-08-27T14:28:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	why would you assume the whole world knows about some crappy US only hardware store? ;)
2005-08-27T14:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	because this muppet knows, :)
2005-08-27T14:29:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	your sample size might be a bit small ;)
2005-08-27T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	the kind of place you can buy a crap screwdriver or a fluke tester :)
2005-08-27T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	I guess you could be right
2005-08-27T06:46:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	and segfault is where it feels a little tired and goes on holiday without requesting permission?
2005-09-25T08:26:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	that's perhaps unhelpful, but intended behaviour, popup menus tend to prevent other things from happening until they are dismissed, otherwise they'd hang around for ages ;)
2005-09-25T08:28:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	it was a perfectly reasonable question :)
2005-09-25T08:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	well I do _try_
2006-01-22T08:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	he should not
2006-01-22T08:27:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	should so, bloot is the worst bot engine evar ;)
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	good bye?
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	never passed "init=/bin/sh" to the kernel? ;)
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	loose it and you can't get in well there is that but how do you do that if grub won't let you there :)
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	boot grub from a floppy/cd ;)
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	basically you should never assume that you have any real level of security if someone has physical access to the machine
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	physical access is always a good chance we better all use 2048 bit keys with huge strong passwords quick :-)
2006-05-25T15:46:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	I spent a few years doing data security, and I may have some understanding of risk management (although it is gladly fading :-))
2006-05-25T15:48:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	fair enough, I do tend to err on the side of teaching people to suck eggs in here :)
2006-06-08T15:04:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	thats !lanugage
2006-06-16T14:54:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	addict ;)
2006-06-16T15:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Ng	sip protocol for coffee over lip of mug ;-)
2006-06-16T15:01:00.000Z	Ng	ompaul	tsk ;)
