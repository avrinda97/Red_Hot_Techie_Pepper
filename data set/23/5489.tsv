2010-04-29T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	the original site is gone.. but the cache is still available.. it seems the gnome people remove the ability to "hide" the cursor
2010-04-29T16:47:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	gnarr...thx anyway :)
2010-04-29T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	oh.. found something   gconf-editor? Set the value of /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_blink_mode to “off”. The default is "System"
2010-04-29T16:50:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	what i really wanted was a "temporary" disable...i have a script in ruby, much of a watch, and the cursor just goes forth and back when deleting the "characters" i wat to delete
2010-04-29T16:51:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	oh.. no idea then.. I just thought the blinking cursor annoyed you =)
2010-04-29T16:51:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	i got that some people get anoyed, not my case :) thnx anyway!
2010-04-29T16:52:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	you're welcome
2010-04-29T17:04:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	have you tried using the "stty" command.. it looks like it can do all kinds of neat things in a terminal..
2010-04-29T17:06:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	to be honest i knew about stty, but i didn't knew i could hide the cursor...can i?
2010-04-29T17:06:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	I don't really know.. I just read about it here http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/advanced_bash_scripting_guide/system.html
2010-04-29T17:06:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	setterm also looks promising.. at least it has a "cursor off" option
2010-04-29T17:07:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	thnx for the research of my behalf, i used stty a lot to hide password inputs, will check it out right away, thanks a lot
2010-04-29T17:07:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	you're welcome
2010-04-29T17:08:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	Awesome, setterm does the deal
2010-04-29T17:09:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	pretty  cool and easy actualy, it also is great for the ones that get annoyed by the blinking cursor, since you can only "not-see" the cursor
2010-04-29T17:09:00.000Z	Slart	eon_	yea.. I just tried it.. although I kind of like seeing my cursor.. but it might come in handy for scripts
2010-04-29T17:10:00.000Z	eon_	Slart	in this case, its pretty nice
