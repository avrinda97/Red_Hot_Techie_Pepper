2005-11-07T08:39:00.000Z	EvilPaddy		Anyone know if its possible to view visio docs on ubuntu?
2005-11-07T08:40:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	not possible.
2005-11-07T08:40:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	a similar, but different file format, is dia
2005-11-07T08:42:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	No way at all of viewing them..?
2005-11-07T08:43:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	nope.  you may be able to under windows save to some format that dia and import.  Don't know
2005-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	Whats your opinion on these apps like, Lin4Win & Wine etc.. ? Ive heard free Wine isnt very good
2005-11-07T08:46:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	I really don't use windows apps that much.  Using autostitch (google it) under wine is fine.  Not tried installing something like MS office into a wine instance.  Bought CrossOver Office years ago (commericalized wine) but find I don't need to use Office that much.  OpenOffice is very good at read/writing word/excel/powerpoint slides that I get/produce.
2005-11-07T08:49:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	you may want to try using qemu, installing windows  + visio into that
2005-11-07T08:50:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	or pony up for a vmware license.
2005-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	wine somewindows.exe
2005-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	wickedpuppy, command not found :-(
2005-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	try: which wine   for me it is in /usr/bin/wine
2005-11-07T09:08:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	Are you running wine?
2005-11-07T09:08:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	occasionally for random small windows apps
2005-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	wickedpuppy, I have wine installed now, just tried to run PuTTY, worked fine.. How would I run something like visio/outlook?
2005-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	you'
2005-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	wickedpuppy, PuTTY as Im sure you know is  astandalone app..
2005-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	you'll have to 'install it' then run it.  putty.exe is just a single program.  That is all I really use wine for -- simple single .exe programs.
2005-11-07T09:10:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	Do you install apps into Wine?
2005-11-07T09:10:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	yeah.  run wine ./the-installer.exe from the cd or wherever
2005-11-07T09:10:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	you will have a ~/.wine or such directory
2005-11-07T09:11:00.000Z	EvilPaddy	MarcN	It will be kept in there?
2005-11-07T09:11:00.000Z	MarcN	EvilPaddy	yeah.
