2010-02-06T02:45:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	how much i need swap if i have 2GB ram..?
2010-02-06T02:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	if you plan to hibernate (suspend to disk) you need >= 2 GiB if not 1 giB is more than enough
2010-02-06T02:46:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	i heart what it must be 2x as ram is it true?
2010-02-06T02:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	old meme from the times where 16 MiB of RAM was the norm and that  refuses to die
2010-02-06T02:49:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	so i need 2GB swap at the end of HDD, does Primary or Logical changes something..? and what swap do it always are under 1MB?
2010-02-06T02:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	no does not change anything; did not understand the last part
2010-02-06T02:51:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	when i look at system monitor swap is always under 1mb why swap need what it do?
2010-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	yes with the amounts of ram of today swap is rarely used that's why it makes no sense to make it that big
2010-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	you probably can do with a 512 MiB swap if you are tight in disk space
2010-02-06T02:53:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	o i have 320gb hdd so i will do 2GB swap for 2GB ram
2010-02-06T02:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	ok
2010-02-06T02:53:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	and i can do hibernate from disk also?
2010-02-06T02:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	yes you can hybernate and suspend
2010-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	there is small problem, 1GB is 1024MB but than i chose 2048MB it shows me 1.7GB ram..
2010-02-06T02:55:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	sory 1.7GB swap size..
2010-02-06T02:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	well parititioning software has to round down or up to cilinder boundaries
2010-02-06T02:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	just type in 2500 MiB so it rounds to have 2 GiB or more
2010-02-06T02:58:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	and make 1 disk for home and system or beter separate, and what type ext4 or better ext3,2...? is there big diference?
2010-02-06T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	just use the latest greates ext4
2010-02-06T02:59:00.000Z	Rencx	erUSUL	and make 1 disk for home and system or beter separate?
2010-02-06T03:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rencx	better make one part for root of about 10-15 GiB and the rest for home
