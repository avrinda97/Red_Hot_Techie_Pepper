2011-08-15T23:49:00.000Z	battle_warrior		besides root
2011-08-15T23:50:00.000Z	battle_warrior		i did my home directory
2011-08-15T23:50:00.000Z	battle_warrior		how?
2011-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	battle_warrior		when i import anything from windows or create a new file i have to add 777 to the file permissions
2011-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	battle_warrior		i did sudo chown -R 777 .
2011-08-15T23:53:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	You should have gotten an error that user 777 does not exist, (and nothing done).
2011-08-15T23:54:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	And you would have had to have done it by sudo.  Is that right?  Your command was sudo chown 777 -R  But did you specify a path? Or not?
2011-08-15T23:55:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Looks like it was 775 instead of 777
2011-08-15T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Just do chown -R minecraft   (From the same dir and you did before.)
2011-08-15T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	... which hopefully was /home/minecraft/
2011-08-15T23:59:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	sudo chown -R minecraft
2011-08-16T00:00:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	sudo chown -R minecraft   /home/minecraft/
2011-08-16T00:03:00.000Z	battle_warrior	usr13	http://pastebin.com/TDYWW0xL   i did sudo chown -R minecraft /home/minecraft
2011-08-16T00:04:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Ok, that should do it.
2011-08-16T00:18:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Where do the plugins go?
2011-08-16T00:19:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Where is minecraft/plugins ?  (Need to see full path)
2011-08-16T00:20:00.000Z	battle_warrior	usr13	its /home/minecraft/plugins
2011-08-16T00:21:00.000Z	usr13	battle_warrior	Did it require sudo or root to install the game files?
