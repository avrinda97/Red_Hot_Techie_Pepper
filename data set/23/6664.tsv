2006-02-20T15:22:00.000Z	MrRio-	Half-Left	yeah, i love that progs like vncviewer doesnt have to redraw itself when it gets covered up
2006-02-20T15:22:00.000Z	MrRio-	Half-Left	that used to be painful
2006-02-20T15:23:00.000Z	Half-Left	MrRio-	yer, most launch instantly
2006-02-20T15:23:00.000Z	MrRio-	Half-Left	im pretty impressed, this is a laptop that can barely run quake 2!

2006-02-20T15:31:00.000Z	MrRio-	Half-Left	the first time i ran it, it said something about the order of these

2006-02-20T15:31:00.000Z	MrRio-	Half-Left	its only giving me one workspace, whenever i change it it goes back to one
