2009-06-22T10:06:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	do you have that res as a modeline in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?

2009-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	1280x800 laptop
2009-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	bernardtk	nomad77	ahk, can I use your xorg?
2009-06-22T10:17:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	your labelling seems inconsistant some uses 0 for lables some default might be the prob
2009-06-22T10:18:00.000Z	bernardtk	nomad77	ahk, but why would I not even have the option to change it in nvidia settings?
2009-06-22T10:19:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	perhaps the driver is not correct for your card/chipset,i'm not sure
2009-06-22T10:19:00.000Z	bernardtk	nomad77	hmm thankyou for your help, it's just frustrating :(
2009-06-22T11:07:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	check your ~/.nvidia-settings-rc
2009-06-22T11:09:00.000Z	bernardtk	nomad77	how do I navigate to that?.........
2009-06-22T11:09:00.000Z	nomad77	bernardtk	its a hidden "dotfile" in your home directory
2009-06-22T11:10:00.000Z	bernardtk	nomad77	I'm looking at all the hiddin folders, nvidia-settings-rc isn't there......
