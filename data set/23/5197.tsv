2007-01-21T07:52:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	where are you accessing it from ?
2007-01-21T07:53:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	on same subnet?
2007-01-21T07:53:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	what do you use as your default gateway?
2007-01-21T07:59:00.000Z	gralha	bulmer	but the configs are alike same gateway...
2007-01-21T07:54:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	may i ask you to direct your response so it can not be missed
2007-01-21T07:55:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	and your other client on the subnet is able to access the internet via that same router?
2007-01-21T07:56:00.000Z	gralha	bulmer	yes i'm doing that right now
2007-01-21T07:56:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	compare the route table on your ubuntu and your other client(windows?) they should be very similar
2007-01-21T07:58:00.000Z	gralha	bulmer	don't look alike...
2007-01-21T07:58:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	thats your key, if the route table are not very similar to others on same subnet
2007-01-21T08:00:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	umm can you paste your route table in some pastebin? so i can view?
2007-01-21T08:01:00.000Z	gralha	bulmer	the one from windows or from ubuntu?
2007-01-21T08:01:00.000Z	bulmer	gralha	from both so we can compare them
2007-01-21T08:04:00.000Z	gralha	bulmer	i cannot make a copy past from the ubuntu
