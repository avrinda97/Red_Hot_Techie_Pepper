2008-10-29T22:33:00.000Z	Joker_-_		I need GLibc2.3. How can I install it on ubuntu? (I can't find it with apt-cache)
2008-10-29T22:34:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	glibc 2.3...? the C library, libc6, is always installed by default
2008-10-29T22:34:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	it's not version 2.3, it's version 2.7, and you cannot change that
2008-10-29T22:35:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	dunno, I get an error with a plugin and everywhere I look it tells me that th eproblem is that I dont have glibc 2.3
2008-10-29T22:35:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	well, maybe that plugin was compiled for that version of glibc, however you can't install that (unless you want to break every other program you have, which wants 2.7)
2008-10-29T22:35:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	you should find a version of that plugin that's compiled for your Ubuntu release
2008-10-29T22:36:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	which plugin would that be anyway?
2008-10-29T22:36:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	I wish there was, it's a very, very old and unsupported program :(
2008-10-29T22:36:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	mainly, I'm screwed?
2008-10-29T22:36:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	perhaps you can find a version of it with libc statically linked...?
2008-10-29T22:37:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	I've been googling on that for what... 5 hours... I seriously don't think theres anything more I can do
2008-10-29T22:37:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	I'll simply give up I guess
2008-10-29T22:37:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	Dapper came with libc6 2.3
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	you might try using Dapper in a virtual machine, if that's important to you
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	are you sure there's no source code to compile, either?
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	dapper hey... Aight I might try that. thx for the help.
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	bout the source, dunno, I'd have to check for that
2008-10-29T22:39:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	with source I could re-make and have it working with newer libc?
2008-10-29T22:39:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	sure, you should (unless the source has other problems)
2008-11-25T19:22:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	(/dev/hda == physical drive) != (/dev/hda1 == partition with possibly a filesystem on it)
2008-11-25T19:22:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	forward to Fezzler1
2008-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	LjL	Joker_-_	it's not prohibited but one really should keep it to a bare minimum
2008-11-25T19:27:00.000Z	Joker_-_	LjL	yeah I can understand this, but changing nickname is a server thing, not a channel thing. anyway, no need to discuss that ;)
