2010-06-05T11:07:00.000Z	kiamo		hmm, so is it a bad idea to fsck my root filesystem?
2010-06-05T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 ive often booted a live cd. and fscked my fileystems befor  (when they get badly trashed)
2010-06-05T11:10:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	Do filesystems often get trashed?  Iv been trying ubuntu periodicly for the last year and every time my fs gets trashed somehow.  Gets remounted as read only, and I have never successfully repaired it.  :(
2010-06-05T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 ive rarely had it happen.
2010-06-05T11:11:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	could it be these bad blocks that are causing it?
2010-06-05T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 power outages while doing things is about the only time i have the issue. Or harddrive faulure
2010-06-05T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 possibaly
2010-06-05T11:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	  if the hd is partitioned into space for wundoiws and linux. its possiuble the bad part of the HD is  allocated to the linux half.
2010-06-05T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 one of the best upgrades i did for my laptop was upgrading its HD to a faster/bigger one.. well worth the effort.
2010-06-05T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 could be the whole HD going bad..
2010-06-05T17:33:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	maybe, but I dont have any spare cash for a new hdd right now :(
2010-06-05T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 i would be making some backups.
2010-06-05T17:34:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	yea I have lol.
2010-06-05T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 if theres some part of the hd that keeps having issues - you cold make some smaller partitions and not use the one that contains the questionable space.
2010-06-05T17:36:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	that's an idea.  But how do I determine the locations of the bad sectors?
2010-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 #1 check  the wine app databnase on the app.
2010-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	yea I already looked there, nada :(
2010-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 chweck the wine forums then i guess
2010-06-09T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 winetricks is not included.
2010-06-09T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 i find 64bit very useable
2010-06-13T00:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 install the rar binaries and unrar -e foo.r01  (or whatever the first rar filename is)
2010-06-13T00:16:00.000Z	kiamo	Dr_Willis	thx
2010-06-13T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kiamo	 oops.. its 'unrar e ' (not -e)
