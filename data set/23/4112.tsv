2007-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	DiViN3		can someone help with ubuntu network install ?
2007-11-06T12:58:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	what kind of inet-connection? ethernet? phone? dsl? wireless? what kind of help do you need with netinstall?
2007-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	u there
2007-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	i'm here! :) your router-settings are correct? already tried for another OS/bootcd? checked your nameserver-settings?
2007-11-06T13:04:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	type /sbin/ifconfig in a terminal -> check "inet Adresse:" eth0 (or whatever device your ubuntu box is connected to the windoze-box). ...and type cat /etc/resolv.conf
2007-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	can't you tell your windows-box to function as a DHCP-server? or wouldn't it be easier (and more secure) to route the inet through the ubuntu box (or through a third box - a firewall)?
2007-11-06T13:08:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	how have you set up your network on the ubuntu box? no /sbin/ifconfig on your ubuntu system???
2007-11-06T13:11:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	cat /etc/network/interfaces -> are the settings for eth0 correct?
2007-11-06T13:16:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	again, how have you set up your network on the ubuntu box?
2007-11-06T13:23:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	maybe you should check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router first? did you type the commands in an ubuntu terminal? (ALT-F2 gnome-terminal)
2007-11-06T13:30:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	how do i check if my network card is configured correctly
2007-11-06T13:31:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	cat /etc/network/interfaces ; cat /etc/resolv.conf (and try to ping the IP of your windoze-box...)
2007-11-06T13:32:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	it dsnt shows my window-box ip at all
2007-11-06T13:34:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	ok just tell me how u setup networking from scratch plz like how u do in a newly installed box
2007-11-06T13:34:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	your server's IP does not have to show up. can you ping it?
2007-11-06T13:40:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	System -> Administration -> Networking (see https://help.ubuntu.com/7.04/internet/C/connect-to-internet.html)
2007-11-06T13:49:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	r u there
2007-11-06T13:49:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	yes!
2007-11-06T13:50:00.000Z	DiViN3	redtux	ok its reads my ip/netmask/gateway
2007-11-06T13:50:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	so you can ping your windoze-box? can you reach the ubuntu box from your windoze-box?
2007-11-06T13:52:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	ping <IP>
2007-11-06T13:54:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	cat /etc/network/interfaces ; cat /etc/resolv.conf - is the namerserver correctly set?
2007-11-06T13:59:00.000Z	redtux	DiViN3	but you can ping your windoze-box? then just type "sudoedit /etc/resolv.conf" -> nameserver <NS-IP> -> CTRL-X -> Y ;)
