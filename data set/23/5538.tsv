2006-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	ozzloy		does anyone have a webcam working right now with ubuntu?
2006-12-21T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	I do.
2006-12-21T11:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	what is the make/model and how well does it work?
2006-12-21T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	It's a built in iSight and it works perfectly, probably not the kind of info you wanted I am guessing :)
2006-12-21T11:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	hah, unfortunately not
2006-12-21T11:33:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	thanks!
2006-12-21T11:39:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	you got a macbook then?
2006-12-21T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	Yup, macbook pro
2008-06-20T11:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	Not sure of it's progress or how good of a phone it is but you might look into http://wiki.openmoko.org if you want an open source phone
2008-06-20T11:59:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	that's not open to the public right now
2008-06-20T11:59:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	they're "sold out" they say
2008-09-13T07:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	dpkg -L packageName
2008-09-13T07:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	thanks
2008-09-13T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	np
2011-07-14T02:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	apt-cache rdepends package
2011-07-14T02:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	that gives too many things, and some aren't even installed
2011-07-14T02:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	is there a way to get the actual package i installed at some point that had some other package as a dependency?
2011-07-14T02:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	"aptitude why packagename" might be what you want.
2011-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	hmm... a smaller list, and all things that are actually installed, but some automatically.  i guess this is good enough for now
2011-07-14T02:18:00.000Z	ozzloy	Jordan_U	thanks!
2011-07-14T02:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	You're welcome.
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ozzloy	You should always be prepared to re-install grub after re-partitioning, though I don't think it will be needed in this case. For instructions on re-installing grub from a liveCD see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
