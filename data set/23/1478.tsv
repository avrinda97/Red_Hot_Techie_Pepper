2010-07-10T18:48:00.000Z	Esigolo		Guys is possible to configure the Xorg or something to make Ubuntu just Ignore my second Grafic card?
2010-07-10T18:49:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	it may be, but is is possible to deactivate the card in your cmos/bios?
2010-07-10T18:50:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	In fact i'm using the second on windows to put the Physx to work so I can't deactvate it :(
2010-07-10T18:51:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	ohh, hmm. let me see if i can dig something up
2010-07-10T18:52:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	thanks man
2010-07-10T18:53:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	is that second card a built in card, a nvidia, a amd, intel, sis?
2010-07-10T18:53:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	The first one is an ATI card and the second is an Nvidia
2010-07-10T18:54:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	sudo nvidia-glx-config disable might work.
2010-07-10T18:54:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	 let me try
2010-07-10T18:55:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	sudo: nvidia-glx-config: command not found
2010-07-10T18:56:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	i was afraid of that. either that command is ancient, or the nvidia driver was never installed, im assuming the first option.
2010-07-10T18:57:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	did you install both drivers?
2010-07-10T18:57:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	the Nvidia driver is not installed because when i Install it the ATI  driver  goes crazt
2010-07-10T18:58:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	i have to install the Nvidia or Ati driver First?
2010-07-10T18:58:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	considring that amd/ati has little or no support for any linux based distro, i kinda undertsand that. just switched to nvidia for that reason
2010-07-10T18:59:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	what disadvantage would you have to using your nvidia card instead of your ati? is there  a big performance difference?
2010-07-10T19:00:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	 Iwas afraid of that because the ATI drivers is an HD5870 and the Nvidia is an 9600GT its a huge diference
2010-07-10T19:01:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	well. hmm. i would think that you would need both drivers installed, and then wuold need to have ubuntu not use the nvidia. but im not an expert. one other possibility is, pclinuxos 2010 or 2009 (2009 if it is an older ati card). pclinuxos is not my favorite os, but has special support for ati, way more than ubuntu
2010-07-10T19:03:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	ok i'm going to take a look about it thank you man xD
2010-07-10T19:03:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	dot know how much help i have been, but, hope it works out for you
2010-07-10T19:25:00.000Z	hylian	Esigolo	just out of curiosity, after installing the nvidia driver, did you try that old nvidia disabling command? that might have come with the nvidia driver
2010-07-10T19:26:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	true i did not let me try
2010-07-10T19:32:00.000Z	Esigolo	hylian	BluesKaj  i'm going to reboot and see if it works be back soon
