2005-02-28T17:04:00.000Z	Khan		Sorry man I had a phone call.
2005-02-28T17:05:00.000Z	Khan		Alright. Will do right now :)
2005-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	Khan		Thanks
2005-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	Khan		... :P
2005-02-28T06:51:00.000Z	Khan		Hmmm I have a problem. I havnt been able to get Ubuntu to start up because during the process of loading everything it stops at "* Starting hotplug subsystem... " and never goes any farther and I cant do anything. I have tried a couple different things and I am lost.
2005-02-28T06:52:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	Hi. Do you have any usb hardware plugged?
2005-02-28T06:52:00.000Z	Khan		Only my printer.
2005-02-28T06:53:00.000Z	Khan		I tried unplugging my printer and booting up but that didnt work.
2005-02-28T06:53:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	so try to start without the printer first. the we will see.
2005-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	I tried unplugging my printer and booting up but that didnt work. Infact I tried unplugging everything accept my monitor just to see if that owuld work and it didnt. :P
2005-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	ok. you did a normal ubuntu install, didn't you?
2005-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	Correct didnt change any settings.
2005-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	I tried searching the forums for a solution and it appears it is a common problem. But none of the ideas there worked.
2005-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	minimec		Ok. Do you have any Live Disk around to start a system?
2005-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	That I do not.
2005-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Khan		I will randabis. Just wanted to see if I could find a solution first.
2005-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	Hmm.. Try to boot in recovery-mode (I'm not sure if I used the right term) and don't start the hotplug system
2005-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	Actually I tried booting in recovery-mode and it hung on the same problem.
2005-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	Khan		So I dunno.
2005-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	I didn't do that for myself :-) . But isn't there the possibility to start one deamon after the other by choice?
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	Khan	minimec	Hmm Maybe Lemme check it out.
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	Khan		I will be back shortly.
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	minimec	Khan	So do I. HAve to smoke ...
