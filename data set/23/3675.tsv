2008-02-21T00:24:00.000Z	sandos_		very quick question: how do I find a SMP kernel?? Suddenly my machine is non-SMP
2008-02-21T00:24:00.000Z	sandos_		cant find any -smp packages...
2008-02-21T00:25:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	the generic kernel is smp, the i386 not, i think
2008-02-21T00:25:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	hmm, just installed generic, previous was 386
2008-02-21T00:26:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	so, you are OK then?
2008-02-21T00:26:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	yes.. =)
2008-02-21T00:26:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	now I "just" need to fix my Nvidia driver ;)
2008-02-21T00:26:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	what do you mean by that?
2008-02-21T00:27:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	well my GLX was not working
2008-02-21T00:27:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	generic should recognize the two cores, so there's a problem somewhere. nevertheless, how did you install the nvidia driver?
2008-02-21T00:28:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	it was the downloadable shell thing from Nvidia
2008-02-21T00:29:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	oh, ok. since it seems you want to use the latest version of the driver (and not the older in the repos) then you it would be better to use Envy.
2008-02-21T00:29:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	is that the fancy nvidia installer thing?
2008-02-21T00:30:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	yes, it will download the driver from nvidia and install it for you
2008-02-21T00:30:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	I will try that
2008-02-21T00:30:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	but remember, everytime time there's an kernel update you will lose your desktop
2008-02-21T00:30:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	aaah, right
2008-02-21T00:31:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	if you want to avoid this you should install the driver from the repos. or before you reboot the pc after the kernel update you have to change the driver in xorg.conf from nvidia to nv or vesa and then put it back
2008-02-21T00:32:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	I will try the ubuntu one I think
2008-02-21T00:32:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	yes, the driver from the repos is "kernel update safe" :) although, it's an not the latest version
2008-02-21T00:39:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	do you know that you have booted with the generic kernel for sure? or i386 is still used. do a "uname -a" to be sure
2008-02-21T00:39:00.000Z	sandos_	kostkon	no, I was still on 386
2008-02-21T00:39:00.000Z	kostkon	sandos_	bah!
