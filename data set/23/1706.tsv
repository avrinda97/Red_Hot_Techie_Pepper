2009-11-21T02:53:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	give us a minute
2009-11-21T02:54:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	how are you installing flash player?
2009-11-21T02:54:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	have you tried using the package manager?
2009-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	yeah, that's one way to do it
2009-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	if it's not on there, try synaptic
2009-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	you should look for what broken-IPod and erUSUL are talking about, they have the same problem
2009-11-21T02:56:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	synaptic is a GUI package manager for ubuntu. think of it like a slightly more powerful software centre, if you will
2009-11-21T02:56:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	follow erUSUL's advice too- you might need to enable the multiverse
2009-11-21T02:58:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	look for flashplugin-nonfree
2009-11-21T03:00:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	let us know if it works for you :)
2009-11-21T03:04:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	excellent :)
2009-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	in ubuntu's defense, they didn't tell you to use the website either :P you just assumed
2009-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	Will123456	Kentoro	enjoy youtube!
