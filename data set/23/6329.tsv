2011-07-09T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	your question isnothing to do with ubuntu
2011-07-09T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	thats why no-one is answering
2011-07-09T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	what's the problem
2011-07-09T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	ok - that's nothing to do with ubuntu as you've beent old multiple times
2011-07-09T20:57:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	it can be depending on your experience
2011-07-09T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	the best option is to burn the iso onto a CD
2011-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	they do work
2011-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	if you purchase microsoft windows, they will give you a CD for free
2011-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	you can mail them with your activation code and they will send you one out for free
2011-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	that's the same thing, the recovery CD is the install CD
2011-07-09T21:02:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	if you don't have the tools to use it, the best option is to just wait for the official one to arive
2011-07-09T21:02:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	the guys in ##windows can help
2011-07-09T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	TechFreak21	/join ##windows
