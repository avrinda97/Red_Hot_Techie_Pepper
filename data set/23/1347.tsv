2010-05-09T08:13:00.000Z	KinKing		Do you guys think if I use the directx9 runtime under wine (instead of the native version), it might get me disconnected from games that use HackShield? I'm getting booted and I'm trying to figure out why
2010-05-09T08:14:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	thats probably an incompatibility with HackShield and wine thats causing you to kick, so there flagging wine as a cheat
2010-05-09T08:18:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	You're saying I get kicked from inside the game cuz the way wine gets read is marked as a cheat?
2010-05-09T08:18:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	its a posibility, or HackShield trys to check you for running cheats and wine doesn't communicate right. So hackshield flags it as not sure and that kicks you. Have seen that happen
2010-05-09T08:19:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	Yeah I'd go for the "not sure," cuz it would just seem like they'd be hating on the linux community otherwise...?
2010-05-09T08:19:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	I don't know I have seen that happen before lol
2010-05-09T08:20:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	So you don't think it's a misscommunication from directx9 right?
2010-05-09T08:21:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	If something is getting sent wrong, maybe that could be tracked?
2010-05-09T08:21:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	best guess is look the game up on WineAppDB and look up hackshield as well, see if anyone else has had that problem
2010-05-09T08:22:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	Actually the game is marked as "does not even run" on the appdb
2010-05-09T08:22:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	what game? curiousity?
2010-05-09T08:22:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	Ace Online
2010-05-09T08:22:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	then best guess is its just a incompatibility problem with wine and the anticheat on the game
2010-05-09T08:23:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	[Bug 4666] anti-cheat system HackShield doesn't work
2010-05-09T08:23:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	with wine I mean, so I think that is your problem
2010-05-09T08:24:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	only other chance I see you having to get it to work, is find a bypass.
2010-05-09T08:25:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	On the appdb it says noone can even log in any games at all that have hshield. So I'm the first. I'll try getting a gameguard or xtrap game to work...
2010-05-09T08:26:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	(At least into the game that is, not like, all the way through)
2010-05-09T08:26:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	fair warning, gameguard doesn't like to play well with wine either. I know that for certain lol
2010-05-09T08:27:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	Yeah but it's built the same way as hshield isn't it? Maybe... Then the developers can get a hint where to go from there
2010-05-09T08:28:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	but almost 70% at least of the market is for windows users so why would they take extra time to help us? honestly.
2010-05-09T08:28:00.000Z	KinKing	UbuntuJeff	I meant the wine developers >_>
2010-05-09T08:28:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	KinKing	oh lol. Yeah don't see the gameguard or the hackshield people helping us lol
