2009-09-24T14:18:00.000Z	meatbun		how to tell if ubuntu have vpn server services installed or running?
2009-09-24T14:19:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	you could see what services are running on certain ports, also what packages are installed
2009-09-24T14:20:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	?
2009-09-24T14:20:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	netstat -pan
2009-09-24T14:21:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	what am i looking for? for that output?
2009-09-24T14:21:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	whatever looks like vpn
2009-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	port scan shows 34746 open. but __> root# netstat -a| grep -i "3473" ; shows nothing
2009-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	that's port scan on localhost
2009-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	that's because you're not using -n
2009-09-24T14:27:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	still nothing with -n
2009-09-24T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	also, 3473 != 34736
2009-09-24T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	if you are not precise, it will fail.
2009-09-24T14:28:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	grep don't need the whole thing. less specific is better for grep
2009-09-24T14:28:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	grep don't need the whole thing. less specific is better for grep
2009-09-24T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	grep needs specific information.
2009-09-24T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	no, you are incorrect.
2009-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	netstat -pan | grep 34736
2009-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	 netstat -pan | grep 34736  ; shows nothing
2009-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	perhaps that wasn't it then
2009-09-24T14:30:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	i c.  i click on 'scan' again. port is gone. but new ports appeared. i click 'scan' some more and random ports came out.
2009-09-24T14:31:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	try using top and see if something starts/stops
2009-09-24T14:33:00.000Z	meatbun	Gnea	i dont' see anything. i think it's just my internet ports talking to router
2009-09-24T14:34:00.000Z	Gnea	meatbun	could be
