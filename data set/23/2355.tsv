2009-06-06T09:21:00.000Z	chronographer		hi all i'm having trouble setting up my second ethernet card. First card (eth0) set using wicd connects fine, browsing internet through that. I have another card which I like yo use for crossover cable for file transfer but I can't set it up. I tried statically in interfaces and also tried using wicd. What are suggestions.
2009-06-06T09:22:00.000Z	chronographer		pinging my laptop which is connected gives: ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
2009-06-06T09:23:00.000Z	chronographer		ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
2009-06-06T09:23:00.000Z	chronographer		still after sudo
2009-06-06T09:24:00.000Z	chronographer		why does the network have to be so complicated in these new versions of Ubuntj?
2009-06-06T09:24:00.000Z	SirStan	chronographer	works perfect for me ...
2009-06-06T09:25:00.000Z	SirStan	chronographer	I have 4 ethernet adapters in my ubuntu machine.. and they all work great
2009-06-06T09:25:00.000Z	SirStan	chronographer	of course not.. that would be silly.
2009-06-06T09:26:00.000Z	chronographer	SirStan	you manually edit interfaces?
2009-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	SirStan	chronographer	Im not sure what you would call 'manually'... ubuntu server has a slightly different (ie, no UI) way to configure things.
2009-06-06T09:28:00.000Z	SirStan	chronographer	I Just brought up my eth1 "manually" and am reconfiguring my wireless router just fine :~).
