2005-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	mick		hi folks
2005-08-22T06:10:00.000Z	mick		sorry to intrude, but anyone any good with sound here, esp cheapo cmi card?
2005-08-22T06:10:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	possibly... what's CMI?
2005-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	might be C-Media...
2005-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	what sorta porblems are you having?
2005-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	ah. what program are you using?
2005-08-22T06:12:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	gotcha. ummmmmmm... gee whiz. where did I see that... can you hear
2005-08-22T06:12:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	ah, that answers my question
2005-08-22T06:12:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	is it completely silent, or do you get error messages too?
2005-08-22T06:14:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	so the other person *can* hear you; it's just very very quiet?
2005-08-22T06:14:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	walv: that would be linuxant, I b'lieve
2005-08-22T06:15:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	well that blows me away. you're using Hoary, I assume?
2005-08-22T06:16:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	stupid question, but when you click on the volume control applet, and choose the OSS device (should be C-Media something-something-something) from the File menu, can you adjust the recording level of the mic there?
2005-08-22T06:17:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	that's a real stumper. do you have a dual-boot setup?
2005-08-22T06:18:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	no kidding. I use it to talk to my friend in Florida; the only problem is that it takes command of my sound card so I can't listen to music or watch videos my friend sends me :)
2005-08-22T06:18:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	so you have no mic problems in Windows... hoo boy
2005-08-22T06:19:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	anything else I'd be suggesting would be just that: suggestions... ideas that might spark other ideas
2005-08-22T06:19:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	don't know about any restrictions that way... although I'm in text-mode right now (killed my X somehow)
2005-08-22T06:23:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	exactly what chipset do you have? if you go 'lspci', what does it list?
2005-08-22T06:23:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	actually, easier is this: lsmod | grep -i snd
2005-08-22T06:29:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	My little Creative SoundBlaster Live works great
2005-08-22T06:30:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	yep. My new motherboard has an atrocious soundcard (some C-Media thingy) that had SOFTWARE-controlled volume, if you can believe it, so I threw a PCI SoundBlaster in there, and it works great.
2005-08-22T06:30:00.000Z	pauldaoust	mick	no doubt :)
