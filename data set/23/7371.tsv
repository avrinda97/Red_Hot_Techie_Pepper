2005-08-22T11:22:00.000Z	shanghaiteej		I installed Ubuntu on two hard disk, one is 13 gigs and the other is 60 gigs.  The installation size on my 13 gig hard drive was only 2.5 gigs (not including swap), but my installation on my 60 gig hard drive was about 5 gigs (not including swap)...what gives?  They were both clean installations.
2005-08-22T11:23:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 well, depends on your clustersizes
2005-08-22T11:24:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 large disk = large clustersize, small disk = small cluster size... a 1 byte file will occupy an entire cluster (which is different in size depending on your partiotns size.. )
2005-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 So Ubuntu adjusts to the cluster size of your hard disk?  So does that mean the bigger the cluster size, the better?
2005-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 nawh,, the filesystem does
2005-08-22T11:29:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	so that's good in what way?
2005-08-22T11:29:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 it isnt really. but it's not ubuntus fault, you'll see the same sort of behaviour if you install XP on the same disks
2005-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 if a cluster if 4096bytes, then a single 1 byte file will still use up one cluster.. so a 1byte file occupies 4096bytes of space on your harddrive
2005-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 alright, I just wanted to know in case I installed ubuntu wrong, I thought 5 gigs was a lot for a file system.
2005-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 and the same goes for NTFS/FAT/ext.... :)
2005-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 well, 5gb is much
2005-08-22T11:31:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	how do i fix that?
2005-08-22T11:31:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	manually partition?
2005-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 You know how to solve the 5gb cluster size..or is it unsolvable for a 60gb partition...
2005-08-22T11:36:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 umh.. your clusters are not 5gb in size... :)
2005-08-22T11:36:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 but i dont know any way to fix that no
2005-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	well crap, 5gb is a lot of ubuntu files to start off with..
2005-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 what was the initial size of ubuntu on your box?
2005-08-22T11:39:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	 maybe 2-3gb ?
2005-08-22T11:39:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	how big was the drive you installed it on?
2005-08-22T11:40:00.000Z	kemik	shanghaiteej	  20gb
2005-08-22T11:43:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 thanks for your help
2005-08-22T11:45:00.000Z	shanghaiteej	kemik	 so 5gigs is nothing to worry about?
