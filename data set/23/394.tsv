2012-04-26T00:30:00.000Z	delinquentme		sooo whats easier running an existing windows install on VirtualBox .. or on VMware?
2012-04-26T00:30:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	it's the same
2012-04-26T00:31:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	vmware player is
2012-04-26T00:32:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	if you decide to use vbox and you need USB forwarding, use non-OSE
2012-04-26T00:33:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	well, converting a disk image to either vmware or vbox is easy, there's tools for that. The hardest part is changing drivers and stuff, because "hardware" did change
2012-04-26T00:34:00.000Z	delinquentme	SunTsu	Ohh so I need to convert the disk image to make it usable in virtual box?
2012-04-26T00:35:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	Not strictly neccessary, there are ways to do it without converting it or even taking an image
2012-04-26T00:36:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	which way is the best depends on what exactly you plan to do
2012-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	that x86_64 although I'd use i386 arch aka 32bit if you have 4GB RAM or less
2012-04-26T00:40:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	wrong. amd created the 64bit arch, intel used it for their own cpus
2012-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	i386 is monstly used as synonyme for 32 bit x86
2012-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	delinquentme	SunTsu	Noted .. klync thanks!
2012-04-26T00:58:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	read
2012-04-26T00:58:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	but, you know, this channel's topic is ubuntu, there's more general channels elsewhere
2012-04-26T01:32:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	here it does, I added myself to that group
2012-04-26T01:32:00.000Z	delinquentme	SunTsu	did you install vbox from the repos or from : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
2012-04-26T01:33:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	I use Oracle's repository
2012-04-26T01:34:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	but, as I said, I added the user myself
2012-04-26T01:34:00.000Z	delinquentme	SunTsu	you mean the group??
2012-04-26T01:34:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	yes, of course
2012-04-26T01:35:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	not root, that doesn't make sense, the user I use for running vbox
2012-04-26T01:39:00.000Z	delinquentme	SunTsu	you dont know offhand what the command to allow oracle repos is do you?
2012-04-26T01:42:00.000Z	SunTsu	delinquentme	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads has all instructions
