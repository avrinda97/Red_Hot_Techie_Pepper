2011-10-26T21:28:00.000Z	metalf8801		tomslominski there is a program you can installed called Boot-Up Manger that will let you pick which programs you want to start when you turn on your computer
2011-10-26T21:28:00.000Z	metalf8801		 tomslominski what
2011-10-26T21:28:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	cheers, I'll have a look
2011-10-26T21:29:00.000Z	metalf8801		tomslominski what command were you using on RedHat systems to do this?
2011-10-26T21:30:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	I can't remember, I'd have to have a look if you really want to know
2011-10-26T21:33:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	if it wouldn't take you to long I would really like to know or if you can give me some more info I might be able to find it myself
2011-10-26T21:35:00.000Z	metalf8801		Is there an IRC client or a plug in for an IRC client that will wake a computer display/monitor/screen when it receives a new message?
2011-10-26T21:46:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	chkconfig
2011-10-26T21:47:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	thank you!
2011-10-26T21:47:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	i just found it in the repo
2011-10-26T21:47:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	i was sure someone told me its RPM/RedHat only!
2011-10-26T21:49:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	yeah me to
2011-10-26T21:49:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	on RedHat it's different, it's a curses ui.
2011-10-26T21:49:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	maybe it doesn't work the same on Debian based systems
2011-10-26T21:54:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	So on RHEL or Fedora it works like Midnight Commander?
2011-10-26T21:55:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	yes, something like that.
2011-10-26T21:55:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	its pretty cool
2011-10-26T21:56:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	I'm going to look into get chkconfig to work the same on Ubuntu as it does on RHEL I'll tell you if I get anywhere
2011-10-26T21:57:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	cool, cheers for that
2011-10-26T22:02:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	rcconf is supposed to be Ubuntu equivalent to RHEL's chkconfig
2011-10-26T22:03:00.000Z	TomSlominski	metalf8801	that's it! thanks!
2011-10-26T22:05:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	Yeah I just installed rcconf and it looks like a great tool for a server or another environment where you can use a GUI
2011-10-26T22:09:00.000Z	metalf8801	TomSlominski	Ubuntu also has  sysv-rc-conf but it is not supported by Canonical like rcconf is and I haven't tried sysv-rc-conf
