2006-08-09T05:49:00.000Z	domas		hii! did anyone find out why does ubuntu dapper freeze in parallels?
2006-08-09T05:49:00.000Z	domas		(I've heard live cd works, but proper install does not)
2006-08-09T05:50:00.000Z	domas		ah, pcmcia issues
2006-08-09T05:50:00.000Z	domas		how do I disable kernel's pcmcia support then? :)
2006-08-09T05:50:00.000Z	mwe	domas	blacklist the modules
2006-08-09T05:51:00.000Z	mwe	domas	pcmcia is modulized in Ubuntu. blacklisting the modules will turn it off
2006-08-09T05:53:00.000Z	mwe	domas	work for what?
2006-08-09T05:53:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it will give you a root prompt and not start any services
2006-08-09T05:53:00.000Z	domas	mwe	ubuntu hangs for me at 'Uncompressing Linux... OK, booting the kernel'
2006-08-09T05:54:00.000Z	mwe	domas	oh
2006-08-09T05:54:00.000Z	mwe	domas	what makes you think it's due to pcmcia?
2006-08-09T05:54:00.000Z	domas	mwe	some basic googling
2006-08-09T05:55:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it could be caused be a gazillion things
2006-08-09T05:55:00.000Z	domas	mwe	people used livecd to successfully install, and all failed with proper iso
2006-08-09T05:55:00.000Z	domas	mwe	sure, esp. being installed on a virtual machine :)
2006-08-09T05:55:00.000Z	mwe	domas	heh yes maybe so 
2006-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it installs just the basic system. no X or anything
2006-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	mwe	domas	the kernel is the same
2006-08-09T05:58:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it should be called minimal I think
2006-08-09T05:58:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it doesn't even install any server programs
2006-08-09T06:24:00.000Z	mwe	domas	it was annoying, having to run lilo at every change of lilo.conf or it would have any effect
2006-08-09T06:24:00.000Z	domas	mwe	more annoying part was 'LI'
2006-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	domas	oh yes that one too
