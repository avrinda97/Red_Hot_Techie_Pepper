2009-12-06T04:12:00.000Z	xJust		hi :D .. so .. how can i tell what version of ubuntu i'm using .. 32 or 64 bits .. and so on ? ? ?
2009-12-06T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	uname -m
2009-12-06T04:14:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	i686 = ? ?
2009-12-06T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	32bit
2009-12-06T04:14:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	thanks ,, now .. is there a 64bit out there ? .. is it better ??
2009-12-06T04:15:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	yes, how much ram do you have?
2009-12-06T04:15:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	4gb
2009-12-06T04:15:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	if you wanted to use the 64bit version (it's called "amd64") then you could, but you would have to reinstall
2009-12-06T04:16:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	thanks .. but .. is there any disadvantages ?
2009-12-06T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	no, not anymore
2009-12-06T04:16:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	is it faster ,, where can i compare ?
2009-12-06T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	it's not faster, you can just use more ram
2009-12-06T04:17:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	and using more ram .. means ?
2009-12-06T04:18:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	32bit can't use more than ~4gb of ram
2009-12-06T04:18:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	so .. if my ram are 4gb .. i don't have to reinstall 64bits ,, or i have to ?
2009-12-06T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	you don't "have" to
2009-12-06T04:20:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	one more time ,, if my rams = 4gb .. i'm at my best performance ,, and 64bit version ,, won't have any effects ,, ? true ?
2009-12-06T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	it's likely you'll be able to access more ram on 64bit (32bit won't actually address all 4gb for whatever reason)
2009-12-06T04:24:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	ooh ,, thanks :) .. so tell me .. is there any good way to "backup" things and "restore" them .. after the new install ?
2009-12-11T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	you don't defragment, you delete your internet history on firefox the same way you do on windows (check firefox menus)
2009-12-11T22:36:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	what about defragmentation ,, how dose it work in linux ? ^^
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	jrib	xJust	the filesystem doesn't defragment nearly as much for it to be required
2009-12-11T22:38:00.000Z	xJust	jrib	arigatou ^^
