2007-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	You broked my compuda. lol.
2007-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	I didn't break anything...
2007-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Very true, but I can no longer boot into Ubuntu after following your advice lol :P
2007-07-30T06:29:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	I went into the restricted drivers window and enabled/downloaded the ati drivers. When I restarted Ubuntu it went through perfectly fine until it reached the point where it should be loading the login screen, and it was black.
2007-07-30T06:30:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	Might have to tweak your xorg.conf resolution and/or refresh -- check monitor specs (I assume its LCD)
2007-07-30T06:30:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Recovery mode only allows me to utilize the command line -- which being a newb I'm not familar with
2007-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Better yet, WHAT am I supposed to be editing ;o
2007-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	You can force refresh rates and set other resolutions -- just look you'll see where...
2007-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	how do you known that?
2007-07-30T06:32:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Because one of the first things I did after booting into Ubuntu was change the resolutin, it was stuck on 1600 x 1200
2007-07-30T06:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	I'm confused - you said you couldn't log in - how did you change res?
2007-07-30T06:33:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	worse comes to worse, you can change driver from fglrx in xorg.conf to vesa to restore gui... sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-07-30T06:34:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	but likely an issue with resolutions refresh rate... nuke off highest reses... down to 1280x1024 whatever and see if it boots into that...
2007-07-30T06:34:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Alright
2007-07-30T06:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	I'd check monitor docs to see what refresh for that default resolutin and for xorgcofn to do that vertrefresh 80.0-80.00 etc...
2007-07-30T06:36:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	or there's dpkg-configure xorg-xserver-fglrx or something like that...
2007-07-30T06:36:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	You're confusing me uhhhh, I think I have just have to change xorg.conf to use fglrx
2007-07-30T06:36:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	no -- vesa...
2007-07-30T06:37:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	I thought fglrx wasn't working/
2007-07-30T06:38:00.000Z	Metafour	ShackJack	Don't I have to tell xorg.conf to use the new driver?
2007-07-30T06:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	No the restrcited drivers manager should of changed it but take a look -- if it is fglrx and not working you can change to vesa to restore GUI
2007-07-30T06:39:00.000Z	ShackJack	Metafour	Your issue with black screen is likely a resolution/refresh conflict with your monitor...
