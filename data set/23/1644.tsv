2009-12-19T20:14:00.000Z	BobXFett		So I take it this is the right channel to request some support.  I'm having an issue which I have been unable to find any solution for by searching, and was hoping somebody could help me either to correct it or to refine what I'm searching for to find some useful info online.
2009-12-19T20:14:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	What's the issue
2009-12-19T20:16:00.000Z	BobXFett		Summary of the issue: when I boot up or shut down Ubuntu (9.10), the progress screen (the one with the loading/unloading bar and the text that displays messages such as if a disk check needs to be performed) is corrupt; no ubuntu logo, no normal graphics, but it displays a lot of "test pattern" type imagery, such as black-to-white gradient, primary colors, different shapes, etc. (looks like one of those old "please stand by" TV 
2009-12-19T20:16:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	Sounds like a graphics driver problem - what type of graphics card do you have?
2009-12-19T20:17:00.000Z	BobXFett		I have an nvidia card.  I am not sure of the particular model.  Some background info which may be useful: I was previously running 8.04.  On that install I had modified my boot up splash screen and TTY settings to run in 1440x900 resolution, using the directions at the following URL: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=622018.  I am wondering if something from that change has carried over to the new install and I need to cl
2009-12-19T20:18:00.000Z	BobXFett		(I am also checking which video card I have right now, will confirm that in a moment)
2009-12-19T20:20:00.000Z	BobXFett		I have a Geforce 8400M GS running restricted nvidia drivers.
2009-12-19T20:22:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	does that information seem helpful or pertinent based on my description of the symptom?
2009-12-19T20:23:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	Yeh, so it sounds like a bug with the Nvidia restricted drivers - but there are lots of people running those so it seems odd; does it run OK basically without the restircted drivers?
2009-12-19T20:23:00.000Z	BobXFett		I have not tried.  Everything is actually functioning fine except for the boot up/shutdown screen.  Let me try disabling the driver and rebooting and see if it still happens.  One moment.
2009-12-19T20:24:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	Oh just the boot/shutdown screens, hmm - I don't think the Nvidia driver is loaded by that point?
2009-12-19T20:24:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	I have no idea at what stage the drivers load.
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	I think it's pretty much when you start X
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	Unfortunately I am not able to take a screenshot of it, but let me see if I can get a decent photo of the screen with my camera.  Perhaps seeing it will be helpful in case my description isn't specific enough.
2009-12-19T20:26:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	Also I am not familiar enough with linux to know what log files I may be able to peruse which might shed some light on this.
2009-12-19T20:28:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	I think dmesg output should show you the kernel boot messages as it first finds out about your graphics
2009-12-19T20:32:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	 I'm uploading an image now.  I am also taking a look at the dmesg log.
2009-12-19T20:33:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	I don't know much about Nvidia cards to be honest
2009-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	 I have not viewed this log before.  Is there a particular term I should look for?
2009-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	Anything relaying to video, nvidia or the like
2009-12-19T20:36:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	There are a number of lines beginning with vesafb:  None of them appear to have any errors, they provide information on the settings being applied (resolution, color depth).
2009-12-19T20:37:00.000Z	BobXFett	penguin42	Two lines with nvidia. Information about setting the IRQ and latency timer, no errors.
2009-12-19T20:37:00.000Z	penguin42	BobXFett	It's worth checking to see what happens without the nvidia driver, but either way I'd submit an ubuntu bug for it - noting whether or not it does it with and without the closed driver
