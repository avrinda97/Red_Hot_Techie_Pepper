2007-07-29T14:39:00.000Z	PluzHalp		anyone had an experience with fixing Grub??
2007-07-29T14:39:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	Whats wrong with reinstalling GRUB?
2007-07-29T14:40:00.000Z	PluzHalp	Flannel	I can't boot in the first place 'cause I did the installation on a different RIBBON then I switched the ribbon and I can't boot anymore
2007-07-29T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	right, you need to reinstall GRUB, not Ubuntu, just grub.  You need to point stage1 of grub (thats the stuff on the MBR) to your new HD location
2007-07-29T14:41:00.000Z	PluzHalp	Flannel	how
2007-07-29T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	first link there
2007-07-29T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	you must have done something wrong then.  Which section on that page did you do?
2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	is your harddrive currently at hda?
2007-07-29T14:44:00.000Z	PluzHalp	Flannel	ok I have LVM2 installation how can do this with the Alternate CD? Since I've gotta mount / as well
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	Oh, this is LVM?  Alright.  Do you have /boot on a separate partitio?
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#head-ec3e41291c7a5a7b61d7827299415204067765de is instructions using alt CD.  You do need to make sure /boot is on it's own (non-LVM) partition thoug
2007-07-29T14:46:00.000Z	PluzHalp	Flannel	thanks, of course is not on lvm
2007-07-29T14:54:00.000Z	PluzHalp	Flannel	"When the Ubuntu splash screen comes up with the boot: prompt, type in rescue and press enter." <--- I just got a kernel panic by doing this. Doesn't it mean to select the rescue option in the Splash menu?
2007-07-29T14:54:00.000Z	Flannel	PluzHalp	Selecting rescue will work too, yeah (used to not have that fancy menu)
