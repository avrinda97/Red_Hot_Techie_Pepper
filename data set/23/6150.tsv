2006-06-08T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	generally you don't want to, what permissions on what kind of file system
2006-06-08T15:33:00.000Z	amortvigil	ompaul	i have an hdd wich i cant do anything with because i aint got premissions
2006-06-08T15:35:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	I don't understand your question enough to help you, there are many ways to do things, if I give you one I can suggest that it works, but it could break your machine, so is it a windows disk, is it a linux disk what is it
2006-06-09T14:38:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	chage the word breezy into dapper with the help of sed or sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list; then >>sudo apt-get update&& sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2006-06-09T14:53:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	dist-upgrade does the work - upgrade will break moving from version to version, -- concept a small enough machine will only do 118 megs on upgrade but 685 on dist-upgrade
2006-06-09T14:54:00.000Z	amortvigil	ompaul	i donot understand what your trying to say
2006-06-09T14:55:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	do not upgrade to dapper do a dist-upgrade, it does the work - upgrade will break moving from version to version, -- small machine: 118 megs on upgrade but 685 on dist-upgrade
2006-06-09T14:58:00.000Z	amortvigil	ompaul	you mean  upgrade is the same als dist upgrade only upgrade updates everyfile and dist upgrade only the nessesary files?
2006-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	NO, you should do a dist-upgrade
2006-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	amortvigil	ompaul	butt... why???:S
2006-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	ompaul	amortvigil	reconfigurations to tell things that things have moved
2006-06-09T15:14:00.000Z	amortvigil	ompaul	it wont dist update
