2007-10-28T00:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Okay. How do I configure update-grub /not/ to put "splash" into the kernel options for the images to boot?
2007-10-28T00:33:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	its in /boot/grub/menu.lst take off the splash command at the end of your kernel
2007-10-28T00:35:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	I know how to do it in menu.lst, but update-grub CHANGES menu.lst, hence why I asked specifically update-grub.
2007-10-28T00:36:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	oh my mistake
2007-10-28T00:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Yeah, got a friend who's having a problem with usplash on their server system, cause they have a POS video card. ;)
2007-10-28T00:37:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	I know even the CLI installer puts the splash screen when grub is installed.
2007-10-28T00:37:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Not the server install edition.
2007-10-28T00:38:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	yeah it's true.  that server install cd was worthless... try the alternate install, it has a CLI install
2007-10-28T00:38:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Heh, the server install is what my friend used, no problem, actually.
2007-10-28T00:39:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	woah that server kernel is huuuuge.  everything you can think of is included in it :p
2007-10-28T00:39:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	It's got SELinux stuff in it.
2007-10-28T00:40:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	not sure what SElinux is.... googling
2007-10-28T00:43:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Kernel hardening stuff. ;)
2007-10-28T00:44:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	ah.  I tried that server install then went to desktop minimal install and built from there.
2007-10-28T00:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	I haven't done a server install since 6.10. :)   I've upgraded since then, on my 10 servers. ;)
2007-10-28T00:45:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	woah sounds like a full time job :)
2007-10-28T00:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Nah., not really. My servers run my house. ;)
2007-10-28T00:46:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	in what way?  in the fact that your heater is now obsolete? hehehe
2007-10-28T00:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	I programmed jackrabbit modules to handle signal inputs from basic serial lines, to be able to turn on/off my house lights, lock/unlock my doors, turn on the A/C set to a specific temperature, Cool or Heat. it handles my TV media streaming, along with music radio streaming, throughout the house.
2007-10-28T00:49:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	woah full automation!  Sweet.  So do you have the embedded RFID tube in your hand to wave at the door?
2007-10-28T00:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	Heh, no. Though I do have a USB key. LOL
2007-10-28T00:50:00.000Z	mehevi	Psi-Jack	I guess you call it that literally.
2007-10-28T00:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	mehevi	But yeah. Basically I have my own custom-built version of what people call a "smarthouse."
