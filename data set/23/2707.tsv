2009-11-15T19:57:00.000Z	ManDay	IdleOne	did you experience any problems with jaunty? in my case (dont ask me whats the name of the chip - its on an eee pc) scrolling webpages and 2d graphics in general was problematic
2009-11-15T19:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	ManDay	in jaunty I had no 3d support but besides that it was fine
2009-11-15T19:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	ManDay	lapdic | grep VGA should give you your graphics info
2009-11-15T19:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	ManDay	that should be lspci

2010-05-13T16:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	ManDay	would seem counter productive to lock a screen but still allow keyboard input.
2010-05-13T16:22:00.000Z	ManDay	IdleOne	the idea behind that is that my screens autolocks but I still want to be able to control the music player
2010-07-14T21:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	ManDay	could you please move this convo to #ubuntu-offtopic.
