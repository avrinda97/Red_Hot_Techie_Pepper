2011-05-14T09:47:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: you can install that app through the terminal
2011-05-14T09:47:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: you can install that app through the terminal . it gives untrusted if it's not in the ubuntu software center
2011-05-14T09:48:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	then why is it looking outside the software center for upgrades?
2011-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: Every package has dependencies if anyone of them is untrusted it'll show u that msg
2011-05-14T09:50:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	 ok, had NEVER seen this warning before.... so, thought i should inquire..... Thank You!
2011-05-14T09:50:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: You are welcome .

2011-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: run sudo "apt-get update" from the terminal and then "apt-get upgrade"  without quotes
2011-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	 yepper, did that.... why does it want 10

2011-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: wat are u trying to doing ?
2011-05-14T10:00:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	i simply wanted to apply the current upgrades to 10.10
2011-05-14T10:01:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: ayou have 10.04 Lts currently installed ?
2011-05-14T10:01:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	 no, i am at 10.10

2011-05-14T10:03:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: i  guess did u installed the updates correctly ? lik all of them or it was a partial upgrade  ?
2011-05-14T10:04:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	total upgrade via locally burned cd.... ALL md5 hashes matched.... the upgrade reported success at the end.... total upgrade... No interruptions.... amd/64
2011-05-14T10:10:00.000Z	quick	cryptodira	: i guess start logout start in safe mode and use the previous command some of the packages might be interfering with each other and file a bug or report it
2011-05-14T10:11:00.000Z	cryptodira	quick	 ok, i will give that a try.... Thanks Again for your help!    laters.
