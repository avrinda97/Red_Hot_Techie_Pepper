2006-08-20T10:42:00.000Z	newbuntu		rob thanks for the word up about lmms dj software
2006-08-20T10:42:00.000Z	newbuntu		I love linux community  ... most cutting edge thing out there.... its like a living organism
2006-08-20T10:43:00.000Z	newbuntu		apt-get  is the modern answer to karma-stealing windows piracy... bill gates gets a piece of every soul that steals from him
2006-08-20T10:44:00.000Z	newbuntu		gates has so much money ... it's souls he's after
2006-08-20T10:44:00.000Z	newbuntu		i dont do windows updates...
2006-08-20T10:45:00.000Z	newbuntu		do you?

2006-08-20T10:45:00.000Z	newbuntu		windblows
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	rob	newbuntu	Windows is off topic here, try #ubuntu-offtopic instead :)
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	newbuntu		I remember a linux conference where microsoft had a banner...  "help microsoft make linux even better"  ... screw that
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	newbuntu	ubuntu	is on topic though isnt it?
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	rob		umm, yes
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	rob		the offtopic channel is for whatever
2006-08-20T10:47:00.000Z	newbuntu	ubuntu	being better than windows is not something you can celebrate in this channel?
2006-08-20T10:47:00.000Z	rob		I also suggest reading that factoid again eyequeue
2006-08-20T10:48:00.000Z	newbuntu		I like to discuss ubuntu, linux, open-source and windows defections...
2006-08-20T10:48:00.000Z	rob	newbuntu	use #ubuntu-offtopic then
