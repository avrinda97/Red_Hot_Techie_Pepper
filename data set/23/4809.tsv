2009-08-25T13:47:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	sorry, didn't see it. could you point me to the url?
2009-08-25T13:48:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	hrm. how about the whole dmesg command without the tail?
2009-08-25T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	look, do you know how to install software with apt-get?
2009-08-25T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	can you open a terminal?
2009-08-25T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	okay, did you get the terminal open? let me know when you did..
2009-08-25T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	now, type first:   sudo apt-get update
2009-08-25T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	it will ask you for your password, type it in and let it rip
2009-08-25T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	did it perform the update alright?
2009-08-25T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	last line should say this: Reading package lists... Done
2009-08-25T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	good. now type:  sudo apt-get install pastebin
2009-08-25T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	sorry, that should've been:  sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2009-08-25T14:03:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	good, now type:  dmesg | pastebinit
2009-08-25T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	yes, then paste it here :)
2009-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	okay, good. looks like linux doesn't even see your wifi... which is, of course, bad. :)
2009-08-25T14:08:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	I'm with ActionParsnip on this, check your bios settings
2009-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	when you turn the computer on, you should be able to press F2 and get to it
2009-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	check your documentation if you still have it
2009-08-25T14:12:00.000Z	Gnea	mikey	did you find your hp documentation?
