2009-02-02T16:15:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	might be a bug, like this one https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ekiga/+bug/237903
2009-02-02T16:16:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	yep.. saw that site .. doesn't provide a fix though :-\
2009-02-02T16:16:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	you have choice to reopen it and paste your own problem:)
2009-02-02T16:17:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	somebody must do it
2009-02-02T16:21:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	are you running on 8.10 ?

2009-02-02T16:21:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	could you maybe e-mail me your file, so I could test and see if I can fix it ?

2009-02-02T16:26:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	cheers
2009-02-02T16:27:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	now refresh, just completed ftping, my line is slow
2009-02-02T16:27:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	looks like it might be working. I got a lot less errors now.
2009-02-02T16:28:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	i suspect this apt-get --purge just doesnt clean everything
2009-02-02T16:28:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	but i'm  not expert on this
2009-02-02T16:29:00.000Z	milligan_	miha	it was generating the error no matter what I did ..
2009-02-02T16:29:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	i had problems with samba reinstall, then someone reminded me to --purge samba-common too
2009-02-02T16:30:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	it's not fix, it's directly from repository, proposed perhaps, though
2009-02-02T16:31:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	i just enabled 'proposed' for my webcam stuff then i found out it's differnet issue
2009-02-02T16:36:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	did you try amsn lately.. it does audio chat too now :)
2009-02-02T16:36:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	the svn version
2009-02-02T16:37:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	http://www.amsn-project.net/wiki/Farsight
2009-02-02T16:38:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	not too much, i wrote my slovenian instructions with just necessary stuff http://sponka.net/AMSN_slika_in_zvok#Razvojna_razli.C4.8Dica_aMSN_in_knji.C5.BEnice i guess you could ignore comments and just try those commands
2009-02-02T16:39:00.000Z	miha	milligan_	amsn wiki has more detailed explanation
