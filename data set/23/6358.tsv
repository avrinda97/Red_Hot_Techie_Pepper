2006-08-12T16:47:00.000Z	eimajenthat		How do I hotswap my pcmcia wireless card in ubuntu or xubuntu?
2006-08-12T05:00:00.000Z	eimajenthat		my wireless card is only sometimes recognized at boot.  How do I tell the system it's there after I'm already booted?
2006-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	do a ifconfig -a to see it, then ifconfig ath0 up to bring it up
2006-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	if ath0 is th name of your interface
2006-08-12T05:02:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	if ifconfig -a doesnt show your wireless interface, you probly need to modprobe the driver
2006-08-12T05:02:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	google that
2006-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	ath0 is the name of my interface when it's working.  I do ifconfig -a but it doesn't show me ath0
2006-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	ok...that means you need to do a modprobe on the driver
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	I tried modprobe ath_pci and modprobe ath0.  The first doesn't give an error, but doesn't show any change.  The second gives not found.
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	can I modprobe something else?
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	type, modprobe -l
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	see what that says
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	does it say anything about aht_pci?
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	a lot
2006-08-12T05:06:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	ok, if theres too much info to read, then just do, modprobe -l|grep ath_pci
2006-08-12T05:07:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	two things
2006-08-12T05:09:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	so the module is loaded, the device shows in lspci, but the interface isn't there, what do I do?
2006-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	dougsko	eimajenthat	dude, wireless cards are the biggest pain in the dik on earth. i really dont have much else to suggest
2006-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	eimajenthat	dougsko	thanks for trying
