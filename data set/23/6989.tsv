2007-03-31T11:18:00.000Z	euxneks		anyone here know about f-spot?
2007-03-31T11:18:00.000Z	euxneks		specifically, why are there copies of images with -1 in them? I.e. if I have an image named dcp1023.jpg there is another image named dcp1023-1.jpg
2007-03-31T11:19:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	what about f-spot?

2007-03-31T11:20:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	I gave up uderstanding this, but I figured out why it happens
2007-03-31T11:22:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	f-spot may be set to copy every picture file to a ~/.Photos
2007-03-31T11:22:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	that sounds like that's it
2007-03-31T11:22:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	will it also make a backup of the original or something?
2007-03-31T11:23:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	since it finds the files already there (with the original name) it shows a newer verion of the file as a -1
2007-03-31T11:24:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	It happened on my system using Edgy only if f-spot crashed at least once and had to recrate its index of pictures
2007-03-31T11:24:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	so that's from me importing the file twice then
2007-03-31T11:25:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	I think so... I gave up using f-spot since... I may try again under Feisty (the new Ubuntu version)
2007-03-31T11:26:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	what do you use for an image "maintaining" system...?
2007-03-31T11:26:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	for now, I have been satisfied with gThumb (not the same resources, I know)
2007-03-31T11:26:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	hrm.. ok cool thanks for the information =)
2007-03-31T11:27:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	It does import from my canon digital cam easy and it creates a single folder where ever you would like to save those....
2007-03-31T11:28:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	It can tag categories and create simple slide shows
2007-03-31T11:29:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	I am sure you can find it at Add/Remove if not already installed
2007-03-31T11:29:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	yeah I have it installed, but I liked the simplicity of f-spot better, it reminded me of iPhoto
2007-03-31T11:30:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	not that I'm not down with gThumb =P
2007-03-31T11:30:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	euxneks	I am not saying f-spot is no good... but it has some odd behaviour some times (like this duplication of the pictures)
2007-03-31T11:31:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	cool thanks
2007-03-31T11:32:00.000Z	euxneks	PresuntoRJ	thanks
