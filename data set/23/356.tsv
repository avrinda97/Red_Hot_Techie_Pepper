2011-11-14T02:51:00.000Z	bagels_		Hey, is there an android app that works with ubuntu that lets me use my phone like a remote control for hulu desktop and other media?
2011-11-14T02:52:00.000Z	bagels_		I'm looking for a simple arrow key thing, not a mouse controller.  I have one of those.
2011-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	there is xbmc remote and vlc remote
2011-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	does it work with any program in linux, as if it were a keyboard?
2011-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	there is also transdroid which I can recommend heavily
2011-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	tell me more plx
2011-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	the xbmc remote acts like a DVD remote and has lots of great buttons, check it out
2011-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	vlc remote lets you control volume, fullscreen and what is playing
2011-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	but do i need xbmc for it to work?
2011-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	for xbmc remote, yes
2011-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	nvm the xbmc then, I don't use it.  Unless it's compatible with wii and hulu.  Then I'll change my mind XD
2011-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	there is also this http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/remotedroid-lets-you-control-your-desktop-using-your-phone/
2011-11-14T02:57:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	I have remotedroid, I was thinking something more like an actual remote, with arrow keys and volume.
2011-11-14T02:57:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	and an ok button.
2011-11-14T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	http://masl.cis.gvsu.edu/2011/05/20/demo-of-android-based-remote-control-app-for-hulu/
2011-11-14T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	does hulu allow remote controlling by web ui etc?
2011-11-14T02:59:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	hulu desktop allows remote controlling via an IR computer remote, a wiimote (if you have BT), etc.
2011-11-14T02:59:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	there's also apps like playon.tv that broadcast hulu to the wii and roku via your PC, but all are windows/mac only.
2011-11-14T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	there is unified remote in android store for very little cash which can talk to hulu
2011-11-14T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	seems to be windows only
2011-11-14T03:02:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	there's tons of windows apps.  all I want is a free remote app... that looks like a remote
2011-11-14T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bagels_	the vlc one and xbmc is all I know dude
2011-11-14T03:02:00.000Z	bagels_	ActionParsnip	I'm resigned to play my computer to the tv.  I'll look into xbmc.  tyvm :)
