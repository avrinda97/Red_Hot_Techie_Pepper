2005-06-13T08:25:00.000Z	rodrigo		hi, I just installed ubuntu, from debian, Im trying to play some .avi's with tottem, but I get this error:There were no decoders found to handle the stream in file...... you might need to install the corresponding plugins
2005-06-13T08:25:00.000Z	rodrigo		does anybody know what plugins is he talking about
2005-06-13T08:25:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	need to install w32codecs
2005-06-13T08:26:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	, I have them already
2005-06-13T08:26:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	the computer?
2005-06-13T08:26:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	yep
2005-06-13T08:27:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	hang on.  using totem-xine?
2005-06-13T08:27:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	well the totem, you get from the basic install 1.1.1
2005-06-13T08:28:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	install totem-xine. the default gstreamer seems to be a little patchy unfortunately
2005-06-13T08:28:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	no, is not the totem-xine...
2005-06-13T08:28:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	should I install it?
2005-06-13T08:28:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	yes
2005-06-13T08:29:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	its comming
2005-06-13T08:33:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	it works, thanks
2005-06-13T11:25:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	any other info besides that?
2005-06-13T11:25:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	hi...
2005-06-13T11:26:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	well the xp is mounted in /dev/hdb1 as an NTFS
2005-06-13T11:26:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	when u start the computer you get the grub window...
2005-06-13T11:27:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	and when you choose WinXp, all it says is:root  (hd1,0)
2005-06-13T11:32:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	most likely one of your grub boots isn't correct
2005-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	any ideas how to fix it?
2005-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	reka	rodrigo	i'm not a grub expert i'm afraid...
2005-06-13T11:34:00.000Z	rodrigo	reka	thanks, and do u know how to get rid of it? I want my lilo back...
