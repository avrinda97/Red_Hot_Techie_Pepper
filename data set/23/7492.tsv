2005-12-18T15:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	if you keep hitting TAB, you should cycle thru all the nicks that start with the letters you've already typed
2005-12-18T15:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	which IRC app are you using?
2005-12-23T16:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	tab-complete works in IRC as well, on nicks...
2005-12-23T16:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	I can get your whole nick by typing "Cap<tab>" :D

2006-03-05T14:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	have a good look thru "man chmod" - but AFAIK -R means "everything"
2006-03-05T15:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	interesting - so it chmods only directories without touching the files inside them?
2006-03-05T15:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	CaptainMorgan	cool. I'll copy that down for dissection tomorrow!
