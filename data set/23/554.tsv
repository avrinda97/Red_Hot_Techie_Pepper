2011-06-10T17:25:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	oh, I got it... still, it gives the bad page error
2011-06-10T17:26:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	run memtest86
2011-06-10T17:26:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	(im thinking possibly bad memory chip)
2011-06-10T17:26:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	kk, just let me test the new usb...
2011-06-10T17:27:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	no im not sure, hence im only thinking possibly
2011-06-10T17:28:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	i have no experience with windows ubuntu tools
2011-06-10T17:28:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	I'm using ubuntu for netbooks for burning the usbs
2011-06-10T17:29:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	i dont know about them either lol
2011-06-10T17:29:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	memtest86 says "Cannot load a ramdisk with an old kernel image"
2011-06-10T17:30:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	try putting your old memory in the machine, see if its that
2011-06-10T17:31:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	wait, you have a bunch of mixed chips?
2011-06-10T17:31:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	ehm, yeah
2011-06-10T17:31:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	you cant do that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-channel_architecture
2011-06-10T17:33:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	windows probbally has a way to work around such a configuration
2011-06-10T17:34:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	the rule of thumb is to buy all your memory at once for your mobo and never worry about it again
2011-06-10T17:40:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	actually, they're both DDR2 lol
2011-06-10T17:41:00.000Z	pfifo	esi	if you have 2 different colored slots, put one in blue and one in black, that 'should' work but it depends on your mmu
2011-06-10T17:44:00.000Z	esi	pfifo	it seems that the 1GB memory was troubling the whole thing...
