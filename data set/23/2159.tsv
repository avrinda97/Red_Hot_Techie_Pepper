2009-06-10T10:30:00.000Z	blubaustin		so any ideas...
2009-06-10T10:30:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	I'm failing to see the problem if you're actually connected here... so maybe you need to explain what the problem is (for those who haven't been reading for the last half hour)
2009-06-10T10:33:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	is it more verbose than 'temporary error' ?
2009-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	blubaustin	tabrisnet	does that give u a better idea?
2009-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	sounds like a DNS problem more than a HTTP problem.
2009-06-10T10:36:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	tbh this is sounding distressingly like you're behind a transparent proxy.
2009-06-10T10:36:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	well, youy could be behind a _transparent_ proxy put up by your ISP... albeit i don't know if qwest does that.
2009-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	`host security.debian.org`
2009-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	doesn't look wrong
2009-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	nah... dig is as good as host
2009-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	dig is more verbose. i figured the short version was good enough
2009-06-10T10:40:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	no, b/c the server taht responded was the one in your resolv.conf
2009-06-10T10:40:00.000Z	tabrisnet	blubaustin	fwiw, I'm in #debian
2009-06-10T10:41:00.000Z	blubaustin	tabrisnet	and losher in ebian now
