2005-05-18T16:37:00.000Z	goofrider		and don't include the offical DEbian depo
2005-05-18T16:39:00.000Z	goofrider		Xorg.conf?
2005-05-18T16:39:00.000Z	goofrider		LMAO
2005-05-18T16:40:00.000Z	goofrider		amarok is popular for KDE
2005-05-18T16:40:00.000Z	goofrider		Totem is the offically support media player in Ubuntu
2005-05-18T16:41:00.000Z	goofrider		I though Totem=gstreamer can use w32codecs as well
2005-05-18T16:42:00.000Z	goofrider		I'm using Totem-Gstremer with w32codecs, no problem
2005-05-18T16:42:00.000Z	goofrider		yeah it took me a while to figure out what I need (I'm a n00b myself)
2005-05-18T16:43:00.000Z	goofrider		amaranth: w32codecs is probably incompatible with GPL/LGPL
2005-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	goofrider		so it'll be illegal to even use it on Linux, technically
2005-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	Doesn't work like that.
2005-05-18T16:49:00.000Z	goofrider	Amaranth	it only means he doesn't work there anymore
2005-05-18T16:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	That's not Ubuntu's fault.
2005-05-18T06:13:00.000Z	goofrider	Amaranth	maybe u should explain the ramiflicatin of adding Marrilat to sources.list instead of just plain bashing everyone recomending it
2005-05-18T06:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	Random breakages because it's for Debian is is tracking Debian. Difficulty upgrading to breezy later because of newer packages gotten from marillat. Probably some more I can't think of right now.
2005-05-18T06:16:00.000Z	goofrider	Amaranth	and it'll be any better if they download the DEB from Marilat and install manually? The same version # conflicts apply
2005-05-18T06:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	Exactly. Thus the 'stupid' comment. It's a stupid thing to do.
2005-05-18T06:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	But they aren't. They expect help here and file bug reports.
2005-05-18T06:17:00.000Z	goofrider	Amaranth	well then maybe Marillat should not even be mENTIONED in the wiki and Ubuntuguide
2005-05-18T06:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	ubuntuguide is totally unofficial. It's written by a user, not a dev.
2005-05-18T06:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	And the wiki is edittable by all.
2005-05-18T06:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	goofrider	All the references I can find on the wiki for marillat say it'll break things.
2005-05-18T06:39:00.000Z	goofrider	Amaranth	well I'll try my best not to recommend ppl to include marillat
