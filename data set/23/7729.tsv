2006-10-08T15:10:00.000Z	Trackilizer		When i turn on my PC, ubuntu crahses while loading moudules or somthig like that
2006-10-08T15:10:00.000Z	Trackilizer		that happens everytime i trun on my PC
2006-10-08T15:10:00.000Z	Trackilizer		do i have to re-install because of this?
2006-10-08T15:11:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	you probably have problematic hardware ... but hard to know without looking at the system
2006-10-08T15:12:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	so i would have to buy new hardware?
2006-10-08T15:12:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	well you would need to perform testing to find out what its hanging on
2006-10-08T15:12:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	do you know where exactly it stops?
2006-10-08T15:14:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	well generally if it it stops during bootup you should be able to see the line it stops at
2006-10-08T15:14:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	yes its the modules part it stops at
2006-10-08T15:16:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	so just do that and wait for the error message right?
2006-10-08T15:21:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	i get stop the boot splash, it happes at the beginning of the load procces
2006-10-08T15:22:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	i've seen that once before but i cannot remember the fix
2006-10-08T15:22:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	i'm going to stab at it with 'reinstall' and see what happens
2006-10-08T15:22:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	sounds like it cannot find the partition
2006-10-08T15:29:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	not being able to boot into the LIVE cd mean something is really wring with my hardware right?
2006-10-08T15:30:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	well probably but depends
2006-10-08T15:31:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	what cpu/ram do you have?
2006-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	i just tried a knoppix livecd, and i still have the same problem, somewhere in the boot procces, the screen simply goes blank... and nothing happens after that
2006-10-08T15:42:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	ye it could also be bad ram.  just out of curiosity did you have another os on this system? did it ever work?
2006-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	Trackilizer	holycow	it's my old PC that used to have win98, but I've used it for ubuntu for  over a year now, i have this problem since yestery
2006-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	ohhhhhhh, chances are the hd is dead
2006-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	that makes sense.... its managed to read the hd up to that part then it gets no further response
2006-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	holycow	Trackilizer	no problem hopefully it works
