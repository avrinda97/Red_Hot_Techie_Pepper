2010-01-01T18:44:00.000Z	deviad		  sreadahead
2010-01-01T18:44:00.000Z	deviad		?
2010-01-01T18:45:00.000Z	deviad		I have installed propertary drivers for the wifi card and graphic card
2010-01-01T18:46:00.000Z	deviad		If I open synaptics packet manager although I can run the updates... I'm worried to screw the propertary drivers though
2010-01-01T18:46:00.000Z	deviad		or that they are not available for the newer kernel... any help?
2010-01-01T18:47:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	which proprietary driver(s)?
2010-01-01T18:47:00.000Z	deviad		Yanick, nvidia and broadcom
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	did you install them using the Hardware driver panel or using custom install scripts?
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	deviad	Yanick_	the proposed upgrade is from 2.6.31-14 to 2.6.31-16
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	deviad		I used hardware driver panel
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	deviad		didn't want to screw up anything so I chosed that method
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	then no worries
2010-01-01T18:48:00.000Z	deviad		ok
2010-01-01T18:49:00.000Z	deviad		oh, I installed also cryptsetup to encrypt my pendrive
2010-01-01T18:49:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	not familiar with it
2010-01-01T18:49:00.000Z	deviad		it uses something embed in the new kernels that allows encryption of pendrives
2010-01-01T18:49:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	but unless it is dependant on the kernel, you should not have any problem
2010-01-01T18:49:00.000Z	deviad		OK, let's give this a shoot
2010-01-01T18:50:00.000Z	Yanick_	deviad	you can still reboot with the old kernel if it doesn't work with GRUB
