2008-04-26T16:40:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	I just googled your Acer
2008-04-26T16:36:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	i'm running gutsy on an asus and it runs like a dream after you get through the first few humps
2008-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	cool. The one bump for me right now with Lenovo is the sound. But seems like a well knows issues that a backports will address. I just ahven't taken the time
2008-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	what kind of asus?
2008-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	a8js
2008-04-26T16:39:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	I see it has Intel wireless. Cool I have a friend with an HP 6000, with the broadcom. BCM linux support isn't strong
2008-04-26T16:40:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	it's an asus mate
2008-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	sorry, I meant asus
2008-04-26T16:43:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	My Lenovo was about $600. 3000 n410. Your Asus is a little out of my price range
2008-04-26T16:43:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	at least until I get a job :)
2008-04-26T16:44:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	What humps did you hit? I see it's got an nvidia card, so you needed the prop drivers.
2008-04-26T16:44:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	if you do get the cash, don't buy it... .great machine but has heating issues. too packed for its own good
2008-04-26T16:44:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	was sound ok on the A8j?
2008-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	thanks.  the EEEPC 9 inch looks fun. By getting a low end Lenovo for $600 (another $100 for 4 MB), I figure I can spend another $300 or $400 on the EEEPC
2008-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	sound and graphics worked fine out of the box. networking took a bit of tweaking and advanced graphics took a bit of xorg tweaking. fan still needs to be tweaked and instability occurs with advanced desktop effects (something with the window titles)
2008-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	I'm waiting for the 9 inch model though.  It's only 2 pound!
2008-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	interesting. When you say fan tweaking, are you talking BIOS?
2008-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	I think my Lenovo 3000 needs a fan tweak, but my googling tells me maybe BIOS related.  I haven't dug in there yet.  It makes this louzy clicking sound. I thought maybe it was broken
2008-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	But when I GG, I see others have fan issues
2008-04-26T16:48:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	I've got 30 days. But I'm trying not to get too obsessive about it, as I'm out of work as of a week ago, and need to job search. Much as I'd rather hack
2008-04-26T16:48:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	For returning the Lenovo, --- 30 days
2008-04-26T16:49:00.000Z	Bits	errpast	i've found that linux is just as fun without all the bells and whistles, and i gave up on the advanced graphics. no adv. graphics means less heat means less fan means less problems -- and it's perfectly serviceable
2008-04-26T16:50:00.000Z	errpast	Bits	Smart move. It's easy to get fanatical about it. I know I do. But in the end, as long as I have net, Firefox, xchat, vim I'm pretty happy
