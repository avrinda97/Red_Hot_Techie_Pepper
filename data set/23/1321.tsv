2010-05-17T07:31:00.000Z	ARandomNub		Hi :]
2010-05-17T07:31:00.000Z	ARandomNub		Q: I just installed Ubuntu and now it's not detecting my windows installation :(. How can I get *both* to work?
2010-05-17T07:32:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	how did u install?  wubi or dual boot?
2010-05-17T07:32:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	I burnt it to a disc, and selected 200gb of the only partition available to select, which said it didn't have an o/s on it.
2010-05-17T07:34:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	so u can see the windows partition?
2010-05-17T07:34:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	I can see the FILES, I just don't get the option to boot into winndows.
2010-05-17T07:34:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	agree with doyule - looks like a grub thingy.  login as root, run terminal sudo update-grub
2010-05-17T07:35:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	it's complete.
2010-05-17T07:35:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	wait 1
2010-05-17T07:36:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	Okay :D
2010-05-17T07:37:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	bookmark that url i sent.  then reboot to see if u got the fix.
2010-05-17T07:42:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	Places>Search for files>grub.cfg
2010-05-17T07:43:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	nothing found =[
2010-05-17T07:43:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	? waaa?
2010-05-17T07:44:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	suggest u slow up and read the factoid.  the recovery options are laid out in that document and should'nt be rushed.
2010-05-17T07:47:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	slow up.  read the grub2 issue.  then carefully fix.  you're on teh right path.
2010-05-17T07:47:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	trying to rush a grub fix is 90% guaranteed to trash the installation
2010-05-17T07:48:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	Can I PM you for a moment, please?
2010-05-17T07:48:00.000Z	acerimmer	ARandomNub	yeah
2010-05-17T07:57:00.000Z	ARandomNub	acerimmer	Hey :D
