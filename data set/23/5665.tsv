2008-07-03T10:24:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	should work out of the box, what specific problem are you having
2008-07-03T10:25:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	it works out of the box
2008-07-03T10:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	you only need one of those wires, not both (and you should use the rj45)
2008-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	yes
2008-07-03T10:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	forget that for now, we'll get there
2008-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	just type ifconfig -a
2008-07-03T11:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	run it, and then go to a website and it'll probably work
2008-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	now go to a website
2008-07-03T11:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	yes
2008-07-03T15:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	where are you at now for progress
2008-07-03T15:16:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	and do you have an IP for either of your interfaces?
2008-07-03T15:22:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	i asked you a question a while ago
2008-07-03T15:23:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	if you type ifconfig -a, do any of your interfaces have an ip address other than 169.xxx.xxx.xxx
2008-07-03T15:24:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	what happens if you type dhclient eth1
2008-07-03T15:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	ok, and then what happens if you go to a website on your browser
2008-07-03T15:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	ok, in terminal type dhclient eth0 then
2008-07-03T15:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	and then what?
2008-07-03T15:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	use "sudo dhclient eth0"
2008-07-03T15:31:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	no
2008-07-03T15:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	you pretty much never have to restart linux
2008-07-03T15:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jaseem	what does your windows connection have to do with this, aren't you on linux?
