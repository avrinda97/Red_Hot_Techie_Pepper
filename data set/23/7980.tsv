2006-08-27T09:44:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	Been trying to get XGL/COmpiz to go for weeks - well beyond my novice nerd skill level.
2006-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	I got xgl working in 5 minutes following the guide on the wiki
2006-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	what do you want to do with grub ?
2006-08-27T09:46:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	- I'm not sure I even know what I'm saying - I want to be able to choose which distro I run when I launch - ubuntu, openSUSE or freespire.
2006-08-27T09:46:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	depending on your setup you need to add a section for each distro
2006-08-27T09:47:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	btw
2006-08-27T09:47:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	if ubuntu is the first linux you have installed you should have grub installed in Mbr
2006-08-27T09:47:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	OK.
2006-08-27T09:47:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	is this your situation ?
2006-08-27T09:48:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	Right now I have straight ubuntu on a 250 Gb hard drive on an x86 (celeron) frankenstein box I put together.
2006-08-27T09:48:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	so you need to resize it
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	Can I do that without having to nuke my drive?
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	I've used gparted booted from my usb stick and everything was fine
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	How'd I do that?
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	download gparted
2006-08-27T09:50:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	boot it, and resize the partition
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	you have ext3 fs or what ?
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	Will it preserve my data?
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	should
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	I'm pretty sure it's ext3.  It's been a while since I set it up.
2006-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	visik7	eric__	it had preserve mine
2006-08-27T09:52:00.000Z	eric__	visik7	So I use gparted to make my partition smaller, then let the installers for OpenSUSE and Freespire use the remaining space, assuming their installers will play nice with ubuntu?
