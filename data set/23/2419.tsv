2009-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	rjbs		I feel like an idiot for being unable to get this to work:  I have installed Ubuntu 8.10 on an external USB hard drive.  This is a large drive and I did a standard install, not a "usb bootable."
2009-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	rjbs		When I reboot, I get grub error 21.
2009-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	rjbs		I don't see any obvious-to-me errors in the menu.lst
2009-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	can you pastebin it?
2009-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	My menu.lst?
2009-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	ya
2009-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	Sure, it'll take a minute or two.  I need to reboot from a Live CD or something so I can see it.

2009-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	what's the mobo?
2009-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	MSI Wind PC, MS-6496
2009-03-20T23:37:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	dual boot?
2009-03-20T23:37:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	No.  When I am trying to boot, there is nothing attached but the USB drive, and it has only Ubuntu 8.10 on it.
2009-03-20T23:38:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	do you know the drive name /dev/sd0 ?
2009-03-20T23:39:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	I'm not sure what you're asking, sorry.
2009-03-20T23:39:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	you answered it
2009-03-20T23:39:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	Clearly I'm more communicative than I know!
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	no clue hopefully someone else knows a fix
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	Thanks, anyway.
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	all I'm seeing on the web is people saying "reinstall"
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	 My related question was: If I make a bootable SD card (which I've done) is it easy to make sure that some particular external drive is always mounted at the same point?
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	Well, reinstalling a fresh install can't hurt.
2009-03-20T23:45:00.000Z	binarymutant	rjbs	you can use fstab and mtab to make sure things are mounted in the place you want them to be mounted at
2009-03-20T23:49:00.000Z	rjbs	binarymutant	Yup, I've found e2label, which looks like it will do the trick.  Thanks.
