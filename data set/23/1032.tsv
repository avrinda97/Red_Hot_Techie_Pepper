2010-11-20T16:22:00.000Z	amarcolino		Trying to remove a package on my system that was installed using apt, however, something is misconfiguration and it doesn't let me uninstall, please take a look at my pastebin http://paste.ubuntu.com/534547/. Can anyone help?
2010-11-20T16:24:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	what was the actual command you used here?
2010-11-20T16:25:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	originally tried aptitude purge, than -f update/upgrade to try and see if apt would correct the package, however it doesn't now I just want to force remove the package
2010-11-20T16:27:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	can you do 'sudo apt-get -f install' and post the output?
2010-11-20T16:28:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	post = paste at http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2010-11-20T16:42:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	I'm able to install/uninstall that package on lucid 64 without any problem if that helps you
2010-11-20T16:43:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	you have to find out which "subprocess" dpkg doesn't have permission to execute, then find out why
2010-11-20T16:44:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	on my other comp it works, I don't know why root would be failing on this package
2010-11-20T16:44:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	you can only discover that using dpkg output - aptitude/apt-get doesn't give you enough information
2010-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	so dpkg -i package name?
2010-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	that's probably a good place to start
2010-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	paste that output and I'll look with you
2010-11-20T16:49:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	the pastebin show the output of both dpkg purge and install not much info given http://paste.ubuntu.com/534552/
2010-11-20T16:52:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	first do 'sudo apt-get install denyhosts', then 'sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/denyhosts_2.6-6.1ubuntu1_all.deb' and please paste that
2010-11-20T16:57:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	i've also posted the output of aptitude reinstall http://paste.ubuntu.com/534554/
2010-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	still there?
2010-11-20T17:08:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	yes I'm here, but I'm not sure what to advise...  I've not seen the "package list missing" errors before :-/
2010-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	neither have I specially a package in the repo, will stick around and ask again soon, it bugs me to have unmet package(s)
2010-11-20T17:11:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	try the advice in #2 at this forums thread, then try again: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1558616
2010-11-20T17:54:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	sorry about earlier I became engrossed in something else just noticed your message will check that link
2010-11-20T17:55:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	no prob - I'm doing other things too ;-0
2010-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	amarcolino	yeats	didn't work I have a good hunch it's something with apt, will be loading the snapshot image I made earlier before doing system settings, it will take long but at least it will be working
2010-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	yeats	amarcolino	good luck!
