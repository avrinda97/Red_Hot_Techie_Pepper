2010-05-19T03:05:00.000Z	samba_		and this is a bad day for me if I cannot resolve this wifi problem...
2010-05-19T03:07:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	I don't see a wlan controller in lspci
2010-05-19T03:08:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	you don't say, of course it won't show up.
2010-05-19T03:09:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	look: http://paste.ubuntu.com/435779/
2010-05-19T03:10:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	if there's no adapter in lspci then the block device won't exist at all.  is the wireless device enabled in bios.
2010-05-19T03:11:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	or has it worked in a windoze os?
2010-05-19T03:11:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	by specification yes wireless card exist
2010-05-19T03:12:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	somebody say to me that wifi in windows works
2010-05-19T03:12:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	they did eh, verify that yourself?
2010-05-19T03:12:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	how ?
2010-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	now I have only ubuntu ...
2010-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	that it works in windoze.
2010-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	samba_	_blackwater_	I have to install windows to try it
2010-05-19T03:14:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	i don't believe the adapter is installed in your laptop.  It should lspci regardless if it's enabled.
2010-05-19T03:15:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	if your lspci is complete then your laptop is missing the wireless controller.
2010-05-19T03:16:00.000Z	_blackwater_	samba_	they are not difficult to remove.
