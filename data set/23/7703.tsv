2005-05-21T16:52:00.000Z	hybrid_goth		ok ty
2005-05-21T16:52:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	edit /etc/samba/smb.conf - scroll to the bottom and make a share
2005-05-21T05:29:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	routers give out different IP's, not the same
2005-05-21T05:29:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	i went to ip chicken on one box and this one and they were the same
2005-05-21T05:30:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	yes, that's because you go there via your router, which has one IP, but your machines get an IP each from the router, two machines cannot possibly have the same IP
2005-05-21T05:30:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	IP chicken is on the internet, thus you exit your router, and have your routers IP, if you understand
2005-05-21T05:31:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	o i c
2005-05-21T05:31:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	Windows or Linux machines?
2005-05-21T05:31:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	the one i want to connect to is windows
2005-05-21T05:32:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	ok, on your windows machine, open start->run...->'cmd' in the box, in cmd you enter 'ipconfig', it'll tell you your IP
2005-05-22T09:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	heh
2005-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	do you know what nmap is?
2005-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	yep
2005-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	okay, you're not completely useless then, I guess :P
2005-05-22T10:51:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	heh

2005-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	try Gentoo then.
2005-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	thats what i plan on as soon as i can figure how to dual boot it with ubuntu
2005-05-22T11:35:00.000Z	Thirsteh	hybrid_goth	try blocking a port in Firestarter, then go to www.grc.com, do the "ShieldsUP" test and specify the port, see if it says it's closed or stealth, if it's stealth, your wall's dropping
2005-05-22T11:39:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thirsteh	heh
