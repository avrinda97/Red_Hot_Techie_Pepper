2005-07-08T11:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	i'm getting deja vu here ;)
2005-07-08T11:41:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	i believe it is
2005-07-14T15:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	i think it's a ping meter of some sort
2005-07-14T15:15:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	k
2005-07-18T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	fdisk -l  doesn't ask; just lists nothing
2005-07-18T12:00:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	ooh yeah........hmm.....well, it should ask
2005-07-25T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	have you used cron before?
2005-07-25T11:39:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	nope.......trying for the first time
2005-07-25T11:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	is cron running? 'pgrep cron' should tell you. (it ought to be)
2005-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	yes it is......pgrep gave me to PIDs
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	no
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	yeah.......somehow there are two PIDs listed
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	is it possible your script is blocking?
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	i dont think so.......i mean the script runs fine when i normally run it, as a normal user
2005-07-25T11:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	how about 'pgrep <nameofyourscript>' ?
2005-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	nothing
2005-07-25T11:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	i put this line in a file called 'simple', and ran 'crontab simple' -- now cron is e-mailing me a filelist every minute
2005-07-25T11:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	the line is '* * * * * /bin/ls'
2005-07-25T11:47:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	well........the line i am using isnt too differnet......just one of the *s is replaced by 00
2005-07-25T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	yeah, but that'll only happen every hour
2005-07-25T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	adwait	are you tweaking your clock to force it to run?
2005-07-25T11:47:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	no......i am just setting the time for after a minute for testing
2005-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	adwait	HappyFool	i tried the above line.......still nothing happened
