2007-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	phanter		so I log into XFCE, is there a standard key combination to pres to get a Terminal window?
2007-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	phanter		or is there an other way to start a terminal session?
2007-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	phanter		alt-f2 doesnot work
2007-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	phanter		ctrl f2 or f3 does also not work
2007-08-03T10:45:00.000Z	phanter		well, it seems that ctrl-alt-fX does only bring an empty black screen... no means of logging in
2007-08-03T10:45:00.000Z	phanter		so... still no terminal :(
2007-08-03T10:46:00.000Z	phanter		any other ideas to get the terminal? I tried to reboot and to let Grub start the "fail safe mode", but grup does not want any keyboard interruption (although I am not sure why... as it is long ago since I installed that OS)
2007-08-03T10:47:00.000Z	phanter		there are no such keys on my keyboards :)
2007-08-03T10:48:00.000Z	phanter		it also seems that the login screen does not present the option to start a fail-safe session
2007-08-03T10:49:00.000Z	phanter		:( we are talking linux, there should be a way to get into a terminal
2007-08-03T10:49:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	huh?
2007-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	maybe this will give you some clue: sudo lshw | strings | grep -A10 -B10 -i rt2500
2007-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	phanter	xtknight	if I had a terminal running to do that... I would not be here :(
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	sorry wrong nickname
2007-08-03T11:02:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	like during bootup?  or at gdm?
2007-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	phanter	xtknight	I will go for both options
2007-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	recovery mode?
2007-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	phanter	xtknight	I already tried that... not working
2007-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	i'll probably need to know more about the background situation
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	you can also access a terminal by mounting your current linux as / using rescue on an ubuntu cd
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	phanter	xtknight	I would love to tell you more... but the problem is that I am 900km away from the machine and that my (girl)friend has no clue about anything next to windows (well, actually not even a clue about that)
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	xtknight	phanter	yikes
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	phanter	xtknight	as I said... horror situation
