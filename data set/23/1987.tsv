2009-10-30T13:54:00.000Z	xs		is ubuntu only suitable for people unfamiliar with linux?
2009-10-30T13:54:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	negative, I switched from arch to ubuntu
2009-10-30T13:55:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	don't you find the documentation very annoying?
2009-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	nah it's easy enough to filter through and I use manpages alot
2009-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	ubuntu document most of their stuff in manpages?
2009-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	what wm do you use?
2009-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	negative, ubuntu's documentation is in their wiki but everything upstream is in manpages, and gnome
2009-10-30T13:57:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	also, coming from arch, how much crap does ubuntu install? e.g., *kit, hal? can you get rid of it easily?
2009-10-30T13:59:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	I use most of what ubuntu installs by default, I got annoyed with spending hours setting things up in arch, as the point of distributions is to get a good base so people don't have to spend hours or days tweaking their system to a usable level
2009-10-30T13:59:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	but anything can be removed easily enough if you don't want it
2009-10-30T14:00:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	did you switch your wm? that's actually a concern for me. it seems a lot of the ubuntu "policy" stuff is tied into gnome and won't carry over to other wms.
2009-10-30T14:00:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	just autoremove through apt-get or remove in synaptic
2009-10-30T14:00:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	ya, via debfoster.
2009-10-30T14:01:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	autoremove will remove all dependencies that aren't needed and synaptic will list orphaned packages
2009-10-30T14:01:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	I used gnome and kde in arch and gnome in ubuntu, so i'm not sure how the policies tie into kde or xfce
2009-10-30T14:02:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	debfoster keeps track of preferences on orphaned packages and finds more than deborphan does (for example).
2009-10-30T14:03:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	the minimal install cd should be similar to a slackware install (which is what arch is based on )
2009-10-30T14:06:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	does ubuntu have a rolling release like debian?
2009-10-30T14:07:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	closes you will get to rolling release with ubuntu is upgrading to the alphas as they are available, there is no unstable for ubuntu like debian
2009-10-30T14:08:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	but there is no testing either? debian testing is vetted more than unstable.
2009-10-30T14:08:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	correct, for ubuntu you have the current releases and the developmental release for the next version
2009-10-30T14:08:00.000Z	duncan_	xs	for example once the 10.04 alpha is released that is similar to debian testing
2009-10-30T14:08:00.000Z	xs	duncan_	okay. thanks. ubuntu -1.
