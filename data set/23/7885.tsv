2005-04-05T16:00:00.000Z	WeirdAl		I remember!
2005-04-05T16:00:00.000Z	WeirdAl		sort of.
2005-04-05T16:00:00.000Z	WeirdAl		I've just installed Ubuntu and I don't know what the default root password is.
2005-04-05T16:01:00.000Z	WeirdAl		So no su -?
2005-04-05T16:01:00.000Z	WeirdAl		OK well I did something at some point on the other computer to get one, and I want one, so can someone remind me what it is I did? :-)
2005-04-05T16:02:00.000Z	WeirdAl		sudo's all very well and good but sometimes you just want to go into su and type normally
2005-04-05T16:02:00.000Z	zyga	WeirdAl	sudo su
2005-04-06T07:30:00.000Z	zyga	WeirdAl	alsa has the best response time for me, esd lags a second

2005-04-06T07:36:00.000Z	zyga	WeirdAl	the little 'o' in xmms' gui
