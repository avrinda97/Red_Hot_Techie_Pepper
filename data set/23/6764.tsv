2006-01-10T06:53:00.000Z	Awal		hey I have two ethernet interfaces connected and when I bridge them I cant connect to the internet. can anyone help?
2006-01-10T06:54:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	you want to build up a router?
2006-01-10T06:54:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	that's the same in that case
2006-01-10T06:55:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	you have to set iptables
2006-01-10T06:55:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	can you connect to the internet?
2006-01-10T06:55:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	ok. great! congratulations!
2006-01-10T06:56:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	when i worked on that it took me hours to get that far
2006-01-10T06:56:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	let me think a moment. I did so a couple of weeks ago.
2006-01-10T06:57:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	you mean, you can connect from firewall to client or what?
2006-01-10T06:57:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	you mean a ping? or a connection? what kind of connection?
2006-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	thats funny
2006-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	you got an iptables-script somewhere?
2006-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	what did you use to set up the bridge?
2006-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	mhmhm...
2006-01-10T07:00:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	whats your interfaces file look like? something like ppp0 <blabla> eth0 <blabla> eth1 ...?
2006-01-10T07:01:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	goto console
2006-01-10T07:02:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	did you say router?
2006-01-10T07:05:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	here is mine: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6625
2006-01-10T07:06:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	what kind of connection do you have? dsl?
2006-01-10T07:07:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	as far as i know (that's the way mine works): you establish a connection via the ppp0 interface (which actually is a "virtual" interface)
2006-01-10T07:08:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	where are you from?
2006-01-10T07:11:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	goto console and look at this: less /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
2006-01-10T07:12:00.000Z	Seicherl	Awal	and tell me if there is something like your dsl-username and password in it
