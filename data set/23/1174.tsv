2010-07-25T01:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Frijolie	can you connect with 'mysql' ? just type mysql -u root
2010-07-25T01:49:00.000Z	Frijolie	ilovefairuz	hmmm, now it's working? something that simple? if you upgrade mysql it stops the service?
2010-07-25T01:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Frijolie	yes it does
2010-07-25T01:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Frijolie	seems it was stuck while trying to stop
2010-07-25T01:50:00.000Z	Frijolie	ilovefairuz	well thanks, sorry I feel like an idiot now. hehe! I should have been able to figure that one out
