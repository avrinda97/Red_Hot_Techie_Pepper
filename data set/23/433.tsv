2012-01-21T18:10:00.000Z	ryannathans		 after changing cloned mac address to connect to a wifi network it never connects,  connects fine with the box left empty though... i keep getting deauthenticated according to dmesg
2012-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	is there mac filtering enabled on the wifi network?
2012-01-21T18:12:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	no
2012-01-21T18:15:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	So everything is working then?
2012-01-21T18:15:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	everything works fine until I put a different mac in the cloned box
2012-01-21T18:16:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	then it doesn't connect, it just sits there, gets auth and after a while a deauth.
2012-01-21T18:16:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	why change the MAC address?
2012-01-21T18:16:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	there is another network i need to access but has mac filtering
2012-01-21T18:16:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	if i can't get it working here i can't get it working there
2012-01-21T18:18:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	when you do a ifconfig, does it show that MAC ?
2012-01-21T18:19:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	yes, when i put in the cloned one, while connecting it has the new one
2012-01-21T18:21:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	i keep getting de--authed while connecting
2012-01-21T18:21:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	If the MAC shows correct with ifconfig, then I'm not sure what's going on with the auth on the wifi side.
2012-01-21T18:22:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	it worked fine before i upgraded to 11.10
2012-01-21T18:22:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	was working on 10.10
2012-01-21T18:26:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	I'm not sure what changed between the versions to make it work.  I'd say a driver issue, but I believe you stated that it works fine if you don't clone the MAC.
2012-01-21T18:26:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	correct
2012-01-21T18:28:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	so yea I don't think that's a driver issue then, most home routers aren't going to provide much useful information as to what's going on that side either =\
2012-01-21T18:28:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	that's why I came here
2012-01-21T18:29:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	it's happening on linux mint 12 and ubuntu 11.10
2012-01-21T18:29:00.000Z	ryannathans	Jokn	works find on linux mint 10
2012-01-21T18:29:00.000Z	ryannathans		AKA 10.10
2012-01-21T18:31:00.000Z	Jokn	ryannathans	yea not sure what changed between the versions, sorry
