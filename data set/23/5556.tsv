2006-11-11T17:21:00.000Z	ademan		huh... i installed an update and now nautilus won't start
2006-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	ademan		does bash store your current working directory in an environment variable?
2006-11-11T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	$PWD
2006-11-11T14:22:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	thanks
2006-11-11T14:26:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	will that work for executable installers though?
2006-11-11T14:26:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	in theory it should
2006-11-11T14:26:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	oh, ok, sweet
2006-11-11T14:27:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	*personally* i wouldn't trust it. but then i wouldn't trust a ".run" or ".bin" installer in the first place
2006-11-11T14:28:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	unfortunately that's all i have for a few things, such as enemy territory, and the add on i'd like to try, True Combat: Elite
2006-11-11T14:29:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	then you don't have many options. another package you might want to keep in mind is
2006-11-11T14:29:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	oh cool, thanks
2006-11-11T15:29:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	is it possible to build a deb around a *.run installer using the dpkg tools?
2006-11-11T15:30:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	probably.
2006-11-11T15:30:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	because i'm starting to think checkinstall may not be appropriate for *.run installers
2006-11-11T15:31:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	as for being possibly, it's most probably possible - as for being easy, i doubt it
2006-11-11T15:31:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	yeah, i gotta write a *.spec file and crap like that don't i? ugh, but it would be worth it for me, i'd much rather let the package manager handle things
2006-11-11T15:32:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	and you'll need to write install scripts, if that .run files does anything besides copying files
2006-11-11T15:33:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	hrm, well at least one of them seems to be prepended by a script, firefox tried to open the *.run instead of installing it and i saw a bunch of plain text (looked like a bash script) and then a whole lot of binary...
2006-11-11T15:35:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	personally i wouldn't know how to approach that. and i'm not sure it's worth the effort honestly
2006-12-08T15:35:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	unfortunately I believe i already have 9629, i'm looking for the new beta drivers, i think 9742 or something
2006-12-08T15:37:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	i was left at 9631. i get mine from http://www.albertomilone.com/driver.html
2006-12-08T15:38:00.000Z	LjL	ademan	if you installed it using the blob from nvidia, you could easily encounter problems during upgrading with a .deb i think
2006-12-08T15:38:00.000Z	ademan	LjL	well i'm experiencing even MORE trouble upgrading with another binary blob
