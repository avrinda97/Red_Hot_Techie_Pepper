2008-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	Xavura		Then telling me to do them again.
2008-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	Xavura		Then telling me to do them again.
2008-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	Xavura		I have done it already.
2008-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	Xavura		okey dokey
2008-07-16T01:28:00.000Z	Xavura		and everytime I try to fix something, something else breaks
2008-07-16T01:29:00.000Z	Xavura		Well, for sites to resolve
2008-07-16T01:29:00.000Z	Xavura		Can I paste it into a PM? It's quite small
2008-07-16T01:31:00.000Z	Xavura		I still haven't figured out how to fix it despite asking numerous times, lemme know if you have any luck
2008-07-16T01:32:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	have you tried the xfix option from single init?
2008-07-16T01:32:00.000Z	Xavura	philsf	No idea what you just said :P
2008-07-16T01:33:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	are you using hardy or an older release?
2008-07-16T01:34:00.000Z	Xavura	philsf	Hardy.
2008-07-16T01:34:00.000Z	Xavura		That's kind of obvious but thanks for that :P
2008-07-16T01:35:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	have you tried the reconfigure xorg with -phigh?
2008-07-16T01:36:00.000Z	Xavura	philsf	Yup.
2008-07-16T01:36:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	it should clear out your xorg.conf, and make Xorg autodetect yoru hardware, instead of filling the conf file
2008-07-16T01:36:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	ok, so I jumped late. could you pm me your problem again?
2008-07-16T01:37:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	unless you have an ATI gpu, in which case I can't help at all
2008-07-16T01:37:00.000Z	Xavura	philsf	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV100 QY [Radeon 7000/VE]
2008-07-16T01:38:00.000Z	philsf	Xavura	well, who knows, pm me the problem anyway
