2006-06-05T10:07:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		can anyone help me? dapper doesn't want to get past the hardware screen on my system! ANY help is appreciated greatly. I can also provide detailed system specs to help you help me :).
2006-06-05T10:09:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	what part specifically does it hang on?
2006-06-05T10:09:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	it hangs on the scanning hardware part. there is a blue screen that is frozen.
2006-06-05T10:11:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	i chose not to try amd64... i am install an i386 dapper on a amd 3700
2006-06-05T10:12:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	yes.
2006-06-05T10:14:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	I don't quite know what to tell you...  Have you tried other linux distributions on this machine?
2006-06-05T10:15:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	and bobstro , I have. Debian, knoppix, ubuntu breezy.
2006-06-05T10:15:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	are they using the 2.6.15 kernel?
2006-06-05T10:16:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	i only use breezy and it's latest everything.
2006-06-05T10:17:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	This is when you're trying to boot the livecd, right?
2006-06-05T10:17:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	this is when im trying to install the system
2006-06-05T10:18:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	i used this: http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/ubuntu-releases/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
2006-06-05T10:19:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	no. that's redundant! Utorrent does that for me
2006-06-05T10:21:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	You could hypothetically upgrade through distupgrade, but I wonder if your rebooting problems wouldn't persist
2006-06-05T10:21:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	should i try to get the desktop ubuntu instead of the alternate?
2006-06-05T10:22:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	I wouldn't know...  I don't even know the difference  :x  But I doubt that the startup would be different, just the included packages
2006-06-05T10:22:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	my breezy is a little fucked up. i want to reinstall.
2006-06-05T10:22:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	I know the feeling
2006-06-05T10:24:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	when I boot my desktop ISO, I have an option to start in safe graphics mode
2006-06-05T10:25:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	i should get desktop.  alternate sucks, obviously
2006-06-05T10:26:00.000Z	clintonc	DavidLeeRoth	If you use memtest as the kernel, it'll perform a memory test
2006-06-05T10:26:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	my memory is fine. i just installed breezy! i've tested it before
2006-06-05T10:27:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	clintonc	i'll try that when i get my new iso in 13 minutes
