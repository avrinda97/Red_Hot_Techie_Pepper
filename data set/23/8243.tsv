2005-01-12T16:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		what real solutions exist in ubuntu for RSS feeds?
2005-01-12T16:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I find that I enjoy Liferea, which integrates well with Gnome
2005-01-12T16:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		how does Ubunut currently handle RSS feeds though?  I can find nothing.
2005-01-12T16:03:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	subterrific: firefox live bookmarks: go to a properly cofigured site, click the little orange icon in the bottom right.
2005-01-12T16:04:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	subterrific:  also I don't enjoy cheap hacks to turn browsers into news readers  :/  I feel such things don't reflect the best quality the open source community can offer
2005-01-12T16:05:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	why not just install liferea?
2005-01-12T16:05:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 It's in universe, i'm interested in what will go into main
2005-01-12T16:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	in Liferea, Feed Reader, and Akregator I believe you can configure periodic checks and minimize the client to a system tray icon (gnome notification area, kde systray, etc).  There's also caching, displaying of small bits of the article embedded in the feed (instead of the whole feed), etc
2005-01-12T16:08:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	way overkill for my needs, but certainly sound like good feature sets all around.  if you want to get it into main, you'll prolly want to figure out which one is most GNOMEish, and promote it
2005-01-12T16:09:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 Liferea definitely.  Akregator is a KDE app, and Feed Reader is a Windows app :)
2005-01-12T16:09:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 there's tons of RSS readers thouhg.
2005-01-12T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 i can get a screenie of Liferea
2005-01-12T16:10:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	maybe post to the hoary list about it
2005-01-12T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 to . . . the hoary list?  :)
2005-01-12T16:11:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	email list

2005-01-12T16:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 I"ll look for the hoary list.
2005-01-12T16:14:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/  Could you recommend where to take this discussion?
2005-01-12T16:14:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	what's your level of expertise?
2005-01-12T16:15:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	ubuntu-users as opposed to ubuntu-devel?
2005-01-12T16:16:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	no, devel is more right i think :-)
2005-01-12T16:16:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	hypa7ia	 ok :)
2005-01-12T16:16:00.000Z	hypa7ia	bluefoxicy	missed it in my check :-))
