2005-12-07T08:39:00.000Z	Mabus06		If I set the videoram higher, would it make games run better? I have 1gig of ram and I think I can spare some.
2005-12-07T08:41:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	an onboard card? a laptop i assume?
2005-12-07T08:41:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	an onboard card yes. Nope, not a laptop.
2005-12-07T08:42:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	it's not worth it imo, just buy a seperate card, upgrading the mboard if necessary.  but i guess it depends on what sort of games
2005-12-07T08:42:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	what do you mean "not worth it, buy a separate card"... I don't want to buy any new hardware, that costs money where I'm from..
2005-12-07T08:44:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	well, most onboard cards are to put it simply: crap for games
2005-12-07T08:45:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	but like i said, depends on the game
2005-12-15T09:40:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	i have/had the same problem.  your apt cache is getting deleted.  apt-get update.
2005-12-15T09:41:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	i haven't confirmed this fix yet, but you may want to remove 'apt' from /etc/cron.daily
2005-12-15T09:41:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	i just did that recently, nad hopefully the seemingly scheduled deletions will stop
2005-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	so just "sudo apt-get update" ?
2005-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	yes, or reload using synaptic
2005-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	but it will probably keep happening ...
2005-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	which is why i'm trying out this cron deletion
2005-12-15T09:43:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	has this been bugzilla'd?
2005-12-15T09:43:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	not afaik.  besides me, you are one of two who i've seen had the same prob
2005-12-15T09:44:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	well I'm always in here if my computer is on, which is ideally 24/7... please pm me if you hear anything else
2005-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	will do.  hopefully this cron thing works
2005-12-16T08:32:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	ping
2006-03-03T09:27:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	fkuxbox is popular
2006-03-03T09:28:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	just try them out i say...easy enough to remove if you don't like them
2006-03-03T09:28:00.000Z	Mabus06	brenner	ideally... had a bad experience trying out kde
2006-03-03T11:02:00.000Z	brenner	Mabus06	me too
