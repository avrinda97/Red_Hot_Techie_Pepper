2009-01-20T04:36:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Ram type.
2009-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	jedi06		Does it matter who makes the ram?
2009-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	jedi06		do they have to be from the same manufacturer
2009-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Sometimes.
2009-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Laptop manufacturers don't make RAM.
2009-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	jedi06		what about speed of ram?
2009-01-20T04:38:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Usually not an issue. DDR2-800 (if you use DDR2) would downscale to whatever speed you need.
2009-01-20T04:38:00.000Z	jedi06	ubuntu	does not support ddr2-800?
2009-01-20T04:38:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Not OS Specific.
2009-01-20T04:39:00.000Z	jedi06		that is what dell says it doesn't sell faster ram becuase ubuntu doesn't support it
2009-01-20T04:39:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Corsair, Kingston, and Crucial all make SODIMMs
2009-01-20T04:40:00.000Z	jedi06		i bought a dell studio 15n with ubuntu 8.04 and i paid 100 to upgrade to 4gb from 2gb ram.  I think i should of bought and installed the ram for cheaper
2009-01-20T04:40:00.000Z	jedi06		100 for an extra 2gb is a rip off
2009-01-20T04:41:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	It'll always be cheaper to do upgrades yourself, if you don't manage to kill something.
2009-01-20T04:41:00.000Z	jedi06		so that was a bad deal i found 2gb sticks 667mhz for 25
2009-01-20T04:41:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Probably. d
2009-01-20T04:41:00.000Z	jedi06		but i was worried about compatibility
2009-01-20T04:42:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Compatibility is rarely an issue. Sometimes though.
2009-01-20T04:42:00.000Z	jedi06		does the ubuntu support 1066 mhz fsb?
2009-01-20T04:43:00.000Z	Anonymous	jedi06	Doesn't matter.
2009-01-20T04:43:00.000Z	jedi06		dell said they didn't
