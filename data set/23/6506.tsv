2006-06-17T10:20:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- my name begins with an i =) the poitn of me mounting it here, i want to remove one little dll files which is infected with a trojan
2006-06-17T10:22:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	it's not the frequency of the operations that cause the trouble.  Why not use your Windows boot CD instead?
2006-06-17T10:22:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- windows boot cd..for what..?
2006-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	Windows boot CD to go into the recovery console and delete the infected file.  yoshiznit123 seems to be confident with the NTFS drivers.  I am not.  I've lost data.
2006-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- wouldn't the recovery console encoutner the same permission problems? i believe this is an NTFS issue, which is why i was lookin towards linux
2006-06-17T10:25:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	What permission problems would the Windows recovery console encounter?!
2006-06-17T10:26:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- no clue, never used it
2006-06-17T10:27:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	hang on, I put something in ubotu a while back about windows recovery console
2006-06-17T10:30:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	yeah, I couldn't fit much about the recovery console in that entry.  But if you google for it, Microsoft.com has pretty detailed instructions on how to setup and enter the recovery console.
2006-06-17T10:30:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- you stick the cd in and hit f3...it's simple
2006-06-17T10:31:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	however, as yoshiznit123 points out, if you can boot in Windows, then just delete the infected dll from within windows.  If it's set to be read-only of if an ordinary user lacks perm, then just become Administrator and/or set the attrib's.
2006-06-17T10:32:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- in windows - i'm logged in as administrator, it's not set to read only, it's locked by something under the system
2006-06-17T10:33:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	attrib?
2006-06-17T10:33:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- everyone has full access
2006-06-17T10:34:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- which is why i said i thought it was ntfs - if it's not bound to anything running and it's not ntfs, i'd expect it to be ntfs fucked up (the table is read wrong to windows, protecting the file)
2006-06-17T10:36:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	I know little about Windows.  You might try googling for more help.  If you really think your NTFS filesystem is corrupt, then you *definitely* should not attempt to use Linux to interfere further (unless you don't care about losing the entire contents of that disk)
2006-06-17T10:36:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- it's a protectino method, actually, a virus/trojan/whatever will tell windows that it's writable only from the SID x-x-xx while it impersonates being fully accessable to everyone
2006-06-17T10:38:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	whatever the virus told your system, you should be able to untell.  You just need to learn how to do it.
2006-06-17T10:38:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- theres no information about this thing anywhere on the itnernet - not even mcafee's site (the AV that discovered it)
2006-06-17T10:40:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	are you familiar with the windows attrib command?
2006-06-17T10:45:00.000Z	Iam8up	ic56	- nope
2006-06-17T10:46:00.000Z	ic56	Iam8up	then why didn't you say so the first time I told you to fix the attributes?  Here:  read this: http://www.computerhope.com/attribhl.htm
