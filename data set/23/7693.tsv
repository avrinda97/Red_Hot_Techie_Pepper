2005-09-15T10:11:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	norton commander just made sense
2005-09-15T10:11:00.000Z	dbernar1	nalioth	what do you mean?
2005-09-15T10:12:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	norton commander (i believe) introduced the interface we use in midnight cmdr and krusader (great file mangler for console, mc is)
2005-09-15T10:12:00.000Z	dbernar1	nalioth	^ and, also, krusader, not a kde app?
2005-09-15T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	krusader is kde based, yes
2006-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	no you do not.
2006-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	dbernar1	nalioth	even for nt domain setup, or are you just talking about file and print sharing?
2006-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	you dont need root for anything. sudo works fine
2006-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	nalioth	you know about nt domains, though, right?
2006-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	dbernar1	i havent used windows or had a windows machine in my house in years, so i'm kinda lost. but sudo will do anything you need
