2005-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	shale		Exception: You system has opengl version '1.2 (1.5 Mesa 6.2.1)'.
2005-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	shale		Glest needs at least version 1.3 to work.
2005-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	shale		You may solve this problem by installing your latest video card drivers

2005-05-09T05:54:00.000Z	spiderworm	shale	looks like they dont have it for 64 bit on there.  any ideas how I would get the 32 bit?
2005-05-09T05:55:00.000Z	shale	spiderworm	of glest?
2005-05-09T05:55:00.000Z	spiderworm	shale	yeah
2005-05-09T05:56:00.000Z	shale	spiderworm	just apt-get install glest after putting the repository in your sources.list
2005-05-09T05:57:00.000Z	shale		but it won't work if you don't have the latest drivers
2005-05-09T05:57:00.000Z	shale		need gl 1.3
2005-05-09T05:57:00.000Z	shale		i just have 1.25 and can't figure out how to upgrade
2005-05-09T05:57:00.000Z	spiderworm	shale	i do have the latest drivers but it wont do it because im running 64 bit, there is no 64 bit package list there...
