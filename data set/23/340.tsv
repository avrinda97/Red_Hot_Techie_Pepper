2011-11-20T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	I'm on Precise here and its solid
2011-11-20T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	which desktops have you tried?
2011-11-20T03:52:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	Where did you get that send me the link and I'll try it.
2011-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/   Its the next LTS
2011-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	its not officially stable, but if you want to try it, fill your boots.
2011-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	Oh Thanks! I hope it's gonna work.
2011-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	which desktops have you tried in your installs since Maverick?
2011-11-20T03:58:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	I tried 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10. They don't work pretty well for me.
2011-11-20T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	no, which desktops? Gnome, KDE, XFCE?
2011-11-20T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	not the release
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	I bet you just used Gnome didn't you...
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	Gnome.
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	any others?
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	No.
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	thought maybe it was Gnome at fault, not the release
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	I've used KDE and LXDE and had zero issues
2011-11-20T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	maybe you could try them
2011-11-20T04:04:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	It's possible.
2011-11-20T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	you can't badmouth a whole release credibly without exploring it a lot, like trying differnt desktops as just a basic thing to try
2011-11-20T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	you may just have issues running gnome, which is not the whole release, it's just one desktop environment
2011-11-20T04:05:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	I should try other desktops.
2011-11-20T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rowla	You find a lot of people who dropped back to Natty because of unity haven't even thought of trying a different desktop and keeping the newer libs and such which make stuff work nice
2011-11-20T04:09:00.000Z	rowla	ActionParsnip	I prefer 9.10 or 10.04
