2010-03-15T08:14:00.000Z	haakon87		For development?
2010-03-15T08:14:00.000Z	haakon87		I'd go with Virtualbox and a Windows XP license, myself, but yes.
2010-03-15T08:15:00.000Z	haakon87		And Emacs is slightly more than a mere text editor... It can be used for anything. It'll run the X-Server in the end.
2010-03-15T08:15:00.000Z	haakon87		However, nobody likes flash, so nobody wants to make something for it.. :(
2010-03-15T08:16:00.000Z	haakon87		Off course, eclipse is an option.
2010-03-15T08:16:00.000Z	haakon87		In which case, do you have a windows xp license? :(
2010-03-15T08:17:00.000Z	haakon87		Seriously?
2010-03-15T08:18:00.000Z	haakon87		Flash sucks to begin with, so why would anyone of us want to touch it to begin with?
2010-03-15T08:18:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Youtube.
2010-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	sudo bash is a fracking bad idea.
2010-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Use "sudo -i", not "sudo bash" as haakon87 said
2010-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	haakon87	theadmin	If he wants to have root, then he should be told the truth. I'm a firm believer in "Enough rope to hang yourself with".
2010-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	haakon87	theadmin	the flash support thingy?
2010-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Nah, mp3 is something i don't need
2010-03-15T08:37:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Dude. He just wants an NTFS filesystem. NOT windows.
2010-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	haakon87	theadmin	Nope, here's his original post: "Hey. I'm on Ubuntu and I want to install Windows 7 over it. When I try to install Windows 7 it tells me it can only be installed over NTFS and that my filesystem or whatever is unrecognized"
2010-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Oh.
2010-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Guess i wasn't online during zat
2010-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	haakon87	theadmin	What do you see? Do you have a screenshot for us?
2010-03-15T08:46:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	Well, can make one
2010-03-15T08:47:00.000Z	theadmin	haakon87	There. http://imagebin.ca/img/O-7shWm6.png
