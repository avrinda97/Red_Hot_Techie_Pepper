2008-10-16T09:43:00.000Z	RickZilla		I'm trying to use the .deb package installer...I'm getting an error that says "Dependency is not satisfiable:  liblqr1"  Does it mean I'm screwed, or can I fix this somehow?
2008-10-16T09:44:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	if you are new to ubuntu, I suggest you use synaptic, or just "sudo apt-get install" to install packages
2008-10-16T09:44:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	you don't have to handle .deb directly
2008-10-16T09:44:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 I've tried that, but it installs an older version of this particular plugin than what I can use
2008-10-16T09:45:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	if you definitely need newer versions, you may try to upgrade to ubuntu-8.10 (beta), or backport the package
2008-10-16T09:46:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	check whether the new version is in 8.10, http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	yes, it should be smooth for experienced users, if you don't want to risk, backports is better
2008-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	check whether the version you want is in 8.10 first
2008-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	will do
2008-10-16T09:49:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	8.10 has gimp-2.6.1-1ubuntu2
2008-10-16T09:50:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 I'm using gimp 2.6.1 now...I need the updated version of this particular script
2008-10-16T09:50:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	then, you should upgrade to 8.10, /j #ubuntu+1
2008-10-16T09:51:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	backporting gimp could be nasty
2008-10-16T09:52:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 Ok, but I'm not even sure this plugin is in the new version
2008-10-16T09:53:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	if you need the current development version of gimp, the best chance is still going to 8.10 and backporting experimental, or just gimp-development
2008-10-16T09:54:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 I have the latest GIMP installed...just need the latest version of this plugin to work on it
2008-10-16T09:55:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	2.6.1 is the latest
2008-10-16T09:55:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 That's what I have
2008-10-16T09:55:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	as I said, 8.10 has 2.6.1
2008-10-16T09:56:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	...but I don't know if it has the latest version of this plugin, which is separate from GIMP
2008-10-16T10:02:00.000Z	RickZilla	dli_	 If I upgrade to 8.10, is it possible that .deb package I was trying earlier would work properly?
2008-10-16T10:03:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	not sure, unless it's built for the specific ubuntu version
2008-10-16T10:03:00.000Z	dli_	RickZilla	otherwise, you'd better get source of the .deb and build your own
