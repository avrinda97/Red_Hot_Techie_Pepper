2010-01-07T05:18:00.000Z	karmst		A hardware raid will just look like an LVM
2010-01-07T05:19:00.000Z	karmst		well if it's a hardware raid you shouldn't be able to see the members of the raid
2010-01-07T05:19:00.000Z	karmst		you should only be able to see the raid
2010-01-07T05:19:00.000Z	karmst		otherwise it's a software raid
2010-01-07T05:21:00.000Z	karmst		I have my Dell PERC 6/i card using raid10 and I only see one LVM on Ubuntu
2010-01-07T05:21:00.000Z	karmst		Steve grep sda2
2010-01-07T05:21:00.000Z	karmst		what is the device desc
2010-01-07T05:22:00.000Z	karmst		dmesg | grep -l
2010-01-07T05:23:00.000Z	karmst		you should be able to pull up a device description
2010-01-07T05:24:00.000Z	karmst		what raid controller do you have Steve?
2010-01-07T05:24:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	my thoughts too..
2010-01-07T05:29:00.000Z	karmst	mmvx	with nvidia onboard raids shouldn't you just create an LVM in Grub and then the OS will just see the virtual single drive?
2010-01-07T05:30:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	it looks like the installer and os can see the single raid partition
2010-01-07T05:30:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	but when it comes to grub install it fails
2010-01-07T05:31:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	possible missing module? grub2 is quite new..
2010-01-07T05:45:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	maybe another module?
2010-01-07T05:46:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	Steve132 this bug report shows several modules being tried: v
2010-01-07T05:47:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	I think Steve132 already has most of his install in place
2010-01-07T05:47:00.000Z	karmst	mmvx	I'm lost then?!?
2010-01-07T06:01:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	yeah I think I'd go software raid and be done with it :)
2010-01-07T06:04:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	it's cause you forget it before you go to bed :)
2010-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	adobe is frequently slower than molasses in January
2010-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	mmvx	karmst	is that a 64 bit player?
