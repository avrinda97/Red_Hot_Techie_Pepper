2007-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	electric_d		Arg! Can anyone explain this? My Mac OS 10.4 laptop can get an address via DHCP from my cable modem, but my router and my fiesty box can't. (!!!)
2007-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	is the router and laptop connected directly to the modem? I assume if ys that means the modem has two ethernet ports?
2007-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	No, I have the router unplugged at the moment. Modem only has one ethernet port.
2007-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	so what is the usual network setup? Router plugged into modem and laptop and other devices connected through router?
2007-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	yep
2007-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	did your modem previously work?
2007-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	yes, everything worked normally for months.
2007-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	well what did you do right before it stopped working?
2007-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	lol, nothing.
2007-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	hmmmm...
2007-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	when you plug in the modem all its lights turn green?
2007-07-28T08:29:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	Everything about the modem seems normal.
2007-07-28T08:30:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	well, did you ever reset the routers settings?
2007-07-28T08:30:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	Yeah, tried that.
2007-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	what I'm suspecting is that somehow the router wants to use a different mac address and the ISP doesn't like it
2007-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	hmm, ok, i might be able to have the router spoof the MAC of the mac laptop
2007-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	does the router in the web interface have the ability to change the mac address?
2007-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	right, that's what I'd do
2007-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	have the router spoof a mac address of one of the machines that can connect to the internet when directly connected to the modem
2007-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	ISP's only allow one mac address to connect to their network through each unique modem to prevent abuse
2007-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	electric_d	hexstar	that worked, I'm wireless again
2007-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	:)
2007-07-28T08:44:00.000Z	hexstar	electric_d	who knows, that happened to me too
