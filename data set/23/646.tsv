2011-04-26T13:57:00.000Z	dpy		hi guys
2011-04-26T13:58:00.000Z	dpy		does anyone know if there is a debian/ubuntu package somewhere that provides iptables as a service?
2011-04-26T13:58:00.000Z	dpy		I'd like to be able to do service iptables stop/start
2011-04-26T13:59:00.000Z	GeissT	dpy	give this a go: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1161445
2011-04-26T14:05:00.000Z	GeissT		If you install ubuntu on that drive AFTER the movies they will be removed.
2011-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	dpy		lol!
2011-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	dpy		I do ufw enable, and I get like 100 iptable rules by default..
2011-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	dpy		dpy> lol!
2011-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	dpy		<dpy> I do ufw enable, and I get like 100 iptable rules by default..
2011-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	dpy		and it totally disables all incoming traffic
2011-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	dpy		first impression of UFW: not so uncomplicated, not convinced to use it...
2011-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	dpy		grrrr UFW #$##$!#$!#$
2011-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	dpy		'ufw disable' should do iptables -X  (as in: clean up the mess you create)
2011-04-26T14:34:00.000Z	dpy	GeissT	if somebody happens to ask about iptables on start up, could you please give 'm this link: http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2009/02/28/standard-process-for-restoring-iptables-at-boot/    (It's the minimalist approach, while UFW is the maximalist/complicated approach (unlike its name))
2011-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	GeissT	dpy	sure mate, ill copy and paste that.
2011-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	dpy		tnx :)
2011-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	GeissT		Are you expecting someone to come in?
2011-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	dpy	GeissT	nah, it was just more of a statement
2011-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	dpy	GeissT	iptables is much cleaner than UFW imho
2011-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	dpy		UFW is like the Windows approach  (I don't know how it works, but I expect it to work)
2011-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	dpy		iptables is like: I understand how it works, why it works and I want to use it
2011-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	GeissT	dpy	Ive never had to delve into them yet, but im sure I might.
2011-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	dpy	GeissT	but thanks anyway
