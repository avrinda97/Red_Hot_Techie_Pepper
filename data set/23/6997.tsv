2006-08-05T09:46:00.000Z	dEn_	avu	 what kind of uptime do u have. cause when i run it for two days the air blown out of the fan is really hot . i got an intel mobile centrino and an acer aspire
2006-08-05T09:46:00.000Z	dEn_	avu	besides the mouse pad gets really  hot.

2006-08-05T09:48:00.000Z	dEn_	avu	: okay . but i guess its the same :( god i wish i had an apple , thats the next one i am going to get.
2006-08-05T09:48:00.000Z	idel	dEn_	maybe disabling some services, that works with my laptop, amd semprom
