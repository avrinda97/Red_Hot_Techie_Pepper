2009-12-16T16:34:00.000Z	yacc	gp	you have the key?
2009-12-16T16:35:00.000Z	yacc	gp	well the key that was used to encrypt your data?
2009-12-16T16:37:00.000Z	yacc	gp	can you click on it in Nautilus?
2009-12-16T16:38:00.000Z	yacc	gp	then you need to fix that first.
2009-12-16T16:38:00.000Z	yacc	gp	why did it boot into readonly mode only?
2009-12-16T16:43:00.000Z	gp	yacc	while booting i get error ...error inserting padlock_sha
2009-12-16T16:44:00.000Z	yacc	gp	yeah, you've got a problem with modules and so on, you need to fix the problem with your readonly rootfs and the root shell first.
2009-12-16T16:44:00.000Z	gp	yacc	:how
2009-12-16T16:45:00.000Z	gp	yacc	how do i fix my problem
2009-12-16T16:45:00.000Z	yacc	gp	well, padlock_sha is not the reason why you drop into a root shell.
2009-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	yacc	gp	you do have already readonly access to your root filesystem?
2009-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	yacc	gp	fsck /dev/YOUR_ROOT_DEVICE
2009-12-16T16:47:00.000Z	yacc	gp	/sbin/fdisk -l /dev/sda should give you the partions on your disc.
