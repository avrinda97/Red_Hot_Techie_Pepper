2008-08-02T09:25:00.000Z	havocstorm		hello
2008-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	havocstorm		does anyone here use rhythmbox regularly?
2008-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	I do
2008-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	does it synchronise with ipods?
2008-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	It recognizes iPods and will add and remove music from them, but it will not automatically sync. You must manually drag the songs from your library to the iPod icon.
2008-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	I'm using songbird right now but it doesn't intergrate with my messenger client and display the songs
2008-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	aw, that sucks
2008-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	yeah, it almost made me switch to amarok
2008-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	does it synch playlists?
2008-08-02T09:28:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	I don't believe so. But you can still create iPod playlists and drag songs into them
2008-08-02T09:28:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	hmm any idea why rhythmbox doesn't have ipod support? songbird has full functionality, so it can't be issues with the apple software
2008-08-02T09:29:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	I like songbird, but it feels like some whacked up browser, I prefer rhytmbox
2008-08-02T09:29:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	I guess it hasn't been a very high priority with the developers. And actually there is a problem with songbird: it doesn't sync album art
2008-08-02T09:29:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	then again, neither does rhythmbox
2008-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	yeah, it removed all my album art on my ipod, but atleast the library synchs, there's no podcast support either
2008-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	and I don't like it how websites can set cookie in my music player and extract information from my library
2008-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	yeah, I always preferred rhythmbox
2008-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	honestly, who's idea was it to build songbird from the mozilla framework
2008-08-02T09:31:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	sigh, can I send in a report to the guys who write rhythmbox?
2008-08-02T09:31:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	you can probably file something on their launchpad page
2008-08-02T09:31:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	but I think it's been requested before and that it's being planned for a future version
2008-08-02T09:32:00.000Z	havocstorm	hkittysmoothie	thanks, I hope they hurry up, it's a very good program with a great interface
2008-08-02T09:32:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	havocstorm	np
