2007-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	DaSkreech		Hello
2007-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	DaSkreech		Can I get some help in mounting a ISO in grub?
2007-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	DaSkreech		!iso
2007-11-23T20:49:00.000Z	DaSkreech		I can get the ISO to mount and boot from it but part way through it says that it cannot find the cdrom
2007-11-23T20:51:00.000Z	DaSkreech		has anyone booted grub from an ISO ?
2007-11-23T20:52:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	yes
2007-11-23T20:52:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	it is quite trivial to create your own grub cd
2007-11-23T20:53:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	No I can't boot from CD
2007-11-23T20:56:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	safrano: the tinyurl at the end
2007-11-23T20:57:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	So I can boot a supergrub CD and then use that and boot any ISO off the Drive ?
2007-11-23T20:59:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	no, you can use it to bot your linux installation
2007-11-23T20:59:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	Ok I need to boot from an ISO on the drive :)
2007-11-23T21:02:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	did you look at http://tinyurl.com/3exghs ?
2007-11-23T21:16:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	No help?
2007-11-23T21:17:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	ah, sorry, was away
2007-11-23T21:17:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	what is the exact problem?
2007-11-23T21:17:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	I can't boot from CD so I need to boot from the ISO directly on the hard drive
2007-11-23T21:18:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	eww
2007-11-23T21:18:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	I've done that and it gets part way through the install
2007-11-23T21:18:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	can you boot from USB?
2007-11-23T21:18:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	in that case, i would probably put the disk into a computer that can boot from cd and install a base system on that machine
2007-11-23T21:19:00.000Z	DaSkreech	RichiH	interesting :)
2007-11-23T21:20:00.000Z	RichiH	DaSkreech	as soon as you have  agrub that can boot and a base system along with it, you can try out device names until it works
