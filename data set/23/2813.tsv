2009-08-28T19:56:00.000Z	FloridaGuy		whats some good printing packages for photo's that have different templates ...like for my printer in windows i can print oval shape photo's
2009-08-28T19:58:00.000Z	my_key	FloridaGuy	 you could use phatch (or imagemagic if you want to do it the hard way) and the gimp
2009-08-28T19:58:00.000Z	my_key		I don't know of any particular printing packages
2009-08-28T19:59:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	my_key	ok......what you mean the hardway
2009-08-28T20:01:00.000Z	my_key	FloridaGuy	 phatch is a way easier image batch processing tool (nice GUI, point and click, very clear) and imagemagic is a bit more involved (long command lines or script writing)
2009-08-28T20:03:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	my_key	ok ill give phatch atry
2009-08-28T20:13:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	my_key	phatch wont open...it opens a little picture on the screen with a crama....and stuff that says phatch and thats all it does
2009-08-28T20:14:00.000Z	my_key	FloridaGuy	After processing the images with phatch (check http://photobatch.stani.be for how to use it, it's really simple once you uderstand the process) you can put multiple photo's on one page easily with photoprint or gnome photo printer (they are in the repo's)
2009-08-28T20:14:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	my_key	ok thanks
2009-08-28T20:15:00.000Z	my_key	FloridaGuy	hmm. you installed it from the rep's right?

2009-08-28T20:16:00.000Z	my_key	FloridaGuy	and you don't get the phatch screen with "click + to add actions" and the logo and stuff?
2009-08-28T20:17:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	my_key	nope...just the loading screen
