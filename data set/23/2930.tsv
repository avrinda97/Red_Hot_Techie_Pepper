2008-09-20T03:00:00.000Z	iaindalton	pibe	I'm not trying to give you a hard time, just making sure you've done everything you could.  I see in your forum post that you seemed to have a corrupt live cd.  Did you check the cd integrity?
2008-09-20T03:01:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	yes, i have tried too mcuh cds, even debian cds and Gos cds and same error
2008-09-20T03:04:00.000Z	iaindalton	pibe	I still don't know if you ran an actual integrity check on any of the CDs
2008-09-20T03:05:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	yes i ahve check them and i ahve use that cd to install it in a desktop
2008-09-20T03:05:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	i have checked*
2008-09-20T03:06:00.000Z	iaindalton	pibe	Because in the forum you say that the ubuntu 8.04 live cd couldn't copy libsane because it was corrupt.  It didn't have an error about the kernel, though, that was a different CD.  So maybe you should try the 8.04 live cd again
2008-09-20T03:08:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	ok i am goint to buy a new cd and burn it then i am going to try again
2008-09-20T03:08:00.000Z	iaindalton	pibe	Buy a CD?  Out of blanks?
2008-09-20T03:08:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	blank cd
2008-09-20T03:09:00.000Z	pibe	iaindalton	thanks i am leaving righ now see you later
