2004-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	erik_		I just upgraded my laptop here to hoary .. is there an xcompmgr package?
2004-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	erik_		ah
2004-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	erik_		excellent, thanks
2004-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	erik_		..
2004-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	erik_		warty has xorg?
2004-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	erik_		haha i opened the floodgates
2004-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	erik_		mostly the nice thing about it is  a "backing store" that works
2004-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	erik_		like the X backing store never did
2004-11-22T14:03:00.000Z	erik_		some of the tools sometimes ask me for my root password.  I thought that ubuntu didn't have a root password?
2004-11-22T14:03:00.000Z	erik_		my user password doesn't work in such circumstances
2004-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	that is because it is asking for ROOT, ubuntu doesn't have root enabled by default
2004-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	yeah
2004-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	why does ubuntu have stuff that asks for root?
2004-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	if I run into something like that, I just run it from command, with a sudo in front
2004-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	yeah, I can get around it easy enough but I was wondering if I was doing something wrong
2004-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	I don't have ubuntu with me here, I cannot help anymore....sorry
2004-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	's okay, thanks
2004-11-22T14:43:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	does ubuntu's gdm respect ~/.xsession ?
2004-11-22T14:44:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	at the log in screen
2004-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	should be soon, one could assume
2004-11-22T15:33:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	what are you burning?
2004-11-22T15:34:00.000Z	erik_	gwildor_	amd64 ubuntu iso
2004-11-22T15:40:00.000Z	gwildor_	erik_	burn ok now?
