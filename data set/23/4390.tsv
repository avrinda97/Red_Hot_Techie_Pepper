2008-09-25T15:56:00.000Z	locke		but i couldn't hit enter to send (at least in IRC)
2008-09-25T15:56:00.000Z	locke		i could go to urls with the button in firefox
2008-09-25T15:57:00.000Z	locke		but if i would have ended up logging out or the power got cut and it rebooted i wouldnt have been able to log in
2008-09-25T15:58:00.000Z	locke		yeah i know..
2008-09-25T15:58:00.000Z	locke		but anyways i do want to know about this 'virtual keyboard'
2008-09-25T15:58:00.000Z	locke		i'm worried if i break my keyboard again
2008-09-25T15:58:00.000Z	locke		i have homework i have to do that i can't say my keyboard broke to get out of :P
2008-09-25T15:58:00.000Z	locke		like in win, the onscreen keyboard
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		is there some sort of built in one?
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		i couldn't figure out how to do it
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	Ziroday	locke	look under the assistive technologies option in System > Preferences > Assistive
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		and had no keyboard to figure it out
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke	Ziroday	i found that, but couldn't find anything in there
2008-09-25T15:59:00.000Z	locke		gok huh, i'll try it
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		there was no way i could have installed that while my keyboard was dead though
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		couldn't type my password
2008-09-25T16:00:00.000Z	locke		i could have typed the command itself by copy-pasting individual characters, but couldn't have pressed enter :P
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	Ziroday		!enter | locke
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		maybe if i could have figured out how to get the alt+f2 dialog up without a keyboard
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		it really was a dilemma :P
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	locke		no ubottu
2008-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	Ziroday	locke	stop using enter as punctuation please.
2008-09-25T16:02:00.000Z	locke	Ziroday	i thought you had something to say about how to press enter without a keyboard :P lol
