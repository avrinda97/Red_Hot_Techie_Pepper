2012-08-31T04:32:00.000Z	krazyk_work		If i installed an ubuntu live based distro to a USB, it should boot from multiple computers, right?
2012-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	yes
2012-08-31T04:34:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I've looked through.. it is working on 1 computer.. then when I try to run same from a new computer it can't get past the grub
2012-08-31T04:34:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	maybe an issue witht he type of video card on the other computer
2012-08-31T04:35:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I've tried in various orders.  It will only work on whichever computer I boot the fresh install on 1st
2012-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	how did you create the usb stick?
2012-08-31T04:38:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	did you just do an install to the thumb drive or did you actaully use startup disk creator?
2012-08-31T04:38:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I'm not sure I understand the difference
2012-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	one makes the thumb drive like the iso the other actrually installs a full system to the usb
2012-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I had an iso burned to a USB.  this install brought up grub and I could either run live (without persistence) or install.. i installed to a new USB drive
2012-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I did the full system to the usb
2012-08-31T04:40:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	you can just burn the iso to usb you need to use startup disk creator
2012-08-31T04:40:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	now when I boot on a new computer, i get "error no such partition" over and over and afew other errors
2012-08-31T04:41:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	I would check the /etc/fstab on the thumb drive and make sure it's using uuid's
2012-08-31T04:41:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	AH HAH.. it's not
2012-08-31T04:42:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	pardon my newbishness, but what's the best way to go about setting up the uuid properly in fstab
2012-08-31T04:42:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	so if it's pulling /dev/sda blah blah it needs to be by uuid
2012-08-31T04:42:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	you can sudo blkid   to list them and put those in in place of /dev/xxx
2012-08-31T04:45:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	I lied.. looks like it is using UUID= blah blah
2012-08-31T04:46:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	have you tried to boot on more than one other machien?
2012-08-31T04:47:00.000Z	histo	krazyk_work	I would reacreate the usb and use startup disk creator this time
2012-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	wow, that tool startup disk creator looks like it worked well (and fast) bout to try it on all 3 computers.. thank you
2012-08-31T05:31:00.000Z	krazyk_work	histo	it looks like it works.. but every time I run it, it look like I need to click "Try Ubuntu" from the ubuntu install GUI instead of grub.  Does this seem right to you??
