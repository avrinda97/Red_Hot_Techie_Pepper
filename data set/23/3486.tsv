2008-07-11T21:24:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot		theres anti-virus for linux?
2008-07-11T21:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	there is
2008-07-11T21:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	unlikely
2008-07-11T21:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	it's very very handy for scanning incoming mail
2008-07-11T21:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	what's the program you're trying to run off sdb?
2008-07-11T21:35:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	UrbanTerror
2008-07-11T21:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	oh right
2008-07-11T21:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	is that the installer?
2008-07-11T21:35:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	No, just extract and run
2008-07-11T21:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	ok, I vaguely remember installing it, but I'm sure I ran a shell script installer
2008-07-11T21:36:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	The program runs fine off of the sda, but doesnt run off of sdb, and the weird thing is, before I reinstalled my Linux, it worked fine from a secondary hard drive
2008-07-11T21:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	oh ok, can you pastebin or pm the output from "mount"?
2008-07-11T21:36:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	yea sure
2008-07-11T21:38:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/26700/
2008-07-11T21:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	see the line describing /dev/sdb1?  It's got "noexec" as an option
2008-07-11T21:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	see if you can guess what the implications of that are
2008-07-11T21:40:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	I would change that in the fstab, correct?
2008-07-11T21:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	yup
2008-07-11T21:43:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	I for some reason still cant run programs from the sdb
2008-07-11T21:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	did you remount?
2008-07-11T21:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	odd.  Well, it's something related to that, I'm sure
2008-07-11T21:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bob_Sagot	it sounds permissionsy
2008-07-11T21:44:00.000Z	Bob_Sagot	gordonjcp	this install of ubuntu has been doing nothing but giving me problems
