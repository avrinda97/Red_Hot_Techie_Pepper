2012-03-01T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	sorry, we don't pickup back track support in here
2012-03-01T18:17:00.000Z	computer_	ikonia	I think it is more a VMware support question
2012-03-01T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	it's vmware support on backtrack so #vmware or #backtrack-linux
2012-03-01T18:18:00.000Z	computer_	ikonia	Yar
2012-03-01T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	yeah, simple things like ldap for example
2012-03-01T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	what are you talking about ?
2012-03-01T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	a clients user account from the server ?
2012-03-01T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	a time limit to do what /
2012-03-01T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	a time limit to do what ?
2012-03-01T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	do you mean active working hours ?
2012-03-01T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	or auto log off after a certain time
2012-03-01T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	I've never seen that setting, but as there is an AD mirror schema for ldap, it should be possible
2012-03-01T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	no, it's an ldap directoy, exactly the same as AD
2012-03-01T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	AD was based of LDAP, so it's the same directory service
2012-03-01T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	active directory
2012-03-01T18:44:00.000Z	computer_	ikonia	All machines on this network are Ubuntu
2012-03-01T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	computer_	yes, I know that's why I said "use LDAP" not "use AD"
