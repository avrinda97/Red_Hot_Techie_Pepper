2008-08-29T20:42:00.000Z	qrush		This is a problem that's happening constantly. Ubuntu will run great for a few hours and then firefox won't open. Then I won't be able to use the gnome-panel. I don't know how to recover from this. Restarting xorg doesn't help, and usually i have to go into tty and reboot
2008-08-29T20:42:00.000Z	qrush		Nothing is eating up a lot of CPU, it's something that's gone haywire. What cna i do?
2008-08-29T20:43:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	make note of the processes on your system with"top" and "ps" when it happens, also take a look in /var/log/messages
2008-08-29T20:44:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	what am i supposed to be looking for?
2008-08-29T20:44:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	or logging myself? I don't see anything that's eating up a lot of cpu or ram
2008-08-29T20:44:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	look for i/o errors or any other hardware related problems
2008-08-29T20:45:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	well, noticing what eats most cpu/ram may give a hint also, check if FF is still running when its window is closed
2008-08-29T20:46:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	I'm not really huge linux/unix guru...this stuff in /var/log/messages is greek to me
2008-08-29T20:46:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	and yes, it is still running
2008-08-29T20:46:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	4 copies now that I've tried to start
2008-08-29T20:46:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	try to see if killing it "solves" the problem
2008-08-29T20:47:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	Other strange things happen too. For instance now I can't right click on my terminal window
2008-08-29T20:47:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	also if i go to the logout/shutdown button that will most like freeze gnome-panel
2008-08-29T20:47:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	looks like something is grabbing the mouse/keyboard
2008-08-29T20:48:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	might be the dead FF
2008-08-29T20:48:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	they're all dead now
2008-08-29T20:48:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	If i try to start firefox up again it won't work. this is usually when i reboot.
2008-08-29T20:48:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	I shouldn't have to do that though, and that's why I'm here. :)
2008-08-29T20:49:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	are you sure all the FF instances and related processes (such as firefox-bin) are dead?
2008-08-29T20:51:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	and still you get mouse/keyboard weirdness ?
2008-08-29T20:52:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	actually now i can right click on terminal
2008-08-29T20:52:00.000Z	qrush	ifireball	how odd
2008-08-29T20:54:00.000Z	ifireball	qrush	does writing files to your home directory, /tmp and /usr/tmp work ok? (you can use "touch" to check)
