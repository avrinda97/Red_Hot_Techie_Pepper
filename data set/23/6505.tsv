2006-03-25T14:16:00.000Z	espresso		who here knows how to add a local folder to sources.list?
2006-03-25T14:16:00.000Z	espresso		I cp'd my cd to the hard drive, since apt-get wouldn't open the cdrom
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	espresso	edit sources.lst
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	espresso	Nickgarvey	right, got that
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		still wouldn't work?
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		cd drive mounted?
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	espresso		I added a line, but I don't think I did it right
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		!tk
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		!turk
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	espresso		the line I did was
2006-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	espresso		(after cp'ing to /etc/ubuntu-install/)
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		!tr
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	espresso		deb /etc/ubuntu-install/
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	espresso		and it didn't like that
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	espresso		!Tk
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	espresso	its tr
2006-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	espresso	Nickgarvey	what's tr?
2006-03-25T14:19:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		tr is turkish, which is what I guessed he was talking
2006-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	espresso		there's a syntax to the line which I'm missing
2006-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	espresso		oh
2006-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	espresso		!sources.list
2006-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		!dsl
2006-03-25T14:22:00.000Z	espresso	Nickgarvey	my other wrinkle is that this is on the server, so I don't have the luxury of synaptic
