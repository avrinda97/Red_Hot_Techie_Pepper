2010-08-05T19:01:00.000Z	neiliob1973		help...Dell laptop was fine, now no grub, just tty1! Tried Googling, but no luck. help!
2010-08-05T19:01:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	did you recently run updates?
2010-08-05T19:01:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	yes. friend laptop, but he even asked me if he should run it.
2010-08-05T19:02:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	did it work after the updates, or are the updates what broke it?
2010-08-05T19:02:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	You get a non-graphical login prompt? Can you log into it?
2010-08-05T19:04:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	can you log in at the prompt and then type "gdm" and see what happens?
2010-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	giving it a shot now...give me a moment
2010-08-05T19:06:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	my guess is that your video drivers got screwed up and that X is failing to start
2010-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	here's the error I get "** (gdm-binary:1760): WARNING ** Failed to acquire org.DisplayManager; could not acquire name; bailing out"
2010-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	that was run as SUDO
2010-08-05T19:11:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	what about without sudo?
2010-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	is there any way to copy the drivers/files/etc from the LiveCD to a mounted HD, and make it work?
2010-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	unlikely. I think you need to fix X and GDM
2010-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	try running gdmsetup or sudo gdmsetup from command line
2010-08-05T19:15:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	great! "(gdmsetup:1932): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display"
2010-08-05T19:16:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	did it run, or did it fail with that error?
2010-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	was the upgrade your friend did a distro upgrade or just a regular update?
2010-08-05T19:21:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	regular update...why this is so weird.
2010-08-05T19:21:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	is there any chance he shut down before the upgrade was finished? Because it looks like it's pretty seriously hosed.
2010-08-05T19:22:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	idk. other options before I Live-boot, copy his files, and reinstall the OS?
2010-08-05T19:23:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	That might be faster. If you're comfortable with the command line you can back up his /home/hisname directory to a USB drive and reinstall
2010-08-05T19:24:00.000Z	neiliob1973	FoolsRun	THNX! I appreciate you taking some time!
2010-08-05T19:24:00.000Z	FoolsRun	neiliob1973	sorry I couldn't actually help :(
