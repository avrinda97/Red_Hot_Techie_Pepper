2006-03-12T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	tried "sudo apt-get update"?
2006-03-12T17:29:00.000Z	paul_	LjL	yes -- goes through a long list of "Hit" s and thats it
2006-03-12T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	paste your errors to the pastebin
2006-03-12T17:31:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	oh but, you tried installing openssh-server directly instead of ssh?
2006-03-12T17:32:00.000Z	paul_	LjL	yes, i'll paste another error for that
2006-03-12T17:33:00.000Z	paul_	LjL	here is the error for "sudo apt-get install openssh-server" http://pastebin.com/587958
2006-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	that's breezy, isn't it?
2006-03-12T17:35:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	it says version 1:4.1p1-7ubuntu4.1 of the client is going to be installed, but myself i have version 1:4.1p1-7ubuntu4 (the one it wants). so i suppose you might have some third-party repositories in your /etc/apt/sources.list that provider a newer openssh-client (and you might have that one installed as well)
2006-03-12T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	try "apt-cache policy openssh-client", see what's installed - if anything - and where it came from
2006-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	if you actually have that wrong version of openssh-client installed, remove it using "apt-cache --purge remove openssh-client", then reinstall it after your repositories are good
2006-03-12T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	uuh, know what? it isn't quite clear to me where that version came from. looks like you had installed it manually using dpkg...?
2006-03-12T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	try just removing it (using the command i said, not just remove) and reinstalling
2006-03-12T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	actually - remove it, issue a "sudo apt-get clean", and reinstall
2006-03-12T17:40:00.000Z	paul_	LjL	just type "sudo apt-get clean" and thats it? (no arguments)
2006-03-12T17:40:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	yes, that will clean your APT cache, so that it will not try to reuse the same package
2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	i'd say just try to reinstall first. though, sooner or later, i suppose you really should fix your repositories
2006-03-12T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	i have no experience with synaptic at all, i use aptitude exclusively
2006-03-12T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	no, "sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2006-03-12T17:48:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	(or make that "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade", if you prefer aptitude. i do)
2006-03-12T17:50:00.000Z	paul_	LjL	what's the difference between update and dist-upgrade?
2006-03-12T17:50:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	update fetches the list of packages (including any changes). dist-upgrade actually installs the new versions
2006-03-12T17:52:00.000Z	LjL	paul_	you're welcome
