2005-12-20T15:30:00.000Z	cyphase		where is the apt lock file?
2005-12-20T15:30:00.000Z	cyphase		i killed apt-get and *then* remembered i shouldn't :)
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	cyphase		Where is the apt-get lock file?
2005-12-20T15:33:00.000Z	cyphase		Where is the apt-get lock file?
2005-12-20T15:34:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	removing it is not a good idea, probably
2005-12-20T15:34:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	why?
2005-12-20T15:35:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	because it's there because something is using apt and needs the lock
2005-12-20T15:35:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	that's just it..
2005-12-20T15:36:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	well in that case look in /var/lock
2005-12-20T15:36:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	i did
2006-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	I would strongly recommend not to use the same alias for two ip addresses
2006-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	the dude suggests that
2006-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	i know
2006-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	also why would he set a root password
2006-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	I don't like that either in ubuntu
2006-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	just use sudo -i to get a root prompt
2006-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	i know :)
2006-01-11T08:41:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	I think it lacks explanations of what's going on
2006-01-11T08:43:00.000Z	cyphase	mwe	have you used the guide?
2006-01-11T08:43:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	no. I just went over it quickly
2006-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	I don't like instructions that don't explain what they do. also he seems to forget the very important step of installing mysql, to set the root password. it seems like he just expects it to be set already after apt-get install mysql-server
2006-01-11T08:46:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	yes
2006-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	mwe	cyphase	I heard someone from sweden got em in a few days
