2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	JavaAtom		Any suggestions for getting wpa_supplicant to run only when I tell it to?
2009-12-09T11:28:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	look into wpacli
2009-12-09T11:29:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	I've attempted to use wpa_cli, but every time I try, it says that it cannot connect to wpa_supplicant.
2009-12-09T11:29:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	is wpa_supplicant set to run at startup?  / is it running as daemon?
2009-12-09T11:30:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	apparently, it's running as a daemon with the '-u -s' options, which prevent me from running it like I should.
2009-12-09T11:30:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	what part of it do you want to control?
2009-12-09T11:30:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	I want to be able to run it with my config file I've set up.
2009-12-09T11:31:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	it should read out of your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf by default, you can install a program "services" to add or remove that kind of stuff
2009-12-09T11:32:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	right, but when I looked at that location, wpa_supplicant.conf was empty, despite being connected to the wifi...
2009-12-09T11:32:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	you might have to remove network manager to get it out of the way first
2009-12-09T11:32:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	rather, ther wasn't a wpa_supplicant.conf - there was an entire folder with ifupdown.sh, etc.
2009-12-09T11:33:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	I just removed everything related to Gnome.
2009-12-09T11:34:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	you have to make your own it doesn't show up automatically
2009-12-09T11:35:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	I get that -- here might be a better question: is there a way to have a stripped-down ubuntu installed? One without KDE/Gnome, but still have a "desktop" configuration?
2009-12-09T11:35:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	Or do I need to switch over to server?
2009-12-09T11:35:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	install debian ;)
2009-12-09T11:36:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	really?
2009-12-09T11:36:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	Debian will give you all the options to select exactly what you want
2009-12-09T11:37:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	shouldnt be a problem since they both use apt
2009-12-09T11:37:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	Ubuntu is just a preconfiged debian distro
2009-12-09T11:39:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	ubuntu just has more repos but u can use any apt repo you want
2009-12-09T11:39:00.000Z	Coded1	JavaAtom	debian is mostly internet install based
2009-12-09T11:39:00.000Z	JavaAtom	Coded1	Even better. Thank you much!
