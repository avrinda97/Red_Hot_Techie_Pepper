2008-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	dquestio1s		thats not the problem, the problem is i cant drage my mouse over there anymore
2008-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	dquestio1s		rotating my right screen works fine
2008-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		you have to rotate the mouse as well
2008-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	dquestio1s		i think there is something wrong with the top of my xorg file, could someone please look at it
2008-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		my rotation.sh script rotates both the mouse and the screen
2008-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	Wolvenhaven		so try rotating the mouse too
2008-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	dquestio1s	Wolvenhaven	 ... . well i rotated the right screen and it works perfectly.. and if i place the left screen to the right of the rightmost screen.. it works fine
