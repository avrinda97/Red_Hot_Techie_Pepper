2006-02-25T16:29:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo		any breakage with the locales lately ?
2006-02-25T16:29:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo		I've apt-get updated my system, and programs complain about the locales and don't work
2006-02-25T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	locales for what?
2006-02-25T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2006-02-25T16:31:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	breezy, with dapper repos
2006-02-25T16:31:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	the locale environment variables
2006-02-25T16:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	thats a very very bad idea
2006-02-25T16:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	they use different locales one wont work on other
2006-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	locale -a doesn't list the locale I want, any idea which package could have it
2006-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	 what does uname -r say?
2006-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	2.6.15-15-powerpc
2006-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	ok you are not using breezy
2006-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	I've been using these configuration for a long time on other boxes (breezy with dapper repos) haven't experienced any problems
2006-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	go to locales in system>admin i think is where it is and there should be updates
2006-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	i didnt say everyone would have problems i said its a bad idea
2006-02-25T16:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	dapper depends on things that are not avilable in breezy and vice versa
2006-02-25T16:35:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	couldn't find appropriate package
2006-02-25T16:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	if you have breezy repos in your sources.list take them out than try the system>admin locales again (after sudo apt-get update
2006-02-25T16:42:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	it didn't make any difference, it still doesn't generate the locale currently set for my system (by ubuntu installer)
2006-02-25T16:43:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	mine is tr_TR.UTF-8 and the closest thing it generates is the tr_CY.UTF-8 which I've never heard of before
2006-02-25T16:43:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	what's the neat way of changing the locale system-wide, so I can test if that tr_CY works
2006-02-25T16:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	EricCartman-iboo	theres a way in cli to do it i just can remember if its sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2006-02-25T16:48:00.000Z	EricCartman-iboo	gnomefreak	thanks anyway
