2007-05-11T12:50:00.000Z	cbs		im running ubuntu on 64 amd, and when I went to install a 64 bit nvidia driver package, it says it detects im running on an x86 kernel
2007-05-11T12:50:00.000Z	cbs		can anyone help?
2007-05-11T12:51:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	what does uname -a tell you?
2007-05-11T12:52:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	Linux OcSys 2.6.20-15-generic #2 SMP Sun Apr 15 07:36:31 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-05-11T12:52:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	are you sure you installed 64 bit version?
2007-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	yes im fairly certain...
2007-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	I think thats the latest 32 bit kernel
2007-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	oh boo
2007-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	there are ways to update your kernel, but it would be faster to reinstall
2007-05-11T12:54:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	but say I want to be able ot use both of them
2007-05-11T12:54:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	what machine again
2007-05-11T12:54:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	why do you want both of them?
2007-05-11T12:54:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	type
2007-05-11T12:55:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	would everything under wine rune the same?
2007-05-11T12:56:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	ooh I cant answer that definitively
2007-05-11T12:57:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	is this going to be a desktop of server?
2007-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	there are programs that you will not be able to use i.e. the Kava plugin for firefox, there isn't a 64 bit version of that
2007-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	i dont really care about what I can and cant run other than being able to run certain windows games, and have a zippy 64 bit environment to work in, if nothing else
2007-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	have you tested wine on this box?
2007-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	cbs	tideline	yes
2007-05-11T13:02:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	well you arent running the 64 bit kernel
2007-05-11T13:05:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	if you move to another partition then dont format during install - then remount it when you install you wont loose anything
2007-05-11T13:10:00.000Z	tideline	cbs	#ubuntu-tn
