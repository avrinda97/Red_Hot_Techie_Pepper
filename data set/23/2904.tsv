2011-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	robeph		oops ok anyhow..   So the installer crashes and basically wrecked my previous grub install
2011-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	robeph		Anyhow,  so heres my question since I don't want to go through and manually rebuild grub...
2011-06-29T13:37:00.000Z	robeph		where the hell does ubuntu install stage files for grub
2011-06-29T13:37:00.000Z	robeph		since it doesn't follow the standard build locations
2011-06-29T13:38:00.000Z	robeph		#ubuntu-offtopic.... just saying
2011-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	robeph		you're spamming up the support channel with irrelevant stuff,  thanks
2011-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	wth man. there's been ONE support questio nin ten minutes.
2011-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	robeph	hdon	doesn't matter
2011-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	talking in this channel makes it easier for me to read real questions when they are asked
2011-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	if i go to an off-topic channel, i will not be able to help #ubuntu
2011-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	hyperbole isn't wrong, it's just hyperbole
2011-06-29T13:42:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	please take this convo to #ubuntu-rule, you're spamming up the support channel with irrelevant discussion
2011-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	/boot/grub ?
2011-06-29T13:46:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	yikes...
2011-06-29T13:48:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	as pathetic as this sounds i haven't dealt with grub in nearly ten years... my new workstation i bought with Ubuntu preinstalled D:
2011-06-29T13:49:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	wait you can't burn a CD because the CD burning software is, on the CD you burned, corrupt?
2011-06-29T13:55:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	my shell says that /*/menu.lst, /*/*/menu.lst, /*/*/*/menu.lst do not exist
2011-06-29T13:55:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	same for grub.conf. but i do not know how my OEM vendor installed my system.
2011-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	i'd try google https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
2011-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	yeah that sounds retarded maximum
2011-06-29T13:58:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	according to an ubu tut, /boot/grub/ is where menu.lst goes
2011-06-29T14:02:00.000Z	hdon	robeph	^^
