2011-05-05T13:10:00.000Z	brez		I want to permantly add an IP to my eth0, how would I achieve this?
2011-05-05T13:11:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	right click on network manager icon >>edit connection
2011-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	select eth0
2011-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	I have network manager disabled
2011-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	edit
2011-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	brez		as I'm running a vhox
2011-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	you mean vbox???
2011-05-05T13:14:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	yes, sorry.
2011-05-05T13:14:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	so when I go to network manager, it's empty. I know how to manually add it via terminal, but I don't want to have to do this.. (it's an IPv6 IP)
2011-05-05T13:16:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	yes so try what I said
2011-05-05T13:17:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	eth0 is not displayed in network manager.
2011-05-05T13:18:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	Then what is displayed ??? Auto eth0???
2011-05-05T13:18:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	nothing. I told you, it's disabled :-)
2011-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	Okay if the VM is running ..shut it down
2011-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	right click on it goto settings
2011-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	I may not of been specific. I'm running ubuntu in the virtual box, so therefore it's a bridged NAT connection from my windows box.
2011-05-05T13:20:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	which vitualization tool are you using ??
2011-05-05T13:21:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	I'm not following? To make it simple, can this be added in /network/interfaces, rather than via the GUI?
2011-05-05T13:23:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	if you dont see a eth0 that mean networking may be disabled. you need to enable it in whatever virtualization tool you are using
2011-05-05T13:23:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	networking is not disabled, I'm irc'n via ssh from the box.
2011-05-05T13:24:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	when I 'ifconfig eht0' the IP's are there.
2011-05-05T13:25:00.000Z	new_kid1	brez	oh .........nothing ...wait n see if some can help
2011-05-05T13:26:00.000Z	brez	new_kid1	thanks for trying :-)
