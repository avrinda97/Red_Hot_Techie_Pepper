2008-01-17T22:07:00.000Z	stringer630		so i should use Gparted to make the partitions before installing?
2008-01-17T22:07:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	what are you doing ?
2008-01-17T22:22:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	ill ask again, whats your setup like ?
2008-01-17T22:24:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	so on HD, two partitions ?
2008-01-17T22:25:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	ok, whats your question then, please reply using my nick so I have a chance to see it, thanks
2008-01-17T22:27:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	thanks for you patience. Can i simpley use a program like GParted to make neccassary partitions for an ubuntu installtion and NTFS? Than how do i go about installing ubuntu, as in which partition option do i use ie Gudied or maual?
2008-01-17T22:28:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	you can partition within the installer if you want, it will do the samething as outside the install ( using gparted, like your asking), are you concerned about losing data ?
2008-01-17T22:29:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	the harddrive is empty so no data would be lost
2008-01-17T22:30:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	then, let me explain a good setup scenerio, and see if that helps
2008-01-17T22:30:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	how large is the drive ?
2008-01-17T22:31:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	120gb, please type your ideas to solve my problem, i will be away from keyboard for a while, many thanks in advance
2008-01-17T22:33:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	ok, so you will need a base of 15GB (generous) for each your Ubuntu partition and your Win partition, then you will need a 1-2G partition for swap, the way I setup Ubuntu is a seperate partition for /home, so the previously allocated space for / is 15GB, and set /home to something the same.  Then allocate the rest of the space to your 'extra' NTFS space
2008-01-17T22:34:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	/ (15GB), /home (20GB), /swap (2GB) c:/ (15GB), ~60GB NTFS left over
2008-01-17T22:54:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	did my information not assist you ?
2008-01-17T22:55:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	yes it was very helpful thankyou
2008-01-17T22:55:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	then why are you still using gparted before your installation to partition your tables ?
2008-01-17T22:56:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	the live cd installer doesnt let me format a partion to ntfs
2008-01-17T22:56:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	then just format it after, you dont 'have' to do all the partitioning in the installer
2008-01-17T22:57:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	ah right, that would make more sense. i dont have much knowledge on partitioning so i didnt realise that was an option. how can i format it after then? use gparted?
2008-01-17T22:58:00.000Z	neverblue	stringer630	yes
2008-01-17T22:58:00.000Z	stringer630	neverblue	thankyou so much :) yours and everyones input has been much apreciated. sorry for my newbyness also lol
