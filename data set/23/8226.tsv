2005-02-11T08:15:00.000Z	AndyFitz		libgc 6.4 needs to be added to the repo  lol.  currently 6.3 is the latest in hoary
2005-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	AndyFitz		raydoggm  just use fglrx already in the repo
2005-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	AndyFitz		fglrx does work well for 3d
2005-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	The 9250 is supported by the DRI project's driver so Ubuntu was probably using that.
2005-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	AndyFitz	Amaranth	 the icons have changed  ( well the arrows and a few little things )
2005-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Damn you, I felt special. :P
2005-07-20T13:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Would ubuntu-art be a good place to request an icon for Smeg?
2005-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	AndyFitz	Amaranth	 yeah  or just PM me .  what did you have in mind ?
2005-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Something that makes it obvious it's a menu editor, I guess.
2005-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	And fits in with your kickass new theme.
2005-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Which icon gets used for the show desktop button on the panel?
2005-07-20T13:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	I think it's zooming either the 22 or 24 one.
2005-07-20T13:37:00.000Z	AndyFitz	Amaranth	if you figure out a fix please post it to the list
2005-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Ok.
2005-07-20T13:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	lmao, if you remove the 22x22 and 24x24 gnome-fs-desktop icons it seems to work perfectly
2005-07-20T13:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	You mean the foot on the window border?
2005-07-20T13:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Getting rid of the 22x22 and 24x24 icons seems to have fixed the show desktop button.
2005-07-20T13:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	it's using the scalable one, i guess
2005-07-20T13:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	those are whatever the default cellrenderer height is
2005-07-20T13:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	I mean it's using the scalable one now, it's it sizing it right. It looks perfect.
2005-07-20T13:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	hmm, putting in the 22x22 one again seems to either use that one correctly or do nothing
2005-07-20T13:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	I can't make it break anymore. I put the 22x22 and 24x24 ones back in.
2005-07-20T13:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	AndyFitz	Try removing the applet and adding it back in.
