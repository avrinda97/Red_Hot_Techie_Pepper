2006-09-15T11:05:00.000Z	lewix		is it possible to copy directory
2006-09-15T11:05:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	yes, cp -a
2008-01-14T03:43:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	can you explain the issue again?
2008-01-14T03:50:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	i couldnt watch videos on my external videos
2011-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	so is it your long way of saying that you use unrar
2011-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	no that's the short and easy way of me telling you, you can install unrar and just use archive manager.  But it's only easy if you bother to read
2011-01-31T02:08:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	you dont know why im asking dont assume i need to install it.
2011-01-31T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	do you have a different question?
2011-01-31T02:09:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	the question was clear. what do you use to extract or read .rar
2011-01-31T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	please don't ask questions like that here.  If you need help accomplishing something, just ask that.  I assumed you just wanted to extract a .rar, but if that's not the case, then just ask your real question
2011-01-31T02:11:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	that was the real question, you didnt have to assume you chose to. you should answered with one word, the package you use, or not answer at all. last time I read the the channel rules I was alowed to ask questions
2011-01-31T02:11:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	this channel is for ubuntu support, not polling package usage
2011-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	so thats what you should have answered. thank you
2011-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	there's http://popcon.ubuntu.com if you're interested in package usage by the way
2011-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	ah im just being a ass. sorry =)
2011-01-31T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	heh, external irc forces were affecting my mood too :P
2011-01-31T02:13:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	lmao - ya i was getting mad i didnt even know why.
2011-01-31T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	use unrar, unrar-free won't work on later rar files
2011-01-31T02:24:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	thats what i just found out =) thank you
2011-01-31T02:33:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	it's the same, just use apt-get to install the apache2 package
2011-01-31T02:34:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	thank you. can you enlighten me with the different version of ubuntu. im a lil bit confused
2011-01-31T02:34:00.000Z	jrib	lewix	maverick is the latest stable release, yeah (they're in alphabetical order now: karmic, lucid, maverick (natty is in development))
2011-01-31T02:35:00.000Z	lewix	jrib	ok thank you
