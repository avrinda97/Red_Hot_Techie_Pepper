2008-09-10T22:36:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	I assume you typed root(hd0,x) before doing that?
2008-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	yes
2008-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	and you're getting a kernel panic?
2008-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	yes
2008-09-10T22:38:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	"kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
2008-09-10T23:22:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	I think there's something wrong with the kernel
2008-09-10T23:22:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	you're better off making a tar.gz
2008-09-10T23:23:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	what would be the tar options?
2008-09-10T23:25:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	make that tar -cvvfz /home filename.tar.gz
2008-09-10T23:26:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	ok, doing that
2008-09-10T23:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	that should work fine
2008-09-10T23:26:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	what do i do next, to get a working kernel or roll back to the one that worked?
2008-09-10T23:27:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	have you booted to an older kernel?
2008-09-10T23:28:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	i dont believe i have one anymore.  this problem came after an apt-get upgrade
2008-09-10T23:30:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	this is ubuntu.  i did a routine apt-get upgrade.  after that, kernel panic when booting up.
2008-09-10T23:30:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	oh, ok
2008-09-10T23:31:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	do you know how i would fix this?
2008-09-10T23:31:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	i'd reinstall
2008-09-10T23:32:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	i see.  hmm, ok..
2008-09-10T23:44:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	how would i prevent this from happening again? it was just a routine apt-get upgrade, it did it on its own.  if i just reinstall, it'll probably happen again during the next upgrade
2008-09-10T23:48:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	i doubt it
2008-09-10T23:49:00.000Z	Spectacular	_Zeus_	you doubt there's anything i can do to prevent it from happening again? or you doubt it'll happen again?
2008-09-10T23:49:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Spectacular	doubt it'll happen again
