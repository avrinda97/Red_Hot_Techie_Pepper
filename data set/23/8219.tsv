2004-12-09T07:55:00.000Z	daniels		artifacts are not 'a side effect of X'
2004-12-09T07:55:00.000Z	daniels		they're a bug that should be fixed
2004-12-09T07:55:00.000Z	daniels		but if it's an nVidia card, then they're the only people who can fix them
2004-12-09T07:55:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	true..
2004-12-09T07:56:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	sure they do
2004-12-09T07:56:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	untrue.
2004-12-09T07:56:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	where....?
2004-12-09T07:56:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/{ati{,misc},r{128,adeon}}_drv.o
2004-12-09T07:57:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	doesn't work with my card man...
2004-12-09T07:57:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	what sort of card do you have?
2004-12-09T07:57:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	i have not heard of any powerpc ati card unsupported by the standard driver
2004-12-09T07:57:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	its onboard ati 7500? g3 ibook
2004-12-09T07:57:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	works fine
2004-12-09T07:58:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	i can only use framebuffer....x just wont display anything...
2004-12-09T07:58:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	please file a bug on https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com with the content of /var/log/XFree86.0.log, /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, and the output of lspci
2004-12-09T07:59:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	no, the default configuration has UseFBDev, which is entirely different to using the framebuffer
2004-12-09T07:59:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	its not ubuntu..it was the same with yellow dog, debian, mandrake
2004-12-09T07:59:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	even so, I would love to see the output so we can hopefully fix this small bug
2004-12-09T08:01:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	even so, ati dont make 3d ppc linux drivers which was the point of my initial conversation with dad
2004-12-09T08:01:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	again, this is not true.
2004-12-09T08:01:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	radeons up to the 9250 are fully supported for all architectures
2004-12-09T08:01:00.000Z	daniels	StarScreem	by fully supported, I mean 2D and 3D acceleration
2004-12-09T08:02:00.000Z	StarScreem	daniels	my apologies...glx gears runs...albeit extremely slow
