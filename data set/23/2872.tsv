2008-10-19T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	boot is handled by grub now
2008-10-19T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	that error is normally (not normally) associated with the windows partition not being defragged/chkdisked before partitioning for the ubuntu install
2008-10-19T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	using the windows repair cd will normally fix it
2008-10-19T15:14:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	I did a Defrag just before installing Ubuntu, like suggetsed
2008-10-19T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	thats the normal cause
2008-10-19T15:14:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	I also tried with the Windows Recovery Console, to "bootcfg /rebuild"
2008-10-19T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	it's no the bootcfg
2008-10-19T15:15:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	but I read on forums that the boot.ini file is probably the problem
2008-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	but I'm not able to edit it from within Ubuntu
2008-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	possible, you need to boot ubuntu, mount your windows partition and look at the file
2008-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	you should be able to
2008-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	that's where I need help, since it's all new to me
2008-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	what part are you having issues
2008-10-19T15:17:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	I can see the Windows drive in the "File Browser", but I can't see the boot.ini file
2008-10-19T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	it's a hidden file normally
2008-10-19T15:17:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	even with "Show Hidden Files" enabled
2008-10-19T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	or it not being there maybe the problem
2008-10-19T15:19:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	yeah, I'm pretty clueless as to why I can't see it
2008-10-19T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	maybe it's not there
2008-10-19T15:20:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	what would you suggest I do to recreate it? I already tried "bootcfg /rebuild"
2008-10-19T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Fueled	someone in ##windows may be able to help rebuild it
2008-10-19T15:21:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	ok I'll look there
2008-10-19T15:21:00.000Z	Fueled	ikonia	thanks!
