2011-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	locsmif_		Hello all. Any issues known with RTL 8168/8111 ?
2011-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	locsmif_		I have Ethernet data frame errors under Ubuntu but not under Windows 7
2011-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	what ubuntu-version?
2011-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	there was a bug in 8.04 about that
2011-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	I' m in Windows now... oh, btw I' m running kubuntu, I might be in the wrong channel :(
2011-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	aha
2011-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	this channel is ok for such questions using kubuntu
2011-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	I downloaded the latest and apt-get dist-upgraded
2011-10-24T23:38:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	ok, so you are using 11.10
2011-10-24T23:40:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	a quick search doesnt show any issues with linux 3.0 and your nic about droping packages
2011-10-24T23:41:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	this is a new PC, it's one of those new AMD CPU/GPU type things. It's got an MSI motherboard
2011-10-24T23:41:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	hardware is quite new, therefore
2011-10-24T23:41:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	but the nic sounds like a standard nic
2011-10-24T23:42:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	yes, but from my experience with developing Sidux/Aptosid, there were instances where the same PCI ID still hid some changes under the hood
2011-10-24T23:42:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	yes :(
2011-10-24T23:43:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	i was also seeing something like that on a aid-controller
2011-10-24T23:43:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	raid
2011-10-24T23:43:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	I chose Ubuntu because of its excellent hardware support ;-)
2011-10-24T23:43:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	i think then its a good idea to open a bug against the kernel
2011-10-24T23:44:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	yeah .... everything is slanted towards Windows, their drivers are functional, it's the Wintel/OEM racketeering alliance.. :(
2011-10-24T23:44:00.000Z	locsmif_	iceroot	okay, I will write a bug report soon
2011-10-24T23:44:00.000Z	iceroot	locsmif_	nice
