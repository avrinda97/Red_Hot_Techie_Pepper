2005-07-15T09:51:00.000Z	Velcan		thanks
2005-07-15T09:52:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	go to System > Admin > synaptic package manager
2005-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i'm not sure if mail-notification uses ssl (which google requires)
2005-07-15T10:54:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	you must enable ssl in your pop3 clients for it to work with google
2005-07-15T10:54:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	there is a very good walkthrough when you log into gmail using your browser
2005-07-15T10:55:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i am not sure if the applet uses ssl
2005-07-15T10:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	a google mail tray applet?
2005-07-15T10:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	where do you get it?
2005-07-15T10:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i'll compile it in a second
2005-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	yes, it's vaporware atm
2005-07-16T05:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	"sudo fdisk -l"
2005-07-16T05:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	the dog sent you a link
2005-07-16T05:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	to mount all the drives on your box
2005-07-16T06:45:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	xdiskusage
2005-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i dont know of any mail apps with panel notification
2005-07-23T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	write a panel dockling for one
2005-07-23T16:00:00.000Z	Velcan	nalioth	 can you explain that or refer me to some doc.
2005-07-24T16:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i'm not a programmer, but all the mail apps are open-sourced and have 'hooks' for you to 'call' functions
2005-07-24T16:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	so theoretically one would create a dockling, or panel applet which called the running email client and kept count of unread mails or whatever you wanted to make it do
2005-07-24T16:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	there is "mail-notification" but it istn part of any mail app
2005-07-24T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	i believe there is a "google mail" section in mail-notification
2005-07-24T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Velcan	ah
