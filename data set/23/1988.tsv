2010-02-12T22:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	can you use the "top" command in a terminal to determine what is eating the CPU?
2010-02-12T22:52:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	i checked but no help... :(

2010-02-12T22:55:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	100 is the CPU usage
2010-02-12T22:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	ipfm appears to be a bandwidth monitor app - it doesn't seem to be part of base install, could you uninstall it perhaps?
2010-02-12T22:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	or file a bug against it?
2010-02-12T22:57:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	okk i will try that
2010-02-12T22:57:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	will get back to u
2010-02-12T22:58:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	hii it worked perfectly for me....
2010-02-12T22:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	cool - you "might" want to post a bug about that program - if you feel generous
2010-02-12T23:00:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	hey can u help me in solving one more problem..?? whenever i boot or shutdown my  system i see a line while booting.. "pidfile not found. is jackd running" ... what is that,,, and there it shows a red * in front of that
2010-02-12T23:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	jack is an audio sub-system of some sort - i've never used it sorry
2010-02-12T23:01:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	 what is a pidfile ...??
2010-02-12T23:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	pidfile is a recording of what PID (process ID) a particular program is running with - it's saying no PIDFILE most likely because the program isn't running
2010-02-12T23:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	i really wouldn't worry too much about it myself
2010-02-12T23:02:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	ohkk...
2010-02-12T23:03:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	hey man. how did u have soo much knowledge about LINUX.. whats your age.. are u a engineer
2010-02-12T23:06:00.000Z	shreymech	ZykoticK9	hey can i uninstall jackd ..???
2010-02-12T23:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shreymech	? dunno - it's not installed on my system, but perhaps something you did install requires it
