2004-11-27T14:32:00.000Z	wood1		What is the difference between VIM and VI ?
2004-11-27T14:33:00.000Z	wood1		Can I remove VIM and just keep VI ?
2004-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	wood1		My hard is only 2 GB. Which packages can I safely remove ?
2004-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	wood1		OK I see
2004-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	apt-get remove --purge vim nvi+
2004-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	also, type apt-get clean
2004-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	clears out the cache of downloaded packages
2004-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	in the settings, you can add any number of new mail accounts
2004-12-05T09:31:00.000Z	wood1	jdub	what I meant was that I want my different Email Accounts to have it's own folders and settings
2004-12-05T09:31:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	for anything other than pop, yes.
2004-12-05T09:32:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	they'll be in separate trees
2004-12-05T09:32:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	but pop comes in to your local box
2004-12-07T14:55:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	do you have a 'Windows Networking' icon in the Network view at all?
2004-12-07T15:00:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	remember that hoary is in development, and in particular, has gnome devel branch packages
2004-12-07T15:02:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	there's no guarantee that hoary will work for anything :-)
2004-12-07T15:05:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	hoary is the development branch. right now it's pre-alpha, pre-beta, pre-preview, pre-release, etc.
2004-12-07T15:06:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	as is gnome 2.9.
2004-12-11T06:02:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	in your account settings
2004-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	you don't need to
2004-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	there were no significant changes in 2.8.0; 2.7.3 was the version released for gnome 2.8
2004-12-17T17:26:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	because warty is released and stable, that is, there are no changes beyond security and high impact bug fixes.
2005-01-03T13:13:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	simply having stuff installed won't slow your machine down
2005-01-03T13:14:00.000Z	jdub	wood1	run 'nautilus'
