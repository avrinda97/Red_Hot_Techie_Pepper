2008-01-17T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	most NAS run opensource OS
2008-01-17T16:01:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	u know any cheap ones?
2008-01-17T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	how big do you want?
2008-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	Not that big. Just one or 2 disks or so.
2008-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	how about a 1gb nas?
2008-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	Of course if it comes cheap with 4 it's also good

2008-01-17T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	you need to be specific with storage capacity that you need
2008-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	ho.. that is expensive. I was hoping for a unit (without disks) for about 50 -150 euro
2008-01-17T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	oic you want a NAS shell with no disks...you never said
2008-01-17T16:11:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	can be with disks but disks are about 200 eachright?
2008-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	You know a website of OS Nasfirmware that has a listing of supported devices or something like that?
2008-01-17T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	its a NAS, they are usually accessed over ftp but check the manufacturer to see if they say Linux support. I know the WD QuickBook cvan be a pain
2008-01-17T16:19:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	but I don't know which os 'firmwares' are available. is there a list somewhere?
2008-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	why do you need firmware for a standalone device?
2008-01-17T16:24:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	maybe I am misunderstanding it. I mean the os... I would like to know which 'distributions' are available for which nas devices... (like you have dd-wrt for the linksys wrt54gl)
2008-01-17T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	esperegu	no idea aboutthat sorry. try http://www.google.com
2008-01-17T16:28:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	thx

2008-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	esperegu	ActionParsnip	/ rww: than I have 32bit. How can I upgrade to 64?
