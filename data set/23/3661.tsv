2012-07-14T20:35:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	why does the ubuntu installer not diplaying sda as a option in the partitional installer of latest ubuntu?
2012-07-14T20:35:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	sorry what ?
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	the installer wont show me the sda drive as a option for install
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	for some reason it can't see your disk
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	disk controller? fakeraid setup ?
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	ahhhh
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	fakeraid is not something I suggest using
2012-07-14T20:36:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	the weird thing is that it shows up with fdisk -l and cfdisk
2012-07-14T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	that sounds like your fakeraid device isn't supported in linux
2012-07-14T20:37:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	why does the sda show up with fdisk -l then
2012-07-14T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	(based on what you are saying)
2012-07-14T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	because that's the physical device,
2012-07-14T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	rather than the raid device
2012-07-14T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	not quite, how the installer sees the disks depends on the raid controller
2012-07-14T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	that's not how it works
2012-07-14T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	I asked if it was fakeraid....you said possible
2012-07-14T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	how many disks are in your system (physical devices)
2012-07-14T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	are you using any sort of raid/striping/mirroring/
2012-07-14T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	what is on the disks, any other OSes ?
2012-07-14T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	ok,
2012-07-14T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	raidghost	as a test, could you please boot a livecd, and create a partition using gparted on /dev/sda
2012-07-14T20:42:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	i will take a look in the bios. and see if there is some options i should change. thanks for some usefull information<(
2012-07-15T20:33:00.000Z	raidghost	ikonia	I did make a video of my ubuntu issue. just let me know if you can understand why it acts as it does.
