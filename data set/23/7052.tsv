2005-10-24T06:25:00.000Z	augustin		i have trouble installing my wi-fi card, following the ubuntu HowTo and various things on the web... when i do "modprobe ndiswrapper", it hangs, and none of the solutions proposed online helped =/
2005-10-24T06:26:00.000Z	augustin		the card is a DWL-G510 (rev C1)
2005-10-24T06:28:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	which card?
2005-10-24T06:28:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	D-Link DWL-G510 (rev C1)
2005-10-24T06:30:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	try the Madwifi driver.
2005-10-24T06:30:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	it explicitely states that rev C doesn't work =(
2005-10-24T06:31:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	yes =((
2005-10-24T06:38:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	when using ndiswrapper -l or the ndisgtk utility, it shows that my driver is loaded and the hardware is present, but still the card doesn't appear in the Networking utility of GNOME, and "iwconfig" returns only lo, sit0 and eth0 (which is my wired network card, disabled atm), none with "wireless extension"
2005-10-24T06:44:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	are you as root?
2005-10-24T06:44:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	that's right... it is when i do it as root that it freezes
2005-10-24T06:45:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	the ndiswrapper driver is said to do that with your card.
2005-10-24T06:45:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	damn, i didn't read that...
2005-10-24T06:46:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	must have missed it, that's what happen when you spend 4 hours straight going from site to site trying to find a solution =(
2005-10-24T06:46:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	aah, I see ><
2005-10-24T06:46:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	if it's possible, that would be ideal!
2005-10-24T06:50:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	try this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCards
2005-10-24T06:54:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	yeah, but ideally i would love to use a linux driver instead of ndiswrapper
2005-10-24T06:58:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	how do i know which one to take when, for one given name/manufacturer, many chipsets exist who don't have the same results ? =(
2005-10-24T06:59:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	a good question.. ><
2005-10-24T06:59:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	(actually i think it's oo-boon-too =) )
2005-10-24T06:59:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	thanks. ^^
2005-10-24T07:02:00.000Z	augustin	YukiIkyuta	i must go, thanks for your help, very nice =)
2005-10-24T07:03:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	augustin	good luck!
