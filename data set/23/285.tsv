2012-01-27T11:31:00.000Z	Nikku		Hi, does anyone know how to use pLop to install Ubuntu from a USB on a computer that can boot from BIOS or DVD/CD?
2012-01-27T11:31:00.000Z	Nikku		I've followed all available instructions. I've reached a purple splash page that says Ubuntu
2012-01-27T11:31:00.000Z	Nikku		how would that help to boot the file?
2012-01-27T11:32:00.000Z	Nikku		opps, that wasnt directed at me, sorry
2012-01-27T11:32:00.000Z	Nikku		Does anyone know how long it usually takes to boot Ubuntu from a USB?
2012-01-27T11:33:00.000Z	aBound	Nikku	Varies on how fast the USB drive is.
2012-01-27T11:33:00.000Z	aBound		2.0 Might be slower than 3.0
2012-01-27T11:33:00.000Z	Nikku		nothing, it's still purple
2012-01-27T11:33:00.000Z	Nikku		Its been this way for about 45 mins now
2012-01-27T11:34:00.000Z	aBound	Nikku	Reboot.
2012-01-27T11:34:00.000Z	aBound		Shouldn't last that long.
2012-01-27T11:34:00.000Z	Nikku	aBound	Ive done that twice
2012-01-27T11:34:00.000Z	aBound		Hmm, could of been a bad ISO.
2012-01-27T11:35:00.000Z	aBound	Nikku	Ubuntu is also known to have issues with certain USB flash drives too.
2012-01-27T11:35:00.000Z	Nikku	aBound	I downloaded straight from Ubuntu. Do you recommend restarting the process?
2012-01-27T11:35:00.000Z	Nikku		ah I see. I'll try a different flash
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	Nikku		it should be formatted as FAT32 correct?
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	aBound		I use a SanDisk flash drive.
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	aBound	Nikku	Dual-Booting?
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	aBound		Ubuntu usually formats itself to either ext3 or ext4.
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	Nikku		I'm not quite sure what that is, but the Ubuntu start up is the only file on there
2012-01-27T11:37:00.000Z	Nikku		I'll try another flash
2012-01-27T11:37:00.000Z	aBound	Nikku	ext3 and ext4 are filesystems but FAT32 should be fine for the flash drive.
