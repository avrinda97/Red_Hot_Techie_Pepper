2009-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	Rinz		hello, and I have some problems with my laptop sound
2009-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	what kind of problems?
2009-11-24T13:20:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	open up a terminal type in alsamixer and make sure everything is unmuted(hit tab twice after running alsamixer to show all channels)
2009-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	I will try.
2009-11-24T13:24:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// I check all volume setting is full(!00).. but in my laptop speaker it doesn't work
2009-11-24T13:25:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	are they all unmuted? you can tell by the MM(muted) or OO(open) at the bottom of the bars
2009-11-24T13:26:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	what kind of laptop is it?
2009-11-24T13:27:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	im thinking it has its own volume, some toshibas have a dial you turn along with the fn Fx keys
2009-11-24T13:29:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// it isn't muted and.. my function keys works great. can I control my speaker only? not line-out.
2009-11-24T13:30:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	does the sound work? and if you want you can control any channel,i changed mine to master channel
2009-11-24T13:31:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	and would it happen to be an intel chipset/audio card?
2009-11-24T13:31:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// it is REALTEK's sound chipset.
2009-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// only my headphone works - line-out
2009-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	hmm thats what i have, i had that same problem i fixed it by editing channels in kmix and unmuting channels
2009-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	PCM and speaker for mine
2009-11-24T13:33:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// what is kmix?
2009-11-24T13:33:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	im in kubuntu im using KDE my fault :D
2009-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	Rinz	sharpen047	// kubuntu is variant version of ubuntu, right? '--'
2009-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	yes same base code **i think**
2009-11-24T13:37:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	google KDE desktop
2009-11-24T13:37:00.000Z	sharpen047	Rinz	we were all noobs at some point :D
