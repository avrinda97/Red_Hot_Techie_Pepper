2011-09-02T01:48:00.000Z	Jeanbeaudrillard	doodmang	glad i can help you can also make the os faster by changing the default theme
2011-09-02T01:48:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	what do you mean by changing the theme? Desktop effects?
2011-09-02T01:49:00.000Z	Jeanbeaudrillard	doodmang	yes i believe it can have a great impact on some less powerfull pcs
2011-09-02T01:51:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	yeah, I plan on changing that.
2011-09-02T01:54:00.000Z	Jeanbeaudrillard	doodmang	lol trialboot

2011-09-02T01:56:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	oh, I mean 3 OSs over the two computers I have
2011-09-02T02:05:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	how can I check?
2011-09-02T02:05:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	I can't remember if I created the live USB with persistent space
2011-09-02T02:06:00.000Z	Jeanbeaudrillard	doodmang	if it's persitent than normally you can save data on it
2011-09-02T02:07:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	what session can I expect if I am installing? probably live?
2011-09-02T02:10:00.000Z	Jeanbeaudrillard	doodmang	hum i should probably be persitent since ubuntu is the first distro to be ported on usb
2011-09-02T02:11:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	well, I already entered in the network password, so I'm already at the point where it doesn't matter
2011-09-02T02:12:00.000Z	doodmang	Jeanbeaudrillard	not that I know how to access the desktop from installer
