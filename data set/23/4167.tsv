2007-10-20T23:54:00.000Z	We3Share		Can someone give me a hand configuring an ATI Radeon on a fresh install of Gutsy? Restricted drivers allows me to enable it. It reboots, runs reconfigure and I get back without it functioning.
2007-10-20T23:56:00.000Z	We3Share		Should I use the proprietary or opensource drivers for an ATI Radeon on a fresh install?
2007-10-20T23:58:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	which radeon?
2007-10-20T23:59:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	I am not sure, but I will check just a sec.
2007-10-20T23:59:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Radeon 9550xl
2007-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	then I'd suggest using the free (default) driver
2007-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	particularly if you're mainly interested on compiz
2007-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Ok, but, how can I get into a res that is above 800 x 600...
2007-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-10-21T00:02:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41385/
2007-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Was that the paste you were looking for?
2007-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Ok, got it...
2007-10-21T00:07:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	yeah sorry I missed it
2007-10-21T00:08:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	No problem, I know it's crazy here....I am capable of following whatever direction, I've just never personally dealt w/ ATI issues...I have nvidia myself...
2007-10-21T00:08:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	well you should switch to the "ati" driver
2007-10-21T00:09:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	when I enabled restricted...it rebooted and asked me what driver...I selected ATI and it rebooted back without change...But I selected opensource not proprietary...Should I use proprietary instead?
2007-10-21T00:09:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	run sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-10-21T00:11:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Run that at term now, then reboot? or logout to term and run it?
2007-10-21T00:12:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	restarting X should be enough
2007-10-21T00:12:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Ok, I ran the command, now I'll give it a whirl.
2007-10-21T00:26:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	Ok, great that worked perfectly...I am having an issue getting compiz to start but I will take that to #compiz...Thanks a lot!
2007-10-21T00:27:00.000Z	crdlb	We3Share	#compiz-fusion :)
2007-10-21T00:27:00.000Z	We3Share	crdlb	I know....I was just being lazy...=)
