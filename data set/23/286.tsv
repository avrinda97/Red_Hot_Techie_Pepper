2012-01-24T06:18:00.000Z	pjs		hey all.. I have a fresh install of ubutun 11.0 and by default it's starting the default window manager. How do I disable this? I dont want any WM running at all. Just a root prompt. I thought it was gdm, but there are no init scripts for that
2012-01-24T06:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	add the boot option: text
2012-01-24T06:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	you will be able to log in as your user at CLI and use your OS as usual there
2012-01-24T06:23:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	thanks. Where do I add that?
2012-01-24T06:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	#ubuntu+1
2012-01-24T06:28:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	sorry?
2012-01-24T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	the channel for Precise is #ubuntu+1
2012-01-24T06:31:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	thanks. I'll ask there too. Unless you just wanna tell me the file name? :)
2012-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	file name of what?
2012-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	I assume to edit the boot option so I can add : text to it. I just dont want the WM to run at boot
2012-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2012-01-24T06:35:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	thank you!
2012-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	So just add "text" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" line in /etc/default/grub file?
2012-01-24T06:38:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	or do I just uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL=console ?
2012-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	adding the boot option is the way I know, not sure about GRUB_TERMINAL
2012-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	ok so add it to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT?
2012-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	the line that says:  quiet splash     add the option in the quotes
2012-01-24T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	then save and close the file and run:  sudo update-grub
2012-01-24T06:41:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	thanks again man
2012-01-24T06:47:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	hrmm, I did that and the update-grub call and now it's just hanging at startup after "checking battery state"... grrr
2012-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	So I had to not use "text" but remove "splash" and then do "echo 'manual' > /etc/init/lightdm.override" and that did the job
2012-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pjs	sweet, I'm guessing you ran: sudo -i   first, or the echo command would fail
2012-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	pjs	ActionParsnip	thanks again for the help!
