2004-11-02T11:14:00.000Z	SuperLag		Good evening, folks.
2004-11-02T11:15:00.000Z	SuperLag		The default install of Ubuntu installs a very modular kernel and I get a LOT of module errors when I boot.  How can I clean that up?
2004-11-02T11:15:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	Do you mean, for example, hw_random?
2004-11-02T11:16:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	that, and if I remember it right, pciehp and some others
2004-11-02T11:16:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	... and maybe something about yenta and i823560?
2004-11-02T11:16:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	wait a minute... isn't hw_random just the random number generator?
2004-11-02T11:16:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	yeah, those too
2004-11-02T11:17:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	I thought they might be loaded from modules.conf, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
2004-11-02T11:18:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	I don't know the details, but I've been told that the errors are cosmetic.  Maybe the experts here can clarify.
2004-11-02T11:18:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	You might also find information in bugzilla.
2004-11-02T11:19:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	well, I know the _why_... I just don't know what file lists the modules to be loaded at boot time.  That's the part that would fix it.  just remove/comment the relevant lines.
2004-11-02T11:20:00.000Z	SuperLag		The default install of Ubuntu installs a very modular kernel and I get a LOT of module errors when I boot.  How can I clean that up? hw_random, pciehp, i82365, yenta are some examples... Gentoo will read /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6 for a list of modules to be loaded (assuming you don't have hotplug enabled/installed).... does Ubuntu read a file also?  I'm just wanting to clean that up some.
2004-11-02T11:20:00.000Z	SuperLag		GAH
2004-11-02T11:20:00.000Z	SuperLag		sorry'
2004-11-02T11:21:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	OK, I'll be watching to see what answers you get here. I wouldn't mind cleaning up some of that stuff myself.
2004-11-02T11:29:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	Nothing yet?
2004-11-02T11:31:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	nope
2004-11-02T11:31:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	<fabbione> SuperLag: it makes no difference other than for estetich
2004-11-02T11:33:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	Sure, esthetics... and, for the next six months, questions here and in the mailing list every time a kernelly challenged newb like myself installs Ubuntu :-)
2004-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	SuperLag	WW	kernelly challenged? o.O
2004-11-02T11:35:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	"kernelly challenged" = ignorant
2004-11-02T11:35:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	kernel-wise, anyway
2004-11-02T11:37:00.000Z	WW	SuperLag	I guess Hoary will have a boot splash, and someone like me can remain blissfully ignorant.
