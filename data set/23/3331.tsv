2008-05-11T13:17:00.000Z	MrBogie		hello
2008-05-11T13:18:00.000Z	MrBogie		how can i get gcc standard library?
2008-05-11T13:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	you may need to install build-essential
2008-05-11T13:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	linux doesn't use drive letters like C: or D:
2008-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	okay, thanks for the answer. but for example, i want to access my removable disk. what i'm going to type?
2008-05-11T13:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	you would need to find out where it's mounted.  I think removable disks are usually mounted to /media/disk by default
2008-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i'll try it out. i'm running win xp for now. thanks for now.
2008-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	yes, although you could download it and the packages that it requires onto a disc and load from that
2008-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i have no internet connection at home. is there any links for ubuntu packages?
2008-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i'm just renting a computer here. :D
2008-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	packages.ubuntu.com, but it might be down
2008-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	yeah. is there any other site of which i can download ubuntu packages?
2008-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	that's the only one that I know of, but there may be more
2008-05-11T14:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
2008-05-11T15:25:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	asking in this channel will get pretty much just one response to that question
2008-05-11T15:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	you'll need to download it and all the packages that it needs then install them
2008-05-11T15:45:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i have already dowonloaded it. what other packages it needs?
2008-05-11T15:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	libc6-dev/libc-dev, gcc, g++, make, and dpkg-dev
2008-05-11T15:46:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	thanks
2008-05-11T15:47:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	is that all?
2008-05-11T15:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MrBogie	I think so
2008-05-11T15:47:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i'm going to install it manually
2008-05-11T15:48:00.000Z	MrBogie	Starnestommy	i dont have internet connection at home. thanks for the advice
