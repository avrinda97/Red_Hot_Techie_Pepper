2012-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	Jacruth		My ubuntu doesn't seem to save the monitor configuration (it's resolution).
2012-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	Jacruth		Is there any way to fix it?
2012-11-29T01:03:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	are you using Display to change your prefs?
2012-11-29T01:05:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	what version are you using?
2012-11-29T01:05:00.000Z	Jacruth	twirm	12.10
2012-11-29T01:06:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	you should have a 'Displays' option you can launch from your dash
2012-11-29T01:07:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	backup all of your data and fresh install 12.04 :p
2012-11-29T01:07:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	do you see 'Diplays'?
2012-11-29T01:10:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	nope, what DE is this?
2012-11-29T01:11:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	desktop
2012-11-29T01:11:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	is this LXDE?
2012-11-29T01:12:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	I don't much about LXDE. I can give you some help with XFCE though :)
2012-11-29T01:15:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	gnome 3?
2012-11-29T01:17:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	From my experience XFCE is much more stable. Try install it via xubuntu-desktop
2012-11-29T01:20:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	have you always had this resolution issue, or is it new with 12.10?
2012-11-29T01:21:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	alright. Have you tried changing your resolution under XFCE yet?
2012-11-29T01:22:00.000Z	Jacruth	twirm	Menu -> Coniguration -> Monitor Settings?
2012-11-29T01:23:00.000Z	Jacruth	twirm	changed, but I think It will be wrong if I restart the system.
2012-11-29T01:24:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	can you give it a shot?
2012-11-29T01:24:00.000Z	Jacruth	twirm	now or when I restart it?
2012-11-29T01:25:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	whenever works for you!
2012-11-29T01:26:00.000Z	Jacruth	twirm	this? http://i.imgur.com/mbijT.png
2012-11-29T01:28:00.000Z	twirm	Jacruth	is this after a restart? Does this work for you?
