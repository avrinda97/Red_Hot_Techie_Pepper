2010-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	C-Ray		Hello! Please I need help: here is the description: http://paste.ubuntu.com/437774/ thanks :)
2010-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	Please give at least an overview of your problem *here* (all in one line) - you will get a much greater audience.
2010-05-22T15:20:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	you can add a virtualbox ppa and then install normally with synaptics
2010-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	how to do that?
2010-05-22T15:22:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	see "Debian-based Linux distributions" on http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
2010-05-22T15:25:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: ok I got that.. I went there in the first place and I download the .deb package as normal, installed it normally and then what? I was not able to lanuch virtualbox! and when I type virtualbox in the terminal it was reporting that it is not installed and when I install it from the normal command of the terminal it is getting the 3.08 version which is the version supported by Ubuntu 9.10
2010-05-22T15:26:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	I was talking about adding the repo, then you don't need to download any debs for virtual box any more
2010-05-22T15:28:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	please pastebin the content of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dnjl-virtualization-repository.list
2010-05-22T15:28:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: Sure sir! Thanks just a moment
2010-05-22T15:28:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	but you will have to install 3.2 first
2010-05-22T15:29:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: Roger that Captain!
2010-05-22T15:29:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	^^ was meant as answer for your previous statement
2010-05-22T15:30:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: Yeah I will clean everything and I will install the .deb package... I will paste the list of repository list also
2010-05-22T15:31:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	you shouldn't need the deb package
2010-05-22T15:31:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: Oh ok! I will paste the list then
2010-05-22T15:37:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/437779/
2010-05-22T15:37:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: here is the list, I hope that what you were asking for
2010-05-22T15:41:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	comparing ... it looks as if you are still using the old key for the virtualbox repo, they have a new one since 3.2 (oracle!)
2010-05-22T15:41:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: oh thanks I didn't know that :)
2010-05-22T15:42:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: I should get the new one from the website right?
2010-05-22T15:42:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	yes, after adding the new key you will have to refresh your software database, and then isntalling 3.2 should run smoothly
2010-05-22T15:43:00.000Z	C-Ray	guntbert	: Thanks sir for that! :) I will try that and I will inform you back! Thanks also for your time up there.
2010-05-22T15:43:00.000Z	guntbert	C-Ray	you're welcome :-)
