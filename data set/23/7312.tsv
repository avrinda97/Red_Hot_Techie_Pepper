2007-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	geeksauce		indygunfreak what should i do?
2007-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	geeksauce		indygunfreak is there some kind of key combo i can hold down at bootup that will force CLI?
2007-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel	geeksauce	 you can hit esc when grub is loading , get the grub menu and choose the recovery image
2007-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	wastrel	geeksauce	 do you get a console with ctrl-alt-f1 ?
2007-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	geeksauce	wastrel	hang on.. lemme run try that
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	geeksauce	wastrel	if that works, what should i do to reconfigure x?
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel	geeksauce	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	geeksauce	wastrel	k brb
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel	geeksauce	 if this is a fresh install you might want sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade  first
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel		so as to have the freshest packages.
2007-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel		(it will take a while)

2007-06-14T08:12:00.000Z	geeksauce	wastrel	just that command by itself?
2007-06-14T08:12:00.000Z	wastrel		(it will take a while)
