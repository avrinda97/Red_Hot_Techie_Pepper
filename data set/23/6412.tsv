2007-03-09T06:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	did you resolve that?
2007-03-09T06:55:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	i have not let the dist upgrade itself ;)
2007-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	so far its simply update notifier or whatever the gui thing is called
2007-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	i had a whole bunch of updates this morning and was told i had to upgrade distro. Since then it broke my xchat and i i can't printo anylonger
2007-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	yes, the orange box
2007-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	Artemis3		yes thats what im being suggested too, but i have not accepted
2007-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	why not?
2007-03-09T06:57:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	i don't want to upgrade to feisty just yet...
2007-03-09T06:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	you can still do sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	but its strange that a regular update would trigger that
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	why would it tell us to upgrade to Feisty which is not even released yet?
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	lol, yes, my point exact
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	thats what i mean its strange, and thats what is happening
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	ok, i'm glad i'm not the only one its happened to
2007-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	Artemis3	livingdaylight	this could cause a lot of trouble today
2007-03-09T06:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	it has already over here :(
2007-03-09T06:59:00.000Z	Artemis3		arg pastebin hates me
2007-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	that is what prompted me to get onto xchat, but then i couldn't coz it was broke or something; when i did do distro upgrade thingy whatteverthe exact command was, i also lost printing
2007-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	Artemis3		im holding a dist upgrade as feisty is not even beta
2007-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	Artemis3		but its not right to offer this atm to regular users
2007-03-09T07:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	but why would we be asked to dist-upgrade?
2007-03-09T07:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	i hope this is not another fiasco like we saw with X11 back when
2007-03-09T07:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Artemis3	coz that wasn't funny
