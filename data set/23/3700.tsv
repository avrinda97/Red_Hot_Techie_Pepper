2008-04-06T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	well what client did you install?
2008-04-06T15:26:00.000Z	Bad_boy	IndyGunFreak	 bittorrent was installed with Ubuntu
2008-04-06T15:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	ok, then it should be in the menu, applications/internet
2008-04-06T15:27:00.000Z	Bad_boy	IndyGunFreak	 it is not there, I can it installed with add/remove program though
2008-04-06T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	right click on Applications menu, choose Edit Menu, then go down to Internet, and look and see if you need to put a checkmark next to it.
2008-04-06T15:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		whats that driver for?
2008-04-06T15:30:00.000Z	Bad_boy	IndyGunFreak	 Thanks a lot mate, done now

2008-04-06T15:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	BUT bit torrent isnt a very good torrent client in Linux, at least in my opinion, I'd look at either Transmission, or using Utorrent in Wine
2008-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		never tried rtorrent
2008-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	Bad_boy	IndyGunFreak	thanks for the heads up, i was looking for utorrent for linux, i saw one for wine
2008-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	its easy to install w/ wine
2008-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	Bad_boy	IndyGunFreak	i have never used wine, i am newbie
2008-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bad_boy	are you familiar w/ utorrent?
2008-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		damn, netsplit at 6am?... thats a new one
2008-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		oh ok..
