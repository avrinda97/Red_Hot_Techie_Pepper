2007-10-25T03:33:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	have you ran memtest86+ ?
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	yep, ran the memtest available on 7.10
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	upgrading ubuntu physically can't damage your ram (unless I'm missing something.. heat is the only possiblity but I highly doubt that)
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	let it run overnight and it passed 10 times our of 10
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	did it pass
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	not ram then
2007-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	my computer normally does not reach above 72F central
2007-10-25T03:35:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	evidently it is, because my computer has not froze yet, and it should have by now..
2007-10-25T03:35:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	i have integrated gfx, and im thinking something dedicated to the gfx (one of the sectors) got messed up somewhere along the line, and that is what was causing everything to freeze up
2007-10-25T03:35:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	perhaps i jumped in late here and don't know the full problem, .. do you think you have a ram problem, if so, why?
2007-10-25T03:36:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	i have integrated nVidia GeFroce 6100 and nForce 405
2007-10-25T03:36:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	and since the upgrade everything went belly-up?
2007-10-25T03:36:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	now i do yes, because the system would lock up (on 6.06, 7.04 32 bit, 7.10 32 bit, and 7.10 64 bit) live CDs (OS - 7.10 64 bit) and when it would lock up, it would display random pixelated colors around the screen
2007-10-25T03:37:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	yeah, after upgrade failed, everything went belly up, but so far so good with this other RAM (which initially came with the computer)
2007-10-25T03:37:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	sounds graphics card related to me for sure
2007-10-25T03:38:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	graphics are chipsets, and share the RAM, so :P
2007-10-25T03:38:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	integrated yes (as is yours)
2007-10-25T03:38:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	my 6100 chipset has 256MB mem it needs, my computer can only use 1784
2007-10-25T03:38:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	thats why i said i think the upgrade messed up one of the sectors the graphics chip was using
2007-10-25T03:39:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	and now that i have new RAM in here, HA I LEFT, IM MAGIC O.O, it is just fine, :P
2007-10-25T03:39:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	got ya
2007-10-25T03:40:00.000Z	danny3794	bobfany	well, i gotta go put my sisters computer back together, and i gotta restart to install the nvidia drivers, thanks Steve^ and bobfany :)
2007-10-25T03:40:00.000Z	bobfany	danny3794	in a bit
