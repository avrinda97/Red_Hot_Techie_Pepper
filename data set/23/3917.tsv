2008-01-09T01:23:00.000Z	Safiyyah		hi all. i burnt myubuntu  CD as a data disk + it doesnt load at start up
2008-01-09T01:23:00.000Z	Safiyyah		now wot?
2008-01-09T01:25:00.000Z	Safiyyah		gosh is any
2008-01-09T01:25:00.000Z	Safiyyah		any1 2 help me
2008-01-09T01:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	you have to burn it as an iso, that's a coaster you have (except maybe for reference)
2008-01-09T01:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	and that's the problem. if you mount it in windows and see only one file, the iso, then you burned it wrong and must burn as an iso. infrarecorder is a free windows burner that will do the job
2008-01-09T01:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	I've already given you the fix
2008-01-09T01:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	if you mount it in windows and see only one file, the iso, then you burned it wrong and must burn as an iso. infrarecorder is a free windows burner that will do the job
2008-01-09T01:50:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	it actually looks more like a zip file.. which when unzipped I get all the other files and see them. So are u saying that i need to unzip first and then burn? (I am downloading the infrarecorder)
2008-01-09T01:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	no, you need to make a bootable cd. don't unzip anything (you should have a file ending in iso) and use infrarecorder to create a bootable cd
2008-01-09T01:53:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	I did that bootable CD thing using nero + got same thing, will see what infrarecorder says... is this the same for the DVD?
2008-01-09T01:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	yes it would be
2008-01-09T02:00:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	 I am gonna do the DVD now... ran out of 700MB disks, will try again in a few hours when I restock only have 650MB disks now
2008-01-09T02:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	ok, see you
2008-01-09T02:02:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	time to shoot windows..... the infrared wont work. I have been having trouble with installations it keeps telling me exe files are corrupted or commited illegal actions NOT just for this
2008-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	downloading image burn
2008-01-09T02:16:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	_moro_bana_ you can find out more about ips and cloaking them by asking in #freenode
2008-01-09T02:16:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	 thanx
2008-01-09T02:23:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	just letting you know my DVD works, thanx 4 ur help
2008-01-09T02:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	, bahman you are welcome :)
2008-01-09T02:27:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	once i get accustomed to linux, is there a way to get rid of the windows partition without reinstalling linux?
2008-01-09T02:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Safiyyah	sure, just reformat it and make it an ext3 partition. Mount it as, say, /data
2008-01-09T02:29:00.000Z	Safiyyah	nickrud	DWSR2 thanx. i am on an eradicatin-windows-from-my-pc mission :)
