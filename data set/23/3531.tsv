2008-03-27T11:35:00.000Z	Abagael	bod_	I still didn't understand how to disable themes. In windows you could just pick the classic theme and all fancy stuff would go.
2008-03-27T11:36:00.000Z	bod_	Abagael	if you disable themes the all colour will go you can remove desktop affects in the apperance window customize tab i think its called
2008-03-27T11:38:00.000Z	bod_	Abagael	System--Preferences-->Appearence-->'Visual effects' tab to disable desktop effects and 'Theme' tab for changing theme
2008-03-27T11:39:00.000Z	Abagael	bod_	I don't have that in KDE :(
2008-03-27T11:39:00.000Z	bod_	Abagael	oh dman yeah,.,. erm,. i dont know much about kde,. someone here might and someone in #kubuntu will know
