2010-03-04T23:13:00.000Z	solow	ActionParsnip	/care. It's not for usage, it's for testing. So to me, it's pretty much like downloading a demo for 30 days, nobody cared.
2010-03-04T23:14:00.000Z	solow	ActionParsnip	Yes it does. It's a demo. Demo's are legal. Not everything downloaded with torrents is illegal.
2010-03-04T23:14:00.000Z	solow	ActionParsnip	as soon as i use it, or crack it, it's illegal. as long as i use the 30 day trial, it's not.
