2008-02-18T07:47:00.000Z	fevel		<_Oz_> I love Ubuntu and Linux.  It's one of the areas that are really hard for open-source companies to close the gap in.  Adobe has such a huge lead, and they have a huge staff working on the product.  It's a tough task for Linux to try to compete in that department.
2008-02-18T07:47:00.000Z	fevel		I dont see their lead
2008-02-18T07:47:00.000Z	fevel		oh
