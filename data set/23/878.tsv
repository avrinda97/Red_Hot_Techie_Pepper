2011-02-18T02:25:00.000Z	maco	induz_	homebank is not for taxes
2011-02-18T02:26:00.000Z	maco	induz_	homebank is for keeping track of spending
2011-02-18T02:26:00.000Z	maco	induz_	tax software needs to be rewritten/updated each year to keep up with new tax laws so AFAIK is only available proprietary.  for linux users, ths means we use the online versions instead of desktop versions to file taxes
2011-02-18T02:27:00.000Z	maco	induz_	there is no desktop software for linux to do taxes aside from the calculator app
2011-02-18T02:27:00.000Z	induz_	maco	online version asks for $$
2011-02-18T02:27:00.000Z	maco	induz_	i didnt pay to file online last year or the year before
2011-02-18T02:28:00.000Z	maco	induz_	when you go to irs.gov it should give you list of about 20 online filing services, including like h&r block's online thing
2011-02-18T02:29:00.000Z	induz_	maco	ok I have to check that
2011-02-18T02:29:00.000Z	induz_	maco	 so its possible online but not through Ubuntu or openoffice
2011-02-18T02:29:00.000Z	maco	induz_	right
2011-02-18T02:29:00.000Z	maco	induz_	i mean, you can use ubuntu to get online to do it... :P
2011-02-18T02:30:00.000Z	maco	induz_	but not desktop apps

2011-02-18T02:30:00.000Z	induz_	maco	online i dont know caz i have to give them my ssn etc number
2011-02-18T02:32:00.000Z	maco	induz_	homebank does not do taxes. it lets you categorise what spending was restaurants, gifts, utilities, etc. and then you can use that info to help budget. thats all its for
2011-02-18T02:36:00.000Z	induz_	maco	ubuntu maual is hard as there are not many pictures to understand
