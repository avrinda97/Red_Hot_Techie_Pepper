2006-09-27T07:22:00.000Z	Berto		good stuff BlueEagle....
2006-09-27T07:22:00.000Z	Berto		so has anyone here setup bcm43xx wireless driver by any chance?
2006-09-27T07:22:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	i have
2006-09-27T07:23:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	with 43xx or with ndiswrapper?
2006-09-27T07:23:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	yeah, i'm working with ndiswrapper too..  the ubuntu help page about obtaining firmware and such with bcm43xx-fwcutter totally lost me
2006-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	need any help?
2006-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	 make sure you blacklist and rmmod the bcm43xx driver
2006-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	well compiling ndiswrapper i'm having problems with modpost:  /bin/sh: scripts/mod/modpost: No such file or directory
2006-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	blacklist?  i've never done that, how do you blacklist a module?
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	no need to compile, just install ndiswrapper-utils from the repos
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	ndiswrapper-utils is WAY old!  its like 10 versions out of date for me... what does apt-cache show that you have
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	to blacklist, add "blacklist bcm43xx" to the end of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2006-09-27T07:28:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	yep, already did it.    Question -- should i have /usr/src/linux-source   or just /usr/src/linux-headers ?  I figure i need more than just headers!
2006-09-27T07:29:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	the version of the utils in the repos for me is 1.8-0ubuntu2
2006-09-27T07:30:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	yeah, ndiswrapper 1.23 is out...  and the repos one didn't work for me
2006-09-27T07:30:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	how didnt they work?
2006-09-27T07:32:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	when i'd modprobe ndiswrapper i'd get an error...   can't find that error now tho
2006-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	looks like i got it to compile, i had a mismatched linux-headers i believe.... oops!  thanks for the help
2006-09-27T07:37:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	cool
2006-09-27T07:39:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	that's right!!  the wifi light is on in my laptop now!
2006-09-27T07:43:00.000Z	briguyd	Berto	get it working?
2006-09-27T07:43:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	yeah, now i gotta hook up my garbage access point.  If it doesn't reach my courtyard, then I shall be buying one of those routers that you acn load linux on and pump up the signal a bit
2006-09-27T07:44:00.000Z	Berto	briguyd	thanks a lot.  i'm sure i'll have more questions on the transition (longtime mandrake/mandriva user).. very impressed with ubuntu besides a few issues
