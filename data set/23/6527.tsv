2006-08-31T15:35:00.000Z	tjb		How do I change my trackpad sensitivity in an Ubuntu Live CD?  Using System -> Preferences -> Mouse doesn't work.
2006-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	tjb		Anyone using Ubuntu on a laptop?
2006-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	me
2006-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	How do you change the sensitivity?
2006-08-31T15:37:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	one sec
2006-08-31T15:38:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	i'm looking through that
2006-08-31T15:38:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Thanks.
2006-08-31T15:40:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	system -> preferences -> mouse -> motion tab and try tinkering with all sliders?
2006-08-31T15:40:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Yeah, I've tried that, but it seems to make no difference (or perhaps very little difference).
2006-08-31T15:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	probably cause you're on the live cd
2006-08-31T15:41:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Ah.
2006-08-31T15:42:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	things get to go real slow on the live cd and some variables may not adjust immediately. or ever :\
2006-08-31T15:42:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Acknowledged.
2006-08-31T15:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	maybe keyboard issues? could be that the live cd detected a wrong keyboard
2006-08-31T15:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	the ubuntu desktop on thoust hard disketh itself will bloweth thou away
2006-08-31T15:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	how are you able to put the slashes here on IRC though?!
2006-08-31T15:45:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	I mean ubuntu installed on a hard disk
2006-08-31T15:45:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Yeah.  It probably would blow me away.
2006-08-31T15:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	aaah
2006-08-31T16:20:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	they look perfect on my laptop straight away
2006-08-31T16:20:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Were you able to make them look better?
2006-08-31T16:20:00.000Z	tjb	DJAdmiral	Oh, scratch that.  Thought you said 'imperfect'.
2006-08-31T16:20:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	tjb	i didn't need to. They weren't blurry at all
