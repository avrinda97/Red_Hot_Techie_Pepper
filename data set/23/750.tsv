2011-02-28T05:58:00.000Z	pessoptimistic		so how come I get this http://twitpic.com/44iamp when I attempt to install 10.10? I do have a lable called "/" but that's not a mount point.  So how do I create a "/" mount point?
2011-02-28T05:59:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	it's not the label you wanna change
2011-02-28T06:00:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	I know but where do I get to add the mount point?
2011-02-28T06:01:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	yes there should be, but don't know why there aren't!
2011-02-28T06:02:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	look at the gparted window.  there is clearly a linux partition
2011-02-28T06:02:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	is the mounted question for me?
2011-02-28T06:18:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	don't use gparted at the same time? just use the installer, will you only be installing ubuntu?
2011-02-28T06:19:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	 I only went to gparted when nothing appeared in the Installed
2011-02-28T06:19:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	 I only went to gparted when nothing appeared in the Installer
2011-02-28T06:19:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	will you only be installing ubuntu?
2011-02-28T06:19:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	no, I have windows on other partition
2011-02-28T06:20:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	have you tried selecting "install side by side"?
2011-02-28T06:20:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	what options did you get?
2011-02-28T06:22:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	 I double click on the "Install Ubuntu 10.10" icon and i get a welcome screen to select English, which I do, then I click on "Forward" then I get "Preparing to install Ubuntu" all green checkmarks, i click on "Forwrard" and I get "Allocate Drive Space"
2011-02-28T06:23:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	 no partitions are to be found in the allocate space. Look at http://twitpic.com/44iamp
2011-02-28T06:25:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	change the option elected in the drop down menu, tell me what you can see?
2011-02-28T06:25:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	look at http://twitpic.com/44juvp
2011-02-28T06:26:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	okso what about the drop down as mentioned in your first image dump
2011-02-28T06:26:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	/dev/sda is only thing in the drop down in the "Allocate drive space"
2011-02-28T06:27:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	close gparted
2011-02-28T06:28:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	device is not mounted, gparted is closed.
2011-02-28T06:29:00.000Z	mickster04	pessoptimistic	did you do an md5sum on the ISO?
2011-02-28T06:29:00.000Z	pessoptimistic	mickster04	still nothing!
