The Gdm login text is as big as the window titles. Do you know how to change the this font size? Help please, I have half screen with the titles and need to fix this if want to use this machine.
2007-11-21T00:31:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	System, Preferences, Appearances, Fonts
2007-11-21T00:32:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	really? Hops!
2007-11-21T00:34:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	i have Ubuntu in another language and cannot find that option. Is it really called Fonts? I have that option missing... Don't know, oh...
2007-11-21T00:35:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	Are you using gutsy?
2007-11-21T00:35:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	Ubuntu 7.10. If you tell me how the icon looks like?
2007-11-21T00:36:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	Go to the Appearance applet in the Preferences menu (It's a blue square icon). The third of the five tabs that come up should be the fonts tab.
2007-11-21T00:37:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	now I see... Everything is set to 10. But it isn't the window title font size
2007-11-21T00:39:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	it is actually the window title font size, but it doesn't take any effect. I still see everithing huge. I have compiz, emerald.
2007-11-21T00:40:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	What is your screen resolution (under system, preferences, screen resolution)
2007-11-21T00:40:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	1280x1024
2007-11-21T00:41:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	sorry. This laptop is 1280x 800.
2007-11-21T00:42:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	In the Fonts dialog still there is a button marked Details. Click that and tell me what the resolution is in there (should be in dots per inch)
2007-11-21T00:42:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	ok. one min.
2007-11-21T00:44:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	it says 96 points
2007-11-21T00:44:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	That's what mine is at too and its fine. You can try change that to 72 and see if you like it better, but on my computer that's far too small.
2007-11-21T00:45:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	I'll try and see.
2007-11-21T00:46:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	Well, it changes text size, wich is great, but the window titles are still huge. Any suggestions?
2007-11-21T00:47:00.000Z	bradv	_hopex	No sorry. Try a different theme I guess.
2007-11-21T00:49:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	changing the themes doesn't work it out, still huge window tittles. blkorpheus told me to install startupmanager, it didn't fix my problem and now I have another one. Well done blkorpheus .
2007-11-21T00:49:00.000Z	_hopex	bradv	thanx for your help
