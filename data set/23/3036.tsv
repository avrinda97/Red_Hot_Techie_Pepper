2008-10-03T13:08:00.000Z	xiaopi		Yeah that's the closest thing you'll have
2008-10-03T13:09:00.000Z	xiaopi		cs3 had some issues, but cs2 always worked fine
2008-10-03T13:09:00.000Z	xiaopi		(exept some plugins that jus crashed :)
2008-10-03T13:10:00.000Z	xiaopi		Dual boot is when you install linux and windows at the same taime
2008-10-03T13:12:00.000Z	xiaopi		Well use windows and run ubuntu in a full screen virtual machine
2008-10-03T13:12:00.000Z	xiaopi		If you computer is powerfull enough (chances are if you run 3ds)
2008-10-03T13:13:00.000Z	xiaopi		And SUN clearly isn't focusing on 3d now :
2008-10-03T13:14:00.000Z	xiaopi		1 or 2 year (you just had to manually edit the config file of the vm)
2008-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	xiaopi		with last workstation 6.5, it supports up to dx9 and shaders2
2008-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	xiaopi		yes it does..
2008-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	xiaopi	nice , I did not know tat
2008-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c		yeah I was using vmware-player
2008-10-03T13:16:00.000Z	xiaopi		vmware-player alone does too from last year option just isn't in the GUI :)
2008-10-03T13:17:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	xiaopi	are you also running a 64 bit system?
2008-10-03T13:17:00.000Z	xiaopi		we won't have correct gpu virtualisation until GPU manufacturer dev a chip for it (like vt-x)
2008-10-03T13:17:00.000Z	xiaopi		Yes i do
2008-10-03T13:18:00.000Z	xiaopi		But using Windows and running a few app and using 3ds which is a memory eater monster and use heavy 3d rendering
2008-10-03T13:18:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	xiaopi	my windows xp pro seems to run faster using vmware, am I seeing things or ? :)
2008-10-03T13:18:00.000Z	xiaopi	C0p3rn1c	try running a direct3d application then :)
2008-10-03T13:19:00.000Z	xiaopi		povray is Sweet/Slow =D
2008-10-03T13:19:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	xiaopi	I don't need 3d, I'm a web programmer and I don't play or design games
2008-10-03T13:20:00.000Z	xiaopi	C0p3rn1c	so it's totaly different from this kind of software
2008-10-03T13:21:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	xiaopi	I can imagen that
