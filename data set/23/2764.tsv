2010-05-05T06:02:00.000Z	martianixor		guys if the gvfsd-metadata prolonged 100% CPU usage is still present after upgrading to 10.04, that would be me or it's still an issue?
2010-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	check what you have starting on startup
2010-05-05T06:04:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	anything specific to look for?
2010-05-05T06:04:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	and thanks for the reply by the way :-)
2010-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		I had the same issue and it was a laptop app and it was on my desktop
2010-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	it ran 1 core up to 100%
2010-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	I am supposing there might be something using it on startup that shouldnt be
2010-05-05T06:06:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	well, it kept switching between the cores 100% each for some period of time then somehow stop, I remember reading that it was an issue with the number of files within a certain directory
2010-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	So I simply moved the rubbish from the Desktop to a subdir, gvfsd-metadata started to behave and be nice to the cores
2010-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	I am not sure about that but I had the same issue however it was another app using it on start up and I couldnt kill it so I had to install boot manager and kill the apps until I found it
2010-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	aha then my advice might be useless =/
2010-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	but still whenever I try to move something files around CPU usage rises
2010-05-05T06:08:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	did you try the forum?
2010-05-05T06:08:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	for sure, my guess was that the forum was where I found the number of files note
2010-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	sounds like we had different issues sorry I couldnt help...
2010-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	actually I'll check startup as well ...
2010-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		ok
2010-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	No on the contrary thanks for replying :-)
2010-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	I used boot manager so I could kill them at the time I removed them so I could watch the cpu
2010-05-05T06:10:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	martianixor	I wish you luck
2010-05-05T06:12:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	with 9.10 I tried to replace Nautilus with pcmanfm it was very light weight, that was when I could kill nautilus now I'm unable to even kill nautilus and gvfsd-metadata, that got me interested to figure out why is that behaviour is present in the first place
2010-05-05T06:13:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	but anyway ... :-) good luck for you too
2010-05-05T06:14:00.000Z	martianixor	U-b-u-n-t-u	Oh do you think it might be "user folders update"?
