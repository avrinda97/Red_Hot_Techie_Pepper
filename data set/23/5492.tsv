2007-03-19T05:36:00.000Z	g1gaman		how can i check system information just with one command or click in ubuntu. mostly i need to know amount of ram and cpu clock rate, but if i get ubuntu and linux kernel version and usage of harddisks it would be great
2007-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	there are some hardware info applications in repos.. I haven't tried them all but some are console based.. some bash magic on top of that should get you what you want
2007-03-19T05:38:00.000Z	Slart		!dconf
2007-03-19T05:39:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	should i install dconf?
2007-03-19T05:39:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	that's just one I found while browsing the synaptic list... try it .. see what it give you
2007-03-19T05:40:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	there is no offlline way to check system info out?
2007-03-19T05:40:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	hardinfo is another application.. it's not console base..
2007-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	ah.. without installing extra stuff?
2007-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	exactly
2007-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	uname -a will give you some info on kernel version..
2007-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	df -hl will give you free space on local harddrives
2007-03-19T05:42:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	what else.. memory? "free" will tell you about memory...
2007-03-19T05:42:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	cpu name and rate?
2007-03-19T05:42:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	hmm.. I think there is a cpuinfo application.. don't know if it's installed by default
2007-03-19T05:43:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	nope.. it isn't... you can probably get it from the /dev tree in some way.. perhaps some guru knows how =)
2007-03-19T05:44:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	oops.. the /proc tree
2007-03-19T05:44:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	well thank you. i've wrote it all an i'll learn it by heart. once again about memory and free stuff, please..
2007-03-19T05:45:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	just type "free" and you'll get some short info about memory.. there are some weirdness to the way free reports memory.. read the manual.. something about buffers and such
2007-03-19T05:45:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	i might ask it google, but due my poior english results mostly arent usable
2007-03-19T05:45:00.000Z	g1gaman		poor
2007-03-19T05:46:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	free -k will get you memory in kilobytes.. swap and regular
2007-03-19T05:47:00.000Z	g1gaman	Slart	k stands for kilobytes
2007-03-19T05:48:00.000Z	Slart	g1gaman	yes.. perhaps -m is a better choice if you just want some quick info
