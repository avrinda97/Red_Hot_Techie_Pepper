2010-12-19T04:42:00.000Z	vex_		I'm having trouble running programs that require use of a graphics card. When I was running Windows (Before I installed Ubuntu) they worked just fine. If anyone can help me, please just PM me on here.

2010-12-19T04:45:00.000Z	vex_		I have friend  who was trying to help me install them, but he failed to help me...

2010-12-19T04:47:00.000Z	vex_		LOL, looking for "Hardware controllers"... Can't find it. :/ I'm trying not to make this harder then it probably is...
2010-12-19T04:50:00.000Z	vex_		Cousteau, is there an alternate was for me to find "Hardware controllers"? Sorry, I'm new to Linux and Unix-Like OS's...
2010-12-19T04:51:00.000Z	cousteau	vex_	not sure of its name, maybe it was "Hardware drivers"
2010-12-19T04:51:00.000Z	cousteau	vex_	what graphics card do you have?
2010-12-19T04:52:00.000Z	vex_		ATI radeon xpress 200

2010-12-19T04:52:00.000Z	vex_		I'm trying to run Project 64 or Nemu 64...
2010-12-19T04:55:00.000Z	cousteau	vex_	is that video card old? looks like it isn't supported by ATI anymore: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Maverick_Installation_Guide#Installing_Proprietary_Drivers_a.k.a._Catalyst.2Ffglrx

2010-12-19T04:58:00.000Z	vex_		So, Christmas is comming soon... cousteau, I need a newer cheep graphics card. What do you recomend?
2010-12-19T04:59:00.000Z	cousteau	vex_	I'm not much into graphics cards, don't know which ones are better, I think the ATI ones, but I'm not sure
2010-12-19T05:00:00.000Z	vex_		Okay.
2010-12-19T05:00:00.000Z	vex_		Well, thanks for the help cousteau.

2010-12-19T05:00:00.000Z	cousteau	vex_	anyway, the open source driver for your card should work ok,,, what do you get when you run   glxinfo | grep render   on a terminal?
