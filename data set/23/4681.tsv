2007-06-06T11:36:00.000Z	Pale_folklore		anyone know if audacious works with iPod?
2007-06-06T11:38:00.000Z	Pale_folklore		I would like to dl audacious, but would also like something that works w/iPod - suggestions?
2007-06-06T11:38:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	i prefer GTKpod and amaroK.
2007-06-06T11:39:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	I don't see amaroK in the sound packages for Feisty
2007-06-06T11:40:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	not sure why.  make sure you have all the repositories enabled.  if you want it, sudo aptitude install amarok.
2007-06-06T11:40:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	how do I make sure all repositories are enabled?
2007-06-06T11:41:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	blah.  i thought that'd be instructions.
2007-06-06T11:43:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	in a terminal, type: cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep universe
2007-06-06T11:43:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	understand?
2007-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	preceded by sudo?
2007-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	no.  only files in /root need sudo to be able to cat, AFAIK.
2007-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	ok
2007-06-06T11:45:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	so once that command is executed, I can go back to the ubuntu packages website and amarok should be there
2007-06-06T11:46:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	did you get some lines that weren't preceded by # when you executed that command?
2007-06-06T11:46:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	haven't done it yet - ubuntu is on my lap top in the other room, was just writing it down
2007-06-06T11:48:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	when you execute that, you should see some lines that don't have # in front of them.  if all of them do, you need to edit sources.list ('sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list') and delete the #.  you don't really need the backport repo's, but you can if you want them.  :)
2007-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	thx :)
2007-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	no problem.
2007-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	btw, why do you have both amaroK and GTKPod?
2007-06-06T11:51:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	well, I started with GTKpod because amaroK acted funny on me at first.  I mainly use amaroK, but I keep GTKpod around, because it's more "raw".  GTKpod is a little simpler to use, for me.
2007-06-06T11:51:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	so maybe a good option for me would be audacious + GTKPod ?
2007-06-06T11:53:00.000Z	teamwork	Pale_folklore	well i can't speak to audacious, b/c I've never used it.  but GTKpod will definitely do the trick.  just be sure you know where your iPod is mounted (usually /media/IPOD).  sometimes GTKpod will say something like "if you're sure it's mounted on /media/IPOD, then click here to do it anyway", GTKpod not always recognizing on it's own that there's an iPod there.  Might not be the case for you though.
2007-06-06T11:54:00.000Z	Pale_folklore	teamwork	thx :)
