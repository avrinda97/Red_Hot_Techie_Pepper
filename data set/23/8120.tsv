2005-12-20T06:13:00.000Z	techrush		so ive got ubuntu all set up but now i dont know what to do with it
2005-12-20T06:13:00.000Z	techrush		what should i do
2005-12-20T06:14:00.000Z	techrush		i normally use ableton live and cool edit pro
2005-12-20T06:15:00.000Z	techrush		sequence music
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	mz2	techrush	you won't find anything like ableton in linux, i'm afraid. rosegarden and ardour are the best audio enthusiast/pro level software really
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	techrush		ok
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	techrush		nothing like ableton in linux :(
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	mz2		muse's pretty good as well in features, but it's very much unfinished and useless in usability
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	techrush		i geuss ubuntu will just be my porn os
2005-12-20T06:16:00.000Z	techrush		lol
2005-12-20T06:17:00.000Z	mz2	techrush	although the whole jackd based architechture in the proper linux audio apps is pretty nice. extremely low latencies and free routing of inputs and outputs, a bit like what you get done between different proprietary applications in mac and windows as well
2005-12-20T06:18:00.000Z	mz2		only that they only need to support jackd, not a zillion different of these proprietary routing standards :)
2005-12-20T06:18:00.000Z	techrush		lol @ me learning to code
2005-12-20T06:18:00.000Z	techrush		:)
2005-12-20T06:19:00.000Z	techrush	Squee-D	did
2005-12-20T06:19:00.000Z	techrush		i looked at ardour but it only records
2005-12-20T06:19:00.000Z	techrush		no sequencer
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	techrush		(not yet)
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	mz2	techrush	yes, no midi sequencing
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	mz2	techrush	although it does support automation through midi, even control surfaces
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	techrush		ok
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	techrush		thanks guys
2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	mz2	techrush	rosegarden is a reasonably good sequencer
