2010-09-08T23:52:00.000Z	UberStudenter		in ubuntu or its variations the steps are the same.. "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get install filename" but instead of me downloading the software everytime ..  i was wondering if i could save on a media and re-use it
2010-09-08T23:53:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	yes, you can "sudo dpkg -i filename" where the filename is something that ends in .deb and is in the same directory
2010-09-08T23:53:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	with apt-get you're actually giving the package name, not the filename
2010-09-08T23:53:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	the filename will be longer, like packagename-1ubuntu3_amd64.deb
2010-09-08T23:54:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	yes you are right.. i meant the package name
2010-09-08T23:54:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	you can also use AptOnCD to create a CD which you can add as a repository and use apt-get with
2010-09-08T23:54:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	but in a live environment how will i swap the cds
2010-09-08T23:55:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	boot with the "toram" option
2010-09-08T23:55:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	then you can remove the live cd from which you booted
2010-09-08T23:55:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	alternatively, use a live-usb instead of live-cd
2010-09-08T23:55:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	hit a key when it asks whether you want to install or run ubuntu, and there should be a way to set boot options. type in "toram"
2010-09-08T23:57:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	ok when i boot from teh live cd i get a menu .. what exactly am i doing at this menu?
2010-09-08T23:57:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	is this one of the older livecds that lists like 6 things you can do or the new one that has an actual graphical window?
2010-09-09T00:00:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	ubuntu 10.04 has a graphical window... though kubuntu doesnt (yet)
2010-09-09T00:02:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	but you can reuse USBs ;-) CDs you have to throw away when a new one comes out
2010-09-09T00:02:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	anyway, ok hit F6 to get to the boot options
2010-09-09T00:04:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	yep
2010-09-09T00:05:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	ok.. sooo.. i should download the driver/firmware and save it somewhere.. right?
2010-09-09T00:05:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	sure
2010-09-09T00:06:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	so what do you sugget i save on this cd
2010-09-09T00:06:00.000Z	maco	UberStudenter	whatever you want?
2010-09-09T00:17:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	so what are my steps to make my experience more stream lines
2010-09-09T01:17:00.000Z	UberStudenter	maco	you there?
