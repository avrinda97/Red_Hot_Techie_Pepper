2005-11-05T16:07:00.000Z	marsh		hi gentlemen (and ladies; of course)
2005-11-05T16:07:00.000Z	marsh		I'm after finding out if it's just me, or whether anyone else has the same problem with musicplayers...
2005-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	marsh		does anyone have problems with Rhythmbox not finding all of there mp3s?
2005-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	who is owner of those mp3, what r the permissions on them...
2005-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	they're all mine, and they're all 777 at the moment...
2005-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	's bin like that for a while though - and was like it with redhat too :|
2005-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	can u play those which r not found?
2005-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	yeah, I can - sometimes...
2005-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	no error messages, just non aknowledgement of them
2005-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	when u click on them, you either can or cannot..
2005-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	rhythmbox doesn't aknowledge their existence
2005-11-05T16:12:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	forget rythm, go to the folder where they r and play them, does that work
2005-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	I can play them all in JUK
2005-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	stick with juk then
2005-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	it hangs... A Lot
2005-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	try xmms
2005-11-05T16:14:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	Mmm... the question was if it's normal to suffer these probs... reason being that with 15000+ tracks the database players are massively helpful in finding/viewing tracks/music
2005-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	well i doubt that u own legally 15000+tracks, so i don't really care, sry
2005-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	marsh	bluefrog-10	was only a question :P
2005-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	no problem
2005-11-05T16:18:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	so far yes
2005-11-05T16:18:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	GPL or bought for
2005-11-05T16:19:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	marsh	i have around 5000 songs coming from my cd's, cost me around 10 grands over the years...
