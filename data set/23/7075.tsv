2005-10-20T10:03:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	what happens not in failsafe ?
2005-10-20T10:03:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	sorry i was fg before
2005-10-20T10:03:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	X works only in failsafe terminal, otherwise "caught signal 11"
2005-10-20T10:03:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	using the fglrx and the kernel you told me to use
2005-10-20T10:04:00.000Z	sn9	klvnn	you had the athlon? you're making progress. signall 11 is much better news
2005-10-20T10:04:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	pentium 4 HT
2005-10-20T10:05:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	good to hear it's good news :)
2005-10-20T10:05:00.000Z	sn9	klvnn	you were having signal 4 before?
2005-10-20T10:05:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	yes
2005-10-20T10:05:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	signal 4 before, signal 11 now
2005-10-20T10:06:00.000Z	sn9	klvnn	signal 11 is often a sign of bad ram
2005-10-20T10:06:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	i don't get that with hoary and xp works perfectly
2005-10-20T10:06:00.000Z	sn9	klvnn	linux is more picky about ram
2005-10-20T10:07:00.000Z	klvnn	sn9	ok how do i find out ? memtest86 ?
