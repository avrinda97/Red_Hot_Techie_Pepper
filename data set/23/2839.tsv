2008-11-21T19:00:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	ok thank u
2008-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	it is not working
2008-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	what's it say? your code probably has bugs in it.
2008-11-21T19:02:00.000Z	chrisinajar		127 :|
2008-11-21T19:02:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	give me step by step guide i am new to linux and very new to programming
2008-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	what should be file name extension
2008-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	step 1: open kdevelop, step 2: open a project, or start a new one, step 3: write your code (there are awesome tutorials out there to teach you basic syntax), step 4: compile (F8) step 5: Run the program
2008-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	there aren't filename extentions for binaries in linux.
2008-11-21T19:04:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	it'll be like... /path/to/your/project/bin/projectname
2008-11-21T19:05:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	if you're used to windows, nothing will make sense at first... then you'll have more and more "aha!" moments, seeing how logical everything in linux is... eventually you realize how much windows totally doesn't make any sense at all :-P
2008-11-21T19:05:00.000Z	chrisinajar		That's generally the learning curve...
2008-11-21T19:07:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	i write and saved the program and press f8 to compile it but nothing happens
2008-11-21T19:08:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	once it's compiled, if there were no errors, then there is now a binary in the folder you're working out of...
2008-11-21T19:08:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	run that
2008-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	i press shift+f9 and nothing happened again
2008-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	chrisinajar	kanhiya78	then you're code doesn't work, there are some awesome online tutorials on how to program, check them out.
2008-11-21T19:10:00.000Z	kanhiya78	chrisinajar	are you able to give me a link please
