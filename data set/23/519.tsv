2012-03-04T02:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	Siegel-	reask in #ubuntu+1
2012-03-04T02:55:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	i read what you had to say. i didnt know about how the beta versions are for reporting errors. how do i know when a "real" version is out? what is it called then/
2012-03-04T02:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	Siegel-	-devel will disappear
2012-03-04T02:56:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	where does it say -devel?
2012-03-04T02:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	Siegel-	check "lsb_release -a"
2012-03-04T02:57:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	ok but when its "advertised" i guess it wont be called the beta version anymore, right? would you suggest to go back to two versions ago? 10.04 or what it was called? narwhal?
2012-03-04T02:57:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	because that was a "Real" version? everything worked on it. all my plugins.
2012-03-04T02:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	Siegel-	it's the development version right now, see "/msg ubottu final"
2012-03-04T02:59:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	i see. interesting. so you suggest keeping to the official releases and not upgrading to beta versions?
2012-03-04T03:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	Siegel-	don't use beta unless you feel like fighting/reporting bugs - that's it's only purpose
2012-03-04T03:00:00.000Z	Siegel-	zykotick9	im not able to fight/report bugs so ill stick to the official ones
