2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	GammaRay	dnlien	the menus?
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	dnlien		yes
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	dnlien		I can not interact with them
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	GammaRay		I'm not sure what that mean.. you don't get the appsa
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	GammaRay		I'm not sure what that mean.. you can't access the apps menu?
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	dnlien		no, I get the visual representation
2005-03-05T17:23:00.000Z	dnlien		I see the menus, but the frame does not support interaction with, for example, a file menu
2005-03-05T17:24:00.000Z	GammaRay	dnlien	which apps?
2005-03-05T17:24:00.000Z	dnlien		well, I am using a rarely used app known as PVS, it's a verification software
2005-03-05T17:24:00.000Z	dnlien		I am remoting into a linux cluster
2005-03-05T17:25:00.000Z	dnlien		and, i can not seem to interact with xterm support for menus that the software offers
2005-03-05T17:25:00.000Z	dnlien		and, JDahl was kind enough to suggest that it might be a configuration change required for security
2005-03-05T17:26:00.000Z	dnlien		but, was not aware of what to change and where
2005-03-05T17:26:00.000Z	GammaRay	dnlien	so this is a curses app.. and you are trying w/ the mouse?
2005-03-05T17:27:00.000Z	dnlien		yes, just as JDahl suggested, I need to export x11 gfx via ssh using a public key
2005-03-05T17:28:00.000Z	dnlien		and yes, GammaRay, the cursir aoos
2005-03-05T17:28:00.000Z	dnlien		can not access menus with mouse or keystrokes
2005-03-05T17:30:00.000Z	dnlien		anyone know anything about x11 graphics when remoting via ssh?
2005-03-05T17:31:00.000Z	GammaRay	dnlien	when running the app try.. TERM=xterm app-name
2005-03-05T17:32:00.000Z	dnlien	yojimbo	or anyone, is it possible to edit a configuration file so that I do not have to manually type every time the -x
2005-03-05T17:32:00.000Z	dnlien		to allow it by default, i mean
2005-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	GammaRay		umm
2005-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	GammaRay	dnlien	/etc/ssh/ssh_config
