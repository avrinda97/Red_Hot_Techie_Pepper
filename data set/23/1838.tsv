2009-10-07T09:14:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	have you tried lspci?
2009-10-07T09:17:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	the one that you bought must've been 3com, VIA ethernet cards are usually attached inside the desktop
2009-10-07T09:18:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	but if you can ping the VIA nic then youre right LoL
2009-10-07T09:28:00.000Z	raudy	mezquitale	what i must do first ?
2009-10-07T09:29:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	how you are using the 2nd nic? are you connecting it to another machine using static ip or getting an IP using dhcp?
2009-10-07T09:35:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	left? dang
2009-10-07T09:43:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	can you see your nick with ifconfig -a?
2009-10-07T09:45:00.000Z	raudy	mezquitale	this output of ifconfig : http://paste.ubuntu.com/287568/
2009-10-07T09:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	did you trh "ipconfig -a"??
2009-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	raudy	mezquitale	ifconfig right?
2009-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	yes, my mistake
2009-10-07T10:13:00.000Z	raudy	mezquitale	how to change my eth0 to must use 3com ethernet
2009-10-07T10:14:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	i think someone already told you there are issues with the drivers
2009-10-07T10:15:00.000Z	raudy	mezquitale	yes. i mean how to disable thats driver. becouse thats driver is onboard. and then i use ouboard ethernet
2009-10-07T10:16:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	so the VIA ethernet nic is onboard and you have issues with it???? youre SOL LoL  try disabling the ethernet port in the BIOS
2009-10-07T10:18:00.000Z	mezquitale	raudy	turn off your machine and go into the BIOS, in the BIOS there should be an option for you to disable the installed ethernet card in your machine
