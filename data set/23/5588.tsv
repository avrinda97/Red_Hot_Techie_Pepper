2009-02-05T12:02:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	that worked fine i was amazed to see that
2009-02-05T12:02:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	is there any way of getting that to work before login?
2009-02-05T12:04:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	i'm a man of my word... but can i get that working without having to first login to the laptop?
2009-02-05T12:05:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	in the options menu at login you can choose xdmcp... i guess that's off limits unless you're wired, or am i wrong?
2009-02-05T12:07:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	i tried it wired and it worked
2009-02-05T12:08:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	choose xdmcp from the options menu at the login screen, and it gives a list of available hosts (which i have 1, which is 192.168.1.1)... i click it and i get to the same screen i did with the X command
2009-02-05T12:11:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	when i turn it on and i'm logged in, it connects automatically to my router with the network-manager applet.  but that's because i have a saved configuration there... before i set that up in network-manager (which isn't started until login) it would ask me for the wpa key
2009-02-05T12:13:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	pm me your paypal email and i'll transfer the $ now... i trust you won't disappear :P
2009-02-05T12:14:00.000Z	boss	n8tuser	half to a good cause, half to you?
