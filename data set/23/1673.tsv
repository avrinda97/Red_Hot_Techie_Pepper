2009-12-18T05:40:00.000Z	pspfreak		never mind
2009-12-18T05:41:00.000Z	pspfreak		this started happening shortly after I got xampp
2009-12-18T05:43:00.000Z	pspfreak		how can I uninstall xampp via command line?
2009-12-18T05:44:00.000Z	pspfreak		no, it was compiled
2009-12-18T05:44:00.000Z	pspfreak		I already said, I compiled it. I didn't have a .deb
2009-12-18T05:44:00.000Z	pspfreak		I have tryed removing and re inserting my ram too
2009-12-18T05:46:00.000Z	pspfreak		I know it is installed at the /opt/lampp directory
2009-12-18T05:46:00.000Z	pspfreak		how could I delete that directory?
2009-12-18T05:47:00.000Z	pspfreak		ok
2009-12-18T05:48:00.000Z	pspfreak		Well, I am running the recovery mode  root terminal, as It will  freeze with xampp   installed
2009-12-18T05:48:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	dont use xamp
2009-12-18T05:48:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	use   sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin
2009-12-18T05:48:00.000Z	pspfreak	iceroot_	???
2009-12-18T05:48:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	xampp is something for windows-users. linux-users are using good software
2009-12-18T05:49:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	yes, use sudo apt-get.. i told you and not xampp
2009-12-18T05:49:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	always use software from the repos, not from websites
2009-12-18T05:50:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	then used it... but its bad
2009-12-18T05:52:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	again. its very bad. use original-softzware from the repo not a distribution from a website
2009-12-18T05:52:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	no automatic security updates for a webserver is bad
2009-12-18T05:53:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	lampp =  sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 phpmyadmin   thats all and you have a lampp
2009-12-18T05:53:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	sad if you dont care about good hints
2009-12-18T05:54:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	and if you dont care about security
2009-12-18T05:56:00.000Z	iceroot_	pspfreak	rm -rf /opt/lampp
