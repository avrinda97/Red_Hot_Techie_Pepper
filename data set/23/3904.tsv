2008-06-26T09:31:00.000Z	warcaptain		how can i modify my xorg config file?  displayconfig-gtk doesnt seem to work for me
2008-06-26T09:32:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	Do what now?
2008-06-26T09:32:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	You want to edit or reconfigure xorg.conf ?
2008-06-26T09:33:00.000Z	warcaptain	EvilDennisR	I want to reconfigure it.  Its not letting me use intel experimental drivers or set my monitor
2008-06-26T09:35:00.000Z	warcaptain	EvilDennisR	so?
2008-06-26T09:36:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	I have no idea what you did for your experamental drivers
2008-06-26T09:36:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	..and I'm going to bed
2008-06-26T09:37:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	Catch me when I'm not a few drinks in and have to wake up early for a meeting..
2008-06-26T09:37:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg though, maybe...
2008-06-26T09:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	Again, I dunno if you're using restricted drivers, or something you got somewhere
2008-06-26T09:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	its prolly using the generic driver.. Did you install ubuntu-restricted-extras or uh.. erm.. wtf is the restricted driver dialog thingy
2008-06-26T09:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	jockey-gt
2008-06-26T09:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	jockey-gtk ...
2008-06-26T09:41:00.000Z	warcaptain	EvilDennisR	thanks
2008-06-26T09:42:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	You /could/ edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and specify the drivers by hand..
2008-06-26T09:42:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	thats assuming they're installed all nicey nice
2008-06-26T09:43:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	under section "Device", specify Driver
2008-06-26T09:46:00.000Z	warcaptain	EvilDennisR	do i put the driver file or the name of the driver?
2008-06-26T09:46:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	the name of the driver
2008-06-26T09:47:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	You gotta know what the name of it is.. like Driver "nvidia" or Driver "ati" or Driver "fglrx"
2008-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	Use the restricted drivers thingy like I mentioned
2008-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	warcaptain	it /sometimes/ works
2008-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	warcaptain	EvilDennisR	all the drivers on that page are working
