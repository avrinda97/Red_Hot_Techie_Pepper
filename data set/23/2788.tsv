2011-07-04T14:28:00.000Z	glaksmono		anyone is here?
2011-07-04T14:28:00.000Z	glaksmono		how do you link files & folders, so that the changes in 1 folder is reflected on the other?
2011-07-04T14:28:00.000Z	glaksmono		= ="..
2011-07-04T14:28:00.000Z	glaksmono		:(
2011-07-04T14:29:00.000Z	glaksmono		yeah, but i couldn't make it recursive to files and folders
2011-07-04T14:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	  you did a link wrong then..  what filesystem is this on?
2011-07-04T14:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 give details of exactly what you are trying to do.
2011-07-04T14:32:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	i'm on Mac
2011-07-04T14:32:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	haha
2011-07-04T14:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 os-x uses bsd. so it can proberly do links also.
2011-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	currently, yes :(
2011-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	looking for more efficient way...
2011-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 You can make a link from directory 'foo1' and give it a new name  foo2     if you access stuff in foo2. you are actually alering things in foo1. youa re not syncing.. the data files are the same.
2011-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 if you have 2 differnt folders and want the contents to be identical,. then you do need to do some sort of rsync then.
2011-07-04T14:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 theres also various 'fuse' tools that can make it more transparent.
2011-07-04T14:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 via the 'alias' command... for bash. or link iot to a differnt name
2011-07-04T14:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 i dont know  what you are rembering.. but the alias command and ln -s are ways...
2011-07-04T14:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 you can make a 2 line script that just runs a command ...
2011-07-04T14:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 so be a bit more clear in what you want to do.
2011-07-04T14:48:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	i'm trying to add something into environment variable, so that instead of doing liek rsync -r bla bla
2011-07-04T14:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 put an alias in your .bashrc or .bash_profile
2011-07-04T14:52:00.000Z	glaksmono	dr_willis	what should i put on .bash_profile?
2011-07-04T14:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	glaksmono	 an alias that does what you want....  i juat showed an example above...
