2006-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	kwarkball		Does someone know of a search tool which allows to send requests to multiple search engines like copernic can do in the windowsworld?
2006-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	for an online tool, how about dogpile?
2006-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	i ve never heard of this. is that some sort of meta websearch engine?
2006-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	yeah
2006-07-14T16:37:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	hm ok have an idea for a piece of software as well? i need my search history
2006-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	how much search history? http://www.dogpile.com/_1_2S4GTKV02I6JE5O__info.dogpl/tbar/features.htm
2006-07-14T16:39:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	scratch that, ie only
2006-07-14T16:39:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	ie only ;) funny isnt it?
2006-07-14T16:39:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	that must mean they've ceased to innovate, they have been around a while dogpile
2006-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	maybe use Beagle with dogpile? http://beagle-project.org/Main_Page
2006-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	thought beagle is desktop search only? no?
2006-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	i ll have a look
2006-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	in Gnome on Ubuntu, go to Places > Search, type in something you've recently searched for on the internet (e.g. i typed "ruby") and in addition to your desktop files it searches your web history
2006-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	but perhaps what you need is something that re-runs the same searches?
2006-07-14T16:46:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	hmm. yeah a rerun would be good. do you know copernic? http://www.copernic.com/en/products/agent/index.html its funky for more complex search projects
2006-07-14T16:46:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	i've heard of it, but never had to use it
2006-07-14T16:50:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	don't know how stable it is (verson 0.50), but development is ongoing and this looks like precisely the sort of app you're looking for: http://pinot.berlios.de/index.html
2006-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	bingo this looks promising
2006-07-14T16:52:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	let us know if it's any good :(
2006-07-14T16:52:00.000Z	webben		sorry, that was meant to be :)
2006-07-14T16:52:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	i ll have a look at it
2006-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	kwarkball	webben	thanks for the tip
2006-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	webben	kwarkball	any time :)
