2008-02-07T15:22:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2		Hi all, I need to know a way to re-generate the original /etc/X11/xorg.conf that is created at ubuntu install time. I am testing hardy and lost my xorg.conf. dpkg-reconfigure -plow is not the answer since the file it generates does not contain the stuff for wacom tablet

2008-02-07T15:24:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2		nobody knows how to regenerate the default xorg.conf without re-installing
2008-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2		Come on I destroyed mine to reply to a bug report question :)
2008-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	dont think thats possible unless you backed it up yourself, just try to set it up using generic values, what are you trying to do anyway
2008-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	what is the tool that generates it in principle?
2008-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	how can you destroy x replying to a bug report?
2008-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	I had to check the "new" configuration tools
2008-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	this aint DBZ (regenerate) you have to use the command for X to set it up manually
2008-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	I have now three or four xorg.conf with different extensions and don't know what the original one is
2008-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	so you have backups than?
2008-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	you mean X -config or something like that?
2008-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	I am not completely sure
2008-02-07T15:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	yea x-config and if you are not sure it means you created those yourself so dont bother
2008-02-07T15:28:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	because I thought my backup was xorg.conf.1 (generated by the screen settings configuration) but it is not working the same
2008-02-07T15:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	I hope this helps you https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/4273 that is if you have a valid backup
2008-02-07T15:30:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	I restricted my attention to two backups (I remembered about a keyword that I had set up some time ago)
2008-02-07T15:30:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2		so if none of them works again, it's fault of today's X updates
2008-02-07T15:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	if the link helps try that or reconfigure xorg yourself
2008-02-07T15:31:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	or I will just start the livecd and copy the xorg.conf file... what a dumb :)
2008-02-07T15:31:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2		didn't realize it's that easy
2008-02-07T15:32:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT2	Pirate_Hunter	thanks for your help
2008-02-07T15:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Le-Chuck_IT2	that could work would never think of that, nice thinking outside the box *im amused*
