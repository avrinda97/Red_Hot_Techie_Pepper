2012-07-18T21:00:00.000Z	L3top	brandon	is this a sandybridge?  update-pciids and do it again.
2012-07-18T21:01:00.000Z	brandon	L3top	update-pciids: /usr/share/misc/pci.ids.new is read-only
2012-07-18T21:01:00.000Z	L3top	brandon	your system is running read only... that is another problem entirely.
2012-07-18T21:02:00.000Z	brandon	L3top	should i sudo it?
2012-07-18T21:03:00.000Z	brandon	L3top	 ok i said sudo

2012-07-18T21:03:00.000Z	L3top	brandon	weird. I have never had to use sudo, nor anyone I gave the command to. I seem to stand corrected.. oddly.

2012-07-18T21:04:00.000Z	L3top	brandon	all I wanted was to better ident that card. We havent changed anything. lspci -nn | grep VGA
