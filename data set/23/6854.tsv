2005-12-13T14:34:00.000Z	zandaa		darnit...
2005-12-13T14:35:00.000Z	zandaa		can't access the root account on my fresh setup
2005-12-13T14:35:00.000Z	zandaa		ok...
2005-12-13T14:36:00.000Z	zandaa		and it doesn't support my LAN
2005-12-13T14:36:00.000Z	zandaa		at least I can't connect through cable
2005-12-13T14:37:00.000Z	zandaa		well, I can't login as root, that's clear to me now
2005-12-13T14:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	there is no need to log in as root
2005-12-13T14:38:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	yes there is... I can't access my HD
2005-12-13T14:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	is that on the same box you're using to IRC now?
2005-12-13T14:40:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	yes.
2005-12-13T14:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	if you couldn't access the hd, your user account wouldn't work
2005-12-13T14:41:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	my user account works... but not my HD (it says owner: root, group: root)
2005-12-13T14:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	"my user account works... but not my HD"  <-- think about that for a minute
2005-12-13T14:46:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	what should I do about my HD then to fix it?
2005-12-13T14:54:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	it appears my HD has been chmodded to 500
2005-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	help you with what?
2005-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	nevermind, I got my HD working... it was a NTFS partition
2005-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	thanks anyway
2005-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	oh, ok. I wouldn't have been able to help with NTFS anyway.
2005-12-16T07:25:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	it doesn't have to be first boot device, on some motherboards it gives like "press [F11]  for boot menu"
2005-12-16T07:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	ah, ok
2005-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	zandaa	ROFL!
2005-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	zandaa	ardchoille	ROFLCOPTER!!
