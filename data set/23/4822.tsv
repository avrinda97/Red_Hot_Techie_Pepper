2009-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	I'm going crazy with this, Ubuntu has been nothing but a problem thus far ..
2009-01-11T06:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	Are you the only user in your system
2009-01-11T06:16:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, why?
2009-01-11T06:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	Just wanted to make  sure your user had burn rights to the cd
2009-01-11T06:17:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Should I sudo k3b and see if it can read it?
2009-01-11T06:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	give it a shot
2009-01-11T06:18:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Should the light on my drive stay lit?
2009-01-11T06:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	I would not think so
2009-01-11T06:19:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Nope, not detected as root, any where else I can look to see if Xubuntu itself can detect it?
2009-01-11T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	does your bios see it
2009-01-11T06:20:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Not a clue, how do I check?
2009-01-11T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	on boot it should show up, can the drive read a regular cd..
2009-01-11T06:21:00.000Z	iShock	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, no problem watching House on it, so it can even read DVDs.
2009-01-11T06:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iShock	k3b and brasero .. neither see it as a burner.. so no idea other than try a different brand of disk
