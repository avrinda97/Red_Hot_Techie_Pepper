2010-06-30T17:31:00.000Z	phaidros	delinquentme	that is the ubuntu version. kernel is something like 2.6.33-generic or alike
2010-06-30T17:34:00.000Z	phaidros	delinquentme	kernel is on little but important software piece in a linux system, it is the core process, managing hardware and other processes (programs). it is only in the back and you graphical environment is totally independent of your kernel version
