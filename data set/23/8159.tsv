2004-12-26T15:08:00.000Z	jdong		you shouldn't be using kernel-image-x anyway!
2004-12-26T15:08:00.000Z	jdong		ubuntu uses linux-image-x
2004-12-26T15:09:00.000Z	jdong		kernel-image-x is auto-imported from Debian :(
2004-12-26T15:09:00.000Z	jdong		yeah
2004-12-26T15:09:00.000Z	jdong		but make sure you install a new kernel befoore rebooting!!
2004-12-26T15:10:00.000Z	jdong		but you're fine removing it!
2004-12-26T15:10:00.000Z	jdong		(I'd install linux-image before removing kernel-image)
