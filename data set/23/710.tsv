2011-08-29T12:34:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	'lspci | grep -i vga' please
2011-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	if you have a flat panel, it's best to connect it to the gfx card using the digital port
2011-08-29T12:19:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	yeah. my desktop doesnt have one
2011-08-29T12:20:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	must be a really old one then ;)
2011-08-29T12:20:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	feel free to give me a new one :)
2011-08-29T12:21:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	if you expect to keep using it for another while, I suggest you graze the used market for one of the newest available AGP gfx cards
2011-08-29T12:23:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	what's the problem w/ the port?
2011-08-29T12:25:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	the pci slot doesnt match the card
2011-08-29T12:25:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	you have a PCI gfx card?  omg, what an antiquity is that..
2011-08-29T12:28:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	really, does that machine not have an AGP port?
2011-08-29T12:29:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	what does an agp port look like
2011-08-29T12:33:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	see e.g. here -> http://lehre.hki.uni-koeln.de/seminare/sites/default/files/userfiles/1/Mainboard_agp.jpg
2011-08-29T12:36:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	^
2011-08-29T12:36:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	I'd be surprised if that wasn't already an AGP card
2011-08-29T12:37:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	a quick Google search seems to suggest that that model was available as PCI Express already
2011-08-29T12:38:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	is that by chance a blue-coloured slot the gfx card is in?
2011-08-29T12:38:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	http://www.ebay.com/itm/Gateway-eMachines-T6216-T6420-T6426-MS7207-Motherboard-/150595280204?pt=Motherboards
2011-08-29T12:39:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	that's definitely PCIe
2011-08-29T12:39:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	so what then?
2011-08-29T12:44:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	the 6100 seems to be a rare bird..  but just about any current gfx card will do if you're looking for a replacement, you should be able to get one for under â‚¬30 (~$40) new
2011-08-29T12:50:00.000Z	szal	philipballew	if you wouldn't mind to join #ubuntu-offtopic, we could continue looking for a gfx card there ;)
2011-08-29T12:53:00.000Z	philipballew	szal	im there
