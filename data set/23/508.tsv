2011-07-14T21:24:00.000Z	Lmat		What does this mean: "cp: cannot stat `location': No such file or directory" ?
2011-07-14T21:24:00.000Z	Lmat		I'm trying to copy like this: "cp -r /location/*.a ~/otherloc/"
2011-07-14T21:24:00.000Z	Lmat		the first location is owned by root.
2011-07-14T21:25:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	does location exist in the root directory /?
2011-07-14T21:28:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	please give the output of llutz command
2011-07-14T21:29:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	llutz  http://pastie.org/2213497
2011-07-14T21:30:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	is /location just a placeholder or was it the wrong command?
2011-07-14T21:30:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	placeholder.
2011-07-14T21:30:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	so can you tell us the original command without placeholders which is giving back the issue?
2011-07-14T21:31:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	"sudo cp -r /media/sf_temp/partwriter\ v.4/*.cpp"
2011-07-14T21:31:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	"sudo cp -r /media/sf_temp/partwriter\ v.4/*.cpp /home/aaron/code/"
2011-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	why don't you use <<"">>? your command contains a space
2011-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	http://pastie.org/2213509
2011-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	try "sudo cp -r "/media/sf_temp/partwriter v.4/*.cpp" /home/aaron/code/"
2011-07-14T21:33:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	http://pastie.org/2213514
2011-07-14T21:34:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	try "sudo cp -r "/media/sf_temp/partwriter\ v.4/*.cpp" /home/aaron/code/"
2011-07-14T21:34:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	You're double-escaping the space.  That's no good.
2011-07-14T21:35:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	http://pastie.org/2213524
2011-07-14T21:35:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	you directory is called "partwriter\ v.4" it contains a space and special sign which is causing that issue
2011-07-14T21:35:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	can't you just rename the directory?
2011-07-14T21:35:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	Which directory?  and why would I rename it?
2011-07-14T21:37:00.000Z	Incarus6	Lmat	can you rename "partwriter v.4" to "partwriter"?
2011-07-14T21:37:00.000Z	Lmat	Incarus6	um...that's very difficult and I don't think there's a point to it.
