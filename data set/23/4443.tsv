2007-08-11T12:26:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	yeah pretty much... :(
2007-08-11T12:24:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	no they arnt next to each other
2007-08-11T12:24:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	you can't move partitions back, so you're screwed i guess :X
2007-08-11T12:25:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	the thing is, i resize my windows partion so it gives 10GB of free space. but the free space partion that windows uses is on top of ubunu, so it wont take GB's from there
2007-08-11T12:26:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	so theres nothing i can do?
2007-08-11T12:26:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	well you can always copy your home folder to an external / different HD, then reformat ubuntu, and move it all back?
2007-08-11T12:28:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	so al i would need to save is Home folder?
2007-08-11T12:29:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	you'll have to reinstall apps too, so you might wanna get your apps from cache (if they're all still there)
2007-08-11T12:29:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	i jsut installed ubuntu anyway so i really dont have much
2007-08-11T12:30:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	copy that to a new partion?
2007-08-11T12:31:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	yea
2007-08-11T12:31:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	well listen to xtkight then :D, i usually have no prob when i select a root folder, but if you want to be safe use sudo cp- a :)
2007-08-11T12:32:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	can i copy the files on the livecd?
2007-08-11T12:32:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	you should be able to...
2007-08-11T12:33:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	it's easier just to back it all up now though?
2007-08-11T12:33:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	if you don't have another comp, i suppose you could make a new part after your current ubuntu one, and dump it there for now, bu t thats just long and painful -_-;
2007-08-11T12:35:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	meh ill just install a fresh ubuntu.. thanks for the help!
2007-08-11T12:35:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	np, sorry i couldnt be of more help :(
2007-08-11T12:37:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	well... i use xubuntu, but thats partly b/c of my slow system
2007-08-11T12:37:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	i've found xubuntu is generally cleaner and faster, but doesn't have everything that ubuntu has
2007-08-11T12:38:00.000Z	m0u5e	Walls7	i've ended up having to install some gnome libraries anyways, but its not that bad since xubuntu uses a lot of GTK stuff anyways
2007-08-11T12:38:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	pete83, WaltzingAlong: thanks
2007-08-11T13:23:00.000Z	Walls7	m0u5e	what is the command if i want to edit my start up page that asks which OS i want to use, so i can re order tham?
