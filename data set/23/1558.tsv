2010-03-12T03:08:00.000Z	archboxman	rahduke	do you have gimp installed??
2010-03-12T03:10:00.000Z	rahduke	archboxman	yup i do
2010-03-12T03:11:00.000Z	archboxman	rahduke	you could just open the image your using as a background and select the eyedrop image and it will match the color for you... I don't use gimp it is more for a whole editing studio instead of just picking a color..
