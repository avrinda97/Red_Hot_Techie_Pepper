2009-07-11T20:05:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	Do you have an idea why the vboxdrv module is not compiled here?  Or does it even have a different name now?  I looked around with modprobe and in /etc/init.d/ but found nothing obviously fixing the issue for me.
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	there is a command you can run to force it to recompile (it tells you it if you try and use it and the correct version isn't compiled already)
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	possibly in dmesg
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	Well, that's the thing. I'm looking for that command, but can't find it.
2009-07-11T20:07:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	sudo invoke-rc.d vboxdrv setup
2009-07-11T20:08:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	Are you on Jaunty?
2009-07-11T20:08:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	ya
2009-07-11T20:09:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	virtualbox from sun, not community wotsit edition
2009-07-11T20:10:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	I'm getting the feeling I'm missing a package here.  "locate vbox.drv" returns nothing here.  And I just stumbled upon an interesting log entry.  /var/log/vbox-install.log:/etc/init.d/virtualbox-ose: line 283: /usr/lib/virtualbox/src/vboxdrv/build_in_tmp: No such file or directory
2009-07-11T20:12:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	googling for that error suggests to me there is something wrong with the Debian/Ubuntu packages
2009-07-11T20:12:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	relative/absolute path problems
2009-07-11T20:13:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	oh ok. are you on Jaunty as well? I've not had any problems as far as I can remember (apart from having to force it to recompile a couple of times)
2009-07-11T20:15:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	yes, I'm on Jaunty.  Jaunty has version 2.1.4 and according to Debian's bugtracker, this problem was fixed only in 2.2.2: http://bugs.debian.org/526322
2009-07-11T20:15:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	Probably we need a backport of the fix.  Strange that apparently not many other people are affected (or they gave up)
2009-07-11T20:16:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	ah, I'm not using the version from the repositories, I'm using a deb downloaded from the vbox site
2009-07-11T20:16:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	yes, you're lucky ;-)
2009-07-11T20:17:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	is the bug reported in Launchpad too?
2009-07-11T20:18:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	I'm checking at the moment and inspecting the ChangeLogs, but haven't found anything definitive, et
2009-07-11T20:28:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	Do you have a file /etc/init.d/vboxdrv?  If so, can you please tell me what package is returned from "dpkg -S /etc/init.d/vboxdrv"?
2009-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	virtualbox-2.2
2009-07-11T20:32:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	thanks.  I can only assume then that /etc/init.d/virtualbox-ose is the equivalent
2009-07-11T20:39:00.000Z	Laibsch	funkyHat	I have concluded that the jaunty package has many issues.  Rather than fixing them, I will recompile the karmic version and use that.  2.2.x seems to be a major leap in stability.
2009-07-11T20:44:00.000Z	funkyHat	Laibsch	sounds sensible :)
