2006-10-13T05:52:00.000Z	Vuen		duh, just because you're in the states doesn't mean you can't use the canadian site genius

2006-11-10T11:01:00.000Z	Vuen	kitche	what's an oem install?
2006-11-10T11:01:00.000Z	kitche	Vuen	it's like Dell installs and such when you buy a new windows machine
2006-11-10T11:02:00.000Z	Vuen	kitche	what's the difference between that and text mode?
2006-11-10T11:02:00.000Z	Vuen	kitche	is text mode like for a server?
2006-11-10T11:02:00.000Z	kitche	Vuen	oem will let you choose what is installed while a text mode will install the full system and command-line is for servers pretty much or for someone that wants to start off with a base system
2007-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	kitche	Vuen	by the way 1.0 is vaild
2007-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	Vuen	kitche	not as a host address, it definitely is not
2007-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	kitche	Vuen	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
2007-02-06T09:55:00.000Z	Vuen	kitche	no. .0 and .255 are reserved. .0 is the network address, .255 is broadcast. neither are valid for host addresses.
