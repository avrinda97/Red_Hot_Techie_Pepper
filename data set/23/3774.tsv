2012-03-07T04:18:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	you have to restart vncserver
2012-03-07T04:21:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	it works for me, but I use lxde
2012-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	are you using gnome?
2012-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	I don't think that it's gnome-session then
2012-03-07T04:27:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	I don't know what Xsession manager does it use, maybe Unity or gnome3, so the gnome-session it's wrong on that file
2012-03-07T04:37:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	yeah something instead gnome-session & but I don't know what! I don't have 12.04 and no more gnome or unity here
2012-03-07T04:44:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	btw what x session uses remote machines?
2012-03-07T04:47:00.000Z	filo1234	Zehle	the remote machines, where vncserver running, which kind of desktop enviroment uses?
