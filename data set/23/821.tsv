2011-02-05T03:58:00.000Z	chrislu5tic		tensor...
2011-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	chrislu5tic		can you tell me why I dont have a third party software section in my ubuntu software centre
2011-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	chrislu5tic		i have the section on my other computer running ububtu 10.10,    but its not on this one.
2011-02-05T04:00:00.000Z	chrislu5tic		i need hzelp
2011-02-05T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	ask away
2011-02-22T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	prefix with sudo
2011-02-22T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	without sudo, the command will run as user, which doesn't have write access
2011-02-22T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	what is the error?
2011-02-22T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	i suggest you search yur filesystem and re-read the guide you are using
2011-05-23T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	chmod +x /tmp/wlsetup-web.exe
2011-05-23T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	it won't work though: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=127
2011-05-23T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	why not use amsn
2011-05-23T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	it won't output anything if it suceeds
2011-05-23T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	then the filename is incorrect (linux is case sensitive)
2011-05-23T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	you are wasting your time too, windows live messenger doesn't work in wine
2011-05-23T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	yes, but if you give chmod the wrong file to make executable, it won't work
2011-05-23T04:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	the 'No such file or directory' is a massive clue
2012-05-24T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	yeah, broadcom based too
2012-05-24T02:06:00.000Z	chrislu5tic	ActionParsnip	Can you check this out,  http://aircrack-ng.org/downloads.html      I know how to install the source just fine through the terminal.. but I need the development source svn,    the first one under development sources,    but... I have no idea how to install it? do I have to compile it or something? any advice...
2012-05-24T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	i've not used aircrack
2012-05-24T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chrislu5tic	the guys in #backtrack-linux may have some advise
