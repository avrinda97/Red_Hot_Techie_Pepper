2007-03-04T14:01:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	,once u empty the list off all the entries ..save the file ..
2007-03-04T14:02:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	,dont delet e the file.. just delete the entries
2007-03-04T14:02:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	,ok then .. sudo apt-get update

2007-03-04T14:05:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	,and then again "update" this had solved my problem with apt where it gave me weird errors.. maybe it;'ll work for this too ..

2007-03-04T14:07:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	.weird... for me ..it just started with reading package tingys.. and then ended in a few lines..
2007-03-04T14:09:00.000Z	GreyGhost	LordLimecat	,just do what i said previously ..clear it up and run apt-get update.. and then add all the repos again ..i've had this warning before too..
