2006-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Paradox34690		i'm running my ubuntu through VMWare on a Windows box... (hey, just trying to get a feel for the whole thing, ya know?)
2006-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	Paradox34690		All i want to do is change the theme to something else...   I've downloaded a couple different ones from that gnome-look.org that someone else was so gracious to inform me of...
2006-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	Paradox34690		i've untared them... and when I try to install them through the theme jobby thing, it tells me Invalid format...
2006-11-20T11:06:00.000Z	Paradox34690		the theme in particular that I'm trying to do is this: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=42997
2006-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	Paradox34690		i'll try that... but if you look at the one in the link that I sent you, that doesn't do anything either other than give an error message..
2006-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	Paradox34690		uh... no.
2006-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	Paradox34690		not that I know of... i'm still new to this.. :D
2006-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	Paradox34690		so i've learned...
2006-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	Paradox34690		where does one find this "beryl" thinger and can it be used with Ubuntu?
2006-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	you might have a hard time with it in vmware
2006-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	seriously, i dont think vmware will do the full 3d acceleration beryl needs
2006-11-20T11:21:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	try this in a terminal:  glxinfo | grep direct   if it doesnt say yes, beryl wont work
2006-11-20T11:24:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	 dude. it wouldnt have worked in your current environment. you would have been on here asking all kinds of questions and getting frstrated for nothing. spend that time installing it to your hard drive, then get beryl running.
2006-11-20T11:26:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	i was picking on you for announcing every smoke/coffee/pee/afk break you take
2006-11-20T11:30:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	art.gnome.org
2006-11-20T11:30:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	also gnome-look.org
2006-11-20T11:35:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	/home/user/.theme
2006-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	that's what the channel is for :)
2006-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	just download the theme, and then you can install it in the theme preference window...no need to untar it yourself
2006-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	the theme manager does all the work for you
2006-11-21T10:33:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	what the hey...sure
2006-11-21T10:39:00.000Z	kmaynard	Paradox34690	still there?
