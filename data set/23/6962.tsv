2005-11-27T15:20:00.000Z	penguinzdr		i am using BMP, just trying XMMS
2005-11-27T15:20:00.000Z	penguinzdr		do you know a lyrics plugin for BMP?
2005-11-27T15:22:00.000Z	penguinzdr		i tried kubuntu yesterday. One word: SLOW
2005-11-27T15:24:00.000Z	penguinzdr		gnome is not ugly!
2005-11-27T15:24:00.000Z	penguinzdr		anyone know a lyrics plugin for BMP?
2005-11-27T15:25:00.000Z	penguinzdr		:(
2005-11-27T15:26:00.000Z	penguinzdr		konqui into the fire
2005-11-27T15:27:00.000Z	penguinzdr		ok, ok
2005-11-27T15:29:00.000Z	penguinzdr		in windows, my screen is ok. but in ubuntu, my screen is too on the right. what should i do? (i dont want to install nvidia drivers.)
2005-11-27T15:30:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	 you'll have to either put up with it or install the drivers, mine did erxactly the same. why not install the ubuntu packaged drivers? makes more sense than no acceleration with nv driver
2005-11-27T15:32:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	my problem with the packaged drivers is that i correctly edit xorg.conf, restart X and my comp freezes at the nVidia splashscreen.
2005-11-27T15:33:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	i have installed the nvidia drivers
2005-11-27T15:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	 disable the splash then ;)
2005-11-27T15:33:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	i tried. than black screen and still freezes
2005-11-27T15:35:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	 ah that sux... :/
2005-11-27T15:35:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	yeah, aloty
2005-11-27T15:37:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	only with the ubu package i tried
2005-11-27T15:38:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	 maybe try the NVidia drivers themselves then??
2005-11-27T15:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	or live happily with the nv driver, which does work well too, i admit
2005-11-27T15:39:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	hmm... do the developers of dapper know about the bug?
2005-11-27T15:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	penguinzdr	 you on dapper right now? it could also be an nvidia bug for you particular card.... do a bugreport somewhere...
2005-11-27T15:42:00.000Z	penguinzdr	aftertaf	no, i'm on breezy. maybe just for my card, other FX 5200 cards work perfect.
