2009-06-19T23:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	is swap being mounted in your /etc/fstab ?
2009-06-19T23:44:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	i dont know what that means by buy partition manager has nothign mounted or anything just the label "swap"
2009-06-19T23:46:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	cat /etc/fstab  .. do you see swap anywhere in there?
2009-06-19T23:47:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	yes but I think it ahs the wrong UUID i think, another thread to fix splahs said swap could be off which got me here and did a command but coming out with diff UUID
2009-06-19T23:48:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	sudo blkid   .. that will give you the correct UUID

2009-06-19T23:51:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	change the UUID in fstab to match the output of blkid
2009-06-19T23:52:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	how?
2009-06-19T23:52:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	unmount swap then run sudo mount -a   .. if all works you're done
2009-06-19T23:52:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2009-06-19T23:52:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	i went into partition editor and hit swap off is thta ok?
2009-06-19T23:53:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	verify that it has been unmounted then yes.
2009-06-19T23:53:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	how do I do that now? sorry im still learning
2009-06-19T23:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	sudo swapoff -a .. but i think that looks at fstab for the ID..  partition editor should be fine.
2009-06-19T23:55:00.000Z	tannersummers	bastidrazor	thanks alot i hope this fixes it let me restrat pc brb man
2009-06-19T23:56:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	wait!..
2009-06-19T23:56:00.000Z	bastidrazor	tannersummers	sudo mount -a will mount it if it worked.. no need to reboot
