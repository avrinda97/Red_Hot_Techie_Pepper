2005-02-16T16:13:00.000Z	rose		phos - on the wiki I read an article about dual boot - talked about problems with MBR - don't know if you're doing dual boot
2005-02-16T16:14:00.000Z	rose		previously when I had win 95 I did a big mess up somehow with GRUB and major crash
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	rose		but I am definitely NOT a geek!
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	rose		wish I was more computer savvy
2005-02-16T16:16:00.000Z	rose		at least if I mess up I can reinstall - don't know how easy WinXP is to install
2005-02-16T16:17:00.000Z	rose		that mean it's easy phos?
2005-02-16T16:17:00.000Z	rose		I have my photos backed up so not a worry - just can't get the blinking CDs to work!
2005-02-16T16:18:00.000Z	rose		tried mandrake also but the install wouldn't work - highlighted but nothing happened when I clicked on it
2005-02-16T16:19:00.000Z	rose		same with ubuntu install
2005-02-16T16:20:00.000Z	rose		phos - reason I want to try mandrake is that it's suposed to be easy for newbs and windows users
2005-02-16T16:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	It is. I'd recommend you start with Mandrake/Fedora/SuSE.
2005-02-16T16:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Of those three, I personally liked Fedora the best.
2005-02-16T16:22:00.000Z	rose	apokryphos	- actually had an older Suse working to a limited degree a couple of years ago - but hardware problems I recall
2005-02-16T16:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Fedora has better hardware support; the community is pretty huge.
2005-02-16T16:23:00.000Z	rose	apokryphos	- been reading some good stuff about fedora somewhere recently
2005-02-16T16:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	It's pretty good. Very user-friendly; has a graphical installation. Annoying things: doesn't come with MP3 support (though that's easily sorted), and secondly -- it never worked that fast for me. Compared to others.
2005-02-16T16:25:00.000Z	rose	apokryphos	- mp3 not an issue for me so maybe i could buy the PC mag and try it
2005-02-16T16:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	I think that would be a good idea. You could always just download the DVD iso, if you've got a DVD-burner.
2005-02-16T16:26:00.000Z	rose	apokryphos	- no - no DVD burner and dial up modem!
2005-02-16T16:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Yup, you better go for the magazine ;)
2005-02-16T16:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Sure. Linux takes some learning, but it's not that hard. But, personally speaking, it's been by far the best decision I've ever made computer-wise.
2005-02-16T16:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Sorry?
2005-02-16T16:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	rose	Oh, yeah, dual boot. Though, I dont' think I've logged into Windoze for well over a couple of months.
