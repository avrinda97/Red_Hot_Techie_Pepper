2007-07-12T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	chmod +x it then run it as root
2007-07-12T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	take care, though
2007-07-12T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	don't run random binaries
2007-07-12T15:31:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	sudo file.bin
2007-07-12T15:31:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	probably
2007-07-12T15:31:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	depending on what it is and where it want to install
2007-07-12T15:33:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	google earth can install to your homedir I think. personally I installed it with sudo to do it system wide, though.
2007-07-12T15:34:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	just sudo file.bin for google earth is what I did
2007-07-12T15:43:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	initiate it with sudo
2007-07-12T15:43:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	you can't change to root after it's started
2007-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	just /usr/local or sudo mkdir /usr/local/real first
2007-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	or better yet install to /opt then create a symlink
2007-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	what didn't work?
2007-07-12T15:48:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	hell if it's in the repos remove the crap it left and install from there instead
2007-07-12T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	it seems to have installed
2007-07-12T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	where did you install it?
2007-07-12T15:53:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	where did you tell it to install?
2007-07-12T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	so ls /usr/local/real?
2007-07-12T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	is realplay there?
2007-07-12T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	ilu	why?
