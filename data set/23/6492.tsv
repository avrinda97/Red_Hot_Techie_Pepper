2006-03-28T10:18:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		Would one of you kind ladies and gentlemen help me out w/ something?  I'm trying to install a software modem. I did scanModem and it tells me I need a Lucent driver (I think), so I'm going by the DialupModemHow to on the wiki and on the step where you type in "sudo modprobe lt_serial" I get an eror saying "Module Lt_serial not found".  The previous steps went ok. I'm using Ubuntu version 5.10.
2006-03-28T10:18:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		What should I do?

2006-03-28T10:21:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		Does anybody know at the support IRC channel for Ubuntu linux is?
2006-03-28T10:21:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		So how do you get support?
2006-03-28T10:22:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	just ask
2006-03-28T10:22:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	did you do a make install?
2006-03-28T10:23:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	what do you mean make install?
2006-03-28T10:24:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	the how to guide didn't say to compile anything.
2006-03-28T10:28:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	you have linux-restricted-modules-x86 installed?
2006-03-28T10:28:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	I believe so. I checked in the package manager and it had a checkmark next to it.
2006-03-28T10:31:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	i think the maker of that wiki might have told us to modprobe the wrong modules, one that doesn't exist
2006-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	so I'm stuck modemless? :(
2006-03-28T10:33:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	one sec, im looking
2006-03-28T10:33:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	Ok. Thank you! ^_^
2006-03-28T10:37:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	that note right underneath the one that lists the error, is this relating to this problem by any chance?
2006-03-28T10:37:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=93852&highlight=ltmodem
2006-03-28T10:38:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	I'll try that. Thank you! :)
2006-03-28T10:38:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	thats a bug on ubuntus end
2006-03-28T10:39:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	dmb	that tutorial you gave me alink to, it will fix it?
2006-03-28T10:39:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	yeh, that will get you to the point of modprobing the module
2006-03-28T10:40:00.000Z	dmb	CreatureOfLegend	that means inserting the driver into the kernel
