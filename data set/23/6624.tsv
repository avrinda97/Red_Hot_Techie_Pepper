2006-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Do you happen to know what partition your linux is on?
2006-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	That's the partition format.
2006-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	That's as good as telling me your floppy is using FAT
2006-02-27T07:29:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Ok, You didn't put /boot into it's own partition, did you?
2006-02-27T07:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Do you have a menu when you boot your computer (To select the OS)
2006-02-27T07:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Does grub load at all?
2006-02-27T07:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Instantly, or after a pause?  You are unable to enter the grub shell by hitting 'c'?
2006-02-27T07:32:00.000Z	southern	Arafangion	Yes I unable to edit grub ...
2006-02-27T07:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	No.  grub is itself an Operating System, which happens to boot other OS's.
2006-02-27T07:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Unlike lilo, grub actually has a shell, etc.
2006-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	southern	Arafangion	thats all
2006-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	Well, you will need to reinstall grub, at the very least.
2006-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	I wish I could help, but I have to head off now.
2006-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	southern	You will need your live cd.
