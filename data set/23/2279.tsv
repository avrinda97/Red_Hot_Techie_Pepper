2009-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	ergZay		isnt kubuntu the same way?
2009-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	ergZay		anyway my question is, what exactly is on the alternative disks and the dvd disks of each?
2009-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	ergZay		and are tehre any other versions besides those
2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	ergZay		theres no graphical samba share setup utility
2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	ergZay		for example
2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	ergZay		or more advanced display setup
2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	ergZay		i have fancy displays
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	ergZay		can anyone tell me what is on the alternative disks and dvd disks? and are there any other special dvds/cds?
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	ed_debian	ergZay	The alternative discs install ubuntu only
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	ed_debian		They are not live CD's meaning you cannot run the OS from them (like I said only install it)
2009-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	ergZay	ed_debian	but there are alternative kubuntu disks...
2009-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	ed_debian	ergZay	That install kubuntu instead.  What is the mystery??
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	ergZay	ed_debian	ok, so whats on the dvds? do they live boot and have the extra features of alternative?
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	ergZay	ed_debian	i'm looking for a disk that can do live boot and LVM management which i think is on the alternative disks
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	ed_debian	ergZay	I am not aware of a live DVD?  IDK.   The point though of the alternative discs though is that they are not LIve CD's
2009-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	ergZay		does anyone know of any disks that can do LVM management and can live boot?
2009-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	ed_debian	ergZay	There are software packages that let you create your own live discs
2009-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	ed_debian	ergZay	with whatever you want on them
2009-06-05T04:14:00.000Z	ergZay	ed_debian	i realize that but im wondering if tehre are any stock cd/dvds that have it
