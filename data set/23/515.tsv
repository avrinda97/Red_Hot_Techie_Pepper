2011-08-18T05:39:00.000Z	MestreLion		i dont get the point in ./configure --prefix=/opt when installing from source. If in Linux an app's files are scattered all over the fs (/usr/bin, /usr/lib, /etc. /var, etc), what is the point in chaging the prefix. What will this change do? What will go to /opt and what will go elsewhere?
2011-08-18T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	/opt/ (and /usr/local) will include directories like those in your main root, so you will have /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/etc/ .
2011-08-18T05:43:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	if i choose /opt, ill end up with /opt/bin , /opt/lib, /opt/etc ?
2011-08-18T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	Yes.
2011-08-18T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	make install will create directories as needed.
2011-08-18T05:54:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	 so i guess its pretty "safe" to install to default /usr/local, since tree is already there... no fear in "messing"  a sys the tree since tree is already there, empty. But... what about desktop integration? will source files from upstream include things like .desktop files, mime types, etc?
2012-03-26T14:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	"env"
2012-03-26T14:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	But it should be the same $PATH as anywhere else.
2012-03-26T14:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	bash -c 'echo $HOME'
2012-03-26T14:26:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	humm, that's cheating, but it is a nice approach ;)
2012-03-26T14:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	Most likely the first word is considered a command, which is searched for in $PATH, then any further tokens are taken as literal arguments to that command.
2012-03-26T14:29:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	humm...
2012-03-26T14:30:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	I wonder if there is a way to print which $PATH is effective in the desktop
2012-03-26T14:33:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	env... duh.. i'm stupid... lol... and, this is curious.. "env" works, but "env | sort" does not... this is indeed a very limited "proxy" :P
2012-03-26T14:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	I think that "proxy" is an odd term that makes it seem more complicated than it is. Shells are shells, this is not a shell. You can run commands without ever involving a shell, like when using the exec() system call from C.
2012-03-26T14:36:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	so what gnome does is exec()ing the commands directly, passing all args as literals?
2012-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	Seems like it, yes.
2012-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	that would explain everything... now it is a pretty understandable behavior... thank you very much!
2012-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	You're welcome :)
2012-10-24T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	That advice is wrong in multiple ways.
2012-10-24T11:38:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jordan_U	true, I completely misread the question
2012-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	grub's boot sector should also be installed to the MBR, not to a partition, and when running grub-install from a LiveCD/USB environment you need to first mount the Ubuntu partition and either chroot in or pass an apropriate --boot-directory argument to grub-install.
2012-10-24T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MestreLion	Theoretically by preventing seeks, which theoretically cause more wear than contiguous reads.
