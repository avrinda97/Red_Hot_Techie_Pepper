2009-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd		i'm trying to find a way to be able to disable some cpus to save some battery life, maybe it's directly possible from the grub entry no ?
2009-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd		please
2009-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd		i'm asking since 10 minutes and i'm always helping people when i can and i think the answer is very simple
2009-12-14T06:12:00.000Z	Exaltia	jacquesdupontd	i dunno
2009-12-14T06:12:00.000Z	Exaltia	jacquesdupontd	i think, at "cold" that the best way to save power is to use hlt
2009-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	what do you mean by cold ? i just remember an applet or a application that was easy to manage cpu and i would like to remember the name i'm running kubuntu, thx
2009-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	Exaltia	jacquesdupontd	just meant it's me that was cold about your needs :)
2009-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	cause running 8 cores is costing a lot of battery life i'm sure ubuntu would run well with only 1 enable
2009-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd		d
2009-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	sorry ok and thx anyway

2009-12-14T06:17:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	thx gonna check that
2009-12-14T06:19:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	not working at all it says me permission denied and yes i've tried a sudo
2009-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	Exaltia	jacquesdupontd	: I was able to use maxcores= in the grub.conf, but how can I disable and enable while running an app? There is some sort of cpu hotplug, but I'm running 2.4 which cpu hotplug doesn't support. Also, i don't think i can enable this in the kernel since I installed the rpm for the kernel I am running., source : http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/disable-cpu-cores-in-rhel3-631816/ (and sorry to not be able to
2009-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	Exaltia		 give a real answers, i didn't know anything about this)
2009-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	that showed me the way thx, this is better http://mailman.lug.org.uk/pipermail/nottingham/2008-March/010936.html
2009-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	haha exactly what i past you :)
2009-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	Exaltia		hehehe
2009-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	thx a lot i'm rebooting to test
2009-12-14T06:41:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	i'm embarassed cause it seems maxcores= option is not working on grub 2 , grub.cfg, do you know where i could find the possible options of grub 2 entries i've searched on google with no good results, thx
2009-12-14T06:44:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	i'm stupid i guess it's nothing in match with grub version it has to do with the kernel version
2009-12-14T06:51:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	just for you to know if one time you need the info and for others you have to add the line maxcpus=N instead of maxcores=N
2009-12-14T06:51:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	Exaltia	and it woks
