2008-05-09T05:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	fbc	well, I think its in the deb that I had you reinstall
2008-05-09T05:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	fbc	I just checked, its in the .deb file.  You can use archive manager, and just grab it

2008-05-09T05:43:00.000Z	fbc	danbhfive	Is it the SRC deb i'm looking for?
2008-05-09T05:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	fbc	no, the one you installed from, that apache2-common thing
