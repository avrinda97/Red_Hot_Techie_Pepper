2007-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	m1k3		I wanna know please
2007-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	basically the desktop environment.
2007-12-15T10:23:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	there are billions of them! (for very small values of a billion)
2007-12-15T10:24:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	no no I mean like the most popularly used ones
2007-12-15T10:25:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	I heard an expression once that was something like, "If you get two linux enthusiasts talking about the best software you'll get five different opinions"
2007-12-15T10:25:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	yup. I've used flux and openbox
2007-12-15T10:26:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	they were *fantastic* for old machines. But those aren't desktop environments. that's a window manager.
2007-12-15T10:26:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	but what about desktop environments, what do yuo perfer?
2007-12-15T10:27:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	I use gnome because I'm lazy and I like it when things work.
2007-12-15T10:28:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	lol I guess gnome is the good one but when ever I try to install Normal Desktop effects it says Desktop effects cannot be enabled, I know it has nothing to do with the hardware because my other pc has 256 mb of on board memory any ideas as to why it wont allow me to enable them?
2007-12-15T10:29:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	I got a shiny new laptop with 2Gig of RAM. So I'm not sure. I know that we use 6.06LTS witht eh machines we ship out to the schools and rarely have more than 256M of RAM
2007-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	I've got 1 gig of ram and 256 of on board shared memory I ment
2007-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	you shouldn't have a problem with it...
2007-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	I did I tried everything wont enable for me for some reason...
2007-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	I'm using ubuntu 7.10
2007-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	have you rebooted recently?
2007-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	I had an issue on a new install before powered down and back up again.
2007-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	I'm not on the fast pc it's at my dad's house I turn it off all the time
2007-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	I'm not sure what to suggest then. You've already tried everything I would normally do. :(
2007-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	emmajane	m1k3	have you tried goolging the error?
2007-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	m1k3	emmajane	good idea but it doesn't give anything specific except "Desktop effects cannot be enabled"
