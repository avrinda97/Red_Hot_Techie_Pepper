2011-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	tanath	PL4Y3R	you blame torrenting? rather than your ability to determine what to download/run? :P

2011-06-02T04:16:00.000Z	tanath	PL4Y3R	G5 is pretty old, IIRC. but even current linux should be able to handle old system requirements. you'll just want to use a lightweight environment
2011-06-02T04:17:00.000Z	tanath	PL4Y3R	lxde is fairly popular. fluxbox, blackbox, etc., are even more lightweight. might want to have a look at icewm
