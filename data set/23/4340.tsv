2007-09-13T10:11:00.000Z	marioosz		where is it defined that when i press alt+f2 the console switches to /dev/tty2 ? i mean how can i map key that if i press lets say alt+f12 it doesnt switch the console to /dev/tty12 but to /dev/my_own_tty ?
2007-09-13T10:13:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	marioosz	i imagine the workings of alt+ctrl+f1-7 are defined somewhere very deep down in the operating system, maybe even in the kernel
2007-09-13T10:15:00.000Z	marioosz	howlingmadhowie	i mean just alt+f1-6 actually - the ones that switch virtual consoles
2007-09-13T10:16:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	marioosz	to be exact, ctrl+alt+f1-7 change to different consoles, the x-server happens to run on the 7th :)
2007-09-13T10:19:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	marioosz	however, i may well be incorrect with my assertion that the effect of ctrl+alt+f1-7 is written into the kernel. i remember hearing that ctrl-alt-del for example is now outside of the kernel in a configuration file. maybe i can find it...
2007-09-13T10:21:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		nrx: that is unusual. almost all wireless cards support wep-encryption. are you sure you are entering the right sort of key? (hexidecimal, 128bit for example)
2007-09-13T10:22:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		nrx: knowing that other pcs are working fine should make it easier to narrow the problem down :)
2007-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		nrx: what sort of wireless card do you have? maybe the linux driver has some problems.
2007-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : that is unusual
2007-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	marioosz	howlingmadhowie	somone said to read keymaps man page
2007-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : have you tried a packet sniffer? something like ethereal? maybe that can tell you what's going wrong
2007-09-13T10:24:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	marioosz	looking at the manpage that seems to be exactly what you're looking for :)
2007-09-13T10:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : the packet sniffer under ubuntu is called "wireshark". this will allow you to record the traffic between your laptop and your router while they are negotiating a dhcp-lease
2007-09-13T10:27:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : then it will allow you to see all packets transmitted between the router and the laptop while negotiating an entry in the routing table of the router :)
2007-09-13T10:28:00.000Z	marioosz	howlingmadhowie	looks like that... but i still dont know how its happened that alt+f3 is bint to the /etc/event.d/tty3 event :(   $ dumpkeys | grep tty gives me zero result
2007-09-13T10:28:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	marioosz	it is unusual that alt+f3 does anything. are you sure you don't mean ctrl+alt+f3?
2007-09-13T10:29:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : the way i see this, without more knowledge, nothing much can be done. how do you know the laptop isn't connected to the router?
2007-09-13T10:30:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : have you tried setting your ip-address manually?
2007-09-13T10:31:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : and entering essid and password using iwconfig?
2007-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : that may well unfortunately be necessary, but it can be done quite easily :)
2007-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : i'm afraid i don't know anything about the errors.
2007-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		thanks hjmills :)
2007-09-13T10:35:00.000Z	marioosz	howlingmadhowie	probably yes :)
