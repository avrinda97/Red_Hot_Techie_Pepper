2005-09-06T16:56:00.000Z	icheyne		I'm having problems with enabling DMA on the DVD writer I just installed. I can't find the right /dev/foo device. Can anyone help?
2005-09-06T16:57:00.000Z	DVSoftware	icheyne	what did hdparm told you?
2005-09-06T16:57:00.000Z	icheyne		and /dev/cdrom and /dev/hdc
2005-09-06T16:58:00.000Z	icheyne	DVSoftware	it said that dma is disabled
2005-09-06T16:58:00.000Z	DVSoftware		then enable it
2005-09-06T16:59:00.000Z	DVSoftware	icheyne	-d 1
2005-09-06T16:59:00.000Z	icheyne	DVSoftware	but it won't work
