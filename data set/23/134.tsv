2012-06-07T15:51:00.000Z	Kowalczyk		is what I got
2012-06-07T15:52:00.000Z	Kowalczyk		will see now..
2012-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 you are using the LILO boot loader?
2012-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	I had that on slackware. but I formated the partition. so shouldnt be any problem
2012-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 formating a filesystem does not erase the MBR boot loader.
2012-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 it definatly looks like LILO is booting. You can 'dd' the mbr and zero it out then repariton if you want to.
2012-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 is the hard drive empty?
2012-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	no.
2012-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 you aer going to boot this hard drive? or is some other drive booting?
2012-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 well for some reason GRUB did not install like it should to the MBR and erase lilo.
2012-06-07T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 id follow the 'fix grub' guides and reinstall grub.
2012-06-07T16:01:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	thank you.. booting from live cd now. will see if it works
2012-06-07T16:06:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	configuring grub-pc. it ask me if I want to remove the grub 2 files. hmm
2012-06-07T16:11:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	thank you so much :) that worked
2012-06-07T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 weird that the installer miss-installed grub
2012-06-07T16:13:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	ya... but at least it worked..
2012-06-07T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 what video card?
2012-06-07T16:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 so the system is not booting right?
2012-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 you installed the nvidia drivers yet?
2012-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 you ran the nvidia-settings tool?
2012-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kowalczyk	 there ya go.. You dont use the normal monitors/display tool with nvidia drivers. You use the nvidia-settings tool
2012-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	Dr_Willis	that did the trick :D
