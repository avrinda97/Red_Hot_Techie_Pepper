2005-04-01T07:32:00.000Z	Sero		Can anyone tell me what's good about Ubuntu?
2005-04-01T07:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	would you rephrase that question?
2005-04-01T07:35:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	timed release schedule (every 6 months), 18 months of support following each stable release, desktop-centric distro, focus on stabilised current software
2005-06-10T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	that's because there is no alsaconf in alsa-utils
2005-06-10T09:44:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	what sound card do you have?
2005-06-10T09:45:00.000Z	Sero	crimsun	Creative Labs SB Live 7.1
2005-06-10T09:46:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	you need the snd_ca0106 driver
2005-06-10T09:46:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	it's not available in the default hoary install, but you can compile alsa-source from universe
2005-06-10T09:47:00.000Z	Sero	crimsun	from Universe?
2005-06-10T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	yes
2005-06-10T09:50:00.000Z	Sero	crimsun	I do not know what universe it.... and google was stressing the literal definition of it... or not telling me when I added Ubuntu in the search.

2005-06-14T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	you need the snd_ca0106 driver
2005-06-14T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	search the ubuntu forums for instructions from me on compiling alsa-source from universe to enable your sblive 7.1
2005-06-14T10:45:00.000Z	Sero	crimsun	the only thing I can find in the forums are just threads that say, "thanks to crimsun in irc I was able to figure it out"
2005-06-14T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	did you search for "ca0106"?
2005-06-16T07:51:00.000Z	Sero	crimsun	are you there?
2005-06-16T08:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Sero	what sort of problems are you having?
