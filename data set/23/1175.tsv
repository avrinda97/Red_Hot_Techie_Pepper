2010-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	jmyeom		netbeans, i liked it, but, dident at the same time :O
2010-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	Hilikus		i like emacs better
2010-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	Hilikus		idk, i don't think so, i usually prefer fancy IDE's. but for text editing i prefer emacs over vim
2010-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	Hilikus		how can you program ANYTHING without autocompletion
2010-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	jmyeom		yes, thats reminds me, miens a dual core, so im dl the 64 bit, all most stuff work, or shall i got 32?

2010-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	Hilikus	jmyeom	at some point i had problems with flash in 64bits, but that was like a year ago
2010-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	jmyeom		haha, flash
2010-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	jmyeom		almost as bad as java
2010-07-23T09:43:00.000Z	jmyeom		right
