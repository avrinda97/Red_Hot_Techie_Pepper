2008-12-24T16:32:00.000Z	moza		i typed export "http_proxy=" in a terminal, and then did apt-get update
2008-12-24T16:32:00.000Z	moza		since then, my graphical synaptic tells me that some updates are available (for openoffice.org and so on)
2008-12-24T16:33:00.000Z	moza		but when it tries to connect to internet to get the packages, the error is "403 forbidden"
2008-12-24T16:34:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	sounds like proxyerror
2008-12-24T16:35:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	i don't need a proxy where i am right now
2008-12-24T16:36:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	so start apt in a shell with no set proxy?
2008-12-24T16:36:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	execute the command once in 2 seconds :)
2008-12-24T16:37:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	i did that, but my apt didn't install the updates
2008-12-24T16:37:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	did u update before upgrading?
2008-12-24T16:40:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	i did a lot of things lately... 0)starting with a fully working 8.04 ubuntu+kde3.5 1)update of 8.04 2)upgrade to 8.10 3)be afraid of kde4 4)trying to get back to kde3 (not possible under 8.10) 5)installing back 8.04 from a live cd and keeping my /home 6)facing a lot of problems with my internet connection...
2008-12-24T16:40:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	gnome>kde :D   but anyway, do aptitude update then upgrade and see if it works
2008-12-24T16:41:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	that wont upgrade you to ibex
2008-12-24T16:41:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	as long as you use the right/original sources
2008-12-24T16:42:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	anything more than this?
2008-12-24T16:42:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	like a few more lines of the console....
2008-12-24T16:42:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	doing the upgrade right now
2008-12-24T16:43:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	the upgrade is working just fine, thanks for telling me that it wouldn't upgrade to ibex :)
2008-12-24T16:44:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	u r welcome :)
2008-12-24T16:44:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	btw, i think best practice is using "save-upgrade"... just for future use....
2008-12-24T16:45:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	does it save the current settings just in case?
2008-12-24T16:46:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	it just upgrades packets taht you already have on your systems to more recent version, and only breakes packeges once in a while :D
2008-12-24T16:46:00.000Z	moza	nibbler	ok, thanks, i take good note of this, save-upgrade :)
2008-12-24T16:47:00.000Z	nibbler	moza	safe, not save
