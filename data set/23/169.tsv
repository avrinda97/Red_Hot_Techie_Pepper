2012-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	james__		is it possible to boot ubuntu without a bootloader installed? like maybe from usb key?
2012-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	yes and manually, why?
2012-09-23T05:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		bootloader in the mbr though, you need grub
2012-09-23T05:39:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	grub failed to install, i assume its because my laptop uses uefi so now that the system is installed, ill just use a usb drive to boot into it from now on
2012-09-23T05:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		james__Ah uefi this a dual boot with another OS?
2012-09-23T05:41:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	i would like to dual boot but with linux on the internal hard drive and windows on a usb hard drive
2012-09-23T05:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	Which windows I don't think it will run continuously on a usb.
2012-09-23T05:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		MS does not like that W8 might be the only one that will.
2012-09-23T05:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		otay
2012-09-23T05:46:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	windows 7 is what im planning booting from an external usb 3 hard drive haha
2012-09-23T05:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		in the words of eddie murphy playing buckwheat
2012-09-23T05:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	You ever try the ubuntu forums with this dual boot thought on the internal HD?
2012-09-23T05:50:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	no i havent, i assumed that it could be done, i want to do it for gaming only and use linux on the internal drive for my daily work
2012-09-23T05:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	Try the forums, your assumptions are not working. I think there are problems with windows in a uefi and running ubuntu, not sure really, I have not had to mess with a uefi.
2012-09-23T05:53:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	ok, im not really concerned with windows, i just need to have linux boot normally
2012-09-23T05:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	Is this a computer that has to have uefi?
2012-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	james__		yes
2012-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	actually, i think so
2012-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	i dont see any options on turning it off
2012-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	Post your setup on the forums and relax for some help if you do not get it here.
2012-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	ok, i think for now i will see if i can get a thumbdrive to act as my bootloader for linux until this uefi can be sorted out
2012-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	james__	I would just use supergrub on the thumb.
2012-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	james__	wilee-nilee	thanks for the help, i will look into supergrub
