2010-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	almoxarife		compiz won't startup when the system is loaded, I can loaded it once I am in a gdm session though, when I run 'compiz' from terminal it loads with all my settings in place, how do I repair it so that it starts from startup?
2010-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Install simple-ccsm and select Custom in Sys>Prefs>Appearance>Visual Effects tab
2010-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	thnks
2011-07-12T08:18:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Oh yea, network-manager caused me many pains
2011-07-12T08:19:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Firs thing I do: chmod -x $(which NetworkManager) :)
2011-07-12T08:21:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	It was hilarious and right on point
2011-07-12T08:26:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Yes, and he can even scan for AP's successfully
2011-07-12T08:27:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	I went through the basics with him already
2011-07-12T08:27:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Basically, NetworkManager is just configured incorrectly
2011-09-09T09:47:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Either way, 11.10 is not supported here yet
2011-11-01T13:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	lagging?
2011-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Just keep it down please
2011-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	fair enough
2012-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	this is why people rely on terminal, its impossible to point to a graphics option
2012-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Yes that's why I prefer cli in most cases
2012-02-26T15:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	installing and having a working nvidia configured wubi install
2012-02-26T15:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	the card is there
2012-02-26T15:57:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Clearly, or else he wouldn't be able to see the screen

2012-02-26T16:09:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	Did you have him remove jockey in pm?
2012-02-26T16:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	dont make accusations, and no
2012-02-26T16:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	soreau	i dont do PM
2012-02-26T16:14:00.000Z	soreau	almoxarife	I suspect he already has ubuntu-desktop installed.. perhaps you mean with --reinstall?
