2005-11-30T13:10:00.000Z	mrkoje		Hello everybody! What is the best way to install 3rd party software? I can't seem to find them using apt-get
2005-11-30T13:11:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 depends on what... tho if not in apt, then get some .deb packages.
2005-11-30T14:39:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	 Its all about permissions and firewalls!
2005-11-30T14:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 hehe i get this in dmesg:           smbfs: mount_data version 1684370019 is not supported
2005-11-30T14:39:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	1st make sure your firewall on the windows machine is allowing connections
2005-11-30T14:40:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	eek
2005-11-30T14:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 hehe i think its cos of ntfs
2005-11-30T14:40:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	i guess... I have ntfs on my windows shares and its fine
2005-11-30T14:41:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	Have you gotten any windows shares to work?
2005-11-30T14:41:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	have you tried using SWAT
2005-11-30T14:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 nope,
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 getting it now.
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	ok, well assuming that you do have folders on your windows machine shared and your firewall configs are set right my best advice is to try SWAT
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 i do have all that.
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	SWAT saved my sanity
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 what is it?
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	Samba Web Admin Tool
2005-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	aftertaf	mrkoje	 for accessing windows shares too?
2005-11-30T14:44:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	another thing I found odd is that besides smbd and nmbd, I also had to run winbind
2005-11-30T14:44:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	it will set up smb client and daemon on your computer
2005-11-30T14:46:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	I think you may also need a "SMB USER" to be the same exact user that is on your windows machiens
2005-11-30T14:46:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	I apologize but it has been a little while since I had to last screw around with samba. Good thing is I guess is once you get it up it stays working :)
2005-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	mrkoje	aftertaf	I did what doogles said about installing the smbfs on my laptop and doinga  modprobe cifs and it worked fine
