2012-02-06T02:38:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	open a terminal and type alsamixer
2012-02-06T02:42:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	ive got alsamixer open in terminal, now what am I looking for?
2012-02-06T02:42:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	any of them muted? (MM)
2012-02-06T02:42:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	I dont see anything that looks muted
2012-02-06T02:43:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	can you post a screenshot?
2012-02-06T02:44:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	I could if I knew how

2012-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	wow, something is wrong there if thats all you got
2012-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	and I didnt do anything to make it happen, it just up and quit working
2012-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	did the sound used to work at some point?
2012-02-06T02:53:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	yes, it worked for a long time, then about 2 weeks ago I upgraded to 11.04; but it did work for 2 weeks, until last night.
2012-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	recently installed any ppas?
2012-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	apps?
2012-02-06T02:55:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	I dont think so. At least I do not remember doing so.
2012-02-06T02:56:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	recently changed any hardware?
2012-02-06T02:56:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	no. havent done anything in months
2012-02-06T02:57:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	in that case i have no idea why the sound suddenly stopped working (i've never trusted doing upgrades though, i always fresh install)
2012-02-06T02:58:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	yeah, i held off for a longt time becuase I had these problems last time I upgraded. Now what?
2012-02-06T02:59:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	backup what you need and fresh install? up to you. or you can see if someone better than me can help (don't worry, i'm rather a novice so someone better shouldn't be hard to find)
2012-02-06T03:00:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	auronandace	okay, thanks for your help.
2012-02-06T03:00:00.000Z	auronandace	Trfsrfr	no worries :)
