2006-09-25T07:29:00.000Z	KromiX		This is my first time trying to install ubuntu on my 2nd box and it goes to the loading screen and does all those [OK] 's then it loads a rectangular box that says Ubuntu and shows Windom Manager, then it disapears and I see 2 white bars on the top and bottom part of the screen with a brown background but nothing happens...... Any suggestions/Ideas what this means i really wanna try out Ubuntu ;\
2006-09-25T07:29:00.000Z	KromiX		the CD Drive keeps blinking but doesnt seem like anything happens....
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	KromiX		whats the minimum memory for Ubuntu?
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	KromiX		?
2006-09-25T07:31:00.000Z	KromiX		oh i guess thats my issue, I'm running 128MB DDR PC3200, I was thinking thats enough, I can run windows Xp profession on that but not ubuntu? ;\
2006-09-25T07:31:00.000Z	KromiX		i would think xp pro would require more memory then ubuntu
2006-09-25T07:32:00.000Z	KromiX		i guess i have to steal another stick from my 3rd box
2006-09-25T07:32:00.000Z	KromiX		lol
2006-09-25T07:32:00.000Z	KromiX		i never listen to 'minumum requirements' :P
2006-09-25T07:33:00.000Z	KromiX		and didnt think twice cause xp pro runs on it
2006-09-25T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	installer, not the system itself.
2006-09-25T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	since it's a liveCD, it requires more memory, to not be reading from the CD (read: slow) all the time
2006-09-25T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	which is why the alternate ISO requires signifigantly less
2006-09-25T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	just get the alternate ISO ;)
2006-09-25T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	no, it's not.  It just doesn't have a pretty interface
2006-09-25T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	yep
2006-09-25T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	how did you install it?
2006-09-25T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	did you select the oem mode? or what?
2006-09-25T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	heh, oem is for people distributing the computer, it leaves all the user config stuff until afterwards.  You actually don't have your first user set up yet, just an 'oem' user
2006-09-25T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	login with your user (oem/whatever password), open a terminal do: sudo oem-config-prepare, then reboot
2006-09-25T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview
2006-09-25T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	why do you feel the need to do that?
2006-09-25T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	KromiX	so, instlal kubuntu then ;)  you can actually have them both on the same system, no problem (assuming you have teh HD space)
