2009-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	getxsick		how can i change default application for images for mc?
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	gnome does it one way. kde does it another. ect..
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	mc = midnight commander?
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	what about gnome?
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	yes
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	midnightcommander has a configuration file right?
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	getxsick		i think there is somehting in my $HOME
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	Melio		try .mc
2009-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	Melio		or something to that effect in /home/userid
2009-06-22T05:50:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	there is .mc directory
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	look inside that .mc dir and see if there's something that you can read and edit it may contain a method of changing what it uses to open files
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	this is the typical method for all applications, linuxwide
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	actually i have already checked it, and didn't find anything useful there
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	maby lacking a .conf or file to configure it. it uses defualts
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	i remember that there was some mime setting in global system, just don't remember there
2009-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	with one, it may use it if defined at start/launch
2009-06-22T05:53:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	http://www.chm.tu-dresden.de/edv/mc/mc4.5/manual1.html
2009-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	getxsick		thx Melio
2009-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	no sweat
2009-06-22T05:59:00.000Z	Melio		I havent used MC for like 15 years
2009-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	getxsick	Melio	anyway it's still doesn't work. but i will figure out :)
2009-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	Melio	getxsick	I would probably be better off with a command line in my case
