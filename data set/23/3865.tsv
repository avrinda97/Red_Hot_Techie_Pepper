2008-10-26T00:31:00.000Z	NetEcho		its as simple as fdisk not wanting to write what I tell it to write
2008-10-26T00:32:00.000Z	NetEcho		if I format the drive completely and re-install ubuntu it'd be fine but I don't feel like making that much work considering I need to also format my desktop system today
2008-10-26T00:34:00.000Z	NetEcho		Is Intrepid fairly stable?
2008-10-26T00:34:00.000Z	NetEcho		for a RC?
2008-10-26T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	if hardy works, dont fix it
2008-10-26T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	have you checked its health?
2008-10-26T00:30:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	health of a partition that I'm trying to format?
2008-10-26T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	id get the tool from the manufacturers sitre and check it
2008-10-26T00:31:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	what the heck are you talking about?
2008-10-26T00:35:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	if it isn't broken but I'm bored I fix it, plus the fact that fdisk can't make any changes to my HDD is annoying me so I'm gonna probably end up having to format
2009-09-04T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	rar runs fine here, mind you i havent used file > 20Mb
2009-09-04T14:46:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	RAR is propriatary and has worse preformance under linux/unix than its WinRAR counterpart
2009-09-29T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	grab the minimal CD and boot from that
2009-09-29T04:01:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	you can't put a cd into a drive when the machine is over 10000km away
2009-09-29T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	you can, with drac ;)
2009-09-29T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	i do it every day
2009-09-29T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	yes drac provides a virtual floppy and cd drive
2009-09-29T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	you of course need a drac card and a drac compatible server but it is possible
2009-09-29T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	configure a pxe server and boot from it
2009-09-29T04:03:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	what now? lol
2009-09-29T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	if you configure a pxe server you can make the server boot from that
2009-09-29T04:04:00.000Z	NetEcho	ActionParsnip	and if something screws up when it trys to boot into that PXE server, then I have no way of getting the server to boot back into the current distro
2009-09-29T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NetEcho	could be hard but may be possibe. I know of a distro that has a public pxe server and an ISO you can boot to to kick it off, just cant remember the name
