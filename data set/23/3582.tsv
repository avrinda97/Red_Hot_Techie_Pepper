2008-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	What irc client are you using
2008-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	pidgin
2008-03-13T05:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	That is not one of the more popular ones.  check into xchat, knoversation or irissi
2008-03-13T07:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	Please dont suggest that
2008-03-13T07:09:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	suggest single user? why not? he does not have a root password
2008-03-13T07:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	Better to see what he want to do...that he needs root
2008-03-13T07:12:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	ok, i just saw that someone didn't have their root pass so i suggested single usering and setting root. I don't see any harm in that.
2008-03-13T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	We do not suggest people set root password.
2008-03-13T07:13:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	how come?
2008-03-13T07:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	It isnt necessary , it is the policy of the channel...
2008-03-13T07:15:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	really? hmm ok ty
2008-03-13T07:15:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	what would you suggest instead? for a user that cannot gain root?
2008-03-13T07:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	this is not up for debate in this rrom, feel free to discuss in -offtopic .. sudo or gksudo will do what they need
2008-06-03T17:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	We have envyng in our repos
2008-06-03T17:09:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	thats what i have installed..
2008-06-03T17:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	but did you install the web envy first
2008-06-03T17:10:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	i don't believe so
2008-06-03T17:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	I have seen a few problems where people used the regular envy then tried envyng from our repo..  I still have no answer for that
2008-06-03T17:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	youdo it by channel.. right click
2008-06-03T17:16:00.000Z	polishpaul	Jack_Sparrow	right.. that's why i'm perplexed.. its not there! ive used xchat before.. are there different versions?
2008-06-03T17:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	xchat or xchat gnome
2008-06-03T17:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	polishpaul	ah...   try regular schat.. it has a higher user satisfaction rating inhere
