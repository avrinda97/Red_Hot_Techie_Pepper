2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	lupine_85		you don't want to use standard ubuntu on a CF card
2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	lupine_85		it'll break it rather nastily
2006-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	lupine_85		(frequent writes)
2006-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	lupine_85		If it's a hard drive, then ubuntu will work fine - a p2 equivalent isn't exactly embedded, TBH ;)
2006-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	lupine_85		however, you might want to look at AspisOS as an alternative
2006-08-22T05:06:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's incredible
2006-08-22T05:06:00.000Z	lupine_85		can you put the hard drive in your PC temporarily?
2006-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	lupine_85		(if not, it'll be a pain to get ubuntu on - but possible)
2006-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	lupine_85		yes, but when you write repeatedly to a CF card, it b0rks it
2006-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	that's true, but it has to be a very large number of writes
2006-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	that' true, I disable logging on my CF card devices
2006-08-22T05:29:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	well, yes and no.  if there are no instructions registered, it does nothing.  so, technically, it is running, but actually ...
2006-08-24T13:00:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	also top lets you kill perhaps a bit more easily than just cli, but without needing the gui
2006-08-24T13:35:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	that's true, but I don't know the file system type
2006-08-25T09:30:00.000Z	lupine_85	sethk	depends on the app
2006-09-07T05:14:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	ext3 is the most commonly used, and doesn't have the reliability problems that reiserfs has
2006-09-07T05:14:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	I've been hearing, for years, "no reliability problems since version 2", "no reliability problems since version 3", ...
2006-09-07T05:19:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	well, literally true  :)
2006-09-07T05:28:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	yes, he knows, he wants to change the permissions after launching it.
2006-09-07T05:30:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	yes, once you've confirmed the nature of the problem.
2006-09-07T06:19:00.000Z	lupine_85	sethk	looks like the firmware is all that's missing
2006-09-07T06:20:00.000Z	sethk	lupine_85	indeed, but it isn't missing because the directory isn't there
