2011-03-17T18:54:00.000Z	blz		Are there any native disk image solutions for ubuntu that are comparable to Acronis True Image?  Specifically, I need to be able to make incremental image-based backups on a schedule.  Ideally compressed.
2011-03-17T18:56:00.000Z	usr13	blz	so you want to periodically make images of your whole hard drive?
2011-03-17T18:56:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 exactly, but incrementally
2011-03-17T18:57:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 i.e.:  I want image n+1 to include only the changes since image n
2011-03-17T18:57:00.000Z	usr13	blz	That's gonna take a lot of space.  Where do you  intend to store these images?
2011-03-17T18:58:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 that's why compression would be ideal, along with the incremental versioning.  I have a solution for the storage
2011-03-17T18:58:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 that solution being a big eSATA drive
2011-03-17T18:59:00.000Z	usr13	blz	I don't think the drive type matters much
2011-03-17T18:59:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 well the speed sure as hell will ;-)
2011-03-17T19:00:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Well, I've done a partition at a time like this:  dd if=/dev/hda | ssh $user@host 'gzip - > /home/user/image.gz'
2011-03-17T19:00:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Or:  dd if=/dev/hda1 | ssh $user@$host 'gzip - > /pub/image.gz'
2011-03-17T19:01:00.000Z	usr13	blz	You could just as easily do the whole drive, but, well, just never saw the need in it.
2011-03-17T19:01:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 i considered that, but there's two problems.  1)  no incremental backup (afaik), and 2) it stores *everything* including unused space... Which is kind of a waste of time/space
2011-03-17T19:02:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 mondo looked promising, but it seems as though they expect you to save it in n number of .iso's and burn them for recovery.
2011-03-17T19:03:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Well, I guess that is as far as I got with backing up stuff.  I just back up my /home partition and am not all that concerned about applications and the rest.
2011-03-17T19:08:00.000Z	usr13	blz	One other thing I've done is to install two identical HDs in a PC and periocically ghost one to the other, (master to slave).  I've done that on servers
2011-03-17T19:08:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 that might be worhtwhile.  I imagine, using dd?
2011-03-17T19:09:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Yes
2011-03-17T19:09:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Set it up as a cron job
2011-03-17T19:36:00.000Z	blz	usr13	BluesKaj, llutz_:  for what it's worth, I think I found what I'm looking for:  http://www.fsarchiver.org/Main_Page
2011-06-17T17:18:00.000Z	blz	usr13	 i believe iptables is installed by default
2011-06-17T17:19:00.000Z	usr13	blz	Yes, you are correct, iptables is installed by default.
2011-06-17T17:19:00.000Z	usr13	blz	And iptables rules can be used for firewalling.
