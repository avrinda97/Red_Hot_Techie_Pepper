2007-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	Freaken		Hi everyone, I am trying to figure out how to use a 1440*900 resolution with a GeForce 4 TI 4200, it works under Windows but the max I can get under Ubuntu is 1152*864
2007-10-26T06:28:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	edit xorg.conf
2007-10-26T06:28:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	is there a tutorial on how to do that somewhere ? I'm pretty new with command line :s
2007-10-26T06:30:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	type this in terminal sudo gedit /etc/X11/sorg.conf
2007-10-26T06:37:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	What do I need to change in xorg.conf to allow 1440*900 ?
2007-10-26T06:38:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	do u see any resolutions in this file?
2007-10-26T06:39:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	I do see a lot of resolutions, but I can't find a way to specify which one to allow or to disallow
2007-10-26T06:39:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	copy paste ur file into pastebin.ca
2007-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	http://pastebin.ca/749934
2007-10-26T06:43:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	what resolution u want?
2007-10-26T06:43:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	1440*900, native resolution for my LCD
2007-10-26T06:44:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	what resolution u have now? Also goto System - Prefernces - Screen Resolution and tell me if u see an option for the resolution u want
2007-10-26T06:45:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	Already done, I can't select it, I am currently in 1152*864
2007-10-26T06:45:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	In fact, 1152*864 is the highest resolution I can see
2007-10-26T06:46:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	make a copy of ur current xorg.conf file
2007-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	Already donbe
2007-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	as andycr suggested change 1400x1400 to 1400x900 for all
2007-10-26T06:48:00.000Z	Freaken	FluxD	& andycr: Thnx v.much, I'll try that out, but is there a reason why I don't see 1280x1024 nor 1280x960 too ?
2007-10-26T06:49:00.000Z	FluxD	Freaken	depends on ur monitor/LCD conifg
