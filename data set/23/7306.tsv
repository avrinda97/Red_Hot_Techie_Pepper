2008-10-11T14:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	gmail is web-based, isn't it?
2008-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Linux is not an "application" that you can run in windows. Linux us an operating system. As you may or may not know windows also requires a partition on the harddisk to run.
2008-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	You can re-partition your drive without loosing data.
2008-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	It's not more complicated than moving a slider. However when doing low-level operations on your disk I always recomend having backups of non-replacable data.
2008-10-11T14:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Well, having those backups is a good idea in any case.
2008-10-11T14:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	When I say "backup" I do mean "copy to removable media and store in a safe place".
2008-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	You are aware that linux and windows do not (automatically) run the same programs and games, do you not?
2008-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm might be a good read. :)
2008-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Finally I urge you to read http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm so that you realize that Linux is not Windows.
2008-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	First off. To install any operating system you will need to know abit more about your hardware than you appear to do. Now, Ubuntu has come a long way in helping set up things automatically, but not everything works out of the box.
2008-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Secondly, you can boot from the desktop cd and try Ubuntu. If it is something you may want to use on a regular basis then you may concider installing it.
2008-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Also, when you want to install another operating system, be it linux, *bsd or beos, then you need to set aside a partition or dedicated space on your harddrive for that operating system.
2008-10-11T14:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Please read the link.
2008-10-11T14:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	You would have to have spelled it to join this channel, wouldn't you?
2008-10-11T14:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	Still there's a high probability that #ubuntu is shown somewhere in your chat client.
2008-10-11T14:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ecmuller	That's a personal opinion and more suited for #ubuntu-offtopic
