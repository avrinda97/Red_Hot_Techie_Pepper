2005-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	Did that comment make you feel better?
2005-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	what?
2005-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	Go listen (read) the lyrics to an old Cure song.  "Jumping someone else's train".
2005-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	"If you pick, up on it quick, you can say you were there..."
2005-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	you can say you were there.
2005-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	no thanks... I could give a fuck about cure... please explain your comment.
2005-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	you were the dork that said "most have been for a while"  implying some sort of elite status.
2005-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it.
2005-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	you were the one that thought it was cool to state "I'm using hoary"  :/
2005-03-25T09:47:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	I am quite proud to be using it.
2005-03-25T09:47:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	why?
2005-03-25T09:47:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	I am a very happy and proud Ubuntu user.
2005-03-25T09:47:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	if you are not, then... perhaps you aren't using the right distro.
2005-03-25T09:48:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	huh? nice conclusion...
2005-03-25T09:48:00.000Z	occy	lunitik	go troll somewhere else please.
2005-03-25T09:49:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	I'm not trolling...
2005-03-25T09:49:00.000Z	lunitik	occy	do me a favor... just don't address me, k?
