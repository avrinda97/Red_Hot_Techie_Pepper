2009-08-07T15:34:00.000Z	kbp		does anyone know how to set file associate for Amarok? Amarok doesn't play mp3 files as default
2009-08-07T15:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	you mean you want to set amarok to be the default app for opening mp3s?
2009-08-07T15:36:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	yes I mean it
2009-08-07T15:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	are you on kde?
2009-08-07T15:37:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	but it doesn't remember (next time it's opened using other app). I'm on Ubuntu 9.04 Gnome
2009-08-07T15:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	well, beats me. i don't have gnome.
2009-08-07T15:37:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	isnt Ubuntu always on Gnome?
2009-08-07T15:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	the naming is confusing. Ubuntu does come with gnome, but you can remove gnome and you'd still have ubuntu.
2009-08-07T15:40:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	is kde for slower pc? I have never used kde before so I have no idea :)
2009-08-07T15:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	no, kde tends to be more resource-hungry. xfce is lighter.
2009-08-07T15:41:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	so is there any reason you chose kde instead of gnome?
2009-08-07T15:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	i didn't. i use fluxbox.
2009-08-07T15:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	fluxbox is fast, and i like it.
2009-08-07T15:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	but it doesn't have as many bells and whistles as the popular desktop environments.
2009-08-07T15:42:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	yea I use something-box before and it's fast (fluxbox is developed from that something-box I think)
2009-08-07T15:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	openbox or blackbox
2009-08-07T15:45:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	I think it was 2 months ago I used openbox for my server, for some reason I need to open firefox with flash, and after 4hrs, the flash content is freeze. Gnome doesn't have that issue
2009-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	ah. flash causes trouble for me too, no matter what desktop.
2009-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	it's just freeze when there is no keyboard/mouse activity (since it was server app) but it didnt crash firefox. It worked back as soon as I moved mouse curson :) It took me age to try to fix it but I gave up and used gnome :)
2009-08-17T11:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	sudo mount -a
2009-08-17T11:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	that'll mount everything in your fstab file.
2009-08-17T11:20:00.000Z	kbp	prince_jammys	it did the trick! thank you very much! :)
2009-08-17T11:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	kbp	welcome
