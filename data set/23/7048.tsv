2007-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	beginn3r		how come #xubuntu is so quiet?
2007-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	uses fewer resources that way.
2007-01-18T17:44:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	Xubuntu
2007-01-18T17:45:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	too  bad xubuntu haven't  got  the evolution-alarm-notify fixed  yey
2007-01-18T17:46:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	so then fix the bug, wait for a fix, or buy a new machine.
2007-01-18T17:46:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	I believe if I can get a new machine I would do that
2007-01-18T17:46:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	so then choose one of the other 2 options i gave you
2007-01-18T17:48:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	no, the solution is "fix it yourself, or wain for a fix"
2007-01-18T17:48:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	, so is the a solution to normally  given  to new users, to fix the buys ourselves?
2007-01-18T17:49:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	a chroot does not improve performance. why are you using a chroot?
2007-01-18T17:49:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	no, the solution is "fix it yourself, or wain for a fix"
2007-01-18T17:49:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	in Windows you *cannot* fix it yourself. all you can do is wait.
2007-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	because if you're too poor to buy a computer, a Vista license is just another expense
2007-01-18T17:52:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	yes I am poor? So? Shouldn't  that  what open source software  all about..so that poor people like me given the chance to do our work with free sofrware?
2007-01-18T17:52:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	i'm sorry the answer isn't "here! download this installer and run it and all your problems will be solved with no effort on your part!" life is like that, dude. ;)
2007-01-18T17:53:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	I am  not asking  for  a  point  and click  sol ution
2007-01-18T17:53:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	so, do some work and fix the bug. or, if you can't don't complain about people not doing the work for you.
2007-01-18T17:54:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	not every  bugs is easy  to  fix
2007-01-18T17:54:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	Xubuntu, or Evolution?
2007-01-18T17:54:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	yes
2007-01-18T17:56:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	that is an Evolution bug, not XFCE. it affects GNOME and KDE as well.
2007-01-18T17:57:00.000Z	beginn3r	mneptok	yes, but it seems to make xfce not  being able  to launch
2007-01-18T17:58:00.000Z	mneptok	beginn3r	so disable that Evol extension.
