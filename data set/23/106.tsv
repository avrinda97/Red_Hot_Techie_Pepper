2012-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	Elesa		/dev/sda is her internal HDD. /dev/sdc is the external one where we want to install Ubuntu.
2012-08-19T09:25:00.000Z	Elesa		Or you might try installing MATE. But I'd use Xubuntu.
2012-08-19T09:27:00.000Z	Elesa		But.. The /dev/sda won't be formatted or anything? I don't want to be responsible for a terrible mistake. x_x
2012-08-19T09:27:00.000Z	Elesa		She has to select the Format? checkbox, right?
2012-08-19T09:28:00.000Z	Elesa		Well, I don't think she really wants to open her computer, so I'll tell her to disable it on BIOS.
2012-08-19T09:29:00.000Z	Elesa		Thanks guys. =D
2012-08-19T09:29:00.000Z	Elesa		lol
2012-08-19T09:29:00.000Z	Elesa		rm -rf /* :(
2012-08-19T09:30:00.000Z	Elesa		It's not like I told someone to type that lol
2012-08-19T09:30:00.000Z	Elesa		Sorry.
2012-08-19T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	why even bother?
2012-08-19T09:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	then use unity2d, or install lubuntu
2012-08-19T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	use the 'something else' option and you can partition another storage to hold the OS
2012-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	Elesa	ActionParsnip	I just want to make sure that the internal hard drive isn't formatted by a Ubiquity bug or something..
2012-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	if you tell the installer which partition is / and which is swap, it won't use anything else
2012-08-19T09:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	it knew by looking at the existing partition table
2012-08-19T09:52:00.000Z	Elesa	ActionParsnip	I see.
2012-08-19T09:57:00.000Z	Elesa	ActionParsnip	can I PM you?
2012-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	Elesa	ActionParsnip	can I PM you? Please D:
2012-08-19T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	sure
2012-11-01T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	can you pastebin the output of:  uname -a; dpkg -l | grep linux-image
2012-11-01T05:25:00.000Z	Elesa	ActionParsnip	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1322337/
2012-11-01T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elesa	you may want to reboot to the newer kernel, then remove the other 2 kernels. You will get about 240Mb back
