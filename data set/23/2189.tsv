2009-06-03T11:32:00.000Z	jamiejackson		livecd has my soundcard working with a module called "snd_ens1370". how do i get that module in my installation? (which package would it be in?)
2009-06-03T11:32:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	was it not installed automatically?
2009-06-03T11:33:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	i added the card just tonight djdavis75
2009-06-03T11:36:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	so you put a different card in the box but it won't work?
2009-06-03T11:36:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	yeah, couldn't get the onboard device to work, so stuck a new card in there
2009-06-03T11:37:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	and the new card work on the live cd but not on the installed version?
2009-06-03T11:37:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	hmm, does it use a restricted driver?
2009-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	try running the Hardware Drivers app
2009-06-03T11:52:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	jamiejackson: hmm, does it use a restricted driver? <= no
2009-06-03T12:24:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	the snd-ens1370 modules is on my system
2009-06-03T12:24:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	it's not in /lib/modules/whatever/sound/pci ?
2009-06-03T12:26:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	i don't have a sound directory in /lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic
2009-06-03T12:26:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	/lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/kernel/sound/pci ?
2009-06-03T12:27:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	no pci dir in /lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/kernel/sound
2009-06-03T12:35:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	u probably need to reinstall the kernel modules
2009-06-03T12:38:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	which package is that?
2009-06-03T12:48:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	some of the sound modules come from linux-image-2.6.28-11-generic but your specific one does show to be owned by any package
2009-06-03T12:51:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	I looked in synaptic, that package, linux-image-2.6.28-11-generic contains that module
2009-06-03T12:51:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	I would reinstall that package
2009-06-03T12:52:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	I wouldn't think so, you should be able to safely reinstall the package
2009-06-03T12:53:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	hopefully it will work
2009-06-03T13:07:00.000Z	jamiejackson	djdavis75	that reinstall of the linux image (plus a reboot) seems to have done the trick: i heard the ubuntu greet sound on startup :)
2009-06-03T13:07:00.000Z	djdavis75	jamiejackson	cool
