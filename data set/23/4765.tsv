2007-05-24T09:23:00.000Z	m0u5e		AHA!
2007-05-24T09:23:00.000Z	m0u5e		can anyone explain to me what bcm44xx cutter does?
2007-05-24T09:24:00.000Z	m0u5e		I know that it extracts firmware information from broadcom devices, but beyond that :D
2007-05-24T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	Basically you have the drivers for your wireless card already but the card itself needs the code that runs on it's processor to be loaded by the OS when it is used, bcm43xx-fwcutter gets you this code ( firmware ) so you can use your card
2007-08-12T13:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	What problem are you having?
2007-08-12T13:36:00.000Z	m0u5e	Jordan_U	every time i play flash videos (on youtube i.e.) its slow and laggy
2007-08-24T15:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	Run it from screen?
2007-08-24T15:26:00.000Z	m0u5e	Jordan_U	but it would still be using a screen
2007-08-24T15:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	Yes, but screen uses almost no resources and you don't have to have an active xterm open cluttering things up
2007-08-25T15:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	Use grep
2007-08-25T15:23:00.000Z	m0u5e	Jordan_U	how would i use grep?
2007-08-25T15:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	ps with whatever arguments >
2007-08-25T15:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	< ps with whatever arguments > | grep <process name>
2007-08-25T15:51:00.000Z	m0u5e	Jordan_U	(this is kinda belated...) thx :D

2007-09-04T14:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	m0u5e	How did you disable gnome-screensaver?
