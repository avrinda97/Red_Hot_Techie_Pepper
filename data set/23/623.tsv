2011-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	JoshWindows		Noob question: where's the grub config file?
2011-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	JoshWindows		somewhere in /boot ?
2011-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	JoshWindows		thanks, jrmcm
2011-05-07T10:28:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	/boot/grub/grub.cfg, however editing this file is unsupported
2011-05-07T10:30:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	what is the output of `os-probe` pastebin.com
2011-05-07T10:32:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	It only detects Arch and the recovery (which it thinks is Windows)
2011-05-07T10:35:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	I think like grub and I have to say... you dont have a windows install, only a recovery... you probbally oerwrote windows with ubuntu
2011-05-07T10:35:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	Ubuntu is on /dev/sd8.
2011-05-07T10:37:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	so, can you pstebin the output of `os-probe`
2011-05-07T10:37:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	It's two lines. Arch, and recovery.
2011-05-07T10:38:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	http://pastebin.com/M0UR7Yxg
2011-05-07T10:38:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	Can you boot to /dev/sda1?
2011-05-07T10:39:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	sda1 is /boot. It's 110 MB.
2011-05-07T10:39:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	sorry /dev/sda2 i mean
2011-05-07T10:39:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	It used to be the Windows boot partition. It's possible I overwrote it on accident with Arch
2011-05-07T10:41:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	Im sticking with my story that you no longer have a windows install... but at anyrate if your running arch, you should use it to manage grub... ubuntu likes to "make things their own"
2011-05-07T10:41:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	GParted tells me sda2 is ntfs, 175 GB.
2011-05-07T10:42:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	try to boot to it
2011-05-07T10:42:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	I don't know how.
2011-05-07T10:43:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	press C at the grub menu
2011-05-07T10:44:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	Done. All I remember is chainloader +1
2011-05-07T10:46:00.000Z	pfifo	JoshWindows	theres a couple more important things, between "help" and google you should be able to point it to your sda2, heres my entry http://pastebin.com/5FQEQsPh
2011-05-07T11:01:00.000Z	JoshWindows	pfifo	The most I can get out of it is "invalid signature."
