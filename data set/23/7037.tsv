2005-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	your CD burning software should verify its contents for you.
2005-10-27T05:58:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	then maybe it's your hardware that has the problem. Bad RAM perhaps.
2005-10-27T05:59:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	that makes no sense I have had a million different OS's on here, I have win XP on another PART working fine, i installed warty fine after it failed  aeon17x
2005-10-27T06:00:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	it never hurts to test it.
2005-10-27T06:01:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	my Hardware is fine, I need to find out why the breezy ISO i have is not working, not inspect my hardware
2005-10-27T06:09:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	we ARE trying to get your Breezy to work, but what you do is reject our proposal even though you haven't even tried it.
2005-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	what did I reject??
2005-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	Let's see... when i told you to check your hardware?
2005-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	I checked it its fine
2005-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	my hardware is fine, I told you that
2005-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	what did you to to make sure it's fine?
2005-10-27T06:11:00.000Z	NixNewby	aeon17x	I ran a full diagnostics check on it with some software, its not the hardware, its the ISO or the Media, all I wanna know is how to find out which one..
2005-10-27T06:13:00.000Z	aeon17x	NixNewby	use a different CD then.
