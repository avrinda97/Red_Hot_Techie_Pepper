2009-06-15T11:30:00.000Z	owh		s/due/scheduled for release/
2009-06-15T11:32:00.000Z	indus	owh	stable and long term support are not related
2009-06-15T11:32:00.000Z	owh	indus	Of course they are :)
2009-06-15T11:34:00.000Z	indus	owh	LTS is for people who dont want to upgrade immediately but want to run their OS version a lot longer than other users
2009-06-15T11:34:00.000Z	owh	indus	And how is that not stable?
2009-06-15T11:35:00.000Z	owh	indus	From a sys-admin perspective, stuff that doesn't change is stable.
2009-06-15T11:36:00.000Z	indus	owh	so LTS in a way denotes stability of the installed work environment instead of the OS itslef
2009-06-15T11:37:00.000Z	indus	owh	but nvm :)
2009-06-15T11:37:00.000Z	owh	indus	My only point was that stability means different things for different people.
2009-06-15T11:38:00.000Z	indus	owh	ya i agree but non LTS doesnt mean unstable at all
2009-06-15T11:52:00.000Z	owh	indus	ROTFL
2009-06-15T11:56:00.000Z	indus	owh	imagebin.org
2009-06-15T11:58:00.000Z	owh	indus	Yes, I got it the first time - I had sent cmannn off to get a screenshot and wondered idly where they'd put it up :)
2009-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	owh	indus	The network manager works for cmann :)
2009-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	indus	owh	it does ? where i didnt see him say it
2009-06-15T12:02:00.000Z	owh	indus	He clicked on the networkmanager, fiddled and his network went away :)
2009-06-15T12:02:00.000Z	indus	owh	did he leave the channel?
2009-06-15T12:02:00.000Z	owh	indus	Yup
2009-06-15T12:02:00.000Z	indus	owh	he pm u maybe
2009-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	owh	indus	We'll see :)
2009-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	indus	owh	so problem is solved for him?
2009-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	owh	indus	He's not here anymore, so I don't know.
2009-06-15T12:04:00.000Z	owh	indus	It's like ssh-ing into a remote workstation and killing the network-manager, works really well. Just kills the ssh connection quicker than oh-no.
