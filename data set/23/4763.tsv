2007-11-05T15:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight		why do people use alternate cd over live cd?
2007-11-05T15:41:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	more installation options, lower system specs
2007-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	go to your software sources, and siable it
2007-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	disable that*
2007-11-05T15:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	| Troc_ ok
2007-11-05T15:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	it's really a preference
2007-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	based on what?
2007-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	hardware specs, what you need to do
2007-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	if you want a little more control over what's installed, you might want to use the alt cd
2007-11-05T15:48:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	what do you mean it breaks?
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	like it won't boot?
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	it starts withthe window switchers
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	try this, type: metacity --replace
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	initially i have two on install but i end up with one and the preferences are ruined
2007-11-05T15:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	i should just type that in command line as is?
2007-11-05T15:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	sudo metacity --replace
2007-11-05T15:50:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	thats if you're window manager has disappeared after you removed compiz
2007-11-05T15:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	other things are when i open apps they creep over panel and i can't exit because i can't reach or exit buttons disappear
2007-11-05T15:52:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	yeah, try sudo metacity --replace
2007-11-05T15:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	i've just done that in console but  its just not doing anything
2007-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	i did not first remove compiz though
2007-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	m0u5e	i just don't want to remove compiz again and have my system crash ... can i replace metacity first
2007-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	m0u5e	livingdaylight	i'm not sure exactly what the problem is :X
