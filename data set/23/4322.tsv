2008-03-24T05:17:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	try without binary video drivers
2008-03-24T05:17:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	without binary drivers ??
2008-03-24T05:18:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	i cant find any confirmation at google related to your specific problem. just many people with movie playing without sound
2008-03-24T05:18:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	i can hear the sound but why movie sometimes go to still and then play then still
2008-03-24T05:18:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	i mean the closed source drivers coming directly from ati/nvidia/matrox/s3
2008-03-24T05:19:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	is it just one .mkv file or any?
2008-03-24T05:20:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	just only one file
2008-03-24T05:20:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	just only one file
2008-03-24T05:20:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	it may be related to the codec. "mkv" ist just a container format
2008-03-24T05:20:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	you could try to convert that file to xvid.avi or something
2008-03-24T05:21:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	any idea how should i convert .mkv file to avi file
2008-03-24T05:21:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=567016
2008-03-24T05:22:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	or use the command line interface of ffmpeg or mencoder (see google etc.)
2008-03-24T05:36:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	any idea how long does that gonna take to convert ?
2008-03-24T05:36:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	shoudlnt take more than 10 minutes with average settings
2008-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	no its 8gb :P
2008-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	i hope your output file is not 700mb ;)
2008-03-24T05:55:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	when its gonna do the conversion does it gonna make the 8gb .avi file or 700mb file ?
2008-03-24T05:57:00.000Z	Stroganoff	tifine_	that depends on your settings in that conversion manager and of the bitrate of the mkv. you should use a bitrate between 900 and 1100 kbit/s for your output file
2008-03-24T05:58:00.000Z	tifine_	Stroganoff	I just installed the mencoder and use the simple command i.e. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MEncoder
