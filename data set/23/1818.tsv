2009-10-30T23:42:00.000Z	wsch		jesus this is getting tiring
2009-10-30T23:42:00.000Z	wsch		anyone thats into grub, please?
2009-10-30T23:42:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	what's the problem?
2009-10-30T23:43:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	installed 9.10 RC, and grub only to the partition, not the MBR of my disk
2009-10-30T23:44:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	i use BCD to start grub
2009-10-30T23:44:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	grub starts fine, however it allmost immediately gives me a CLI
2009-10-30T23:44:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	and no errors that im fast enough to read
2009-10-30T23:46:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	hrmm... sound outside my field of expertise... All I can suggest is booting a livecd and trying to reinstall grub...
2009-10-30T23:47:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	how? i need to make very sure its not installed to my MBR
2009-10-30T23:47:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	? grub can only work from the mbr... I don't understand how it can work without it.
2009-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	i have had it like this before, only on a partirion
2009-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	grub installs it's config files to a partition, but ultimately it installs a hook in your mbr to load the files from the partition
2009-10-30T23:49:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	well it didnt install anything to my MBR and yet it starts, gives me a CLI
2009-10-30T23:49:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	than that means it installed to your mbr
2009-10-30T23:49:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	ok i just went to ask in #grub
2009-10-30T23:50:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	its NOT impossible to have grub NOT on MBR
2009-10-30T23:50:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	its just RECOMMENDED to have grub on MBR
2009-10-30T23:51:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	true, it can be chainloaded from another bootloader, but something needs to be in the mbr that tells the bios what to boot
2009-10-30T23:51:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	yes BCD is on my MBR like i said
2009-10-30T23:51:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	also BCD boots grub fine
2009-10-30T23:51:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	then grub gives me its CLI allmost instantly
2009-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	ripps	wsch	I'm not familiar with BCD or how it might interfere with grub, so better to ask somebody else
2009-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	wsch	ripps	sure thanx for trying anyway
