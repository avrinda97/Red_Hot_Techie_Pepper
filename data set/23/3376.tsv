2008-07-19T10:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	Nobody knows if / when
2011-02-17T15:22:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	ok
2011-02-17T14:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	Flash unlinks the file immediately after creating it.
2011-02-17T14:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	The file is (sort of) in /tmp/.
2011-02-17T14:49:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	do u know where google chrome stores the /tmp files?
2011-02-17T14:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	If you're talking about flash videos it's flash that stores them, not chrome. And they are stored in /tmp/, but using a clever trick of Unix to make them hard to access.
2011-02-17T14:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	This script will "undelete" the files, so that they are accessible in /tmp/ like they used to be in previous versions of flash: http://pastebin.com/7DHc6eyU
2011-02-17T14:52:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	where do i put the script?
2011-02-17T14:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	Anywhere will work. If you want to use it often you might want to put it in ~/bin (create that directory if it doesn't already exist).
2011-02-17T14:55:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	do i put it on a empty file?
2011-02-17T14:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	Yes. Name it something like "undelflv" and make sure that its permissions are set to allow execution.
2011-02-17T14:59:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	so il just run the file, and start streaming the flash video?
2011-02-17T15:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	Load the video, wait for it to be completely downloaded, then run the script to copy the video file into /tmp/ where you can access it.
2011-02-17T15:00:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	ok
2011-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	it worked, but why did they change it?
2011-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	I don't know, you'd have to ask Adobe.
2011-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	ok thanks man
2011-02-17T15:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	You're welcome.
2011-02-17T15:16:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	is there an alternative to adobe flash?
2011-02-17T15:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	For some sites HTML5 video, like http://youtube.com/html5
2011-02-17T15:18:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Jordan_U	how about gnash, is it the same with adobe flash?
2011-02-17T15:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ljsoftnet	It's not very usable yet unfortunately.
