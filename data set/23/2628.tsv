2010-12-28T15:42:00.000Z	evenflow		does anyone know how can i manually unlock ubuntu10.10 from cli?
2010-12-28T15:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	unlock as in locked out of your login account?
2010-12-28T15:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	screen to unlock?  like the gdm screen?  can't you just enter the password?
2010-12-28T15:44:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	xscreensaver
2010-12-28T15:45:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	screensaver+lock is running, i want to be able to have a command to both unlock and stop the screensaver, this should be something like xscreensaver-command -d but it doesnt do the trick
2010-12-28T15:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	oh I think I understand, so if you ssh in you can unlock the screen and bring up vnc or something like that,  I'm not sure but there must be a way
2010-12-28T16:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	this might be totaly the wrong path to take but maybe x11 keystroke from cli with http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/xdotool
2010-12-28T16:25:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	even if i can change the keystrokes, i still need it to enter my password.. so im not sure about this
2010-12-28T16:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	can't you just disable the screensaver ?
2010-12-28T16:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	maybe look at http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/gnome-control-center.1.html
2010-12-28T16:28:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	even if i disable the screensaver, i still need to enter a password
2010-12-28T16:29:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	im trying to have lock/unlock of my ubuntu from my phone's bluetooth
2010-12-28T16:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	well without the screensaver it would always be online to access with vnc
2010-12-28T16:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	ok I got cha,  let me look
2010-12-28T16:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	ok I found it http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/man1/xdg-screensaver.1.html
2010-12-28T16:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	now all you need is software from your phone to triger run that line
2010-12-28T16:31:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	xdg stops the screen but not the lock
2010-12-28T16:32:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	i guess i could write a script to kill the screensaver..
2010-12-28T16:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	 reset            Turns the screensaver off immediately. If the screen was locked the            user may be asked to authenticate first.
2010-12-28T16:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	I would try lock and reset from the command line and see what happens
2010-12-28T16:34:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	, doesnt work
2010-12-28T16:35:00.000Z	evenflow	sacarlson	i found a way to do it but it involvs killing my xscreensaver :)
2010-12-28T16:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	evenflow	that sounds like it would work then , just kill it and restart again at some point or at some time after
