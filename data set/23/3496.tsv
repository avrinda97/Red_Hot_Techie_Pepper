2009-05-19T11:01:00.000Z	Iowahc		hello there, got the .ICEauthority problem. tells me no write access, after each restart I have to manually chmod the file, how do I set it permanently? Running Kubuntu. already asked in #kubuntu, but no reaction
2009-05-19T11:02:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	related? -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=172210
2009-05-19T11:04:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	jep, same problem, but chown / chmod it doesnt resolves the problem
2009-05-19T11:05:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	how are you starting X?
2009-05-19T11:05:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	what do you mean?
2009-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	automatically
2009-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	on startup
2009-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	is the .ICEauthority owned by root before you have to 'fix it'?
2009-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	exactly
2009-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	also see this thread, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1004356
2009-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	thread doesnt tell me anything new :(
2009-05-19T11:14:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	does anything run upon login that uses sudo?
2009-05-19T11:15:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	nothing I know of
2009-05-19T11:15:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	I mean, it seems like it's something along these lines, but this particular link is an old bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kdelibs/+bug/8785
2009-05-19T11:17:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	poke around here as well, https://launchpad.net/+search?field.text=.ICEauthority
2009-05-19T11:19:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	run it with strace and see if it's manipulating the permissions on .ICEauthority (e.g. strace sudo kvpnc)
2009-05-19T11:19:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	i am going to try it
2009-05-19T11:20:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	you'll get a lot of text fly by. maybe try it with sudo strace kvpnc 2>&1 | pager
2009-05-19T11:22:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	its kvpnc
2009-05-19T11:22:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	well, at least you won't go on wondering
2009-05-19T11:23:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	yep, but now to figure out, how to resolve it ^^
2009-05-19T11:23:00.000Z	bc	Iowahc	I don't know if that's technically a bug (maybe it is), and if there isn't a report already in maybe file one
2009-05-19T11:25:00.000Z	Iowahc	bc	got it, using the [Alt] [F2] call to start kvpnc it seems to start with proper user settings
