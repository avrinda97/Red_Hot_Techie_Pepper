2011-10-24T20:32:00.000Z	BentSpace		Why does System Monitor say I'm using 0 bytes of 0 bytes of my Swap space, does that mean I don't have any swap space?
2011-10-24T20:33:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	yes, "swapon -s" to check
2011-10-24T20:36:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	tried the swapon -s and this is all it said "Filename    Type  Size Used Priority" so, I have no swap?
2011-10-24T20:36:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	no swap
2011-10-24T20:38:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	"sudo blkid | grep swap"  to check if a swappartition exist. if so, add it to /etc/fstab
2011-10-24T20:43:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	did sudo blkid | grep swap, no output.
2011-10-24T20:44:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	so you don't have a swappartition. create one or add a swapfile if you need swap
2011-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	I checked with the Disk Utility and it says I have 3 paritions: 1 large one and two - 2 GB small ones called Extended and Unknown, what are the small ones for, was one of the supposed to be the swap?
2011-10-24T20:50:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	i don't know what the installer does. do you have any other OS on that machine? if not, the 2GB partition sounds like a broken swap you might reconfigure
2011-10-24T20:59:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	Sorry, accidentally hit clear, not sure if I missed a message from you about the 2 small partitions Ubuntu created on install and if one is supposed to be  swap?
2011-10-24T21:01:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	i don't know what the installer does. do you have any other OS on that machine? if not, the 2GB partition sounds like a broken swap, you might reconfigure it (/dev/sda5 most likely)
2011-10-24T21:04:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	No other OS's, just had it erase everything and fill the whole HD.  Extended is on /dev/sda2 and the unknown is /dev/sda5.  So /dev/sda5 is suppose to be the swap?
2011-10-24T21:05:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	yes,change partition-type to swap and run "sudo mkswap /dev/sda5" then
2011-10-24T21:09:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	Sorry again, just noticed that it already says Partition Type: Linux swap (0x82), do I still need to run  "sudo mkswap /dev/sda5"?
2011-10-24T21:09:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	yes, to be sure
2011-10-24T21:10:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	"sudo blkid | grep swap"  to get the UUID (or simply use /dev/sda5) and add it to /etc/fstab
2011-10-24T21:20:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	got the UUID, how to add it to fstab.  Currently fstab says: # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
2011-10-24T21:20:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	"UUID=xyz-abc-def   none                    swap            sw              0 0"
2011-10-24T21:21:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	why the heck did they comment the swap?  now the UUID will have changed, so insert the one from "blkid" instead
2011-10-24T21:24:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	What is the "/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0"?  I did chose the encrypt home directory option on install maybe that's what's going on.
2011-10-24T21:25:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	yep, it also encrypts swap in that case. i don't have any idea how to deal with it, but i fear we just broke your encrypted-swap by using "mkswap" :(
2011-10-24T21:28:00.000Z	llutz	BentSpace	but it didn't work before, so nothing to worry about
2011-10-24T21:29:00.000Z	BentSpace	llutz	Oops, no worries, thanks for trying to help me any ways. hmm maybe I should reinstall, haven't changed much yet.
