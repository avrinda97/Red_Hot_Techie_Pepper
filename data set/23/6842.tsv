2007-02-23T06:33:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	everything looks just fine
2007-02-23T06:33:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	brb, lemme find that
2007-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	still not working
2007-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	exact same results, just dies after a few minutes
2007-02-23T07:54:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	nothing
2007-02-23T07:58:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	http://pastebin.com/886978
2007-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	Errm, I'm the guy with the erratic wifi card ^^;
2007-02-23T08:04:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	nope, any more ideas on my problem?
2007-02-23T08:09:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	yeah
2007-02-23T08:11:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	nope, pcmcia card
2007-02-23T08:12:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	yeah
2007-02-23T08:18:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	Well my concern is that it was working fine yesterday and earlier today, then it just borked when I got home
2007-02-23T08:21:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	I installed ubuntu yesterday (I've played with and used it before for about a year) and once I got the drivers set up for my card (which I got from eBay the same day) and I've used wifi in assorted places in my house for a long time and it's fine. There are no competing signals and even where there are there's no interference.
2007-02-23T08:21:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	I have a crazy idea, hold up
2007-02-23T08:22:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	Worse comes to works I could always make a shell script to run a ping every few seconds, and if it doesn't hear from the router it just ifdown;ifup's
2007-02-23T08:24:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	maybe it's my router. I don't think so, though. my wired desktop is running just fine and has been for ... a long time lol
2007-02-23T08:24:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	about a day, it's new
2007-02-23T08:26:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	I'm thinking you're right. It just seems so odd that it would work just fine and then for no apparent reason stop
2007-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	I'd do that but I use my laptop at school too (mostly just to screw off when I'm bored ... ;)) so I'm stuck with getting the wireless to work
2007-02-23T08:31:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	dfwlinuxguy	brb, rebooting the router. Let's just hope that's it ^o^
