2005-06-25T15:25:00.000Z	concept10	lsuactiafner	sorry.  I wasnt bashing you.  You just make wild statements like "Ubuntu doesnt like to compile stuff with default installation"  it could be "The default Ubuntu installation doesn't include some development tools, you must install them"  (Which is not hard to do)
