2010-08-27T19:40:00.000Z	afeijo		my ubuntu isnt loading, how can I abort the graphic mode and load the text mode?
2010-08-27T19:41:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	if it automatically goes to graphical mode you have to force it into text mode
2010-08-27T19:41:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	yes how?
2010-08-27T19:41:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	you have to edit the grub settings at runtime since this can only be forced via kernel parameter
2010-08-27T19:42:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	any key to make it wait for my choice?
2010-08-27T19:42:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	however is it just X.org not working properly? Then you could just use ctrl+alt+F1 to change to tty1 to get a shell
2010-08-27T19:42:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	I had no xorg.conf, I created it and rebooted
2010-08-27T19:43:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	no chance except having several grub entries with several parameter configs
2010-08-27T19:43:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	ctrl+alt+F1 didnt work
2010-08-27T19:44:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	then its obivously stuck somewhere...you may have to force it then
2010-08-27T19:44:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	how can I force it ? :)
2010-08-27T19:44:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	get into grub menue (shoud work by pressing ESC on bootup if its not displayed by default)
2010-08-27T19:45:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	then higlight the entry you want to boot and press 'e' for edit
2010-08-27T19:46:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	then find the line including root=/somepartition
2010-08-27T19:46:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	edit this line and append 'init=3' to it and then boot
2010-08-27T19:48:00.000Z	afeijo		ok esc helped, it offered to restore and restarted X, it worked :) thanks wastl
2010-08-27T19:48:00.000Z	afeijo		now I need to make it use my 2 screens, I'm using a virtual ubuntu with virtualbox
2010-08-27T19:48:00.000Z	afeijo		do I need to edit xorg.conf ?
2010-08-27T19:49:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	Splitscreen is a setting of the graphics driver....for my Nvidia card the nvidia setup gui does that
2010-08-27T19:50:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	but to virtualbox that should not be the case... its probably manual
2010-08-27T19:51:00.000Z	wastl	afeijo	you mean virual desktops in your X.org?
2010-08-27T19:51:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	no, 2 monitors, 2 screens
2010-08-27T19:51:00.000Z	afeijo	wastl	but I just found out that virtualbox dont support it to linux yet, only windows :(
