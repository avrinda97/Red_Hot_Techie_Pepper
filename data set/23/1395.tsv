2011-03-08T11:10:00.000Z	usr_	ActionParsnip	raido thanks guys you rock!
2011-08-28T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	did you install a deb of your own, or copy a file yourself?
2011-08-28T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	or force install a deb
2011-08-28T02:31:00.000Z	usr_	ActionParsnip	yes, I am trying to install pogoplug using an executable file that I got from the pogoplug.com website
2011-08-28T02:31:00.000Z	usr_	ActionParsnip	it was compressed (I don't think this matters at all...)
2011-08-28T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	then you need to undo whatever you did, then install the 64bit version
2011-08-28T02:36:00.000Z	usr_	ActionParsnip	by any chance do you know if this might be caused because the file I am trying to install may be compiled for a 32 bit version (which I think it is)
2011-08-28T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	yes, you need to match the arch
2011-08-28T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	lots, it downloads from multiple locations
2011-08-28T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	usr_	not sure, not really looked, nor do I think it'simportant
