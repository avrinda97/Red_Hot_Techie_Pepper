2005-04-08T12:31:00.000Z	PuGz		man... e17 looks wicked! i want it already!
2005-04-08T12:31:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	it's pretty usable, I've been playing with it some
2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	on ubuntu?
2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	and the team made it really easy to compile debian(read ubuntu) packages
2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	yeah
2005-04-08T12:33:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	I compiled creating debian packages
2005-04-08T12:33:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	I should say .debs since they were for ubuntu not debian
2005-04-08T12:33:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	I think there is even an unofficial deb repository out there somewhere though
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	really!?
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	but last time I looked, the packages were kind of old
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	do you still recommend compile?
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	yeah... they do that!
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	from early february I think
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	any major bugs?
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	it's kind of a pain to configure
2005-04-08T12:35:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	but it runs fine for me
2005-04-08T12:35:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	how so?
2005-04-08T12:36:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	the config tools just arn't very polished yet, and everything is stored in binary format, so there are no text files you can modify(for menu entries, etc)
2005-04-08T12:36:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	I'm sure that will get better with time
2005-04-08T12:36:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	binary format! yikes!
2005-04-08T12:37:00.000Z	PuGz	gratuit	yeah... time.... always time... hehe.... i want magic development instantly (perfect world)
2005-04-08T12:48:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	apt-cache show blackbox
2005-04-08T12:48:00.000Z	gratuit	PuGz	there is your answer
