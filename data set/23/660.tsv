2011-04-23T14:22:00.000Z	herol3oy		I need a very free ssh server? any help?
2011-04-23T14:23:00.000Z	herol3oy		I mean just free :D
2011-04-23T14:24:00.000Z	herol3oy		you know I want to have a ssh access because I have a presentation in my class about SSH but I don't know how can i find a free ssh account?
2011-04-23T14:25:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	why don't you use one from your own
2011-04-23T14:28:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	just set up your own ssh
2011-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	it is possible, but i doubt about this
2011-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	did you try another poert ?
2011-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	just pick up a random one
2011-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	from 1000 to 65535
2011-04-23T16:12:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	try with 8888
2011-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	just try this : ssh -D 9999 sh3er@shell.cjb.net
2011-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	and even if its a free account, it's probably register to your name and you probably not want to share your password, i'm just telling you :)
2011-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	i guess you are trying to bypass the iran firewall ?
2011-04-23T16:16:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	is the command line works ?
2011-04-23T16:17:00.000Z	herol3oy	nameless`	i have a ssh access
2011-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	don't spam the channel !
2011-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	i told you to try another port
2011-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	replace 9999 by 8888
2011-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	herol3oy	nameless`	so would try plzzzz
2011-04-23T16:20:00.000Z	herol3oy	nameless`	i tried 8888 >>> Could not request local forwarding.
2011-04-23T16:20:00.000Z	herol3oy	nameless`	wanna you try
2011-04-23T16:20:00.000Z	nameless`	herol3oy	look your privmsg
