2004-11-13T16:07:00.000Z	Sensebend		other than xorg, what else is changing in Hoary?
2004-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Sensebend	all sorts of stuff
2004-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		like graphical installer/boot
2004-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		check the wiki under HoaryHedgehog
2004-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	Sensebend		hmm
2004-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	Sensebend		sounds enticing
2004-11-13T16:10:00.000Z	Sensebend		well I'm off to get Hoary :)
2004-11-13T16:11:00.000Z	Sensebend		basically just change my apt repository to hoary, in place of warty
2004-11-13T16:11:00.000Z	Sensebend		and do a update, dist-upgrade?
2004-11-13T16:11:00.000Z	Sensebend		I'm really enjoying this Distro
2004-11-13T16:12:00.000Z	Sensebend		I am a Debian convert
2004-11-13T16:12:00.000Z	Sensebend		it was getting too stale for my tastes
2004-11-13T16:13:00.000Z	Sensebend		I dunno, I liked the major improvements in hardware detection
2004-11-13T16:13:00.000Z	Sensebend		and the installer
2004-11-13T16:15:00.000Z	Sensebend		it seemed to ask less stuff than the sarge installer
2004-11-13T16:15:00.000Z	Sensebend		which would be good for a newbie
2004-11-13T16:16:00.000Z	Sensebend		it must have all been in my head
2004-11-13T16:16:00.000Z	Sensebend		:)
2004-11-13T16:16:00.000Z	Sensebend		Need to get 239MB of archives. :S
2004-11-13T16:18:00.000Z	Sensebend		I did a dist-upgrade of warty this morning and I don't have much beyond a standard desktop yet
2004-11-13T16:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		There needs to be an easy way to disable a soundcard
2004-11-13T16:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		eg: if you have an onboard soundcard and an emu10k
2004-11-13T16:18:00.000Z	Sensebend	HrdwrBoB	I had the same problem
