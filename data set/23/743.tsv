2012-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	metap0d		Hi everyone, I tried to install ubuntu with a flash drive but part way through the install it said my image was corrupt. It looks like GRUB only partially installed on my hard drive. I found a boot repair tool to fix grub except that my windows partition is missing
2012-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	metap0d		could help me to fix grub from inside my ubuntu live cd?
2012-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	metap0d		i don't have another computer use to make another bootable usb
2012-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	metap0d		i'm trying to update grub from inside my ubuntu live cd
2012-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	metap0d		to include my windows partition / os
2012-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	so you are on live cd ?
2012-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	right now i'm talking on the live cd from a java applet
2012-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	 can you paste the output of    sudo fdisk -l
2012-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	bobweaver		!pastebin | metap0d
2012-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	Nothing comes up
2012-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	bobweaver		Oo
2012-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	I do see the "210gb filesystem" on my desktop which is my windows partition
2012-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	 pastebin ?
2012-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	Sorry what would you like on pastebin
2012-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	     sudo apt-get -y  install pastebinit  && sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
2012-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	bobweaver		then give us the link
2012-11-08T08:23:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	I'm certainly new to linux but I don't think i'm that new. http://pastebin.com/ZgwAkbxN
2012-11-08T08:23:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	:o
2012-11-08T08:24:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	I've concluded I need to run update-grub on my /dev/sda2 partition, but I don't know how to mount it correctly
2012-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	 you need to mount /dev/sda3 then install grub to it
2012-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	I can mount it through the file manager by right clicking on it and hitting "mount volume" .. but it doesn't mount to /dev/sda3
2012-11-08T08:26:00.000Z	metap0d	bobweaver	which is where my confusion lies : /
2012-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	bobweaver	metap0d	 so      sudo  mount /dev/sda3 /mnt        then   sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda   then   cd    then     sudo umount /mnt           then reboot into linux then sudo update-grub       then sudo reboot
