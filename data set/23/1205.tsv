2010-07-05T06:04:00.000Z	Doonz_		hey guys im having a weird issue. I just had a power outtage that lasted longer than my UPS could handle. Anyhow the system came back up nicely but i have 2 raid arrays that arent mounted but when i try to mount the manually by running sudo mount -a it tells me that its either mounted or the mount point is busy. when i type mount it doesnt show up that its mounted and when i umount it it says its not mounted any advice?

2010-07-05T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Can you mount the array from a LiveCD?
2010-07-05T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Try mounting to /mnt just as a test.
2010-07-05T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Can you pastebin the contents of /proc/mounts ?
2010-07-05T06:16:00.000Z	Doonz_	Jordan_U	one second
2010-07-05T06:16:00.000Z	Doonz_	Jordan_U	how do i get that info
2010-07-05T06:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	cat /proc/mounts

2010-07-05T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Ahh, the problem may have something to do with the fact that you have an msdos and gpt label, when normally with gpt your msdos label should only contain a single protective partition.
2010-07-05T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	What is the output of "readlink /dev/disk/by-uuid/d4aec111-f1b8-4cc2-a0c3-cd978d762dd5"?
2010-07-05T06:19:00.000Z	Doonz_	Jordan_U	../../sda1
2010-07-05T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Never mind what I said about GPT, I was just confused since /dev/sda uses an msdos label while /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc use gpt (and have a proper protective partition)
2010-07-05T06:21:00.000Z	Doonz_	Jordan_U	ok did you see the reply about the read link output
2010-07-05T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Yes.

2010-07-05T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Ok, fsck is running for some reason. Do *not* kill it.
2010-07-05T06:37:00.000Z	Doonz_	Jordan_U	because its running thats why i cant mount it?
2010-07-05T06:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Yes.
2010-07-05T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	Yes.
2010-07-05T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Doonz_	And with the size of your arrays it's going to take a while.
