2007-07-10T13:39:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	beryl IS a window manager, so i'm not sure how one can work and not the other
2007-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	no, window manager. there's no title bar, cant move the windows, etc
2007-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	do the windows have borders?
2007-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	no
2007-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	if you hold alt and click on a window and drag can you move it?
2007-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	ive had to switch to the gnome window manager to use the desktop
2007-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	no
2007-07-10T13:42:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	gnome is desktop environment. metacity is its window manager. beryl is another window manager that most people run with gnome. dont try to run it alone or you wont have a menu to open up any programs
2007-07-10T13:42:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	what do i do in the theme manager
2007-07-10T13:43:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	pick one
2007-07-10T13:43:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	nope, still no titlebars
2007-07-10T13:44:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	wait, how do i select it? i dont see an apply button or anything once i have it selected
2007-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	the ok button is all there is
2007-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	it applies as soon as you select it
2007-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	i dont see an ok button, just quit
2007-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	ok then that's it
2007-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	ok then it didnt work
2007-07-10T13:46:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	it applies when you pick it and there is no cancel. you could hit the X and thatd do it
2007-07-10T13:46:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	what window decorator is selected?
2007-07-10T13:46:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	the only option, standard beryl (emerald)
2007-07-10T13:46:00.000Z	macogw	ReK_	reload window decorator?
2007-07-10T13:47:00.000Z	ReK_	macogw	no effect whatsoever
