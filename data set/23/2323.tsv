2011-11-03T04:56:00.000Z	ruser	Scunizi	yeah, issues with your nvidia driver,  personally i haven't touched X server in a while.  try switching for a generic video driver, to get basic X going.  maybe  also try (nvidia) instead of nv
2011-11-03T04:57:00.000Z	ruser	Scunizi	aha, looks like some nvidia options are enabled that the current driver isn't supporting.
2011-11-03T04:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	ruser	could it be because I have 2 monitors plugged in.. ?? if I eliminate one maybe it will start.. As I remember that has been an issue since 6.06.. errg.. memory failing me.

2011-11-03T04:58:00.000Z	ruser	Scunizi	yeah.  aslo read up on nvidia and x. As i said i havne't used setup with X11 in a while.  sorry i'm super rusty :)
