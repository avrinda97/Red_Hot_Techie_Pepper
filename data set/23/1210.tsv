2010-08-12T11:15:00.000Z	choomra		hey guys!  I will soon be the proud owner of a new system76 laptop, their ultraportable. I would really like to get an SSD, but they are so expensive (SSDs in general), that if I got one it would have to be a mere 40GB. This will likely be enough for my apps and system stuff, but certainly not enough for my music collection (20GB or so) and the movies that I'd want to keep on there. I do however have a computer with ample storage runn
2010-08-12T11:15:00.000Z	choomra		Lucid at home. My question is, how can I "virtually mount" the hard drive and attached drives of my Lucid computer at home on my laptop? In effect I want my own personal storage cloud. I'm open to all suggestions. I was thinking something like VPN? Thanks so much in advance!
2010-08-12T11:17:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	nas should be fastest, next samba, then ssh and ftp
2010-08-12T11:18:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	thanks. Would nas do what I want it to do? Is there an easy and native way to do this in Ubuntu? (I don't need a GUI).
2010-08-12T11:19:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	are this 100 or giga nics ?
2010-08-12T11:20:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	unles you use a switch to connect the two boxes, need a crossovercable for this, when using 100 mb nicks, tuning their parameters can increase their thrughput massivly
2010-08-12T11:22:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but it is an externally (USB2) attached 1TB sata drive, and the computer connects via wireless N. I don't really follow your second post, but I don't want to buy any extra hardware.
2010-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	even better, if its an external hd, don't need any of the previous told, can just mount it;; I got you so, you wanted to connect the laptop to the desktop-PC and access it's internal hd
2010-08-12T11:25:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	External yes, but it would be nice to get to the internal one too. And yes, I want to be able to mount my external/internal harddrive that lives at home, on my laptop from anywhere. I already use DynDNS and have anywhere SSH access, but that doesn't do much in the way of mounting hard drives.
2010-08-12T11:26:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	an external hd with usb can just be plugged in laptop, best throughput, no probs at all.
2010-08-12T11:26:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	Heh, that's true
2010-08-12T11:27:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	for the later, use samba (easier to configure, more common) or NAs (slightly faster ~10-15%)
2010-08-12T11:27:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	But it's not an option for me, and this is not a really portable xHD. Is there no easy way to do what I'm looking to accomplish? Speed is not one of my primary concerns so much as reliability and simplicity are.
2010-08-12T11:29:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	Well I don't really need Windows interoperability, as both of these are modern Ubuntu boxes. Once set up, can I browse files on samba drives in Nautilus just like a normal hard drive?
2010-08-12T11:29:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	I won't use swat, just install samba on the desktop, once configure it ( and also secure it), then can access from laptop
2010-08-12T11:30:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	yes
2010-08-12T11:30:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	I see that now. That sounds like the best bet for me then! Thanks for your help, I'll let you know if I've any other questions :)
2010-08-12T11:30:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	can even put it in fstab of lapto, so when connected, it automounts and behaves like a local drive
2010-08-12T11:31:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	it will be one (little ) hassle setting up smb.conf on the desktop, but internet has lots of good howtos, also on securing it
2010-08-12T11:32:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	No doubt. I'm currently following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2010-08-12T11:36:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	ok to go with this, a more updated one : http://tinyurl.com/y8by6yg
2010-08-12T11:38:00.000Z	choomra	DasEi	Excellent find! I will probably end up using both, as my link explains how to set up auto-mounting via fstab.
2010-08-12T11:38:00.000Z	DasEi	choomra	readers are the dream of supporters, :-D, good effort
