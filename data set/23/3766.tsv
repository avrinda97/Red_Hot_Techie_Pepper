2008-11-04T16:58:00.000Z	chalcedony		what's the name of the popup blocker things for firefox please?
2008-11-04T16:59:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	popup blocking is built in to Firefox. Tools>Options>Content>"Block pop-up windows" =/
2008-11-04T17:00:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	its supposed to be blocking them .. i upgraded did it turn that off?
2010-11-24T15:20:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	This page does not exist yet. You can create a new empty page, or use one of the page templates. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression.
2010-11-24T15:20:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	remove the . from the end of the URL
2011-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	That error message is about another repository you added for Opera, not about Skype. Ubuntu Tweak wouldn't fix it.
2011-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	i see .. so now what?
2011-01-24T09:48:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	I'm trying to find the right key. one sec.
2011-01-24T09:48:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	thanks
2011-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	there's instructions at http://deb.opera.com/ for adding the new key
2011-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	thanks :)
2011-01-24T09:55:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	i wonder if i need to unistall the old key?
2011-01-24T09:56:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	ugh. apparently they used the old key to sign the Release file on the repository you're using. The issue's on their side, not yours >.>
2011-01-24T09:57:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	oh ok.. umm .. so...
2011-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	you could temporarily disable the repository and then try again in a few days. Add a # at the start of the line in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list that doesn't have one, or uncheck the relevant line in Software Sources
2011-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	(and when it's disabled, it won't interfere with Skype install)
2011-01-24T10:00:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	that file says it's read only and won't let me save & exit
2011-01-24T10:02:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list, or gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list
2011-01-24T10:03:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	(nano is a command-line editor, gedit is a GUI one. you'd run either of those commands in the terminal)
2011-01-24T10:04:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	thank you - i like vi(m) . gedit is ok.
2011-01-24T11:27:00.000Z	chalcedony	rww	opera irc support isn't up to ubuntu standards
2011-07-31T04:54:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	11.04 (as the name implies) came out in April. If you mean 11.10, try #ubuntu+1 ;)
2011-10-10T01:41:00.000Z	rww	chalcedony	get your cat off your keyboard, please
