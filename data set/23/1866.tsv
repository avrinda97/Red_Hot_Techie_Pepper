2009-10-05T11:50:00.000Z	mgmuscari		alright, has anyone used MPD to set up a home media server before?
2009-10-05T11:51:00.000Z	flyman	mgmuscari	No but I used apache w/apachesound which is a web-based script to allow streaming of music
2009-10-05T11:51:00.000Z	flyman		ampache actually I think it's called
2009-10-05T11:51:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i've got a NAS with all my music on it, and i'm planning to have a small laptop set up permanently as the audio device (attached will be a usb sound device with speakers)
2009-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	mgmuscari		the laptop/server will have access to the NAS. i want to be able to hit the server from any of my other pc's and queue up music to play
2009-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	mgmuscari		e.g. if i'm on my bed with my laptop, i want to be able to queue up a playlist, then turn off my laptop and go to bed while the music keeps playing
2009-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	mgmuscari	flyman	do you know of any gtk clients for ampache?
2009-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	flyman	mgmuscari	unfortunately I do not. However, it is web-based an almost out of the box easy to use.
2009-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari	flyman	eh, yeah, not looking to control my media library via a browser. hmm
2009-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari		theoretically i would also like to be able to redirect sound from my laptop or any other machine through this thing
2009-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i plan to use pulseaudio for that
2009-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	flyman	mgmuscari	have you seen http://www.radscan.com/nas.html?
2009-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	mgmuscari	flyman	no, thanks for the link
2009-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	flyman		It might be what you're looking for.
2009-10-05T11:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i wonder what the sample applications are
2009-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		oooh, MPD has an iphone application
2009-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		now THAT is neat
2009-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	flyman	mgmuscari	you know, Sockos has a GUI
2009-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	flyman		http://sockso.pu-gh.com
2009-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	mgmuscari		sockso, hm, i'll have to look into this too...
2009-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	flyman	mgmuscari	I am actually downloading the source now, it looks better than ampache.
2009-10-05T11:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari	flyman	thanks for all the suggestions
2009-10-05T11:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari	flyman	this gives me a good, solid set of possibilities to try
