2008-01-13T07:23:00.000Z	Whatsinaname		but I am stuck on how to mount it for use, thanks for any help doseryder
2008-01-13T07:25:00.000Z	Whatsinaname		good luck,  I used mdadm
2008-01-13T07:25:00.000Z	Whatsinaname		now md0 exists and is formatted, I just don't know what to do with it lol
2008-01-13T07:27:00.000Z	Whatsinaname		One more cry for help,  Any one know how I mount my md0?  I get cant find /dev/md0 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2008-01-13T07:28:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	md0 is normally located at /dev/mapper/md0
2008-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	when I try mount /dev/mapper/md0 I get same error
2008-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	So how do you try to mount it?
2008-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	, I just typed in sudo mount /dev/mapper/md0
2008-01-13T07:31:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	sorry I am very noob
2008-01-13T07:31:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	okay, have you mounted md0 in the first place with mdadm?
2008-01-13T07:32:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	I did make the arrary with mdadm, and formatted it,  how do you mount it with mdadm...
2008-01-13T07:33:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	You use the command assemble and the harddrives that should be in the array. Like this for example: "mdadm --assemble /dev/mapper/md0 /dev/hda /dev/hdb".
2008-01-13T07:34:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	I think thats the correct line. Maybe the md0 line should be before --assemble, I don't remember
2008-01-13T07:37:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	I get /dev/mapper/md0/ does not exist and is not a 'standard' name so it cant be created
2008-01-13T07:39:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	Okay, w8 and I check how I mount things
2008-01-13T07:42:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	I think this is a great guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=408461 . The manual part of the howto is probably what you are looking for. But at the top is a great description on each step you have to do
2008-01-13T07:48:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	 Ok I feel DUMB  I was trying to assemble with hdb hdc and they are named sdb sdc  I get the idiot of the day award,  now it is assembled and I am formatting it.
2008-01-13T07:49:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	Nice :)
2008-01-13T07:50:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	now after format I should use mount /dev/md0
2008-01-13T07:50:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Whatsinaname	Yeah, or whatever path you choosed. Normally, md0 is placed at /dev/mapper/md0
2008-01-13T08:41:00.000Z	Whatsinaname	Blinkiz	Thanks for the help,  I knew I was missing something simple,  I had to create a directory and then mount my md0 to it.  I feel so noobish in this whole linux thing.
