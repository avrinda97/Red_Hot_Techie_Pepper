2008-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	nvidia-xconfig is what I need?
2008-04-26T13:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 i just installed the 'nvidia-glx-new' package and my 8800gtsxxx   worked fine.
2008-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	tell me more, how did you do it?  through synaptic or envyng?
2008-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 its in the normal repos/packages.. a simple apt-get install got it.
2008-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	Also, are you actually using the nvidia driver and not the nv driver?
2008-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 i have NEVER needed to use envy.
2008-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 I see the nvidia logo when X starts up, so its using nvidia.
2008-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 you might also want to install the nvidia config tools  to allow for tweaking the thing a bit.
2008-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	lemme try that
2008-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	nvidia-cg-toolkit?
2008-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
2008-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 i use both of those. :)
2008-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	its asking to remove the glx-new
2008-04-26T13:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 i dont knwo about that. I installed all 3 at the exact same time.  and this was a few weeks ago.
2008-04-26T13:12:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	Ok, I have all three installed, and when I run nvidia-xconfig all it gives me is a corepointer error for the keyboard and mouse
2008-04-26T13:13:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	The CoreKeyboard device was not specified explicitly in the layout;
2008-04-26T13:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	  I dident have that issue. if you just installed the nvidia-glx drivers. You 'should' be able to restart the X server and it 'should' see the nvidia card and start using it. You MIGHT have to enable it in the restricted-managers tool
2008-04-26T13:14:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	lemme restartx and try that, brb
2008-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	No dice, it started back with nv drivers
2008-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 check the restricted-manager tool, be sure you have 'use nvidia' checked.
2008-04-26T13:19:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	System > Hardware drivers?
2008-04-26T13:19:00.000Z	joe_	Dr_willis	I used to have restricted drivers as an option, but its gone now
2008-04-26T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joe_	 no idea. Im not using gnome.. and i dont have the menus memorized
