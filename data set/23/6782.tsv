2006-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	apokryphos		anyway, there's deborphan debfoster when I really want to remove packages I don't use on my system
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	can you explain deborphan and debfoster to me? and how do I get/use them
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	both available from apt; apt-cache show <package> is very good for descriptions (better than me) =)
2006-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	k Ill check them out
2006-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	basically used to find orphaned libraries and/or to weed out unused/unwanted packages
2006-04-17T08:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	not really. installation_sources -a URL
2006-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	I just couldnt seem to get it . ubuntu's system just came more natural to me
2006-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	Ubuntu lists all sources in one file though which is quite nice
2006-04-17T09:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	my ubuntu box is going to be down for a month or so maybe more...will it be safe when I get it back online to just do a dist-upgrade ?
2006-04-17T09:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	yes
2006-04-17T09:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	with sudo apt-get update first of course
2006-04-17T09:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	ok cool
2006-12-26T15:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	edgy is fine to use; upgrading is dodgy though.
2006-12-26T15:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	Dapper had its issues around too, but it's better stability-wise than edgy.
2006-12-26T15:30:00.000Z	IdleOne	apokryphos	Seveas and Hansel I'll wait then
2007-02-22T17:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	IdleOne	hi
