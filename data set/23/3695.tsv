2008-02-18T00:31:00.000Z	AfroRowan		i doesnt update
2008-02-18T00:32:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- apt-get update just gets a list of new and upgradable packages from the ubuntu repositiries - it doesn't actually perform any upgrades - you need to sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-02-18T00:33:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- *repositories
2008-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- Do you mean apt-get update produces no output at all?
2008-02-18T00:35:00.000Z	AfroRowan	danand	i did that then it says 0 upgraded 0 installed (all 0)
2008-02-18T00:36:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- Do you get any output from the apt-get update command?
2008-02-18T00:38:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- if your getting output like Hit http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com gutsy-updates/multiverse Sources ..... etc and then do apt-get upgrade - if your system says 0 upgraded etc ... then your system is up to date - ie there is nothing to update
2008-02-18T00:43:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- can you pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list?
2008-02-18T00:44:00.000Z	AfroRowan	danand	ill get the file and paste it
2008-02-18T00:44:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- k
2008-02-18T00:45:00.000Z	AfroRowan	danand	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56397/
2008-02-18T00:46:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- just lookin
2008-02-18T00:48:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- I've seen this error before - I think its due to a possible bug in the gutsy installer - Essentially all your sources for your packages are commented out - wait one and I'll edit it and repastebin it
2008-02-18T00:49:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- might be a little while - stick around and I'll be as quick as I can
2008-02-18T00:54:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56399/ - that should give you a working sources.list - just copy it to /etc/apt/sources.list. Make a backup of your old one first if you like. Then run sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade. After that you can install new packages! :)
2008-02-18T00:58:00.000Z	AfroRowan	danand	i cant edit and save it
2008-02-18T00:59:00.000Z	danand	AfroRowan	- you need to be superuser to edit that file - copy your old one first - run sudo cp /etc/apt/source.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old and then gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-02-18T01:03:00.000Z	AfroRowan	danand	your the best ! he is downloading updates now... thanks ! :)
