2009-09-14T19:20:00.000Z	Threetimes		Can anybody help me on line 7 in http://paste.ubuntu.com/270945/ ?
2009-09-14T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	/join #bash
2009-09-14T19:21:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	you probably just want to redirect output to /dev/null, but they'll have better advice for you
2009-09-14T20:51:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	iirc wicd's dbus interface has some methods for that...
2009-09-14T20:52:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	i need to run it on ubuntu server
2009-09-14T20:52:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	ok?
2009-09-14T20:58:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	wicd doesn't require gtk...
2009-09-14T20:58:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	uh? are we talking about the same wicd?
2009-09-14T20:59:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	you're thinking of the gtk client
2009-09-14T20:59:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	i guess...
2009-09-14T20:59:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	the daemon has no gui
2009-09-14T21:00:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	and there is a curses client.  Anyway I don't even remember if the dbus interface does exactly what you asked but you've been asking for a while and I remember something like that
2009-09-14T21:01:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/52443 mentions max.  Worst case scenario you could grep the source and write your own
2009-09-14T21:02:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	http://www.noc.ucf.edu/Tools/Iperf/default.htm there you go
2009-09-14T21:02:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	thatr's not what i mean. That is my current speed, not my max speed. I want to know how close to the 25 mbit i can get
2009-09-14T21:02:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	it says it can show max.
2009-09-14T22:14:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	why do you want to do this?
2009-09-14T22:15:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	I need to test my internet connection using a cron job. Fully automated and quiet.
2009-09-14T22:15:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	yes.  Why?
2009-09-14T22:15:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	'cause i need to...
2009-09-14T22:16:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	ok... well good luck I guess
2009-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	jrib	Threetimes	erm, abort it, check file size, divide by 3?
2009-09-14T22:22:00.000Z	Threetimes	jrib	i'm quite stupid. Thanks for this brilliant insight!
