2009-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	It didn't do anything
2009-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	I can get great speeds on torrents and on speedtest.net, but loading pages takes forever
2009-10-15T06:36:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Sorry for the long reply, no it's not
2009-10-15T06:37:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> for a simple test use the ip in your browser, not the .com name and see if it's faster
2009-10-15T06:38:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> ie.. www.goog.com   use 212.227.93.146
2009-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	goog.com is taking about 10-15 seconds to load a search result
2009-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> did you use the .com name?
2009-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Not sure, I just typed in that IP and got sent to that site
2009-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> was that faster?
2009-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Google itself searches faster, but when I go to click on a link it's slow right away
2009-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> right, because it has to query the dns server again
2009-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> sounds like dns problem
2009-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Is there any auto-repair that I can try or what should I do next?
2009-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Primary DNS  192.168.1.1 (My router)
2009-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> edit your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf with pico or vi
2009-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> add this line to the end of the file
2009-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> prepend domain-name-servers 4.2.2.1,4.2.2.2;
2009-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Anywhere speific or?
2009-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> then restart the network or reboot
2009-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> at the end of the file... last line
2009-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Woops, sorry.
2009-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	|m0r0n	mow	Let me restart, brb
2009-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	mow	|m0r0n	> that will add those ip's to your /etc/resolv.conf when network restarts
