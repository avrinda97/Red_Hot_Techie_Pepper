2011-07-03T18:26:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	yes?
2011-07-03T17:54:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	what doesyour server do? Is it a tomcat server?
2011-07-03T17:56:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	ps aux |grep -i java
2011-07-03T17:57:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	that's it? Just that one line?
2011-07-03T17:58:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	don't use ssh?
2011-07-03T17:58:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	how do you know it's at 100% ?
2011-07-03T18:02:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	sorry, just balancing irc with cooking. My response will be slow for the next 10 mins or so. Why do you suspect it's java? What have you changed recently on the server?
2011-07-03T18:09:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	ok. so how do you access the server in rescue mode?
2011-07-03T18:10:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	I'm trying to understand what you have available to you.
2011-07-03T18:11:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	no, because here you get the benefit of more knowledge :)
2011-07-03T18:14:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	so, whydo you suspect... java?
2011-07-03T18:16:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	ok. So, how did you setup that script?
2011-07-03T18:20:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	ok. um... well, how does this java thing run?
2011-07-03T18:21:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	ok, cd /etc/init.d
2011-07-03T18:21:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	if you ls in there, do you see your startup script?
2011-07-03T18:23:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	so, you've found your script in /etc/init.d ?
2011-07-03T18:25:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	"sudo update-rc.d -f SCRIPTNAMEGOESHERE remove"
2011-07-03T18:29:00.000Z	StevenR	cracoucas	awesome! You're welcome :D
