2008-08-30T20:34:00.000Z	wols_	karly	neither
2008-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	karly	wols_	neither? how does it keep track of discs?
2008-08-30T20:36:00.000Z	wols_	karly	it uses BIOS only
2008-08-30T20:36:00.000Z	wols_	karly	kernel uses whatever you tell it to, sdaX, UUIDs, labels, etc
2008-08-30T20:37:00.000Z	karly	wols_	did you see my paste? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/41900/
2008-08-30T20:37:00.000Z	karly	wols_	not sure where to go from here
2008-08-30T20:37:00.000Z	wols_	karly	misconfigured menu.lst probably. not a grub problem, kernel config problem
2008-08-30T20:38:00.000Z	karly	wols_	and any direction you can point me to? where is menu.lst and should I try to edit it?
2008-08-30T20:39:00.000Z	wols_	karly	you should pastebin it. /boot/grub/
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	karly	wols_	il say its misconfigured menu.lst, there is no boot directory
2008-08-30T20:47:00.000Z	wols_	karly	not possible. if ther is no /boot you don't have ubuntu installed
2008-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	wols_	karly	use the live cd
2008-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	wols_	karly	cause you aren't on your harddisk. it's not mounted. which is why busybox is showing.
2008-08-30T20:57:00.000Z	karly	wols_	live cd didn't show discs either
2008-08-30T20:57:00.000Z	wols_	karly	what sata controller?
2008-08-30T20:58:00.000Z	wols_	karly	and how did you check for disks?
2008-08-30T20:58:00.000Z	karly	wols_	it's a scsi controller, perc2
2008-08-30T20:59:00.000Z	wols_	karly	and how did you check for disks?
2008-08-30T21:00:00.000Z	karly	wols_	used DSL, don't have live cd for buntu, and I checked there, it just showed ramdisc
2008-08-30T21:00:00.000Z	wols_	karly	we do not support DSL
2008-08-30T21:01:00.000Z	karly	wols_	lol I know, I have no questions about dsl
2008-08-30T21:01:00.000Z	karly	wols_	just sued it to check for drives and none showed
2008-08-30T21:01:00.000Z	wols_	karly	use a ubuntu live cd. we do not know what drivers dsl has and we don't care
