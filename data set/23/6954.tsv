2005-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	Phuzion		Alright, something is up with my machine...
2005-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	Phuzion		I try to log into it through PuTTY, and it "unexpectedly closes the connection"
2005-11-27T09:01:00.000Z	Phuzion		Not that I can think of...
2005-11-27T09:01:00.000Z	Phuzion		Pings fine.
2005-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		Alright, what's the command for restarting openssh?
2005-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		openssh -restart ?
2005-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		Alright, thanks.
2005-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		Hey, would restarting the machine work?
2005-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		Because I don't have a monitor hooked to it right now...
2005-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		And I don't wanna drag my huge ass CRT upstairs.
2005-11-27T09:04:00.000Z	MrFarts	Phuzion	wuss :)
2005-11-27T09:04:00.000Z	Phuzion		Alright
2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	Phuzion	MrFarts	I don't want to get my CRT out because it's sitting on top of a 6' tall shelf...
2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	Phuzion		And it's a 19" CRT that weights nearly a ton.
2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	MrFarts	Phuzion	weaking :)
2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	MrFarts		weakling :)
2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	Phuzion	MrFarts	 I'm just lazy.

2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	MrFarts	Phuzion	19" crt can't weigh more than 75 lbs or so
2005-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	Phuzion	MrFarts	 It's on top of a 6' shelf.
2005-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	MrFarts	Phuzion	so get a chair :)
2005-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	Phuzion	MrFarts	 Plus, If anything, I'd just disconnect the LCD that I'm using right now...
2005-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	MrFarts	Phuzion	that'll work too :)
