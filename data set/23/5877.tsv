2006-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	it's called DCC
2006-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	or IM
2006-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	go get AIM or something
2006-08-20T13:59:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	I have AIM, does it allow direct IP input?
2006-08-20T13:59:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	ummm, *why* would you need or want that?
2006-08-20T13:59:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	Lots of reasons. I've been around long enough to have had the need several times.
2006-08-20T14:00:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	good, so give me a few of those reasons.
2006-08-20T14:01:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	One example is that a person that had been trying to connect to your FTP is no longer connected, you want to contact via IP.
2006-08-20T14:03:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	ummm, you want to contact them or they want to contact you? and wouldn't that require that *everyone* install your little "chat" software? and couldn't that easily become a security vulnerability just like any other daemon/listening process
2006-08-20T14:04:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	Yes, I'm asking if there's a chat app that allows direct IP input. You've just described what I've described to the channel already. OSS the damn app, but there has to be something.
2006-08-20T14:05:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	my initial guess is "no" because i really don't think you've got a very good reason to do what you're doing... at least not that i can see based on what you've described to me so far
2006-08-20T14:06:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	There's a good reason that people may want to chat without having to connect to a common server.
2006-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	what you're saying is that you want a standalone DCC app
2006-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	so go make it! or google
2006-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	Say some script kiddie has been scanning my ports and I want to send a message to that IP "Stop it you little butt monkey"
2006-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	since DCC is already part of basically every IRC client in existence i think is the reason that most people haven't cared about what you want
2006-08-20T14:08:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	ummm... now *that* is retarded... *and* he would have to have the software installed to be able to GET that message in the first place
2006-08-20T14:08:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	so if he doesn't install your little chat app you're screwed... and besides, doing that is just stupid
2006-08-20T14:09:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	don't send him messages about "butt monkeys" that'll just make him want to hack you more... log his IP and report him to the fucking FBI or something yo
2006-08-20T14:09:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	Yup, people have AIM, Yahoo, IRC, etc. I'm wondering if there's a popular or common app that allows IP input.
2006-08-20T14:09:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	NO!!!! dammit kid... write your own standalone DCC
2006-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	argument	Having only 1 app that isn't commonly adopted isn't really a good way to chat.
2006-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	argument	Corporal_Dirge	my advice: give up and go do real work
