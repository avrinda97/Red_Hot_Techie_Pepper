2005-04-13T09:56:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		do I have to stick with openoffice, I'd like it uninstalled but It always complains of ubuntu-desktop dependency, at least
2005-04-13T09:57:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		after all this is a server
2005-04-13T09:58:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		why do I HAVE to stick with a bunch of packages I dont wan't because of ubuntu-desktop.... Stupid dependency....
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	yfir	s0undt3ch	you can remove the ubuntu-desktop package
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		thoght that was the desktop I'm at...
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	yfir		it's a dummy package
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		!"#$
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	yfir		just dependencies
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		k, thanks
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	yfir		but if new packages are added to it, you won't get them with a regular update if you don't have ubuntu-desktop installed. just be aware of that
2005-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	s0undt3ch	yfir	has I said, stupid dependency
2005-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		*as
2005-04-13T10:02:00.000Z	s0undt3ch	yfir	added to it? what? ubuntu-desktop?
2005-04-13T10:04:00.000Z	yfir	s0undt3ch	- the packaged 'ubuntu-desktop' is just dependencies - it's a way of keeping all of the packages involved with the standard ubuntu desktop in one place...
2005-04-13T10:04:00.000Z	yfir		however, if you remove it, nothing will be removed from your system
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	yfir		on the other hand, if you update your system and you don't have the ubuntu-desktop package installed, you may not get new dependent packages that the maintainers later add to their idea of the "standard ubuntu desktop"
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	yfir		if that makes sense... phew
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	s0undt3ch	yfir	will I still be able to install updates?
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	yfir		yes
2005-04-13T10:06:00.000Z	yfir		s0oundt3ch, i'm a little nervous for you now. if you don't know this, maybe you shouldn't be messing with these things :)
2005-04-13T10:06:00.000Z	s0undt3ch	yfir	well, they should add to their ideas that someone might just wan't a server, withoud the desktop(all of them at leas) apps...
