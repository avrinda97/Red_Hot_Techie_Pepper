2011-02-28T03:07:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Correct.
2011-02-28T03:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	the wifi card is not showing in lspci ?
2011-02-28T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	restricted drivers dialog is not affering the driver anymore?
2011-02-28T02:59:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	No.
2011-02-28T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	try « sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-$(lsb_release -cs)-generic » to get newer drivers
2011-02-28T03:02:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	ok, I'm trying that now,
2011-02-28T03:05:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Should that have made it show up in lspci and etc?
2011-02-28T03:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	you have to reboot after installing the package
2011-02-28T03:06:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	I did
2011-02-28T03:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	no joy ?
2011-02-28T03:07:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Its still not showing up in the lspci list there, I tried reseating it as well, just to make sure it wasn't a hardware problem, but it was working friday before I installed all the updates.
2011-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	then something else is going wrong here... maybe it is disabled in bios or something?
2011-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	even if there is no driver for it. it should appear in lspci
2011-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	It can't be disabled in bios, checked that, and reseated it.  Unless something else is messing with me.
2011-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	with the old kernel it appears in lspci ?
2011-02-28T03:09:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Is there a way I can boot with the old kernel?
2011-02-28T03:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	if you did not removed it it should be in the grub menu. if the menu does not appear when you boot press shift during start up to force it to appear
2011-02-28T03:10:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Ok trying that now, and I will see if that fixes the issue...
2011-02-28T03:11:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	Now its just mocking me.  Its not showing up in the old one either, I'll look into some more hardware issues.  Thanks alot.
2011-02-28T03:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	i would recheck bios.
2011-02-28T03:12:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	I wish it was that, but you are unable to disable it through the bios.
2011-02-28T03:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kaeles	then i dunno. do you dualboot? check if windows detects it
2011-02-28T03:13:00.000Z	Kaeles	erUSUL	nope just ubuntu, I'll look into it a bit more.  thanks
