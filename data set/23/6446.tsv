2009-05-13T09:48:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	what happens when you try to mount it from the command line?
2009-05-13T09:49:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	click Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
2009-05-13T09:49:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	from there, 'sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/'
2009-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	ubuntu will usually unmount the CD behind the scenes when you press eject
2009-05-13T09:55:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	wait ...
2009-05-13T09:56:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	have you installed libdvdcss?
2009-05-13T09:56:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	dpkg --get-selections | grep libdvdcss
2009-05-13T09:56:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	are you trying to play an actual legit DVD?
2009-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	you might have a region mismatch
2009-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	check out the 'regionset' package
2009-05-13T10:00:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	perhaps.  have you ever been able to play this specific DVD on that specific drive before?
2009-05-13T10:01:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	try installing the gstreamer-plugins-{good,bad,ugly} packages
2009-05-13T10:02:00.000Z	insta1	steven_	without the output from dmesg | tail i can't diagnose further
