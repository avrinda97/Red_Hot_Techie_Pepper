2007-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	jenda		I'm trying to compile foo2zjs - can someone help me identify the error? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17377/
2007-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	jenda		I can't figure it out :(
2007-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	do you have the source file with the error I can look at (pastebin)
2007-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/foo2zjs.tar.gz
2007-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	have you tried an older version of the source ?
2007-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	nope, should I?
2007-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	I'm on Feisty
2007-04-24T15:47:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	do you have the C development libraries installed ?
2007-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	muhehe... maybe I don't - it's a nearly fresh install. Is that in build-essential?
2007-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	I dunno, try libc6-dev
2007-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	and build-essential is for building debian packages, not compiling from source
2007-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	ok, will install that, then.
2007-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	ok, let me know if the libs works ):
2007-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	it's installing libstdc++6-4.1-dev as part of build-essential... I hope std's can't be carried by c++ code ;)
2007-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	lol
2007-04-24T15:57:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	BTW, libc6-dev is also included in build-essential
2007-04-24T15:58:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	nice, I only looked at the summary :)
2007-04-24T15:58:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	and yep, it works now :) thanks... I guess I shouldda thought of that... since it has probably happened every time I clean installed so far ;)
2007-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	yeah, I started looking at the errors and it was missing <stdio.h> / dead givaway
2007-04-24T16:02:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	I have absolutely no idea what that means ;)
2007-04-24T16:02:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	but thanks anyway.
2007-04-24T16:03:00.000Z	what_if	jenda	yw :) If this were an RPG I would get [geek +1]  [programmer +1] , lol
2007-04-24T16:03:00.000Z	jenda	what_if	hehe :)
