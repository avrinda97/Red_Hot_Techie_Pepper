2008-01-20T23:26:00.000Z	zhobbs		I'm having issues with video playback and xinerama...video will only play in my primary monitor
2008-01-20T23:27:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	both on the same card?
2008-01-20T23:27:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	yeah
2008-01-20T23:28:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	I bet if you look at your Xorg.0.log it says the second card isn't compatible
2008-01-20T23:34:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	didn't see anything in the xorg log
2008-01-20T23:35:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	if you run glxgears, and drag it between teh monitors do they both work?
2008-01-20T23:35:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	yeah
2008-01-20T23:35:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	if glxgears shows up on both monitors... then you should be fine...
2008-01-20T23:36:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	but if you start it on that monitor does it do the same thing?
2008-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	if I start it on the monitor it won't even play if I drag it to the primary monitor
2008-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	for me if I start a movie on a monitor and drag it to one that's on another card it doesn't always work, but if I start i ton the other card it works fine
2008-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	you sure both cards are fully supported by the driver you're using?
2008-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	yeah, video won't work at all on secondary
2008-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	only using 1 card
2008-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	yeah, didn't happen in the distro I was using previously with similar xorg.conf :)
2008-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	nvidia card?
2008-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	yeah
2008-01-20T23:39:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	thanks, I'll check it out
2008-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	I'm also having some issue with where new windows are placed...but I think that's more kde specific
2008-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	hope it helps... I had problems with my two nvidia cards and getting Xinerama to work(4 monitors), ended up doing two twinviews and then Xinerama and it works now
2008-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	wouldn't know about that, I use GNOME
2008-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	zhobbs	Joe_	thanks...with twinview each monitor is a different desktop?
2008-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	Joe_	zhobbs	no, extended display... only thing I don't like about it is that maximize window spans both monitors
