2007-05-13T06:02:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	those are counts from a Geiger counter. background cosmic radiation. i need to know how many times i had a count in the range of let's say 30-40 how many times 40-50 then fit a gaussian to it
2007-05-13T06:02:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	did you see the paste?
2007-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	_SpitFIRE	vladuz976	sorry for the questions; but lastly, where do you get the classes??? I mean 10 -20 etc?
2007-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	_SpitFIRE	vladuz976	I see it!
2007-05-13T06:04:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	you see how for instance there are many occurances of 0.3? i need to know how many 0.3's are in that file or better how many counts in the range from 0.28-0.32
2007-05-13T06:05:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	0-0.60
2007-05-13T06:05:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	ranges should be 0.05

2007-05-13T06:09:00.000Z	vladuz976	_SpitFIRE	the file is a lot longer that's just a snapshot, i had the counter run all night in 120sec intervals. and always got counts ranging from 0-60 , now devide those counts by 120sec i get the frequencies. i have to figure out which one was the most common frequeny
2007-05-13T06:09:00.000Z	_SpitFIRE	vladuz976	hmmm...
2007-05-13T06:09:00.000Z	_SpitFIRE	vladuz976	ok
