2009-08-14T03:00:00.000Z	Some_Person		How long will that dd command take?
2009-08-14T03:00:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	you can get progress info, see the man page for details how
2009-08-14T03:01:00.000Z	Some_Person	derenrich	while its running?
2009-08-14T03:02:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	yeah
2009-08-14T03:02:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	you can get the info on any running dd process
2009-08-14T03:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	derenrich	how?
2009-08-14T03:04:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	kill -USR1 $pid where $pid is the pid of the dd process
2009-08-14T03:05:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	which you can get from ps
2009-08-14T03:05:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	I swear it's in the man page
2009-08-14T03:05:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	no kill is used to send signals
2009-08-14T03:05:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	if it sends SIG_KILL then it'll kill
2009-08-14T03:06:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	well it defaults to SIG_KILL
2009-08-14T03:07:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	you might need ps -e depending where you are doing this from
2009-08-14T03:07:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	it's the number next to the word dd
2009-08-14T03:08:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	it printed output on the window u ran dd in
2009-08-14T03:08:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	should have
2009-08-14T03:09:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	ok
2009-08-14T03:09:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	it tells u how much it has outputed so far? i can't remember
2009-08-14T03:10:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	fast. /dev/random is way slower (which is what i wipe drives with)
2009-08-14T03:12:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	nobody will recover it from the drive
2009-08-14T03:12:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	right but i assume you're wiping it because there's sensitive material on the drive
2009-08-14T03:12:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	why are you wiping it?
2009-08-14T03:15:00.000Z	derenrich	Some_Person	not sure about that
