2006-03-15T10:06:00.000Z	paradizelost		how did you pull that off??? ;)
2006-03-15T10:07:00.000Z	paradizelost		xkill should do the trick
2006-03-15T10:07:00.000Z	paradizelost		just run xkill, then click in the window you want to ogo away
2006-03-15T10:07:00.000Z	paradizelost		you won't need the pid with xkill
2006-03-15T10:08:00.000Z	paradizelost		xkill will turn your mouse cursor into a skull and crossbones
2006-03-15T10:08:00.000Z	paradizelost		just click in the window you want to go away
2006-03-15T10:08:00.000Z	paradizelost		just be careful not to click on the desktop or anyhing
2006-03-15T10:08:00.000Z	paradizelost		not familiar with kurmin
2006-03-15T10:09:00.000Z	paradizelost		anyone available to assist me w/ vncserver, i installed it, it seems to start, no errors, but doesn't
2006-03-15T10:10:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	"vncserver :0" gives you what?
2006-03-15T10:10:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	"vncserver :1" then?
2006-03-15T10:11:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	what do you mean? What error do you get?
2006-03-15T10:12:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	so when you type "vncserver :2" or whatever .. do you get something like "New 'X' desktop is tryodin:2
2006-03-15T10:14:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	do a "ps aux | grep vnc" and check for any XrealVNC or something in that list
2006-03-15T10:15:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	hm, thats strange ... have you checked your deamons?
2006-03-15T10:16:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	probably an easier way to display them, but old school I use the "service" command (not installed default by ubuntu) to list my services
2006-03-15T10:22:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	paradizelost	I hounestly dont know ... just found out that vncserver wasnt a daemon at all .. sry
