2006-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	delire		ves: how did you go ves?
2006-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	ves	delire	oh hi there, haha complete reinstall :)
2006-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	delire	ves	didn't take you long did it?
2006-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	ves	delire	nah, not at all this 10meg connection helped a bit with the dist-upgrade :)
2006-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	delire	ves	hehe cool
2006-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	ves	delire	I'm very tired from running about though :)
2006-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	delire	ves	get online with that machine eh?
2006-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	delire	ves	better still install openssh-server and ssh from the machine you're on now.
2006-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	ves	delire	yeah, thing was it was hooked up to the network but due to my login issues I couldn't ssh or anything :)
2006-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	ves	delire	cheers, I'm just sorting out all my packages now, 'gvim - command not found' argh :)
2006-01-11T12:54:00.000Z	delire	ves	ldd /path/to/binary
2006-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	ves	delire	Hmm, I've never had to do that before is there something automatic that should do it?
2006-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	delire	ves	what are you trying to do?
2006-01-11T12:56:00.000Z	ves	delire	I've got the latest version of firefox installed but trying to run it gives me library errors: "error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
2006-01-11T12:57:00.000Z	delire	ves	right.. this is an important library. you may need to create a symlink. it's also possible that firefox wants a different version of libstdc++. though i'd be surprised.
2006-01-11T12:57:00.000Z	delire	ves	ls -l /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.*
2006-01-11T12:58:00.000Z	ves	delire	ah I see, they're not all linked
2006-01-11T12:58:00.000Z	delire	ves	do you have a libstdc++.so.5?
2006-01-11T12:59:00.000Z	ves	delire	I just installed that package via apt, working great now :)
2006-01-11T12:59:00.000Z	ves	delire	only 6 was installed by default
2006-01-11T12:59:00.000Z	delire	ves	a much cleaner solution ;)
2006-01-11T13:00:00.000Z	ves	delire	Thanks again, have a nice night! :)
2006-01-11T13:00:00.000Z	delire	ves	u too ves
