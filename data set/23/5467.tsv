2008-12-08T06:36:00.000Z	Bsims		Hrm I googled is there an easy way to load multiple distros with unetbootin
2008-12-08T06:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 not that ive seen.. You would proberly have to manually configure the boot loader. and learn a bit about each disrto
2008-12-08T06:36:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	Fair enough, I was just being lazy
2008-12-08T06:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 i set up a thumbdrive with PuppyLinux and GeeXbox. :)
2008-12-09T05:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 you would have to do some manual configuring of the syslinux (or was it grub) boot loader on the drive.. and perhaps some  work at 'installing'  to the THumbdrive, and archive the isntall somewhere else. install next OS.. and move the first one back....
2008-12-09T05:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 unetbootin may erase the first. if you install another on top
2008-12-09T05:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 and of course different disrtos install in different 'ways' to a thumb drive
2008-12-09T05:23:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	thats the problem, how do I prevent it from doing so, I want ntpasswd and ophtcrack
2008-12-09T05:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 you will have to install each OS and see how thy install and manually tweak things.
2008-12-09T05:25:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	I cam
2008-12-09T05:25:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	Er I can't even find a good how to on it for the love of GNU
2008-12-09T05:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 no idea then..  Ive seen 2gb thumb drives for $5 a pop.. I aint going to be doing much Multi-intall-hacking on my thumbdrives any time soon.
2008-12-09T05:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 i did get PuppyLinux+Geexbox on one THumbdrive however. and Ihad to manually edit the boot configs
2008-12-09T05:26:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	what file did you edit?
2008-12-09T05:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 depends on th boot loader its using.. syslinux has its syslinux.cfg
2008-12-09T05:28:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	Hrm and whatabout the gui something.32 leave that alone?
2008-12-09T05:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 no idea.. depends on the specific disrto you are messing with.
2008-12-09T05:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 it pays to read the syslinux config/docs :) its a powerfull tool
2008-12-09T05:29:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	Hrm I know both want their vesamenu.32
2008-12-09T05:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 i think that some how gives syslinux a nice looking menu.
2008-12-09T05:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	Bsims	 its proberly not needed.. if you set up a simple text menu
2011-11-25T10:22:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	with reason if ya were there for its teething pains
2012-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	Bsims	dr_willis	yeah f12 on dells isn't it?
