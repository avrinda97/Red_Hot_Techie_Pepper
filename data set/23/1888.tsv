2010-01-14T17:58:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Wrong, WUBI is very nice, yet if it's possible to do a clean install, I would do one.
2010-01-14T18:00:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	then how does one reinstall grub4dos when it is unable to read the menu.lst equivalent?
2010-01-14T18:00:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	There is no grub4dos, huh? WUBI 9.10 uses normal grub2 at least.
2010-01-14T18:03:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	ah, ok, well then how does one reinstall grub2 then (I thought it would still be on grub4dos since that's what the documentation seemed to imply)
2010-01-14T18:05:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Eh, whatever. WUBI is nice for windows installation, but meh, normal installs are ALWAYS better.
2010-01-19T19:17:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	"sudo fdisk -l" I guess
2010-01-19T19:18:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Hm. Where did sda2 get to? %) It has sda1 and sda3
2010-01-19T19:19:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	I'm innocent :|
2010-01-19T19:19:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	meaning: I have no clue ;)
2010-01-19T19:19:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Ah :D
2010-01-19T19:20:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	should you have a faulty partition table, testdisk might be able to help..
2010-01-19T19:21:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Meh, I messed with partitions a bit
2010-01-19T19:22:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	What do you mean by a "faulty" partition table?
2010-01-19T19:24:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	if you know sda3 should be there and it doesn't show up in fdisk, chances are the partition table might have gone a bit whacky, the partition table is a set of bytes at the start of the HD detailing where partions boundries start and end
2010-01-19T19:25:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	sda3 shows up, sda2 doesn't. Altough it shouldn't exactly, well, I think I'm starting to make sense of it
2010-01-19T19:25:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	if you deleted sda2, it shouldn't no
2010-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	Yup at least according to som post on the planet
2010-05-07T20:40:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	Using the repository version? (Don't)
2010-05-07T20:41:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	*ubuntu repo..
2010-05-07T20:41:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Not an idiot. Their site instructs not to use the ubuntu one.
2010-05-08T15:45:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Xubuntu _should_ work on that machine... crunchbang is pretty meh.
2010-05-15T21:07:00.000Z	arand	theadmin	(as per Q in +1) No liceCDs yet. Edit your sources.list and apt-it.
2010-05-15T21:07:00.000Z	theadmin	arand	Well, wow. Nah that's not something I'd go with... I'd rather run it in a vbox or something :P Oh well whatever
