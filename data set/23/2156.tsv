2009-06-14T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	just ask
2009-06-14T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	you need to use sudo before that command, I think
2009-06-14T01:49:00.000Z	|Ryan	Slart	I'm told NOT to use sudo.
2009-06-14T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	ie you need to run it as root..
2009-06-14T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	who told you not to use sudo?
2009-06-14T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	oohh.. "the website".. well.. it's your call then
2009-06-14T01:50:00.000Z	|Ryan	Slart	It says I must be in a 'root' terminal, how can I access this?
2009-06-14T01:50:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	just use sudo instead
2009-06-14T23:14:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	the guys in #winehq probably does
2009-06-17T21:12:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	I guess some people think KDE is easier to change/customize
2009-06-17T21:13:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	I've also heard that it resembles the windows enviroment from microsoft more than gnome
2009-06-17T21:13:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	if you ask me it's down to taste.. I think KDE looks and feels... strange =)
2009-06-17T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	that's what I've heard.
2009-06-17T21:15:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	system properties? such as?
2009-06-17T21:16:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	hmm.. I'm not following.. not running .exe files properly? we're still talking about linux, right?
2009-06-22T23:28:00.000Z	Slart	|Ryan	djfjnd
