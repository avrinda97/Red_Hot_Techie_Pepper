2006-01-12T13:06:00.000Z	cutterjohn		hello
2006-01-12T13:07:00.000Z	cutterjohn		I was wondering if anyone might be able to offer some insight into a network problem?  (May not be a network problem after all, but...)
2006-01-12T13:08:00.000Z	cutterjohn		Drayen, thx
2006-01-12T13:08:00.000Z	cutterjohn		Here goes, I've got a powerpc Ubuntu linux(5.04) running dialup and acting as a router for my LAN.
2006-01-12T13:09:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	sounds like a fun project
2006-01-12T13:13:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	everything you typed.. it was a lot, paste it into a pastebin, and i'll read that, it was hard to keep up.
2006-01-12T13:14:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	link to the pastebin in channel
2006-01-12T13:16:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	it doesn't _really_ matter, but the ubuntu one has the nice logos and what not :P
2006-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	link is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6755
2006-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	ty
2006-01-12T13:23:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	omfg, that shit's over my head. but one question: how can you afford a win2k, bsd, and linux box, but not a decent internet connection?
2006-01-12T13:26:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	win2k box is 5y old, FreeBSD box in something like 8u old, and notebooks is also c. 5y old
2006-01-12T13:26:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	ah, okay.
2006-01-12T13:27:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	thx for trying, I've looked into everything that I could think of and frankly if I can sustain bandwidth on http connections, I should also be able to via https as that is just encrypted http...
2006-01-12T13:27:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	very annoying...
2006-01-12T13:29:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	you wouldn't happen to know of someone else I could bounce that off of, or of someplace else to try would you?
2006-01-12T13:30:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	do you mean another channel to ask in, or what?
2006-01-12T13:30:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	another channel, another person, a web site, pretty much anything/place...
2006-01-12T13:31:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	I've been beating on that problem for about a week off and on, and it's driving me nuts...
2006-01-12T13:32:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	honestly, sorry to say it, but when i have hard quiestions that #ubuntu can't answer, i try #mandriva
2006-01-12T13:32:00.000Z	cutterjohn	kameron	would that be on the freenode network as well?
2006-01-12T13:32:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	yes sir
2006-01-12T13:33:00.000Z	kameron	cutterjohn	all the distros have a channel here, aswell as help for programming languages, programs like wine, etc.
