2008-02-12T15:59:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	lots, did it used to work, is it live CD or full instalation
2008-02-12T16:02:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	say X at a console, what are the last few line (no screens found I suspect)
2008-02-12T16:04:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	try alt and arrow, cycle right round all the VTs, if so you need to delete the lock, I'll remember where that is in a minute
2008-02-12T16:04:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	the lock ix /tmp/.X0-lock
2008-02-12T16:04:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	yes, that one :)
2008-02-12T16:05:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	could be that it is running on a different output, or thinks it is
2008-02-12T16:05:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	fix it, well it really is to see if it's bound to another VT than F7
2008-02-12T16:07:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	i am at the black gnome login screen and did the alt right thing, and no other screens are coming up
2008-02-12T16:09:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	i remove the lock and go X again, and the black screen comes back
2008-02-12T16:09:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	black screen?
2008-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	as in the TTY disappears and all that appears is a black screen
2008-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	and when I go CTRL, ALT F1 brings up the tty
2008-02-12T16:11:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	nothing, its just black like night
2008-02-12T16:11:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	in /etc/X11/xorg.conf change Driver in Device section to "vesa"
2008-02-12T16:12:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	roger
2008-02-12T16:12:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	try again, just X
2008-02-12T16:14:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	changed the driver to vesa and rebooting now
2008-02-12T16:14:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	its doing something
2008-02-12T16:15:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	its got a green distortion at the top and the wait cursor is displayed, but then goes back to the black bootup screen
2008-02-12T16:16:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	something is badly wrong
2008-02-12T16:16:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	i will try booting up with the live cd and see if it that boots up
2008-02-12T16:17:00.000Z	Hadeshorn	bascule	is this too much of a fuckup to fix.. should i just reinstall ubuntu?
2008-02-12T16:17:00.000Z	bascule	Hadeshorn	no, in live cd copy it's working xorg.conf to the installation one
