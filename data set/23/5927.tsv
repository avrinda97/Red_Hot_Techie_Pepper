2006-07-31T05:29:00.000Z	JamieBE		Hi peeps
2006-07-31T05:29:00.000Z	JamieBE		It appears that the search util in Ubuntu only searched Home dir by default. How can I make it search the entire Filesystem??
2006-07-31T05:30:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- when you are searching simply chg the directory of where to search
2006-07-31T05:37:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	nope just a "Search Results"

2006-07-31T05:39:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	- I see now! For some reason that section was collapsed as default
2006-07-31T05:39:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	you seem pretty smart. I have just done a search for what I am after and have had no luck
2006-07-31T05:41:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- go ahead and ask
2006-07-31T05:41:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- what are you looking for to customize?
2006-07-31T05:41:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- have you used Alacerte Menu Editor at all?
2006-07-31T05:48:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	- My guess would be that the menu structures along with icon allocation and command line are saved in an XML structure somewhere. it would be the sensible way to save it. But I cant find this anywhere?
2006-07-31T05:49:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	theres a bunch of xml files that call out the preferences there, including icons, etc
2006-07-31T05:50:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- i wish i had the spare time / programming experience to do things just like that
2006-07-31T05:50:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- have you browsed around ~/.gconf/apps/panel at all?
2006-07-31T05:52:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- those xml files all define that I 'think'
2006-07-31T06:07:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	sorry then :(
2006-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	See the XML here? /etc/gnome-vfs-2.0/vfolders
2006-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- yes....
2006-07-31T06:15:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	Sorry - There are more .menu files somewhere on the computer
2006-07-31T06:16:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- you sure you included hidden files?
2006-07-31T06:16:00.000Z	magnus87	JamieBE	- Places > search for files, then click the drop down for more options, and select "show hiddent and backup files", then click "add"
2006-07-31T06:32:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	I cant find these panel menu structure anywhere
2006-07-31T06:34:00.000Z	JamieBE	magnus87	Enough of that. I have managed to change my distributer logo, but it isn't taking effect in the menu bar. Someone suggested that it was due to my not using the default Ubuntu Human theme. Does anyone know where gnome-themes files are saved?
