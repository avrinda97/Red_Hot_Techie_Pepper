2006-08-22T13:51:00.000Z	Lattyware		Ugh, ok.
2006-08-22T13:51:00.000Z	Lattyware		I took out my ram, put it back in, and it hasn't crashed, but now, X won't start
2006-08-22T13:51:00.000Z	Lattyware		I get an error 'No Screens'
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	Lattyware		The config file is fine.
2006-08-22T13:54:00.000Z	Lattyware		I had a problem with RAM, got a Memtest error, so I asked here, and was reccommended to re-seat the RAM, which I did, now X will not start with a 'No Screens' error. The config file is fine.

2006-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Lattyware	whats the downgrade.php for?
2006-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Lattyware	oh I see, it redirects
2006-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	Lattyware	NickGarvey	Just a PHP redirect, it redirects to the really long URL
2006-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Lattyware	yup, try "tinyurl.com" though
2006-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	Lattyware	NickGarvey	I didn't think that would work, as it's META redirection.
