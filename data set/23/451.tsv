2011-08-17T00:00:00.000Z	gskelling		but thanks for the tip
2011-08-17T00:01:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	blacklist the nvidia drivers
2011-08-17T00:01:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	so what if i want to use the nvidia graphics card?
2011-08-17T00:02:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	you can not in linux.. Nvidia does not support optimus
2011-08-17T00:02:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	if you really wanted to you could try the bumblebee project
2011-08-17T00:02:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	i dont want optimus I just want the nvidia one all the time =\
2011-08-17T00:03:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	yes but the technology behind it is optimus.. the nvidia gpu's output goes through the intel gpu
2011-08-17T00:04:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	no, they work together
2011-08-17T00:05:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	there are a few laptop which allow discrete GPU's like the lenovo T520.. you could check in your bios
2011-08-17T00:05:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	yes.. basicially.. but linux can get to the nvidia GPU direct
2011-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	yes
2011-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	bad experiences :) well it was working but performance wasnt any good
2011-08-17T09:39:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	ok you can disable the intel one? do that
2011-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	I get much better battery life with just the intel one though
2011-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	yeah.. do you game?
2011-08-17T09:41:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	a little, not much
2011-08-17T09:41:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	well the intel one is fine if you dont.. and with kernel 3.0 is actually pretty good (2000fps in glxgears)
2011-08-17T09:42:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	also disabling the intel graphics card requires me to turn my ASUS laptops SATA mode to "compatible" instead of "Enhanced" which I'm afraid would mess up the performance of my SSD
2011-08-17T09:42:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	you are lucky you have the option.. I'm stuck
2011-08-17T09:42:00.000Z	gskelling	SIFTU	what laptop?
2011-08-17T09:43:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	dell XPS 15 l502x
2011-08-17T09:44:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	yeah has the i7 quad
2011-08-17T09:45:00.000Z	SIFTU	gskelling	you could get it from a PPA or manually compile it
