2008-12-04T22:37:00.000Z	greencookie		Hi I work on an office computer (running Ubuntu) which is always on. When I come and login in the mornings I would like to have my emails automatically downloaded into /var/mail/[username] so that I can check it with mutt. How can I do that? thanks in advance.
2008-12-04T22:38:00.000Z	norbert79	greencookie	Thats not an easy topic. First you have to find out what method your company uses for mailing
2008-12-04T22:38:00.000Z	greencookie	norbert79	what bout gmail?
2008-12-04T22:38:00.000Z	norbert79	greencookie	Does your company uses Gmail for internal mailing? :)
2008-12-04T22:39:00.000Z	norbert79	greencookie	I see :) Well, what does your place use for mails? POP? IMAP?
2008-12-04T22:39:00.000Z	greencookie	norbert79	I would like to fetch Gmail via IMAP.
2008-12-04T22:39:00.000Z	greencookie	norbert79	do I need fetchmail to do that?
2008-12-04T22:40:00.000Z	norbert79	greencookie	Not used mutt long time... hmm, let me trace this on google
2008-12-04T22:40:00.000Z	greencookie	norbert79	when sshing into my campus's linux server it tells me 'You have no new mail' and when i type 'mail' if i have it, then it shows me my mail, i can even mail using 'mail [username]' do you know what program that is?
