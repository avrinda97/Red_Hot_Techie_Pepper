2009-08-14T03:34:00.000Z	Berzerker		to /usr/something
2009-08-14T03:36:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	if you don't apply security updates for 3.5 it would be wiser to stay with 3.0 all together
2009-08-14T03:39:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	you could set up firefox-3.5 as your default browser, then every thing will be started by FF 3.5, if you want to start FF 3.5 from console by using the command firefox you can set an alias firefox= firefox-3.5 in bashrc. I have never bothered with the icon though
2009-08-14T03:39:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	if it only affects your startmenu you can edit the startmenu entry
2009-08-14T03:55:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	how do I uninstall it from my manual install?
2009-08-14T03:58:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	once you installed something, your package manager should be able to find it
2009-08-14T03:59:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	I found out how to change the icon/text. it's in the Main Menu application under preferences.
2009-08-14T03:59:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	:)
2009-08-14T04:03:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	and refreshing the netbook-launcher made it keep changes, worked like a charm.
2009-08-14T04:12:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	I have another problem
2009-08-14T04:13:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
2009-08-14T04:14:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	and you get that message when you try to download something, not at startup?
2009-08-14T04:14:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	yes when I try to download something
2009-08-14T04:16:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	close the window you have opened, open a terminal and type firefox-3.5 -safe-mode this will start FF in safe-mode, test if you get the same problem still
2009-08-14T04:17:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	it's the merkeet addon
2009-08-14T04:17:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	wasn't fully compatable with 3.5.2, even though it would say it is
2009-08-14T04:18:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	good to know.  safemode will start FF with all addons  disabled, so you can quickly know if one of the addons is at fault. :)
2009-08-14T04:19:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	yeah, btw, is there a way to add a shortcut to paste in terminal?
2009-08-14T04:20:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	how do you mean? alt+f2 can be used to run comands, but not sure this is what you are looking for?
2009-08-14T04:23:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	like if I see a command I need to execute on firefox, and I need to run it in terminal, I can't ctrl+c and ctrl+v
2009-08-14T04:24:00.000Z	kaddi	Berzerker	you can just highlight the text you need and then use the middle mouse-button or click the left and the right button similtaneously to insert the text as well
2009-08-14T04:37:00.000Z	Berzerker	kaddi	also found a script that will change the branding of the browser to Mozilla Firefox and the logo of the application itself to the orange firefox
