2010-10-21T10:31:00.000Z	FriGiN		I am having troubles keeping my Linksys/Cisco WUSB54GC v3 [Ralink RT2870] to hold a connection. it randomly dies, and stays dead. It also is very broad in the data transfer rates, it will be fine then go super slow.  Any suggestions?
2010-10-21T10:32:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	ralink stuff works better with compat-wireless drivers
2010-10-21T10:33:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	can ya walk a noob thru settin that up?
2010-10-21T10:34:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	i.e. linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic 2.6.35-22.12 from source linux-backports-modules-2.6.35
2010-10-21T10:34:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	save us both time if you search for "compat-wireless" and the codename of your ubuntu release
2010-10-21T10:35:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	 will do thx.
2010-10-21T10:36:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	I have a ralink chipset here on my ALFA 1/2watt wifi adapter ;)  so I noticed that it dropped wifi link with high number of network connections in the new wifi driver and compat-wireless driver works better for me
2010-10-21T10:37:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	yes thats what its lookin like here.. im just new back to linux after a long long stretch away and my brain doesnt do what it used to do.  Got old and dumb.
2010-10-21T10:38:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	it's like trying to hop on a moving train ;)  no worries
2010-10-21T10:42:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	i just installed "2.6.35-22.12 (linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic-pae)" via ubuntu software center, is that about what i need to do?
2010-10-21T10:54:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	am i literally typing "./scripts/driver-select <driver-name>
2010-10-21T10:55:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	huh? oh it should be far simpler than that
2010-10-21T10:56:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	i ended up using ubuntu software center to get 2.6.35-22.12 (linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic-pae) but afaik it didnt do much of anything but dl it.. i didnt dc or rc as the helps say i should
2010-10-21T10:57:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	oh, did you need PAE?
2010-10-21T10:58:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	the modules should match 'uname -r' output, is all.  If it says PAE in your uname output, then you need PAE, I *think*
2010-10-21T10:58:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	PAE is for folks with 4+GB ram to say it simply
2010-10-21T11:02:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	so if i used the ubuntu software center to get that driver.. am i good or do i need to do something to tell the system to use that driver instead of the default one?
2010-10-21T11:03:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	good question, after installation of the package you will need to reboot, but that may not be enough
2010-10-21T11:04:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	I remember all I had to do was reboot and the compat-wireless versions of the modules were then being used
2010-10-21T11:09:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	i'm totally horked. im getting device descripptor read/64,  error -71 system does not boot
2010-10-21T11:10:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	how'd you do that?
2010-10-21T11:11:00.000Z	FriGiN	lucent	 nfc... i restarted to restart the wireless like i always do.. now im sitting at a boot screen saying sorry bub you sck.
2010-10-21T11:11:00.000Z	lucent	FriGiN	privmsg, maybe we can sort it out
