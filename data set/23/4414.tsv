2007-08-19T05:27:00.000Z	jimmitastic		dooglus_:E: Couldn't find package build-essential
2007-08-19T05:27:00.000Z	jimmitastic		haha yes! I downloaded it yesterday
2007-08-19T05:28:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	which version?
2007-08-19T05:28:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	did you mess about with your sources.list?
2007-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	can you paste the output of this command please:      grep 'feisty *main' /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-19T05:30:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	/usr/bin/ is empty?
2007-08-19T05:31:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	that's to be expected
2007-08-19T05:31:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	did you "sudo apt-get update" recently?  if not, try it, then try the "sudo apt-get install build-essential" again
2007-08-19T05:37:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	I think because ubuntu is for end users.  the idea is that everything is available in binary form, so compilers and the like aren't needed
2007-08-19T05:38:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	if all you want is an up-to-date version of GNU Emacs, I have a .deb of the current CVS code
2007-08-19T05:40:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus	cheers, to be honest I am doing this partly just to learn how to download unzip use vi/emacs and generally get to grips with the system before I start my uni course in october,
2007-08-19T05:40:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	sure
2007-08-19T05:41:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	are you wanting to learn about debian/ubuntu in particular?  or just "building stuff" in general?
2007-08-19T05:42:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	I would suggest just installing the binary emacs package.  you won't learn anything much by building Emacs from source
2007-08-19T05:45:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus	for example I've worked out you need this build-essentials package for development which I wouldnt have known otherwise
2007-08-19T05:46:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	build-essential is really an empty package - it doesn't contain anything useful at all - but it depends on a bunch of other packages.
2007-08-19T05:46:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	so it truth, you don't need build-essential at all - you could have installed its dependencies one-by-one instead
2007-08-19T05:47:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus	but then I REALLY would have got annoyed!
2007-08-19T05:48:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	if you run this:  "apt-cache show build-essential | grep Depends"  you'll see the list of things that build-essential depends on.  that's all it does
2007-08-19T05:50:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	the problem is that some programs use control-v to do something
2007-08-19T05:51:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	suppose you're running Emacs inside a terminal.  control-v is used by Emacs to scroll down.  if the terminal stole all control-v keypresses, Emacs wouldn't see them
2007-08-19T05:51:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	you can change the keybindings for any GTK program to whatever you like, anyway
2007-08-19T06:29:00.000Z	dooglus	jimmitastic	it will automatically be in your path - just type "emacs" to run it - or find it in the applications menu
