2005-03-15T12:52:00.000Z	|QuaD-		or something like that
2005-03-15T12:53:00.000Z	|QuaD-		so you can install that
2005-03-15T12:54:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	Hmm.
2005-03-15T12:45:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	i haven't gotten it yet either
2005-03-15T12:51:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	so, is this a bug that needs reporting?
2005-03-15T12:52:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	hmm, one of the developers can fix it quickly when they are around
2005-03-15T12:52:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	did you try apt-get install ubuntu-calendar-march
2005-03-15T12:53:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	hold on
2005-03-15T12:53:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	the package exists according to apt: ubuntu-calendar-march
2005-03-15T12:54:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	no idea... i try to not use gui's :)
2005-03-15T12:55:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	warty or Hoary?
2005-03-15T12:55:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	hoary
2005-03-15T12:57:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	I'm on warty.
2005-03-15T12:57:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	thats probably why.... how come you don't upgrade to hoary?
2005-03-15T12:57:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	waiting for Hoary final.
2005-03-15T12:58:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	ok. just to let you know, hoary is more or less as stable as its going to get
2005-03-15T12:58:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	I'm conservative.
2005-03-15T12:58:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	understandable :)
2005-03-15T12:59:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	if that's true, what remains to be done before final?
2005-03-15T12:59:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	nothing really major i don't think, the packages are more or less frozen (just fixing bugs and security releases as they come around)
2005-03-15T13:00:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	haha ok :)
2005-03-15T13:01:00.000Z	|QuaD-	WebMaven_	i would assume
2005-03-15T14:11:00.000Z	WebMaven_	|QuaD-	so has a dev shown up yet?
