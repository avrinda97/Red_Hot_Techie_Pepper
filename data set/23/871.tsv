2011-01-29T18:41:00.000Z	novitololo		Hi there: I've modified permissions for /var/www, and I have the following now: ''drwxrwxr-x  2 root web   4096 2011-01-29 11:27 www''. I'm logged in a user who belongs to the 'web' group, but when I try to write a file into the www folder it doesn't let me do it. Any thoughts?
2011-01-29T18:42:00.000Z	novitololo		root
2011-01-29T18:43:00.000Z	novitololo		user --> root, group --> web
2011-01-29T18:43:00.000Z	novitololo		mmm
2011-01-29T18:43:00.000Z	novitololo		I did relogin
2011-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	novitololo		well, I closed the terminal, and opened again
2011-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	novitololo		what do u mean?
2011-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	novitololo		permissions?
2011-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	where did the "web" grouo come from? usuallt the httpd processes on Ubuntu run as www-data
2011-01-29T18:45:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	use the "groups" command to ensure the users you *think* are in the "web" group are actually members
2011-01-29T18:49:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	log out and back in
2011-01-29T18:49:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	your user is part of the "web" group, but your current session is unaware of the change.
2011-01-29T18:50:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	terminals attach to your current session, managed by GDM
2011-01-29T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	what httpd are you using?
2011-01-29T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	ps aux | grep apache
2011-01-29T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	note the user/group that Apache runs as
2011-01-29T18:55:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	www-data is a group created when you install an httpd. the httpd runs as this user.
2011-01-29T18:56:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	sure, but i would use the existing group. the way you have things now, your webroot wil have to be world-readable in order for Apache to serve the pages
2011-01-29T18:58:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	i would add anyone that needs to edit and change web content to a special group ("web" will work). then chown and chmod tyhe webroot to web:www-data 644
2011-01-29T18:59:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	the httpd should not have to write out to files, so read should be enough
2011-01-29T18:59:00.000Z	mneptok	novitololo	de nada
2011-01-29T19:01:00.000Z	novitololo	mneptok	gobbe: I have to go to eat, I will be right back. Thanks a lot
2011-01-29T19:32:00.000Z	novitololo	mneptok	I'm back.  I don't understand this operation that you told me: ''novitololo: i would add anyone that needs to edit and change web content to a special group ("web" will work). then chown and chmod tyhe webroot to web:www-data 644''
