2007-09-26T16:12:00.000Z	casey		can anyone tell me what this means?:  http://pastebin.com/d60953f6e
2007-09-26T16:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	first ubuntu uses ash as default sh and not bash. second: you do not have kernel-headers instaled
2007-09-26T16:15:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	so what do I do to fix it?
2007-09-26T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	for the first error jus use the work araoun proposed and use 'make SHELL=/bin/bash'
2007-09-26T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	for the second error 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)'
2007-09-26T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	if you are building a driver you will need build-essential too
2007-09-26T16:18:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	the $ being my kernel and I leave the (uname -r)?
2007-09-26T16:20:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	sorry.  It says both are all ready the newest version?
2007-09-26T16:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	just copy paste ( $(uname -r) gets evaluated by the shell)
2007-09-26T16:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	well then you are ready to go use the modified make command
2007-09-26T16:21:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	I still get the same error though.
2007-09-26T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	with 'make SHELL=/bin/bash' ?
2007-09-26T16:22:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	http://pastebin.com/d54185984
2007-09-26T16:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	are you sure you run this 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)' as is ?
2007-09-26T16:23:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	I have no /source but there is a Makefile in .../build
2007-09-26T16:24:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	yes.  both packages said they were the latest version
2007-09-26T16:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	the i dunno what's going wrong...
2007-09-26T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	i checked the intel site... dis you installed the new mac80211 subsystem first?
2007-09-26T16:28:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	yes and I checked that it was running
2007-09-26T16:29:00.000Z	casey	erUSUL	I ran modprobe mac80211 and didn't get any errors, and it was listed in lsmod
2007-09-26T16:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	well you will have to ask in their support forums or mailing list
2009-07-26T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	in linux is /etc/init.d/ for suystem wide scripts... or simply add a call to your script from /etc/rc.local
2009-07-26T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	casey	if you want to run it when you log in.. System>Preferences>init apps
