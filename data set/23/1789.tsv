2009-10-27T06:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	krkelly	what's not happening?
2009-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	krkelly		well he's using the remote desktop client on kubuntu
2009-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	krkelly		and it's telling him to give me his private IP
2009-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	krkelly		19.168...
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	krkelly		but obviously, that's not going to help me get into his machine
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	almoxarife		you two on the same network?
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	krkelly		no
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	almoxarife		is he behind a firewall?
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	krkelly		well, on a router
2009-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	krkelly		so i guess
2009-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	almoxarife		if he is firewalled this won't work, but what you need is his public ip
2009-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	krkelly		how can i get his public IP?
2009-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	almoxarife		he gives it to you
2009-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	krkelly		haha...  how can he get that?  (sorry, noob here)
2009-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	krkelly	then you enter his public ip and port into your logon
2009-10-27T06:36:00.000Z	krkelly	almoxarife	how can he get his public IP for me?
2009-10-27T06:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	krkelly	he must know what his internet provider has decided to give him for an ip?
2009-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	krkelly	can he come here and chat?
2009-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	krkelly	almoxarife	i don't think he does?  can he get it by logging into the router?
2009-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	krkelly	almoxarife	i'll try to get him in here (he's an even worse noob than me)
2009-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	krkelly	he could
