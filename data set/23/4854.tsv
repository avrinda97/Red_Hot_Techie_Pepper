2007-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	rilak		When I return home from work, my laptop is set to "Roaming".  No big deal, I switch to "Home" via NetworkManager's applet interface.
2007-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	rilak		Then my connection dies after a random number of seconds.
2007-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	rilak		Everything shows up fine.
2007-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	rilak		IP is set to static one, mii-diag shows everything is working, but no data goes through.
2007-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	rilak		When I switch back to DHCP, it starts again.
2007-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	rilak		but I wasn't able to set the static IP by any means once after my laptop starts with a DHCP address.
2007-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	rilak		nothing is being neither sent neither received, to the best of my knowledge.
2007-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	rilak		I've tried disabling avahi daemon, didn't help
2007-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	rilak		it wasn't the culprit
2007-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	rilak		so my question is then: where can I start to tinker in order to diagnose my network problem?  I'm not all too well familiar with networking.
2007-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	test if you can ping, make sure something is in /etc/resolve.conf, ifconfig gives info, try ifdown and ifup for your connection. apt-get remove avahi-daemon
2007-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	rilak	trogdor	nope, yes, yes, doesn't work
2007-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	rilak	trogdor	I disable avahi-daemon by hand: /etc/init.d/avahi stop
2007-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	tried a different cord?
2007-10-03T05:22:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	its worked before though right?
2007-10-03T05:22:00.000Z	rilak	trogdor	I think this started to happen at some point, I'm not quite sure
2007-10-03T05:23:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	anything on dmesg? is your card claimed on lshw?
2007-10-03T05:23:00.000Z	rilak	trogdor	I tail -f my syslog at the time when my connection stops working -- NOTHING there
2007-10-03T05:25:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	so its working now?
2007-10-03T05:25:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	probably your router, I had some trouble with mine
2007-10-03T05:26:00.000Z	rilak	trogdor	actually it works with Windows quite well, and I've changed routers in the meantine
2007-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	trying using wireshark for a while plugged into your router offline, log any oddities
2007-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	trogdor	rilak	if all else fails that is
