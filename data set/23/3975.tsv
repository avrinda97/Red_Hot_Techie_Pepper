2009-10-05T10:56:00.000Z	undeclaredx		unetbootin.
2009-10-05T10:56:00.000Z	undeclaredx		yup
2009-10-05T10:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	what went wrong w/ unetbootin?
2009-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	usb-creator only takes IMG files to my knowledge
2009-10-05T11:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	yes, not an ISO
2009-10-05T11:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	are you using unetbootin under Linux?
2009-10-05T11:01:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	I would be, yeah
2009-10-05T11:01:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	at this point I may simply use unetbootin's automatic creator so to speak.. where it downloads and does everything
2009-10-05T11:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	before you use unetbootin, open gparted, and format the thumb drive as ext3, then use unetbootin.. for some reason under Ubuntu, unetbooin will nto work w/ a fat32 filesystem
2009-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	okay.
2009-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	well, that is extremely slow, but you can do that
2009-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	well on 20 megabit internet (at my school) it should be like 5 minutes
2009-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	plus, if somethng goes wrong, you won't have to download the ISO again.
2009-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	err, you missed my point
2009-10-05T11:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	so were you trying to do the Live version?
2009-10-05T11:03:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	just the alternate iso
2009-10-05T11:03:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	and it was like "I need to contact the internet"
2009-10-05T11:04:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	- anyhow, like I said, it should just work and since its 20 mbit inet, it will work reallly quickly
2009-10-05T11:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	hopefully
2009-10-05T11:04:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	I will format it to ext3 as well.. why not
2009-10-05T11:07:00.000Z	undeclaredx	IndyGunFreak	correct me if I'm wrong, but Kubuntu is mainly the same thing except presented more along the lines of like start menu-ish?
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	no, theya re different
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	undeclaredx	how the GUI's work is different.. not to mention kde sucks
