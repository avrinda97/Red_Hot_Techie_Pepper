2011-10-24T16:40:00.000Z	lesshaste		what's the easiest way to use a laptop as a wireless bridge. The laptop is connected via wired ethernet to the internet and I would like to use its wireless card to allow other devices to connect too
2011-10-24T16:42:00.000Z	Singham	lesshaste	: Try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
2011-10-24T16:42:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	ok thanks
2011-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	hmm.. have you done this
2011-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	the instructions are a little unclear
2011-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	does it cover the case where the laptop has a wired connection to the internet and also a wireless nic that you want to use to share the connection?
2011-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	Singham	lesshaste	: Yes..
2011-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	ok.. why do you change the Method to "Shared to other computers" from dhcp for the wired connecton? How does it get its ip address in that case?

2011-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	I think I see.. I need to get the wireless connection up and running somehow do that network manager sees it at the same tme as the wired noe
2011-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	lesshaste		one
2011-10-24T16:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	I think :)
2011-10-24T16:53:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	hmm.. so my problem is that wlan0 is not actually listed by network manager
2011-10-24T16:53:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	although  I can see it in ifconfig
2011-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	Singham	lesshaste	: Ont eh top panel , click on the network connections icon..There you will fing a option called "Create a new wireless network"
2011-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	I do see that
2011-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	it has empty slots for bssid and mac address
2011-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	what should go in there?
2011-10-24T16:59:00.000Z	Singham	lesshaste	: Wait a sec
2011-10-24T16:59:00.000Z	lesshaste	Singham	k
