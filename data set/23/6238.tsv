2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	hollerith		I imagine everyone looking for w32codecs is just getting this pkg error right now
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	hollerith		Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	hollerith		its a simple case of the file having a different name
2006-06-07T16:47:00.000Z	hollerith		where do these packages live and can I interrupt an install long enough to correct the path?
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	hollerith		or am I going the wrong way about this?
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	hollerith		symlinks removed using rm
2006-06-07T16:49:00.000Z	hollerith		you could pipe the list to a file
2006-06-07T16:49:00.000Z	hollerith		and add the rm if they don't have some commonality
2006-06-07T16:50:00.000Z	hollerith		some ...er something .. mathchable quality
