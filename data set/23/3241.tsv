2009-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	what type of video card do you have?
2009-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	system > administration > hardware drivers
2009-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	and install the restricted driver.
2009-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	what is the problem?
2009-04-21T07:02:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	that deals with resolution that does not help me with my frequancy problem
2009-04-21T07:03:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	well you can specify monitor specific settings in xorg.conf or let the xserver detect them on its own.
2009-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-04-21T07:05:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	yeah the other issue is xorg.conf isn't used anymore.  But you can still specify monitor specific settings in there.  You can set horizontal and vsync ranges.  That howto should go into that.
2009-04-21T07:06:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	that hoto guide is like 20 pages ...
2009-04-21T07:06:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	well you have to be carefull with setting ranges manually you can actually damage your monitor with an improper one. Can you pastebin your xorg.conf and the /var/log/xorg.0.log
2009-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	the other thing to try to fix the xserver is sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
2009-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	or is it dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2009-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	 i'v tryed that
2009-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	http://pastebin.com/m49cb180a  <--xorg.conf
2009-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	yes and you should have an error log in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-04-21T07:12:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	http://pastebin.com/m62a72c41 <--- log
2009-04-21T07:12:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	the xorg.conf looks normal
2009-04-21T07:13:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	also it looks like the nvidia driver isn't loading
2009-04-21T07:14:00.000Z	aasdf	histo	 if i give you vnc access can you help me fix it
2009-04-21T07:14:00.000Z	histo	aasdf	can you pm me
