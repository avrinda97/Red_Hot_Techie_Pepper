2007-07-12T15:30:00.000Z	ilu		<mwe> after i have done the chmod +x <filename> what should i do? just type the name to execute it?
2007-07-12T15:31:00.000Z	ilu		<mwe> RealPlayer/Google earth. your tip did not work btw
2007-07-12T15:32:00.000Z	ilu		<IndyGunFreak> well i downloaded realplayer because i wanted to install it and it was this bin file
2007-07-12T15:32:00.000Z	ilu		i have no clue how to get it to work
2007-07-12T15:32:00.000Z	ilu		i thought bin file was binary and readdy to execute
2007-07-12T15:32:00.000Z	ilu		sure
2007-07-12T15:33:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	should be like ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin to execute it
2007-07-12T15:36:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	google earth should have a shortcut under Applications/Internet
2007-07-12T15:37:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	probably under Applications/Sound&Video
2007-07-12T15:41:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	I usually install misc apps under /usr/local/
2007-07-12T15:41:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	just do something like /usr/local/real
2007-07-12T15:42:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	it's under /usr, so you gotta use sudo before your commands
2007-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	if you still have problem just ctrl+c outta that installation and open a command prompt and install it with sudo apt-get install realplayer
2007-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	I think it's in the repos
2007-07-12T15:49:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	oh yeah it's realplay, good call Tajmox
2007-07-12T15:49:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	sudo apt-get install realplay
2007-07-12T15:49:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	mmm
2007-07-12T15:55:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	mwe: I found the problem, the .bin installer file gotta be executed with sudo first
2007-07-12T15:58:00.000Z	rec0m	ilu	np glad could be of help
