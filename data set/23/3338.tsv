2008-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	quinn	wgrant	i think it also has some trouble to upgrade from one version to another. sometimes the system may broken

2008-06-18T18:23:00.000Z	wgrant	quinn	I've not seen a situation more then a couple of weeks after release where an upgrade broke, as long as third-party repositories were not used.
2008-06-18T18:24:00.000Z	quinn	wgrant	maybe i install too many third-party software
2008-06-18T18:24:00.000Z	wgrant	quinn	That sounds right.
