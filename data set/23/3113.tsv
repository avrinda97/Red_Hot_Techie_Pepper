2008-07-23T04:49:00.000Z	Guest68309		how can I clean $? variable from a script ?
2008-07-23T04:51:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	$? is just the return status of a script/command.  there isn't much you can do with it
2008-07-23T04:51:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	it does always take cero result :S !!!
2008-07-23T04:51:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	and I don't know what to do :(
2008-07-23T04:52:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	you mean zero?
2008-07-23T04:52:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	yes zero
2008-07-23T04:52:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	is this your script?
2008-07-23T04:53:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	I am using xdialog, and when you press ok button come out 0, and when you press cancel button it takes zero value
2008-07-23T04:54:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	but my script is into cicle while, and I don't know what happen because it always takes zero value
2008-07-23T04:56:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	what does this return?  echo $(xdialog ...)
2008-07-23T04:57:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	let me pass you one piece of my script, wait
2008-07-23T04:57:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	it is big jajaj
2008-07-23T04:58:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	I know jaja
2008-07-23T05:00:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	check 538 line http://paste.ubuntu.com/29440/
2008-07-23T05:01:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	it is really big, jaja I hope you could read it
2008-07-23T05:02:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	 $? is only current right after you execute a command. you are testing $? after palabra=`cat /tmp/xdialog.tmp` which is too late
2008-07-23T05:03:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	put line 538 just before line 535
2008-07-23T05:03:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	mmmm jaja well let me try, thanks for the advice
2008-07-23T05:06:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	it still come out zero :(
2008-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	thanks anyways, I think because the variable $? I use it so many times after that line, when it come back takes the zero value, but I don't know how to reset it, or am I wrong ?
2008-07-23T05:15:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	hold on a sec
2008-07-23T05:16:00.000Z	Guest68309	unop	don't try to execute my script because it requires a lot of files as well
2008-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	unop	Guest68309	/usr/bin/Xdialog  --yesno "foo" 10 30; if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then echo yes $?; else echo no $?; fi
