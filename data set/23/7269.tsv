2006-01-11T10:49:00.000Z	BirdyKiller		I prefer passw0rd...  It has a 0 in it, and that's the strongest shape on the keyboard
2006-01-11T10:50:00.000Z	BirdyKiller		I hate password rules, though
2006-01-11T10:51:00.000Z	BirdyKiller		you end up with 50 different passwords that all require the same crappy rules
2006-01-11T10:51:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	without password rules you end up with a network full of passwords like 'password'
2006-01-11T10:52:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	yeah I don't dig password expiry.  you get users with 30 passwords that change every few weeks and have to be secure, and they start taping them to their monitors because they're impossible to remember.
2006-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	what seems to be the problem
2006-01-11T10:58:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	finally got drivers installed but they're gone after reboot... I can get you the error in a second
2006-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	"API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module is version 1.0.7667, but this X module is version 1.0.8178...please be sure they all have the same version"
2006-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	you have to tease me like that?  get me started and hopeful and then not say anything? :'(
2006-01-11T11:33:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	I'll volunteer to be your brother
2006-01-11T11:33:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	you haven't said a single thing to me since you asked what the problem was :)
2006-01-11T11:33:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	sorry, I stepped away and may have missed something :)
2006-01-11T11:34:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	I thought I removed em all, but I don't know the command to check :)
2006-01-11T11:35:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	removed all what?  command to check what?
2006-01-11T11:35:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	removed all nvidia packages, command to check if any linger
2006-01-11T11:35:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia
2006-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	thanks.  apt-get and I have to have a little talk.  I see nvidia-glx even though I distinctly remember removing it.
2006-01-11T11:38:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	there's also an nvidia-kernel-common, but I can't remove it without removing linux-amd64-generic etc.
2006-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	dpkg -L the package and remove its files
2006-01-11T12:05:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	trappist	thank you!
2006-01-11T13:28:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	what does it instantly kill?
2006-01-11T13:29:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	laptop?
2006-01-11T13:30:00.000Z	trappist	BirdyKiller	ah, I use the supercoder2000 myself.  watercooled, just two keys, 1 and 0
