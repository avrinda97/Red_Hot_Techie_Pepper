2009-07-24T05:27:00.000Z	asddasdas		is it possible to install Grub on windows partition
2009-07-24T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	maybe and that would be a bad idea
2009-07-24T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	it can go in the  MBR of a Windows hard disk though of course
2009-07-24T05:27:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	why would be a bad idea?
2009-07-24T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	,because   you don't want any of the Grub stuff inside Windows itself, you just don't
2009-07-24T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	,but you can put Grub in  the Master Boot Record of the Windows hard disk of course, the very first section
2009-07-24T05:31:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	can i do it using only WinXP, without installed any linux os
2009-07-24T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	don't think so, you will need a Live CD of some sort that will install Grub
2009-07-24T05:32:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	i have a live cd, using it right now
2009-07-24T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	you have Ubuntu installed already?
2009-07-24T05:33:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	no, i didnt
2009-07-24T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	ok so your  basically confussed as to where Grub is meant to go, hence why your asking these questions?
2009-07-24T05:34:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	well... no. my question is: can i install grub without installing any linux distribution. i'm ok with installing it in its own partition or something like that
2009-07-24T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	 why would you want Grub for Windows?  that does not make sense
2009-07-24T05:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	in fact there's even a Windows bootloader  that can be enabled
2009-07-24T05:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	that lets you boot other versions of Windows, and  I think with some kind of hack, other  operating  systems as well
2009-07-24T05:35:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	yes but i cant get to the recovery console from the windows cd
2009-07-24T05:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	well yes other operating systems can be  booted from  the Windows boot loader as well
2009-07-24T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	which recovery console?
2009-07-24T05:37:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	the one that lets you type 'fixmbr' to reinstall the windows bootloader
2009-07-24T05:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	ok well recovery mode in  the Ubuntu Grub  boot loader, is for   Ubuntu, and Ubuntu only
2009-07-24T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asddasdas	so basically as  I  been thinking for a while now,  your  asking for Windows help in  the Ubuntu channal?
2009-07-24T05:39:00.000Z	asddasdas	sebsebseb	i'm not sure, it's late and i'll probably go to bed right now... i'm tired :-/
