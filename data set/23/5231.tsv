2007-12-10T23:38:00.000Z	josh__		Well, read what I say?
2007-12-10T23:38:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	Well what error are you getting?
2007-12-10T23:40:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	helixplayer is in the repositories.
2007-12-10T23:42:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	do you specifically need realplayer or just something to play real files?
2007-12-10T23:43:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	let me know if you have any questions about that
2007-12-10T23:43:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	it doesnt hurt to try.
2007-12-10T23:47:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	Like I suggested earlier, you should install w32codecs off of the medibuntu repo.
2007-12-10T23:50:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	http://www.medibuntu.org
2007-12-10T23:53:00.000Z	josh__	Pici	I done the GPG, & repositories,
2007-12-10T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	open synaptic, and click refresh
2007-12-10T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	*tries to not respond sarcastically* er, yes, now.
2007-12-10T23:55:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	search for w32codecs and then install it
2007-12-10T23:55:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	yes, but I'm not sure if helixplayer takes advantage of those codecs, you may need to use totem or vlc
2007-12-11T01:27:00.000Z	Pici	josh__	sudo lshw | most will give you your computer specs
