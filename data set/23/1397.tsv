2011-03-06T10:01:00.000Z	j_dalmond		guys, does anyone know how to disable system messages like "ur flash drive is mounted" in cairo-dock?
2011-03-06T10:03:00.000Z	j_dalmond		any ideas?
2011-03-06T10:05:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	sorry, trying to solve my own problem, let me take a look
2011-03-06T10:06:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	oh, nothing to sorry for, thk you ))
2011-03-06T10:08:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	no, sorry... but there is a cairo-dock only channel right here at freenode, #cairo-dock
2011-03-06T10:08:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	already there, thx :-)
2011-03-06T10:17:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	probaby, home folder, then .local or .epiphany
2011-03-06T10:18:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	my thoughts too, and while there are some files there, like plugins, none of the pictures or flv files or html files are there, so it's not the proper directory. i'll try local though, didnt think of that
2011-03-06T10:18:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	one more variant in /usr/share/epiphany - but that's unlikely
2011-03-06T10:21:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	i actually checked that out too. epiphany has several places where it saves data, but not the main cache. it's not that big of a deal, i just like to look through the cache for pics and what not that i was interested in but decided not to save...
2011-03-06T10:34:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	:-D ok. sometimes i am
2011-03-06T10:22:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	well, u could just visit source site again if u remember. i'm sure it's address is in history
2011-03-06T10:23:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	yeah. it's not that big of a deal. i just hate it when there is no easy documentation for this stuff. this is a rather commonly asked question when it comes to web browsers, and i can tell you where firefox has it's tmp folder right off the spot.
2011-03-06T10:25:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	agree. well, u might want to try midori if u need i lightweight browser. works pretty f***ing good :-)
2011-03-06T10:26:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	i just sudo apt-get removed midori, i didnt like it, a little too buggy. epiphany is running better by far. and firefox, well, it's such a hog i have actually gotten the greyed out screen of bogged down-ism.
2011-03-06T10:28:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	agree about firefox, but after a few recent updates it works good even with _many_ multiple tabs, though some time ago it was _unbearably_ f***ing slow. well, but chromium is also _very_ good
2011-03-06T10:30:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	good to know. for now i am still going to stick with epiphany. i can't complain, it's not a need to know where the cache is.
2011-03-06T10:31:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	well, good then -)
2011-03-06T10:32:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	ahh, i see you are a cyclops
2011-03-06T10:32:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	cyclops? what do u mean?
2011-03-06T10:34:00.000Z	hylian	j_dalmond	your smiley was a  - ) (one eye) : )
2011-03-06T10:35:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	well, actually, it's kind of wide closed eyes with smile
2011-03-06T10:43:00.000Z	j_dalmond	hylian	first google result /home/username/.gnome2/epiphany - then cache or favicon_cache
