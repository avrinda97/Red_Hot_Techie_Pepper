2012-05-20T00:17:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	why wouldn't you just do a fresh install?
2012-07-05T21:25:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	have you got any ppas installed? It seems like you have a repository problem. What happens in terminal when you sudo apt-get update
2012-07-05T21:27:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	please make sure that synaptic/update mgr are closed btw.
2012-07-05T21:35:00.000Z	freshone0	L3top	can u see it now
2012-07-05T21:36:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	I need the output of: cat /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-07-05T21:38:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	please sudo mkdir ~/ppas; sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* ~/ppas
2012-07-05T21:39:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	then please pastebin the output of: cat /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-07-05T21:47:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	I would hash out the last two lines of that sources.list (# is a hash, just put it in front of the last two lines). gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	now sudo apt-get update   again
2012-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	you are on Ubuntu right? Not  a derivative?
2012-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	for instance kubuntu, lubuntu, xubuntu, mint (mint is not supported but a derivative) etc
2012-07-05T21:54:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	what happens when you type gksudo gedit
2012-07-05T21:55:00.000Z	L3top	freshone0	use file open to navigate to /etc/apt/sources.list
