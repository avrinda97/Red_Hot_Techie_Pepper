2010-09-11T03:21:00.000Z	Nach0z		no apache people in here? trying to set up a server in Ubuntu....
2010-09-11T03:22:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	What problems do you face ?
2010-09-11T03:23:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	I have little experience in ubuntu, to start with. and although apache is in the distro download manager thingy, i have NO idea how to set it up.
2010-09-11T03:23:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	`sudo apt-get install apache2` is enough
2010-09-11T03:23:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	uh, where do i put that :|
2010-09-11T03:23:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	And if you need, you can also `sudo apt-get install php5 mysql-server php5-mysql` ans so on ..
2010-09-11T03:24:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	In the terminal ( Applications menu > Accessories > Terminal )
2010-09-11T03:24:00.000Z	Nach0z		... ah. ok. thanks. brb
2010-09-11T03:24:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	OK
2010-09-11T03:26:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	could you elaborate on that last one a bit please? also, if we need to goto PM i can do that, the channel seems a bit clogged...

2010-09-11T03:26:00.000Z	Nach0z		.... i think my IRC is brokle
2010-09-11T03:27:00.000Z	Nach0z		oh. nevermind. it just wasnt scrolling down...
2010-09-11T03:28:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	What will you use Apache web server for ?
2010-09-11T03:28:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	i want to actually set up my own server at my house here.
2010-09-11T03:28:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	If you need only to offer HTML and JavaScript pages ( Static Website ), So installing `apache2` is enough
2010-09-11T03:29:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	i'm also gonna need PHP. and probably CSS and whatever else rolls in with that stuff.
2010-09-11T03:29:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	If you need dynamic websites ( PHP & MySQL ), You'd need also `php5 & mysql-server & php5-mysql`
2010-09-11T03:29:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	So, do `sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server php5-mysql`
2010-09-11T03:29:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	just standard coding pages. also i'm trying to double it as an IRC server on another port, so i'll have to keep looking in that...
2010-09-11T03:29:00.000Z	Nach0z	egsome	aight thanks then.
2010-09-11T03:30:00.000Z	egsome	Nach0z	You're welcome
