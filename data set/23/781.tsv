2011-02-06T22:47:00.000Z	rmi		Hi, is this the place i can get help on Transmission?
2011-02-06T22:47:00.000Z	rmi		I started a torrent but it doesn't start the download
2011-02-06T22:47:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	you can get help with transmission here (assuming you mean the bit torrent client ;))
2011-02-06T22:48:00.000Z	rmi		yep
2011-02-06T22:48:00.000Z	rmi		so it doesn't start downloading
2011-02-06T22:49:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	when you open a torrent it will ask you which files in the torrent you would like to download (usualy you leave them all selected) did this happen?
2011-02-06T22:49:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	yes
2011-02-06T22:50:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	does it just say 0 connected peers now or what?
2011-02-06T22:50:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	where do I check that
2011-02-06T22:50:00.000Z	bbordwell		well the torrent you opened is listed correct?
2011-02-06T22:51:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	It reads "donwloading from 0 of 0 connected peers"
2011-02-06T22:51:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	it seems to be listed correctly
2011-02-06T22:52:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	yes 0 connected peers mean there is no one connected at the time seeding or leeching. this does not happen with all torrent does it?
2011-02-06T22:52:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	I'm doning my first attempt now
2011-02-06T22:53:00.000Z	rmi		bbrordwell, both files have the same
2011-02-06T22:53:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	it seems to me that transmition is working fine just the torrent you downloaded is not very active
2011-02-06T22:54:00.000Z	rmi		bbordwel, any active torrents i could use to test
2011-02-06T22:54:00.000Z	bbordwell		http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download#bt
2011-02-06T22:55:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	try 10.10 amd64
2011-02-06T22:55:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	trying now, tks
2011-02-06T22:55:00.000Z	bbordwell		I have over 40 connected peers after about 1 min
2011-02-06T22:57:00.000Z	rmi	bbordwell	tks! that is probably the problem the torrents are not very active. The ubuntu one started in 2 secs. I'll wait the others to become active as well
2011-02-06T22:59:00.000Z	bbordwell	rmi	If you are using a torrent search engine it should show torrent 'health' you always want to look for torrent with lots of 'seeders'
