2009-04-11T14:44:00.000Z	jelly12gen		much better integration etc.
2009-04-11T14:44:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	haskell? are you serious? does anyone actually use that for production? :)
2009-04-11T14:46:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	haskell?
2009-04-11T14:46:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	yes
2009-04-11T14:48:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	wich project?
2009-04-11T14:49:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	im looking for a big open source project based on haskell
2009-04-11T14:49:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	xomad !
2009-04-11T14:49:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	Xmonad ! ,
2009-04-11T14:50:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	xmonad is the most cool window manager
2009-04-11T14:54:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	im not very experienced with haskell but its hard to imagine how you could create a window manager with it. when i used it it was all build on recursion. you called one function and it continued running until it was finished. hard to imagine how you could implement a windows manager like that :P
2009-04-11T14:55:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	well they did , have you googled xmonad , you can even do I/O with it
2009-04-11T14:55:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	i am learning it atm btw fot my study and it's pretty awesome
2009-04-11T14:56:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	yup. im looking into it now. aint i/o kind of a "hack" that isnt really function/recursion based?
2009-04-11T14:56:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	i dont know yet :D
2009-04-11T14:56:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	but got to go
2009-04-11T14:56:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	wel it can
2009-04-11T14:56:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	sure. interesting things.
2009-04-11T14:57:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	i did i midi sound composer that interpreted musical notes into files. written in haskell :)
2009-04-11T14:57:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	http://learnyouahaskell.com/input-and-output
2009-04-11T14:57:00.000Z	jelly12gen	nasso	: nice :)
2009-04-11T14:58:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	it was one of the exercises in the course. probably the hardest thing i have every written. you could sit for hours and work on one line. but when you are finished with a haskell program and it works, its friccin beautiful.
2009-04-11T14:58:00.000Z	nasso	jelly12gen	wont keep you here. bye
