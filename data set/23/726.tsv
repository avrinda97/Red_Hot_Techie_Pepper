2011-03-11T09:01:00.000Z	smw	ankers	you plug in the cord and there is no video?
2011-03-11T09:01:00.000Z	smw	ankers	is there a video button?
2011-03-11T09:02:00.000Z	smw	ankers	maybe one of the function keys has a rectangle with two bars on either side of it?
2011-03-11T09:02:00.000Z	smw	ankers	on my HP laptop, it is f4
2011-03-11T09:03:00.000Z	smw	ankers	do you have an HP?
2011-03-11T09:03:00.000Z	smw	ankers	you found the symbol though?
2011-03-11T09:05:00.000Z	ankers	smw	i pressed all my F keys lol, in the taskbar were displays are i detect monitors but only laptop screen is on there.. is there somewhere i need to set the hdmi up?

2011-03-11T09:09:00.000Z	smw	ankers	step 2
2011-03-11T09:10:00.000Z	smw	ankers	what really ticked me off is that I had to change sound settings to get audio through hdmi :-\
2011-03-11T09:12:00.000Z	ankers	smw	i have no audio... i have played with alsa and nothing :( but it only really matters if i get picture/sound onto my tv threw hdmi because thats all i use... where is the FN key though? lol
2011-03-11T09:12:00.000Z	smw	ankers	next to the ctrl key
2011-03-11T09:15:00.000Z	ankers	smw	no luck.. :( ill try google some more
2011-03-11T09:16:00.000Z	smw	ankers	ok, sorry :-(.
2011-03-11T09:21:00.000Z	ankers	smw	maybe it would help if i install my nvidia drivers first lol, i know its nvidia geforce but not sure what else, is there a way to detect it? seeing as nvidia only supports auto detection on there website for windows
2011-03-11T09:21:00.000Z	smw	ankers	alt+f2 then type gksu jockey-gtk
2011-03-11T09:22:00.000Z	smw	ankers	or system -> administration -> additional drivers
2011-03-11T09:25:00.000Z	ankers	smw	i need to restart now.. i'll be back shortly as i think im slowly getting there ;D thank you very much
