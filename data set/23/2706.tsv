2009-09-13T14:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys		welcome.
2009-09-13T14:05:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	not sure what to put in the second line of /etc/hosts . it currently is     192.168.2.23 workgroup.workgroup workgroup
2009-09-15T17:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	perhaps your prog outputs directly to the terminal.
2009-09-15T18:00:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	what is the technical difference?
2009-09-15T18:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	ie. (in a shell script): echo foo > /dev/tty
2009-09-15T18:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	well, first make certain that that is really the case.
2009-09-15T18:02:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	it most likely is the case - as you said
2009-09-15T18:02:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	thats a good idea
2009-09-15T18:03:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	huh?
2009-09-15T18:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	man script also to see if it's of use.
2009-09-15T18:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	that seems to work nicely, and you can redirect script's output to /dev/null and still have the stuff captured in the log file.
2009-09-15T18:04:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	if you could tell me how to make a terminal scrollable i could also go with that. my problem is that the program crashes and gives an error message which is too long to fit into the terminal - so i cant see its beginning
2009-09-15T18:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	run it in screen is one way
2009-09-15T18:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	script -c YourCommand  YourFile.log  seems promising.
2009-09-15T18:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	assuming you have script, which i believe comes with default ubuntu.
2010-06-12T12:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	consider /usr/local/bin
2010-06-12T12:34:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	whats the diff between /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin ?
2010-06-12T12:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	see rww's comment. For one, prevents mayhem should you ever install files by the same name through apt
2010-06-12T12:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	second, reminds you of the progs you manually installed, as /usr/local/bin is otherwise empty.
2010-06-20T14:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	you might have better luck at ##linux for something like this.
2010-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ManDay	you could do a ubuntu minimal install, and use only the packages you really need.
2010-06-20T14:29:00.000Z	ManDay	prince_jammys	I've done that before and while in theory that sounds promising its hardly applicable - mostly because deps are a complete mess and a missing indicator applet may well make compiz stop functioning
