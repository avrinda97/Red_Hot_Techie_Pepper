2012-08-18T04:55:00.000Z	hualet		Yesterday , I installed kde with 'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop' , then i just find i don't like kde at all, so i uninstalled it with synaptic, but when i use command 'locate kubuntu', i still found some files, so i deleted them, but when i install some new software today , it always warn me that some 'kubuntu-...'files can't found, so what can i do now?
2012-08-18T04:56:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	you could try installing kubuntu-desktop again
2012-08-18T04:56:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	and then uninstall it again
2012-08-18T04:57:00.000Z	hualet		oh, god...
2012-08-18T04:57:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	some applications depend on KDE libraries, so you might have inadvertently deleted some of them
2012-08-18T04:57:00.000Z	hualet		what's the problem?
2012-08-18T04:58:00.000Z	hualet		then, do it again...?
2012-08-18T04:59:00.000Z	hualet	keith__	Couldn't I just install some package instead?
2012-08-18T05:00:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	sure, but you could have deleted files that other programs are depending on that you already have installed
2012-08-18T05:01:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	but yeah, you could just try reinstalling packages when things error
2012-08-18T05:02:00.000Z	hualet		ok, but it's really a big project to install kubuntu-desktop again...
2012-08-18T05:03:00.000Z	hualet		I just select the package install under the kubuntu-environment group
2012-08-18T05:03:00.000Z	hualet		then, apply
2012-08-18T05:04:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	you probably still have all of the packages downloaded in /var/cache/apt/archives
2012-08-18T05:05:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	but I'm actually not sure if that will fix your problem, because I think the system thinks that a package is installed, but really some of its underlying files have been deleted by you
2012-08-18T05:06:00.000Z	hualet		keith, no, do you know a tweak app named 'ubuntu-tweak'? i always use it after my updating or installing.
2012-08-18T05:06:00.000Z	hualet		I think so, too
2012-08-18T05:08:00.000Z	hualet		Are you sure it will works if I just do the install and uninstall again?
2012-08-18T05:12:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	no, like I said... I'm actually not sure if that will fix your problem, because I think the system thinks that a package is installed, but really some of its underlying files have been deleted by you
2012-08-18T05:12:00.000Z	keith__		you will probably have to "reinstall" certain packages that are broken
2012-08-18T05:13:00.000Z	hualet		Ok, i'll try
2012-08-18T05:14:00.000Z	hualet	keith__	and wilee-nilee, thank you .
2012-08-18T05:17:00.000Z	keith__	hualet	no problem, good luck!
