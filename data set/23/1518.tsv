2010-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	booh-		IF you use 1080p TV
2010-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	booh-		720p give me less resolution
2010-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	booh-		Problem with 1080p is... you can't use USB to VGA :(
2010-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	booh-		USB bandwidth can't do 1080p
2010-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	booh-		1280 x 1024 is the maximum for usb-2-vga
2010-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	booh-		So I had to use pci card instead... (I wanted use mini-itx computer at first time!)
2010-02-24T11:55:00.000Z	dsnyders	booh-	So you're using a usb based graphics card rather than agp/pci/whatever?
2010-02-24T11:55:00.000Z	booh-	dsnyders	no... I change my mind and use pci with dual head
2010-02-24T11:56:00.000Z	booh-		I drive 4 screens on an micro-atx computer.  And 1 screen on a mini-itx computer.
2010-02-24T11:56:00.000Z	booh-		all on wifi network
2010-02-24T11:56:00.000Z	booh-		to refresh...

2010-02-24T11:56:00.000Z	booh-		8 monitors at all
2010-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	booh-		not at the same place...
2010-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	booh-	Sweet!  Any advice on getting x running on a single LCD monitor using an nVidia GeForce2 MX?  It was working a week ago.
2010-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	booh-		by the way, ubuntu run very well on mini-itx (ASUS ITX-220)
2010-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	dsnyders	booh-	I'll make a note of that.  I plan on replacing my motherboard later this year.  800 MHz ain't cutting it like it used to.
