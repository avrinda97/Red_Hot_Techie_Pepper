2006-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	jmspeex		Anyone can tell me how to tell ubuntu not to lock my display every time I close the lid?
2006-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	jmspeex		Is it a known issue with Dapper that Firefox crashes every 10 minutes?
2006-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	i dont think ive heard of that but it could be say flashh thats causeing it if the page has a flash video on it
2006-06-03T08:25:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	no flash actually
2006-06-03T08:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	whats the link you trying to open?
2006-06-03T08:28:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	wotif.com.au. Works for a bit, then boom!
2006-06-03T08:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	do you have java installed for ff?
2006-06-03T08:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	the site is javascript (all of the site)
2006-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	i have java and flash installed, yes. I guess it's irrelevant if the site is JS
2006-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	its html with javascript in it are you using the version of java you installed?
2006-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	what do you mean?
2006-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	what does java -version say when typed in terminal?
2006-06-03T08:47:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.1.0 (Ubuntu 4.1.0-1ubuntu8)
2006-06-03T08:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	type sudo update-alternatives --config java and pick the java that you installed
2006-06-03T08:48:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	done. Now what? How's Java relevent if the site is JS-only?
2006-06-03T08:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	now type java -version adn tell me output
2006-06-03T08:49:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
2006-06-03T08:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	now restart ff and open that site
2006-06-03T08:50:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	done
2006-06-03T08:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jmspeex	crashing?
2006-06-03T08:51:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	Takes a few minutes to crash. Need to go to bed now. I'll check tomorrow.
2006-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	we'll see... thanks anyway.
2006-06-03T09:40:00.000Z	jmspeex	gnomefreak	ff crashed on me again. The site was open, but that's not what I was browsing (I was doing a reload on /.). Going to bed for real now.
