2007-03-27T12:28:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	what are you going to do with menu.lst?
2007-03-27T12:29:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	lol, then why do you want to go there, if you edit it improperly your computer might not boot the OS
2007-03-27T12:29:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	well congrats, you've made it
2007-03-27T12:30:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	yeah, you can edit in terminal using nano, vim, etc. or using gedit (kind of like notepad) what are you wanting to edit in it?
2007-03-27T12:32:00.000Z	lordvaygor16	sidny4	and im totally thick with computers which doesnt help
2007-03-27T12:35:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	ok, in a terminal type in: sudo nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst, a few lines down (about 10) you will see default     0, change that 0 to what number down the list you want to boot by default
2007-03-27T12:35:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	0 being the first, 1 the second, etc.
2007-03-27T12:45:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	ok, and do you want it to boot one of the other operating systems?
2007-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	ok, what number is it in the list?
2007-03-27T12:47:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	ok, count the divider as well and put that number as default
2007-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	sudo nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-03-27T12:51:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	how's it the menu editing coming? I believe it should be default     6
2007-03-27T12:57:00.000Z	lordvaygor16	sidny4	how do i exit the configuration for grub? im worried that just clicking close in the top corner wont save my changes
2007-03-27T12:57:00.000Z	sidny4	lordvaygor16	hit ctrl-x and save it
2007-03-27T12:58:00.000Z	lordvaygor16	sidny4	ok thanks for your help!
2007-03-28T10:45:00.000Z	lordvaygor16	sidny4	i cant remember how to access grub's config...i know it was something to do with "nano" and "/root/grub/menu.lst" or something like that
