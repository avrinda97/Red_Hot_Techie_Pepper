2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	parshimers		i know i know
2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	parshimers		it just doesnt do anything
2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	parshimers		say i run chown or something, nothing happens
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	parshimers		then why do my files still belong to someone named "500" who doesnt exist D:
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	parshimers		well chown is what you use to change ownership on something, right?
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	parshimers		its a ext3
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	parshimers		this is my /home
2005-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	parshimers		i have 2 drives, one is / the other is /home
2005-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	aye.. no output is generally good
2005-09-19T13:59:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	if you've chmodded it 644 or something
2005-09-19T14:03:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	executables have to be set to be executable
2005-09-19T14:03:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	tried rm -rf / ?
2005-09-19T14:04:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	one less person for us to support :)
2005-09-19T14:05:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	well just saying "it's doing nothing" is equally helpful :|
2005-09-19T14:07:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	sudo visudo ?
2005-09-19T14:07:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	hmmm
2005-09-19T14:08:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	what did you do then  :)
2005-09-19T14:09:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	hoary ?
2005-09-19T14:10:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	you could try asking in #ubuntu-devel but be aware that is a development channel (so people use breezy) but not a support channel
2005-09-19T14:10:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	something along the lines of "is there an issue with sudo in breezy at the moment.?"
2005-09-19T14:11:00.000Z	Nermal	parshimers	otherwise I would recommend installing hoary
