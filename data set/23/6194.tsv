2007-09-18T08:20:00.000Z	Pelo	cganya	the live cd you have is probably 5.04 ,  you realy need to get your hands on a blank one and dl the current release , I don'T think you'll be able to get  java on the one you have now , it's too old and it's not suported anymore so you won'T be able to get any dependencies
