2008-05-10T01:23:00.000Z	KingOfDos		I've got a strange problem with ssh and the tun driver. When i execute "ssh -w 0:0 somehost.company.nl" the tun is available at the client. But on the server there is no tun device.
2008-05-10T01:23:00.000Z	KingOfDos		Then i started searching. Tried for 2 days a couple of things. But it's not working. With the following script: http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_VPN_over_SSH_and_tun I get this erros: http://pastebin.com/d627dfb0a
2008-05-10T01:24:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	don't use gentoo guides on ubuntu
2008-05-10T01:25:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	on a gentoo device we got the same problems.
2008-05-10T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	still, don't use gentoo docs on ubuntu
2008-05-10T01:36:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	i'd started with this. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH_VPN
2008-05-10T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	apologies, I just lost connection
2008-05-10T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	there was an interesting bug I was working on with someone earlier in the week where /dev/net/tun can't have it's udev rules overwritten, ~I wonder if this is related
2008-05-10T01:42:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	it's possable that it's some kind of bug somewhere.
2008-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	yes, I was having quite a hard time with the users problem, I was able to re-create it, it still in my development environment and on the list to fix
2008-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	it may not be related though
2008-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	but the main part is that someone else has the same problem, but then from a gentoo device.
2008-05-10T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	is the problem always with the server end
2008-05-10T01:46:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	so far i can see is the problem indeed always on the server
2008-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	then I'd assume thats a bug with the actual software (big assumption)
2008-05-10T02:04:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	with edgy as ssh server. and hardy as ssh client it will create a tun0 device on the server
2008-05-10T02:05:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	i'm searching for a gutsy server at the moment
2008-05-10T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	thats interesting.....
2008-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	nope. i don't have any feitsy/gutsy servers. only a few edgy servers left. the rest is on hardy.
2008-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	I may setup one up myself to test the other issue I was looking at, as they may be releated.
2008-05-10T02:23:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	ok. i had enouch of it. then i'll only forward one port for zabbix instead of building a simple VPN. no tun driver at this point. thanks for the help so far :)
2008-11-14T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	KingOfDos	thats not funny or appropriate
2008-11-14T17:51:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ikonia	i don't care. i diddn't develop/choose that name.
