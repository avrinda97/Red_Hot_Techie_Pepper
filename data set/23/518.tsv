2011-07-10T05:21:00.000Z	prf_q		hey guys I have a question. I have Ubuntu installlation and another Ubuntu installation in VirtualBox. virtual installation has OpenSSH and I'm able to connect it from inside it using "ssh localhost" but I want to connect it from host machine. I couldnt find its IP or anything. any ideas?
2011-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	"ifconfig" from inside the VM (note you'll only be able to connect from the host machine, unless you configure bridged networking)
2011-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	it is okay. I'm currently using NAT.
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	so with NAT you can ONLY connect from the host machine
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	on ifconfig, I see something like 10.0.2.15
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	prf_q		is it its local ip?
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	use that IP from the host
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	prf_q		yes but it doesn't respond
2011-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	i have ubuntu server on virtual
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	can you ping it?  have you install ssh server?
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	and when I say ssh 10.0.2.15 from host machine, it doesnt work
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	I have openssh insatlled on guest,
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	ssh localhost works on guest machine
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	can you ping it?
2011-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	it couldnt ping also
2011-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	hum, i'm surprised.  but you might want to ask in the #vbox channel (but i though from Host machine it would be able to access the Guest NAT, perhaps not)
2011-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	I'm also asking there simultaneously
2011-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	can it be about firewall? should I forward some ports?
2011-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	if you have a firewall on guest - yes it could be that!
2011-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	it is default ubuntu server 11.04 installation. I am not sure there exists any by default
2011-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	by default, there is not active firewall
2011-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	prf_q	zykotick9	got the answer. if we're using NAT, we should not try to connect it using its IP. we should use localhost and make a port forwarding 2222->22 then ssh -p 2222 localhost
2011-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	prf_q	glad you got an answer!  Thanks for the heads up.
