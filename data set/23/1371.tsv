2010-12-21T00:02:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	you didn't lose it, it's just covered by the mount
2010-12-21T00:02:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	you regain it by umount /home/gnuworld
2010-12-21T00:02:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	aah okay, how can i share /home/bla directory? i did it wrong?
2010-12-21T00:03:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	what kind of "share"?
2010-12-21T00:03:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	i want to see and edit files on windows7, sharing it by the vbox (ubuntu is on vbox)
2010-12-21T00:04:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	you are aware of the possible problems when editing files unter linux and windows?
2010-12-21T00:05:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	yes
2010-12-21T00:06:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	set "shared folder" in virtualbox ... or put soft/hardlinks to it
2010-12-21T00:06:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	i already have 2 folder shared on virtualbox
2010-12-21T00:07:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	i maked one folder for copy and past somethings... i did it corretly but when i dont know how to it in /home/bla
2010-12-21T00:08:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	why not " mount -t vboxsf gnuworld /home/gnuworld/sharedfolder" ?
2010-12-21T00:09:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	cuz i'll have to copy past everything into that folder, all my files are on /home/gnuworld ...
2010-12-21T00:09:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	and there are so many files
2010-12-21T00:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	ln -s /home/gnuworld /sharedfolder/thishomedir    (link to home-dir)
2010-12-21T00:11:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	okay, let me try
2010-12-21T00:15:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	doesnt work
2010-12-21T00:15:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	i cant create ln -s in shared folder while its mounted, and if i do it before mount, when i mount the mount cover the ln -s
2010-12-21T00:19:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	 "if i do it before mount, when i mount the mount cover the ln -s"  <- don't understund
2010-12-21T00:21:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	when i do the "ln s" command while the foulder is mounted(shared) it give me an error, says i cant do it, and when i mount the sharing then i execute the command "ln -s", the ln -s override the sharing.
2010-12-21T00:27:00.000Z	bezao	rumpe1	any ideas?
2010-12-21T00:27:00.000Z	rumpe1	bezao	sorry... no ideas
