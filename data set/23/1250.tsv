2011-10-20T11:12:00.000Z	popey	jayant	not sure that keyboard combo is set by default anymore
2011-10-20T11:12:00.000Z	jayant	popey	thanks....but what is the difference between these 2 terminals
2011-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	popey	jayant	functionally wise, not much
2011-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	jayant	popey	i guess it is, because it works on mine and i installed ubuntu yesterday :)
2011-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	jayant	popey	why is it virtual?
2011-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	popey	jayant	yay!
2011-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	popey	jayant	its not a physical terminal on your physical desk I guess â˜º
2011-10-20T11:14:00.000Z	jayant	popey	what does that mean ?
2011-10-20T11:14:00.000Z	jayant	popey	you mean desk or disk ?
2011-10-20T11:14:00.000Z	popey	jayant	terminals used to be physical boxes on your desk
2011-10-20T11:15:00.000Z	jayant	popey	haha...ok...i thought that the terminal with ctrl+alt+F2 is a virtual one while the one with ctrl+alt+T is not
2011-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	popey	jayant	do you have a list of big buttons down the left hand side?
2011-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	popey	jayant	unity

2011-10-20T11:19:00.000Z	popey	jayant	i dont know, i just use unity as it is, running stuff has a little mark next to it
2011-10-20T11:20:00.000Z	jayant	popey	yeah, but it's annoying when it goes back, and what if it fills up
2011-10-20T11:21:00.000Z	jayant	popey	how do i change stuff in that sidebar on the left?
