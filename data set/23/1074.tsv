2011-09-05T00:51:00.000Z	zoopp		Might anyone know why 70% of the times I start my system my wireless adapter can't pickup any networks ?
2011-09-05T00:52:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	you are too far away from the access point ?
2011-09-05T00:52:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	no, I have a few dozens networks around me the only issue is that I can't pickup any of them.
2011-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	iwlist scan returns 'no scan results'
2011-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	what helps you connect after all ?
2011-09-05T00:54:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	rebooting the system until it is able to pickup network's around me
2011-09-05T00:54:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	sometimes I don't mind doing it..but heck...yesterday I had to reboot 10 times :D
2011-09-05T00:55:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	what's your hardware ?
2011-09-05T00:55:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	"04:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)"
2011-09-05T00:56:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	I did activate the driver trough the 'Additional Drivers'
2011-09-05T00:56:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	don't you think that there are some hindering waves, obstacles etc ?
2011-09-05T00:57:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	No it's impossible. As I told you I've get a few dozens of access points around me. I even got one in the next room and It also happens when I'm like 1m away from it.
2011-09-05T00:58:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	It's got to be a driver issue.
2011-09-05T00:58:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	haven't you ever tried another OS ?
2011-09-05T00:59:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	no, but few months ago I was using OpenSuse and I had on such problems.
2011-09-05T00:59:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	yeah, I'm going to exclude hardware issues by recommending you trying some other operating system
2011-09-05T01:00:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	I'd recommend some live-cd(live-usb) distros as they have all the stuff you need and fresh(another) drivers
2011-09-05T01:01:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	well I had no problem while using OpenSUSE.. so I'm a bit confused
2011-09-05T01:02:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	have not you tried googling about your Wi-Fi adapter and operating system you use ?May be it is quite widespread ?
2011-09-05T01:04:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	well it is actually..I had found a fix for it back in the 10.10  time but I don't seem to find it again.
2011-09-05T01:10:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	I think I'll do something stupid, I'll install the package from oneric for my wireless card. Maybe it'll fix it..
2011-09-05T01:11:00.000Z	barberan	zoopp	in your case you should try everything) but do not forget about data backup, etc.
2011-09-05T01:28:00.000Z	zoopp	barberan	so far I rebooted 3 times...it worked every time
