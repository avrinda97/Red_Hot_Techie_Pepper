2009-12-10T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	if you run: sudo lshw -C sound     you will see the sound chip you are using
2009-12-10T00:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	yahoo, msn, ask, bling
2010-10-04T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	rename your $HOME/.mozilla. folder to see if it works then
2010-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	do you use thunderbird for email?
2010-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	before the upgrade I used whatever the mail icon is in the top right for email
2010-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	evolution then. Ok if you rename the folder and rerun the browser you should get vanilla settings. Does it work?
2010-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	it sure did! thanks so much for the help. this is why I love Ubuntu and linux both and why I hand out cds every chance I get!  how hard is it going to be to recover my old settings?
2010-10-04T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	you can recover favourites using the html file in the old folder. You. Will need to reinstall plugins and all the other bloat you throw at it
2010-10-04T18:53:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	thank you so much for the help!  now back to work and time to give out another cd :)
2010-10-04T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	looks like your old profile was incompatible with the new version
2010-10-04T18:53:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	is there a way to get all the saved passwords and the like in the new one or do I need to try to remember them all?
2010-10-04T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	not sure there dude. I don't use crappy firefox
2010-10-04T18:55:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	okie dokie.  thanks for the help I will figgure the rest out. got my bookmarks so that is a start. and I may start using chromium more normaly I use lynx but some clients use their own thing
2010-10-04T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	to try Dr_Willis advice you will need to rename the old profile back into the driving seat and restart the browser
2010-10-04T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	simple stuff dude. There are addons to upload settings / passwords to some web storage so it doesn't matter where you are your settings will follow
2012-02-12T07:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_schism_	install network manager then remove wicd
2012-02-12T07:52:00.000Z	_schism_	ActionParsnip	is it network-manager-gnome ?
