2007-10-11T12:54:00.000Z	joseph		Anybody know if wireless support in Ubuntu 7.10 is better than it was in 7.04?
2007-10-11T12:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	For what chipset?
2007-10-11T12:54:00.000Z	joseph		How do I send a message to someone in here?
2007-10-11T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	/msg nick message
2007-10-11T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	Many people don't like to get private messages though

2007-10-11T12:56:00.000Z	joseph		I am really frustrated I spent 2 days trying to get my wireless working in Ubuntu following all the stuff on the web and never could get it then I tried PCLinux OS and it worked fine but I prefer Ubuntu
2007-10-11T12:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	What chipset?
2007-10-11T12:57:00.000Z	joseph	Jordan_U	It's Broadcom
2007-10-11T12:57:00.000Z	joseph		I tried Ndiswrapper and I could see access points but they weren't scanning and no signal
2007-10-11T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	How could it possibly work by default? It's illegal to distribute the needed firmware.
2007-10-11T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	Did you try just installing the bcm43xx-fwcutter package?
2007-10-11T12:58:00.000Z	joseph		Jordan it asked for the windows driver on the install and I specified that so it definately used ndiswrapper
2007-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	Not necessarily, it could have just used the firmware from the driver
2007-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	That is what Gutsy does
2007-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	joseph		I wish I knew how they got it to work in PCLinux OS so I could do that in Ubuntu
2007-10-11T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	"sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter"
2007-10-11T13:00:00.000Z	joseph		I tried that link Varka and coudln't get it
2007-10-11T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	That is all you need to do
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	Or in Gutsy you would be prompted that restricted firmware is required and it would offer to download it for you or ask for the path to the driver ( only so it can extract the firmware from it )
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	joseph		So Jordan with thatr do I need windows drivers? And does it do WPA
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	joseph		No Varka it just sat there
2007-10-11T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joseph	You don't need Windows drivers, I don't know about WPA, but if it worked in PCLinux it should work the same in Ubuntu ( they use the same driver )
