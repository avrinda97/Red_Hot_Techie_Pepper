2012-11-25T12:04:00.000Z	cosmicfires		what do you need Noah?
2012-11-25T12:06:00.000Z	cosmicfires		Noah the partitions aren't assembled into a raid device yet
2012-11-25T12:07:00.000Z	Noah	cosmicfires	what command(s) should I run?
2012-11-25T12:07:00.000Z	cosmicfires		I think you need to make /etc/raidtab
2012-11-25T12:08:00.000Z	cosmicfires		I'm looking at my notes it's been awhile since I've set raid up, I used the ubuntu alternate install dvd most recently
2012-11-25T12:08:00.000Z	Noah	cosmicfires	okay awesome..I've created the directory /etc/raidtab
2012-11-25T12:08:00.000Z	Noah		Trixie yeah use the windows installer
2012-11-25T12:09:00.000Z	cosmicfires		raidtab is a file not a directory
2012-11-25T12:09:00.000Z	cosmicfires	Noah	http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/linux-raid.html
2012-11-25T12:09:00.000Z	cosmicfires		raidtab is archaic it's not used anymore
2012-11-25T12:10:00.000Z	Noah		cosmicfires..okay suggestions on something to use instead? I've already got a working ubuntu install so I can't use the initial setup wizard. It's server 12.04
2012-11-25T12:11:00.000Z	cosmicfires		I'm looking at that url I pasted
2012-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	cosmicfires		I set raid up with the installer
2012-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	Noah	cosmicfires	my disc drive is broken in the machine..makes things really difficult
2012-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	cosmicfires		you want raidreconf I think
2012-11-25T12:15:00.000Z	cosmicfires	Noah	http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl8_raidreconf.htm
2012-11-25T12:15:00.000Z	Noah	cosmicfires	the only thing is, cat /proc/mdstat shows (2/2), an active raid is already setup..it actually just finished resyncing
2012-11-25T12:16:00.000Z	cosmicfires		then you don't have to build it, I'm not sure what the problem is
2012-11-25T12:16:00.000Z	cosmicfires		looks like raidreconf isn't current anyway
2012-11-25T12:17:00.000Z	Noah		strange..thanks for the help anyway ..anybody else have any ideas?
2012-11-25T12:17:00.000Z	cosmicfires		Noah do you have file systems on your raid devices?
2012-11-25T12:19:00.000Z	Noah		yup I have a 1TB drive with two 500GB partitions (one of them used in the raid), and a 500GB drive partitioned as a whole (the whole used in the raid). Both of which are LINUX Raid partitioned. It's raid 1..then the raid 1 is partitioned as ext4
