2006-10-14T12:32:00.000Z	SuperMiguel		ubuntu*
2006-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	"server" and "GUI" are usually mutually exclusive terms ;)
2006-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	use the server version
2006-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	servers should not have GUIs except when absolutely necessary
2006-10-14T12:35:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	and GUI apps like OpenOffice and Firefox and what-not
2006-10-14T12:35:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	just use the server version of Ubuntu
2006-10-14T12:36:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	why do you need a GUI on a server?
2006-10-16T11:05:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	i will put on my official hat and strongly encourage you not to use Automatix, EasyUbuntu, or any other such automated means of using apt.
2006-10-16T11:06:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	mnepton	why is that
2006-10-16T11:06:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	because they make assumptions about architecture, repos, versions, etc.
2006-10-16T11:07:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	the "what you should" is the sticky point
2006-10-16T11:09:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	to get Frostwire to work you need Sun's Java (which means agreeing to the Sun license), you need your default Java changed to Sun's JRE, and you need Frostwire downloaded and installed. a script can seriously, seriously mess this up and leave a user with *no* functional JVM.
2006-10-16T11:09:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	mnepton	you got your point :)
2006-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	i'll even go so far as to say "just do as i say" on this issue. and that's something i really, *really* don't like doing. at all.
2006-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	mnepton	are you mad?
2006-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	not at all. should i be?
2006-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	mnepton	i dont mind xD
2006-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	i think you just did. :)
2006-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	if you mean "can i ask you something else besides 'can i ask you something'?" then the answer is "yes" ;)
2006-10-16T11:14:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	i don't use FTP. but ssh, an httpd, mysql, and php/python/ruby are de rigeur for me
2006-10-16T11:15:00.000Z	mnepton	SuperMiguel	http://ruby-lang.org
