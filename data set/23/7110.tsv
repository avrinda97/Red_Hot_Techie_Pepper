2006-05-27T07:29:00.000Z	mdeboer		hi
2006-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	mdeboer		tomorrow i will be installing dapper on a friends computer, an AMD64. if i would install it for myself, i'd definitely go for the amd64 version, but since he is rather new to linux, i am thinking that it might be better to go for i386.... what do you think?
2006-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	mdeboer		right, flash is definitely something he wants to use
2006-05-27T07:35:00.000Z	mdeboer		okay, this confirms my thoughts.
2006-05-27T07:36:00.000Z	mdeboer		ok, thanks a lot for your advice!
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	mdeboer		and, a related question, would you recommend flight7 or the daily build?
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mdeboer	rc should be released today
2006-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	mdeboer	gnomefreak	that is interesting news
2006-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mdeboer	dailybuild should be at rc or just before give me a few and ill let you know if rc has been uploaded yet
2006-05-27T07:40:00.000Z	mdeboer	gnomefreak	thanks. i will have to live in an hour, after which i will not have cd-burner access anymore, so i might be forced to go for dailybuild, but i'll wait as long as possible
2006-05-27T07:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mdeboer	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseCandidateAnnouncement?highlight=%28dapper%29  you will have to copy and paste the mirror into your browser but should work
