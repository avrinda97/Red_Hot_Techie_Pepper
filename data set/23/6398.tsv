2006-06-03T12:33:00.000Z	disinterested_pe		is dapper x86?
2006-06-03T12:33:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	and ppc and amd64
2006-06-04T10:25:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Is there a mozilla-plugin-mplayer package? That would seem the obvious way
2006-06-04T10:28:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	I got loads of stuff working with the Nemo Codec pack (search for it in Google) installed in WINE, then I copied all of the .dlls it made in /home/chris/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32 into /usr/lib/codecs
2006-06-04T11:05:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Have you tried using VLC? It is built to habdle all kinds of streams
2006-06-08T06:13:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	You can play them with an "xmms-wma" plugin and use XMMS's disk-writing output
2006-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	If you can mount a DVD then XMMS can access the files
2006-06-08T06:17:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	XMMS WMA plugin is not in Ubuntu. You will have to find it on google ("xmms wma ubuntu" should work)
2006-06-08T06:41:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	What kind of file is it? tar.gz, rpm, deb?
2006-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	It isn't a very important package so you should be fine. Install alien "sudo apt-get install alien" then use it "sudo alien packagename.rpm" and finally install the package you made "sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb"
2006-06-08T06:45:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Yes
2006-06-08T06:46:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Extract it then go in it with a terminal
2006-06-08T06:46:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	What is in there? Does it look like source code (README, INSTALL, configure, stuff like that?)
2006-06-08T06:49:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	? Extarct the file (double click it to open file-roller) then have a look inside
2006-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Is it source code? You know you would probably be fine with the RPM file (it is not recommended for system packages, but this is hardly system critical)
2006-06-08T06:57:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	If you can run "./configure" then it is source code
2006-06-08T06:58:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Do you still have the RPM? That would be much easier :)
2006-06-08T07:00:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Install Alien with "sudo apt-get install alien" then run use it to convert the RPM to a Deb with "alien packagename.rpm" then install the Deb file you have made with "sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb"
2006-06-08T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	You will need XMMS as well (in case you don't have it "sudo apt-get install xmms")
2006-06-08T07:10:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Have you managed to install the .deb file yet (or even make it)?
2006-06-08T07:11:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	"sudo dpkg -i *.deb" should do it
2006-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	OK, if you open XMMS now you should be able to play WMA files (as long as they aren't encrypted). If not, then go in Preferences and enable WMA. Then you can change the output from ALSA, OSS or whatever it is on to Disk Writer
2006-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	Warbo	disinterested_pe	Mount the DVD and browse for the files
