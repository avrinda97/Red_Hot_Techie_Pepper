2008-01-14T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	offensive/swearing language is not allowed in this channel
2008-01-14T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	no, it's not. The channel policy is set
2008-02-01T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	join #ubuntu-ops and speak to the guy who banned you if possible
2008-02-01T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	well, ask in #ubuntu-ops for support
2008-02-01T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	you've been told what to do
2008-02-01T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	stop asking in here, this is a support channel, go to ubuntu-ops and gain support
2008-02-01T18:08:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	being off topic in this channel won't help you argue your case in #ubuntu-ops
2008-02-01T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	no - thats not correct
2008-02-18T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	if your doing this for a client, you should know the basics of running your server
2008-02-18T19:25:00.000Z	hk2999	ikonia	i know im sorry
2008-02-18T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	canonical do paid for supports
2008-02-18T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	you may want to consider paying a canonical employee if you have now crippled your clients server
2008-02-18T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	clearly you are not qualified
2008-02-18T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	purchase a support package from canonical
2008-02-18T19:28:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	sure, fo on then.
2008-02-18T19:28:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	good luck,
2008-02-18T19:28:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	canonical does paid for support for business customers, excellent deals
2008-02-18T19:29:00.000Z	hk2999	ikonia	the server is not ubuntu i think its rhel
2008-02-18T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	this is basic stuff - you should know this if you are running a server for paying customers
2008-02-18T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	this is ubuntu support - so don't ask here. Also redhat and ubuntu behave the same - so don't use that excuse
2008-02-18T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	we don't support redhaht here
2008-02-18T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	hk2999	please stop asking for redha support
