2005-10-09T11:12:00.000Z	mcphail		Has anyone had any success using qemu in Hoary?
2005-10-09T11:14:00.000Z	mohkohn	mcphail	I used it to run SUSE 9.1 some time back. A bit slow though.
2005-10-09T11:16:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	i think my problems are ubuntu specific, judging by the responses on #qemu. thanks anyway
2005-10-09T11:17:00.000Z	mohkohn	mcphail	What I meant was I was running Suse 9.1 in qemu on hoary.
2005-10-09T11:18:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	ahh... Were you using the apt package or from the qemu site?
2005-10-09T11:18:00.000Z	mohkohn		At the time the apt-package

2005-10-09T11:19:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	i'm trying to get Windows in a (ahem) window. i don't think the ubuntu package allows this.
2005-10-09T11:20:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	I'll check out that link. Thanks
2005-10-09T11:20:00.000Z	mohkohn	mcphail	how much RAM?
2005-10-09T11:20:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	512MB
2005-10-09T11:21:00.000Z	mohkohn		It won't be a case of disabling windows. Linux isn't discriminatory.
2005-10-09T11:21:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	the version in ubuntu is buggy and crashes when installing windows. i've been using the compiled version from the qemu site
2005-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	mohkohn		IMHO windows xp will struggle with that in qemu. Emulation is intensive. Thanks for the tip. I was going to try it my self with windows xp.
2005-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	Unfortunately, it consistently hangs the whole system after running for about 9 minutes. major drag...
2005-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	mohkohn		I want to watch in fascination as an unprotected windows system gets owned from the comfort of ubuntu. I think it takes less than 20 minutes now!
2005-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	mohkohn	mcphail	Does the qemu compiled from the site work better?
2005-10-09T11:24:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	that _is_ with the compiled version! I didn't use the hoary version because of warning over the site that XP will not work.
2005-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	mcphail		It is, however, supposed to be "fixed" in the latest versions
2005-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	what's more, the current versions have a plugin which should run guest OSs at near normal speeds
2005-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	mohkohn		Sorry. I must be a bit slow.
2005-10-09T11:26:00.000Z	mohkohn		I'll have to go back to the site.
2005-10-09T11:26:00.000Z	mcphail	mohkohn	I'd be keen toknow if anyone else is having the same problems as me
