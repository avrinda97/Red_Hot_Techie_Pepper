2010-01-16T20:59:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	netstat, iptraf
2011-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/README
2011-11-04T13:29:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/README             did you try this?
2011-11-04T13:31:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	you messed up your permissions on /etc
2011-11-04T13:32:00.000Z	melvincv	llutz	I guess so...
2011-11-04T13:32:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	i guess you did a stupid "chmod 777 something" on it. whyever
2011-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	melvincv	llutz	the entire /etc is now 777 :P
2011-11-04T13:34:00.000Z	melvincv	llutz	Can I do something about it?
2011-11-04T13:34:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	you could try to repair from live-cd
2011-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	melvincv	llutz	there is a repair option???
2011-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	setting all to root:root 755/644, /etc/sudoers to 440
2011-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	nope
2011-11-04T13:36:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	the kernel doesn't install because the postrm failes (because you stupidly chmodded all 777)
2011-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	repair permissions and it should install (if you don't know how, reinstallation could be easier)
2011-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	melvincv	llutz	I'd like to try repair. And I don't remember why I did that :P Anyway, where do I find the repair option in the live cd?
2011-11-04T13:40:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	there is no repair-option, its done by hand. mount your /-fs and try to fix
2011-11-04T13:41:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	chmod/chown are the commands you'll need
2012-10-30T14:19:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	tobias_ that error only says that building the modules using dkms fails and it tries to compile them the old way
2012-10-30T14:37:00.000Z	llutz	melvincv	from what i read here, itunes won't work properly in wine
