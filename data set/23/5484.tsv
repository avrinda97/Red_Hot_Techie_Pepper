2008-12-29T06:01:00.000Z	x0r		hey, do I need to register or something, to show my writings as black, and name as blue? -thanks in advance, disthanks for the ones not answering me
2008-12-29T06:02:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	here in the channel?
2008-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	irc itself doesn't do colours.. it's probably your client that makes certain lines colored.. like those containing your nick for example
2008-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	so am I being black-blue?
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	I don't know what kind of colours you're seening.. you're black on white on my screen.. except when you say Slart.. then your line gets orange on black
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	it's all configured in whatever client you're running
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	:o I'm seeing myself as gray only
2008-12-29T06:05:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	thanks, I though I was just as "visitor"
2008-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	it doesn't make a difference if you're registered or not.. of course, registering has other advantages such as "owning" a nickname
2008-12-29T06:35:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	try writing /help in your client..
2008-12-29T06:36:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	well that answer have to be really be a very difficult to write, as nobody else didn't have the time to even start writing that!
2008-12-29T06:37:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	I don't think people are lazy.. it's just that when someone asks questions like that it kind of shows they haven't used google.. haven't read the documentation etc.. so if you answer that question they will just keep on asking about trivial stuff
2008-12-29T06:38:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	and to all: I'm not that kinda noob
2008-12-29T06:38:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	here's a first tip.. write your question in google.. see if you get any good hits.. if the first hit answers it you shouldn't have to ask it
2008-12-29T06:39:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	yes, google is our friend..
2008-12-29T06:39:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	and there's usually a channel called #test for testing stuff
2008-12-29T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	check the application database
2008-12-29T07:19:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	usually people run aMSN or some other native client
2008-12-29T07:20:00.000Z	x0r	Slart	yes, but I need to have as much WIndows looking linux as possible,  and WOW! did patb just got banned!?
2008-12-29T07:20:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	nah.. it's just a floodbot.. the ban keeps him from spamming any more.. he'll be unbanned in a minute or so
2008-12-29T07:23:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	tab will autocomplete names for you
2008-12-29T07:23:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	so [[ <tab> and it will fill in the rest
2008-12-29T07:45:00.000Z	Slart	x0r	check out the usage info
