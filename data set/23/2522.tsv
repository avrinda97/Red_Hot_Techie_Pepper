2009-02-26T21:48:00.000Z	Daremonai		is there a tool i can us to see if my domain is at risk?
2009-02-26T21:50:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	at risk of what? the only actual risk is social engineering -- if a human can convince the human who is "safeguarding" the data that contains domain info (registry), with money, or whatever, to make that data insecure, all bets are off... otherwise, no one can just "steal" your domain
2009-02-26T21:52:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	I'm talking about the possibility for someone to find a vulnerability and perhaps do malicious acts to it, or some bad configuration that allows intruders to take advantage of my system. I was on dnsstuff.com I ran the domain health check, it told me i have 2 'vulnerabilities' or smth, but it wouldn't tell me what they were.
2009-02-26T21:53:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	oh, i see... well, not that there *aren't* risks, but keep in mind a lot of "businesses" depend on your fear of the unknown (e.g. anti-virus makers, *fake*-anti-virus makers, etc)
2009-02-26T21:54:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	but does it actual describe the vulnerabilities, or does it want you to sign up to find out more?
2009-02-26T21:54:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	true... which is why i'm asking here to see if there's a way to check for current known vulnerabilities, etc.
2009-02-26T21:54:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	i think they might be referring more to ways your actual site can get hacked
2009-02-26T21:54:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	sign up and pay.
2009-02-26T21:55:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	yeah, so to me, it sounds kinda sketchy (they just want your money)... it's like those 'you are the 100000th visitor' ads -- how could they possibly be real, right? so therefore it's just a "lure" to get your money
2009-02-26T21:55:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	that's basically it, I would like to see if there are some empty holes that need to be shut, and where they are.
2009-02-26T21:56:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	unfortunately, there's no quick and simple scan to do that, but more general stuff: e.g. check ALL  open ports on your gateway (e.g. router) -- ONLY open those that you actually need (e.g. 80 for HTTP, and so on)
2009-02-26T21:56:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	possibly, which is why i am not going to pay them for such stuff.. but am still looking for a way to like 'scan' it.
2009-02-26T21:56:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	also, set your gateway to block/ignore/drop all unsolicited ICMP stuff (PING, etc) because it makes it harder to "feel" the server from the other side (hacker's end)
2009-02-26T21:56:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	I run netstat all the time with a (watch), the ports that are open are the ones that i want.
2009-02-26T21:57:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	my ISP already has those done... I cannot ping or be pinged atm.
2009-02-26T21:57:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	awesome -- from the sounds of it, you've already got the basics covered (and often that's enough for 99% of the time)... just keep reading this and that about security, and you'll be fine -- it's a constant uphill battle, security, because the hackers are always one step ahead ;-)
2009-02-26T21:58:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	i've heard of a "hardened ubuntu" project which (besides being topical) might be of interest to you  :-)
2009-02-26T21:58:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	true.. am also taking an Internet Security course at uni so I can understand more about this stuff and to see how to prevent or at least try to :)
2009-02-26T21:59:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	cool, will check it out
2009-02-26T22:23:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	some mutation of netstat might work
2009-02-26T22:23:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	yeah, I thought netstat can give that.. mmm.. i should find out what the command is
2009-02-26T22:24:00.000Z	bernz	Daremonai	the '-p' option yields PID and process name ... that's probably useful... 'man nestat' away!  :-)
2009-02-26T22:24:00.000Z	Daremonai	bernz	thanks :)
