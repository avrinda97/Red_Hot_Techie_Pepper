2010-04-30T09:49:00.000Z	digital_1		Flynsarmy- do a uname -a  inside a terminal
2010-04-30T09:50:00.000Z	digital_1	Flynsarmy	 Out of curiousity- what card are you running?

2010-04-30T09:50:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	digital_1	on a laptop
2010-04-30T09:51:00.000Z	digital_1		FlynsArmy:  You should be able to look under Nvidia Settings.  System --> Administration --> NVidia X Server Settings
2010-04-30T09:52:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	digital_1	i don't have that
2010-04-30T09:52:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	digital_1	a package you installed yourself perhaps?
2010-04-30T09:52:00.000Z	digital_1	Flynsarmy	 Nope
2010-04-30T09:53:00.000Z	digital_1	Flynsarmy	 Does it show proprietary driver in use for the graphics card?
2010-04-30T09:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	digital_1	i'd say probably not because system - preferences - monitors is working. it doesn't if you use proprietry
2010-04-30T09:54:00.000Z	digital_1	Flynsarmy	 Well without the proprietary drivers you won't get the effects.
2010-04-30T09:55:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	digital_1	thought you said you weren't on them and were getting the effects?
2010-04-30T09:55:00.000Z	digital_1	Flynsarmy	 No,  I have the proprietary drivers turned on.  Without them, you won't get the effects.
