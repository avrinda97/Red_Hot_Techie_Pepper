2005-09-23T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	does 8139too in fact work?
2005-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	I'm too scared to try 8139too. this is my only PC so I don't to ruin it.
2005-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	you can't ruin your PC by trying to modprobe 8139too. At worst, it'll just fail and you'll get an error message.
2005-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	Unless of course you're debugging over ssh.
2005-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	even it do load  8139too, the first driver will still be loaded so I would not know what driver is it using.
2005-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	8139too should fail to load.
2005-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	the first driver loads before hotplug starts
2005-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	if the first one's still loaded.
2005-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	via what, /etc/modules?
2005-09-23T11:04:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	no, not in /etc/modules ( that's what's puzzling me )
2005-09-23T11:13:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	if ispci doesn't list my network card, how can I be sure what driver it should use? All I know is that it is a realtek
2005-09-23T11:13:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	then it isn't a pci nic, as suspected since you're referring to 8139 and 8139too
2005-09-23T11:14:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	no it is a PCI card. I installed it myslef
2005-09-23T11:14:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	ok, then are you sure the BIOS is assigning resources to it?
2005-09-23T11:15:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	if lspci isn't listing it, then there must be a darned good reason
2005-09-23T11:19:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	I posted about it in ubuntuforums.org and more than one person replied that they are getting the same error http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65823
2005-09-23T11:20:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	possibly an upgrade side effect?
2005-09-23T11:20:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	it's related to 'hotplug', but it's not critical.
2005-09-23T11:21:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	well the error comes out before hotplug initializes
2005-09-23T11:21:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	but it doesn't seem to be critical since networking seems to work
2005-09-23T11:22:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	k
2005-11-22T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	hussam	you use pbuilder.
2005-11-22T13:29:00.000Z	hussam	crimsun	thanks
