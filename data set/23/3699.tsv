2008-08-22T00:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		hey Pici little information here so far will provide the rest in a moment once I get this thing hooked up to the net. Anyway got a mates E-Machines 4115c with ubuntu installed on it.. all working from day 1 till yesterday his wireless will not connect to anything..
2008-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		or not
2008-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!ask | Daenyth|Work
2008-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	I did ask, lemme repaste it
2008-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	then you'll just need a little patience till someone frees up thats all.. perhaps If I get these comps finished in the next hour or so I will try my best to help you if that would be alright
2008-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	I just want to know if it will be damaged if I abort right now
2008-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	the student is leaving the country tomorrow, and I'm leaving here in 45 minutes
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	no it wont
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	ah thanks
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	it may perform a chkdsk though on next boot into your windows partition
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	it did not actually touch the FS
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	that's fine as long as it's not damaged.
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	great, thanks
2008-08-22T00:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	sure mate no probs good luck
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	you may need to just plain kill ubuntu (cold boot) in order for it to perhaps kill that faulty process
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	yeah, I'll play around
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	nothing major to worry about though
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	does the install cd have sysrq enabled?
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	and always keep backups :)
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Daenyth|Work	yes
2008-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	yeah, I backed up the student's data before, but I dislike giving people their stuff back in worse shape than they gave it to me
2008-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	luckily he has the vista disks at home so it shouldn't be a problem
2008-08-22T00:53:00.000Z	Daenyth|Work	Paddy_EIRE	thanks for the help
