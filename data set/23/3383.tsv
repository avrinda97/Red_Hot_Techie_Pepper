2008-05-07T20:52:00.000Z	xintron		I can't write to the file "/proc/acpi/acer/wireless". Does anyone have any clue why?
2008-05-07T20:52:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	the command looks weird with all those quotes...
2008-05-07T20:53:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	echo "enabled: 1">/proc/acpi/acer/wireless
2008-05-07T20:53:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	try ﻿echo "enabled: 1" > /proc/acpi/acer/wireless and you probably have to be root
2008-05-07T20:54:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	notice in that forum post he did 'su' first
2008-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	ah
2008-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	I still get the same error
2008-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	did you do the chmod 777 ?
2008-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	without error
2008-05-07T20:56:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	yes, that worked without error
2008-05-07T20:56:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	I tried to edit the file with vim, but it wouldn't let me save
2008-05-07T20:57:00.000Z	ejer	xintron	are you SURE you are root?
2008-05-07T20:57:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	Yes, I'm root

2008-05-07T20:59:00.000Z	xintron	ejer	I thought so too, and tried to change it to "1" using vim, but still error, but now it worked, thanks ejer
