2010-09-27T08:29:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	some multi-protocol clients  are pidgin, empathy
2010-09-27T08:27:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	sudo  cd /path/
2010-09-27T08:28:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	that depends on your IRC client
2010-09-27T08:29:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	that is just a matter of preference
2010-09-27T08:31:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	could you tell us what you want to actually do? (say again please if you have already)
2010-09-27T08:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	what sort of theme you expect from a command line program...
2010-09-27T08:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	but yes you can.
2010-09-27T08:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	you could change colour
2010-09-27T08:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	and layout
2010-09-27T08:46:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	again.. a matter of personal preference...   like  mplayer, vlc,  totem, xine
2010-09-27T08:46:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	i personally think mplayer is the best though
2010-09-27T08:49:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	i would  "rm -rf ~/.config/vlc "  in that case
2010-09-27T08:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	RK	why would you want to increase volume to 400%... sound quality would degrade
