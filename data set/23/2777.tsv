2008-11-12T14:16:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_		i'm having issues getting my sound to be output to a specific port, does anyone know how to fix that?
2008-11-12T14:18:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	what do you mean by 'specific port'?
2008-11-12T14:20:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	i have 3 'jacks' in the front of my laptop, the 'hedphone' jack is physically busted, but thats where my sound is being output to, i'd like to send it to a dif port
2008-11-12T14:21:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	i see, is that a feature your laptop actually supports? have you got a speaker jack or similar?
2008-11-12T14:21:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	the labels on the 3 jacks are headphones, output, and input
2008-11-12T14:22:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	i see, and have you had this working before? I only ask because some headphone jacks will detect when something is plugged in and automatically redirect output
2008-11-12T14:22:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	also, when i had vista installed it said i had another port somewhere but i never had a reason to find it
2008-11-12T14:22:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	 it would auto detect in vista, but not in ubuntu
2008-11-12T14:23:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	ah i see, i would run 'aplay -l' and 'aplay -L' and pastebin that, that should show you what devices alsa can see, they may not be named appropriately though
2008-11-12T14:23:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	pastebin?
2008-11-12T14:24:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	http://paste.ubuntu.com
2008-11-12T14:26:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	ok i pasted it under paster name kyle+again_and_again
2008-11-12T14:27:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	ah, i think it gives you a link? i dunno if we can search for them :)

2008-11-12T14:28:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	that all looks normal, run 'alsamixer' and browse through the controls there, there may be one that can select headphone output
2008-11-12T14:29:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	also what is the model of your laptop? i'll do some googling
2008-11-12T14:29:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	dell inspiron 1525 (i know dell sucks but they were willing to finance)
2008-11-12T14:30:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	no comment, my laptops are both broken :D
2008-11-12T14:35:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	from reading it seems that there are a few problems with the soundcard you're using, but that you might have headphone jacks on the left and right, i assume that's not an option?
2008-11-12T14:38:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	 alsamixer was no go, only volume controls and balance controls, no output. as for the right port, all 3 are next to each other, the far left is the one it's set to output to, the far right is labelled mic and the middle is labelled speakers.  when i run a test sound with the speakers plugged into the mic port, i hear the sound int he external speakers (static from the loose port) when i plug it into the middle, or rig
2008-11-12T14:43:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	i'm afraid i don't know how to help you further, there's not really much information about it on google and if you have no alsamixer control i don't know where to look next
2008-11-12T14:43:00.000Z	kyle__again_and_	Winkie	thank ou for trying, maybe i shoul start checking page 100 on google lol
2008-11-12T14:44:00.000Z	Winkie	kyle__again_and_	unfortunately this sorta thing happens quite a bit with alsa, you may have to tell it what model of that soundcard you have specifically
