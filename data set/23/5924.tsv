2006-07-31T10:47:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		Hello everyone, I'm new to Ubuntu and have a video question.
2006-07-31T10:49:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		Anyone ever setup a video card with a componet out to a TV?

2006-07-31T10:52:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	yes... depends on the card though in how you do it
2006-07-31T10:53:00.000Z	Ap0s7le	joshuapurcell	it's an old card with VGA, S-Video and Comp out
2006-07-31T10:54:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	i was looking for the package i got from the repos to get my s-video working on my radeon card... haven't found it just yet. is that what you are looking for?
2006-07-31T10:56:00.000Z	Ap0s7le	joshuapurcell	I don't know what I'm looking for. The card is old, shows as this "S3 Inc. 86C410 Savage 2000"
2006-07-31T10:57:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	you need the savage drivers which should be installed by default in the latest Ubuntu version
2006-07-31T10:57:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	what driver does your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file say you are using?
2006-07-31T11:00:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	you can find out fast by typing this at the command line:
2006-07-31T11:00:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	more /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep -A 2 'Section "Device"'
2006-07-31T11:02:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	cool, that means the savage drivers are installed and you should have 3d working because of it. so you plug in an s-video cable and nothing comes out to the TV?
2006-07-31T11:02:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	have you tried plugging the cable in and then rebooting with the laptop lid closed?
2006-07-31T11:09:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	hmm....
2006-07-31T11:10:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	i think there is another package you can install like i mentioned before that specifically deals with s-video output
2006-07-31T11:10:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	have you looked at the xvattr command?
2006-07-31T11:11:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	i'm not sure if i used that to get s-video working, but i did need it for external display to look right (using the vga output). it may come into play on the s-video as well
2006-07-31T11:13:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	look into s3switch definitely
2006-07-31T11:13:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	that's what it is... s3switch

2006-07-31T11:14:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/s3switch.8.html
2006-07-31T11:15:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	i knew there was a package somewhere... couldn't remember the name. you should be able to get that from repos
2006-07-31T11:15:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	Ap0s7le	np
