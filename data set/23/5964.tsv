2006-07-31T05:20:00.000Z	redcard		No.. he's right.
2006-07-31T05:20:00.000Z	redcard		apt-get -s remove rhythmbox removes rhythmbox and ubuntu-desktop
2006-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	redcard		Should that be logged as a bug?
2006-07-31T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	no
2006-07-31T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	ubuntu-desktop is a virtual package
2006-07-31T05:22:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	So if you remove rhythmbox, it should remove the ubuntu-desktop package?
2006-07-31T05:23:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	yes but no actual packages are removed
2006-07-31T05:23:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	What happens if someone tries to install something that requires ubuntu-desktop?
2006-07-31T05:23:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	it removes the virtual package
2006-07-31T05:23:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	Or is Ubuntu-desktop shorthand for "Everything back the way it was"
2006-07-31T05:24:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	ubuntu-desktop is a virtual package providing a bunch of packages
2006-07-31T05:24:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	So.. basically.. if he removes rhythmbox.. then it'll remove ubuntu desktop.  The next time he installs something that requires ubuntu-desktop, it'll install ubuntu-desktop, then rhythmbox..
2006-07-31T05:24:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	I don't think anything depends on ubuntu-desktop
2006-07-31T05:25:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	Well, easy enough way to find out :)
2006-07-31T05:25:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	I don't have that package
2006-08-06T14:59:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	I can think of about nine ways to exploit that
2006-08-07T05:42:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	does it say it must be run natively in windows?
2006-08-07T05:42:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	It says something like "must be run on a legal version of Microsoft Windows"
2006-08-07T05:42:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	so yes basically
2006-08-07T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	I guess many games say that somewhere if you read closely
2006-08-07T05:43:00.000Z	redcard	mwe	*nods*
2006-08-07T05:44:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	I've never heard about it at least
2006-08-07T05:44:00.000Z	mwe	redcard	they don't care if you buy the game I think
