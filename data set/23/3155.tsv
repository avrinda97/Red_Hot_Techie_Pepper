2009-01-15T07:27:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Did you have a support question?
2009-01-15T07:28:00.000Z	tester_	Flannel	yes, I am trying to gte gksduo work from a shell script(withput requiring the prompt for password), I have modified the sudoers with NoPASSWd, and from terminal gksude wors as expected
2009-01-15T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Try using sudo instead.
2009-01-15T07:30:00.000Z	tester_	Flannel	that is not a good idea, to use Sudo where gksude shoudl be used, Sparrow can make his minion convey this to you
2009-01-15T07:30:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	You just said "a script" you didn't mention anything about what said script is doing.
2009-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Whats wrong with just calling that script with sudo?  If the only thing the script does is modify files, `sudo script` should work just fine, without any security issues.  Also, sudo will work fine for that usage as well.
2009-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Also, you really shouldn't remove the password for all of your programs.  You can, however, remove the password requirement for that particular script rather easily.
2009-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	tester_	Flannel	I am hoping to create a shortcut on desktop, or put a script on the desktop, when someone clicks on it, want it to run
2009-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	That's fine.  You can make the shortcut include the sudo stuff very easily.
2009-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	tester_	Flannel	you are god that is all I want man
2009-01-15T07:55:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Don't use gksu, use sudo.  We already covered this.
2009-01-15T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	What?
2009-01-15T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	tester_	Why are you using c# and gtk to change a few files?
