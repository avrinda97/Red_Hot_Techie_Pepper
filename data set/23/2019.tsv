2010-09-28T18:21:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 changing the port will avoid a lot of the automated scripts. as the only protective measure, it wouldn't be recommended, but fine with others.
2010-09-28T18:22:00.000Z	jzaboo	bobstro	well, mist prot scanners usually use ICMP or SYN probing and due to the way the server replies, you can already see what kind of OS it's using. Sure, changing the port might prevent the logfiles from overflow...
2010-09-28T18:23:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 that's extra effort at least, and certainly slows them down. the old case of not having to out-run the bear and all.
2010-09-28T18:34:00.000Z	jzaboo	bobstro	Already told him about mrtg
2010-09-28T18:35:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 yes, i'm suggesting on router as well
2010-09-28T18:35:00.000Z	jzaboo	bobstro	ah you mean SNMP ok..
2010-09-28T18:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 or something similar, yes. so he can see traffic actually coming & going rather than depending on the exposed system.
2010-09-28T18:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 but it sounds like that's not an option.
2010-09-28T18:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i bought 3 of the suckas back at version 1.1 :)
2010-09-28T18:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 they are slow though.
2010-09-28T18:37:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i just noticed my throughput drops compared to a cisco router i have.
2010-09-28T18:38:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i love it though, don't get me wrong. dd-wrt is amazing.
2010-09-28T18:38:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 it was a straight bandwidth test off of dslreports. i'd get 10+ Mbps down with the cisco, half that with dd-wrt on the wrt.
2010-09-28T18:40:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i'll experiment sometime, but a speed test shouldn't hit either of those maximums. maybe mtu tuning and the like will help.
2010-09-28T18:42:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i just wonder what the max is on the little linksys. i haven't overclocked mine or anything.
2010-09-28T18:43:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 do you play with the NSLU2s as well?
2010-09-28T18:46:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i put debian on an nslu2 and use it on a dmz for my ssh connects. nice little box to harden.
2010-09-28T18:47:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i guess i could use it for nas too. :)
2010-09-28T18:47:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 well, it's just a dinky debian box now. no nas, only 40G drive on it. :)
2010-09-28T18:48:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 that's the idea. i'm trying to get rid of power-munching boxes.
2010-09-28T18:51:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 i've had a linux server running for years, and finally got it beefed up enough to run VMs.
2010-09-28T18:51:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 going green has made me abandon all my old hardware-hoarding ways.
2010-09-28T18:53:00.000Z	bobstro	jzaboo	 mine's an ex-desktop motherboard. i found an AMD quad-core CPU that would fit and upped it to 6 GB. nothing special, but it's adequate for a few VMs.
