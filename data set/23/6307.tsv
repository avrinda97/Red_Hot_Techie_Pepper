2008-08-06T19:12:00.000Z	paolo		Does anyone know if it is possible to install the new nvidia driver with envyng? (I mean 173.14.12)
2008-08-06T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	envyng's results are hit and miss use at your own risk
2008-08-06T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	I wouldn't change  / update the nvidia drivers unless I have an exceptional reason
2008-08-06T19:16:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	i have been using 173.14.09... there are some bugs but it is much better than the version that comes on hardy
2008-08-06T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	only you can answer that
2008-08-06T19:16:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	what does that mean?
2008-08-06T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	depends on your hardware, your card and your bugs
2008-08-06T19:17:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	ok... but my question was completely different
2008-08-06T19:17:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	I already have envyng . The question is how do I install the newest version
2008-08-06T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	envyng should get the new drivers for you
2008-08-06T19:18:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	it only gets the .09 not the .12
2008-08-06T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	wait for the updates then
2008-08-06T19:18:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	yes, but it was already announced... so I was wondering if someone knew what was going on
2008-08-06T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	announced where ?
2008-08-06T19:19:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	planet ubuntu
2008-08-06T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	have you re-run envyng ?
2008-08-18T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	shared .thumbs dir ?
2008-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	maybe ... but I didn't do anything
2008-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	and where is the .thumb dir?
2008-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	home dir
2008-08-18T01:10:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	thanks... let me check that
2008-08-18T01:12:00.000Z	paolo	ikonia	ok... why dolphin can update thumbnails and nautilus can't
2008-08-18T01:13:00.000Z	ikonia	paolo	check the permissions ? Nautilus probably can, but it doesn't as the file hasn't changed
