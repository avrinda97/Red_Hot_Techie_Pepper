2004-11-30T16:37:00.000Z	Solkaris		well I am not versed enough to build debs .. IE I would not trust what I did .. and there are several apps on gnome-files that would be nice to try and or make life easier but there are no .debs .. so do we just suck it up and live without?
2004-11-30T16:38:00.000Z	Solkaris		or build from source which means it wont play nice with apt
2004-11-30T16:39:00.000Z	Solkaris		yea jdub I just did that with 2 programs .. got broken programs that didnt work at all .. like I said Im not a dev .. so basically if you guys dont feel like doing a build we dont get to use it?
2004-11-30T16:40:00.000Z	Solkaris		wow .. guess its time to maybe start the distro hunt again .. that sucks
2004-11-30T16:40:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	why don't you try *learning* to package those packages?
2004-11-30T16:41:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	i guess debian/ubuntu has about the COOLEST people in place... they're faster at packaging than other (commercial) distros are
2004-11-30T16:41:00.000Z	Solkaris	__daniel	if I knew how I would
2004-11-30T16:42:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	the ubuntu developers learnt it too
2004-11-30T16:44:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	you try to talk to the developers of those projects to supply reasonable  /debian/ -directories
2004-11-30T16:46:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	and if a project supplies you with a /debian/-directory in their tarball, you can try   "debuild"  to build packages
2004-11-30T16:47:00.000Z	Solkaris	__daniel	that would be great but all the stuff Ive tried so far didnt have that
2004-11-30T16:48:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	then look at   apt-get source <something>   and try to talk to the developers - they'll be glad to have a debian/ubuntu tester for their project
2004-12-01T17:37:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	just ask your question
2004-12-01T17:37:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	you'll see if they pay attention
2004-12-01T17:41:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	apt-cache search imake, apt-cache search xmkmf
2004-12-01T17:42:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	look what i told you about imake and xmkmf
2004-12-01T17:43:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	looking at debhelper isnt done in "just a minute"
2004-12-01T17:50:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	try to calm done... packaging projects won't work being frustrated :-/
2004-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	i can really understand trey`... try to take it slow
2004-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	just add a new panel (somehow) and re-apply all the applets
2004-12-01T17:56:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	nobody plays games
2004-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	re-talking talk doesnt help you now, does it? i dont want to be rude, but try to get on a bit slower with people...
2004-12-01T06:04:00.000Z	__daniel	Solkaris	you didnt get a META-META-answer, so don't complain... most people are happy to get to know tools to help them
