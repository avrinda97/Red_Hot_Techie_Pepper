2008-10-07T23:27:00.000Z	lucax		Learnt to fly FFighter, if u want to share a printer, use samba...
2008-10-07T23:27:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	I don't need to share the printer, I need it to be accessible via IO, to use it programatically :)
2008-10-07T23:30:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	are u tryin to print a file to pdf?
2008-10-07T23:31:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	kind of, I will be connecting to this printer for testing purposes, I have some ruby pritning logic that needs to connect to a printer, and as I don't have a real printer, I just need to connect to a similar API, hence the PDF printer
2008-10-07T23:31:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	IO.popen('path/to/device')
2008-10-07T23:32:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	open office can do that... but not sure if how u can do it with ur program though... let me check that
2008-10-07T23:32:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	wow, thanks for the help :)
2008-10-07T23:33:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	k... first sudo apt-get install cups-pdf
2008-10-07T23:34:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	yes, have done that already :)
2008-10-07T23:34:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	Add a new printer (System->Administration->Printing) selecting the “Local Printer” “PDF Printer” option. In the next step choose “Generic Printer” and then used the “Postscript Color” driver.
2008-10-07T23:34:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	hmm, haven't done generic and postcript color thing
2008-10-07T23:36:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	k... try it hope it works!
2008-10-07T23:36:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	after I do this, where will the IO device be located in the filesystem?
2008-10-07T23:36:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	one more thing... dont forget to restart cups.... sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart
2008-10-07T23:37:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	check that in System->Administration->Printing
2008-10-07T23:37:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	where u add the printer...
2008-10-07T23:39:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	ah, you mean the URI ?
2008-10-07T23:39:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	cups-pdf:/
2008-10-07T23:40:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	try it like that...
2008-10-07T23:44:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	hmm, didn't work
2008-10-07T23:45:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	Im googling but where u add the printer doesnt tell u wheres located?
2008-10-07T23:45:00.000Z	FFighter	lucax	apparently no
2008-10-07T23:46:00.000Z	lucax	FFighter	check if theres a properties or something like that... or in printer default its another option in the menu...
