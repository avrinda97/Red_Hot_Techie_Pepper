2012-05-03T14:05:00.000Z	bubuz		hi guys question. box A cant get through firewall to internet, but can get to box B which can get out to the internet. I need to be able to update and install things on box A. How would I go about an SSH tunnel allowing this?
2012-05-03T14:06:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	use ssh's socks proxy
2012-05-03T14:07:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	-D
2012-05-03T14:07:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	please elaborate
2012-05-03T14:09:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	openssh has a socks proxy facility built in. Use -d <port>, put that  into /etc/apt/apt.conf and there you go
2012-05-03T14:19:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	there is no /etc/apt/apt.conf file
2012-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	I already told you, nearly an hour ago
2012-05-03T14:44:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	you didn't tell me you told me "ssh -D" and wouldnt explain further. sorry for cleaqrly being a fucking noob but thats not a full explanation in my book
2012-05-03T14:46:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	I told you to use -D <port>, which creates a socks proxy, which you can put into apt.conf. Which part don't you get? Try to read ssh's manpage, read apt.conf's manpage, expedially the proxy part, try that and ask specifically if you run into problems
2012-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	there is no /etc/apt/apt.conf
2012-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	then create one. There is none by default, if you create one apt will honor it
2012-05-03T14:56:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	ssh -fCND localhost:1080 user@remoteboxthathasaccesstointernet
2012-05-03T14:58:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	Did you try using an IP address? Maybe your dns server does not resolve everything
2012-05-03T14:58:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	and: what kind of proxy did you setup in firefox?
2012-05-03T14:59:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	tried IP, no go. Manual proxy config -> HTTP proxy and us this roxy for all protocols checked
2012-05-03T15:00:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	it's no http proxy. It's a socks proxy, I wrote that multiple times already
2012-05-03T15:01:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	did you configure both proxy types?
2012-05-03T15:02:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	ah ha - i had to clear all other options other than socks5
2012-05-03T15:03:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	well, of course, else you end up trying to use the wrong proxy type, which won't work
2012-05-03T15:04:00.000Z	bubuz	SunTsu	how would I set apt.cfg to point to proxy then?
2012-05-03T15:07:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	just read about that, you need to use tsocks: tsocks apt-get update for example. apt doesn't know how to handle socks on it's own
2012-05-03T15:08:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	ob course not. Just download it manually and scp it there
2012-05-03T15:10:00.000Z	SunTsu	bubuz	apt-get --print-uris install socks5
