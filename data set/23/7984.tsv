2005-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	Xappe		have you tested any other IM-client with msn support?
2005-09-08T11:29:00.000Z	TestDummy	Xappe	yes I have.
2005-09-08T11:29:00.000Z	TestDummy		aMSN doesn't work either.
2005-09-08T11:30:00.000Z	Xappe	TestDummy	I've used centericq with msn without any problems
2005-09-08T11:31:00.000Z	TestDummy		Er..
2005-09-08T11:31:00.000Z	TestDummy		Wrong button
2005-09-08T11:31:00.000Z	TestDummy	Xappe	Hm..
2005-09-08T11:32:00.000Z	TestDummy		I haven't tried that yet. But I'm not very familiar with that program.
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	Xappe	TestDummy	that's a cli client though...really nice for running in screen on a remote server :)
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	TestDummy	Xappe	I don't usually use my programs that way.
2005-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	Xappe	TestDummy	well, it would be my choice locally too nowadays. I'm so tired of all fancy smileys and stuff they bloat the im's with
2005-09-08T11:36:00.000Z	TestDummy	Xappe	I'm not a big fan of the bloat either, but I'm not too fond of CLI programs.
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	TestDummy		Gaim used to work, but 1.5.0 doesn't for some reason.
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	TestDummy		Something get broken?
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	TestDummy		I mean, it starts and runs, but..
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	Xappe	TestDummy	you don't run any firewall?
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	TestDummy		I do.
2005-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	TestDummy		I have Firestarter installed.
2005-09-08T11:38:00.000Z	TestDummy		Should I open up a port or something?
2005-09-08T11:38:00.000Z	Xappe	TestDummy	have you opened the right ports then?
2005-09-08T11:38:00.000Z	TestDummy		Well, I don't even know what ports to try opening.
