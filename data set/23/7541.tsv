2005-08-23T07:20:00.000Z	tristanmike		Hi
2005-08-23T07:21:00.000Z	tristanmike		can anyone spare a moment to answer a sound question?
2005-08-23T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	everyones got a moment, but the answer, well ....
2005-08-23T07:36:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	you could try running alsamixer from the terminal and see if all the volumes are turned up. My limit on 5.1 :)
2005-08-23T07:37:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	Yeah, I'm there now, I ran the "speaker-test -c6 -D surround51" command and here's the thing, I get surround sound there, but the sound for the center speaker comes out the Ft.Lf. loud
2005-08-23T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	watch for a guy named crimsun, he's the sound guru around here.
2005-08-23T07:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	I see his name, but it's greyed, what does that mean? You have no idea of how much a computer n00b i am
2005-08-23T07:39:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	I haven't a clue :)
2005-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	that's what's happening to him
2005-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	over and over, if he hit's enter, reboot
2005-08-25T10:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	what if the same thing is happening but it quits at the line... "PS/2 mouse device common for all mice"
2005-08-25T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	again, I'll pass that to the people who actually know the installer. I try to stay within my limits.
2005-08-25T10:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	cool
2006-04-03T12:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	thanx :)
2006-04-03T12:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	is that -l an "L" or an | ?
2006-04-03T12:27:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	capital ? or doesn't matter ?
2006-04-03T12:28:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	does matter, capital L ; lower case l lists packages matching the file glob ; dpkg -l gnome*
2006-04-03T12:28:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	merci beaucoup :)
2006-06-13T08:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	don't be mean
2006-06-13T08:01:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	I'm so tired of hearing of help requested on barely beta software
2006-06-13T08:01:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	that's true, I was just joking anyway :P
2006-06-13T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	tristanmike	:)
2008-02-08T08:58:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud	does that require a reboot ?
