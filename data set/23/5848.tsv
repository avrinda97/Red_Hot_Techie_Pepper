2006-08-25T16:56:00.000Z	lupine_85		manpages are the answer to everything ;)
2006-08-25T16:56:00.000Z	lupine_85		means it does the directory, all the filwa in it, and all it's subdirectories etc.
2006-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		chmod -R a+rwx * would do what you seem to want...
2006-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		but I wouldn't recommend it
2006-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		lol, true ;)
2006-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	lupine_85		same thing...
2006-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	yeah, same stupidity
2006-08-25T05:16:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	even if you use NTFS-3 with r/w, you still can't change perms
2006-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	you can do ACL's with *nix
2006-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	i do it all the time on my fbsd servers
2006-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	probably
2006-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	not on BSDs :)
2006-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	lupine_85	debuntu	you'd need to sudo twice

2006-08-25T05:53:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	thing about aptitude is if you use it to install, when you uninstall it will remove unneeded dependencies, apt-get won't
2006-08-25T05:54:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	only difference is instead of 'apt-get' you type aptitude .. "aptitude update && aptitude install hotporn"
2006-08-25T05:54:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	i was the same , till i had to keep running deborphan

2006-08-25T06:20:00.000Z	lupine_85	debuntu	and pay the license fee?
2006-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	debuntu	lupine_85	exactly
