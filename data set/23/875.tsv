2011-01-03T00:17:00.000Z	aimio		has anyone had any right click mouse issue in ubuntu 10.10 ?.. (and any ideas how to solve it).
2011-01-03T00:17:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	what's the issue.
2011-01-03T00:19:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	i am not able to right click on desktop or folders etc, i have tried -q on nautilus and addins show_desktop to true but notting seems to be working, so i'm leaning into beliving the issue is with the mouse sessting's, i realy don't know what the problem is.
2011-01-03T00:21:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	and you've confirmed that this mouse's right click works outside of ubuntu yes?
2011-01-03T00:21:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	yes.
2011-01-03T00:21:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	did your install start like this, or is this a new thing?
2011-01-03T00:22:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	and does the right click work in other programs, like the sudoku game or whatever?
2011-01-03T00:25:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	have you tried a different mouse with ubuntu?
2011-01-03T00:25:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	it's a built in one i am on a netbook.
2011-01-03T00:26:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	okay, so it's not a mouse, its a touchpad, that's different
2011-01-03T00:27:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	it's a tochpad issue. "mousepad"
2011-01-03T00:28:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	if the driver it uses is called mousepad do the same thing, sudo rmmod mousepad sudo modprobe mousepad
2011-01-03T00:29:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	how can i do something like aplay -l for the mousepad to see what it the driver is called.
2011-01-03T00:30:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	just do a lsmod
2011-01-03T00:32:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	my computer is a lenovo, ideapad, s10-3t. (it's a touch screen enabled as well)..
2011-01-03T00:33:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	some touchpads use proprietary drivers, and this is not so fun =\
2011-01-03T00:34:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	but i did not have this problem in 10.04 so what did they change :S? if i could know what they changed then i could fix it maybe..
2011-01-03T00:38:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	i did sudo rmmod psmouse and then sudo modprobe psmouse that did not work.
2011-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	i have tried that with the config and nautilus thingy no changes.
2011-01-03T00:48:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	then you're going to have to write configs to X for your touchpad driver, yeah it sucks =\
2011-01-03T00:48:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	do you know where i can read about that so i know what to add etc.. beacuse i have no clue.
2011-01-03T00:49:00.000Z	Maahes	aimio	try the !touchpad or !mouse commands to ubuntu, and look for your device on the ubuntu forums
2011-01-03T00:50:00.000Z	aimio	Maahes	thanks
