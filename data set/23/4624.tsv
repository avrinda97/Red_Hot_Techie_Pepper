2008-04-02T02:49:00.000Z	amenado		kazol_-> in your /etc/network/interfaces
2008-04-02T02:49:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	I still have to enter it.
2008-04-02T02:50:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	I'll try it again (I'll have the wpa-psk key).
2008-04-02T02:54:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It does not work; I have to enter it each time.
2008-04-02T02:56:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	http://pastebin.com/d4d3bb67d
2008-04-02T02:58:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It was generated by default.
2008-04-02T02:59:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	When I reboot, there is no internet connection-I have to open Network Manager and change the very long string to the temporary short key I have.
2008-04-02T03:00:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	So clearly the key in Network Manager is different from the actual key...maybe it's PSK?
2008-04-02T03:00:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	In that case, I don't understand why I have to enter my key each time for it to generate the same PSK.
2008-04-02T04:19:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	Are you there?
2008-04-02T04:20:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	I figured it out-second post in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834
2008-04-02T04:24:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It was a bug, so I had to add a symbolic link to a restart script for startup (after S40networking).
2008-04-02T04:24:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	*Many* people have the same problem yet did not receive an answer...
2008-04-02T04:24:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It's the second post on: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834
2008-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	Yes
2008-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	(sry for that, I changed my key), I did not fix the bug but fixed the problem temporarily.
2008-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	I tried everything (I think that pre-up thing too)...nothing worked except this.
2008-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It's on the second forum post on the url I gave you.
2008-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	I told you, it restarts networking.
2008-04-02T04:39:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It's all described on the second forum post.
2008-04-02T04:39:00.000Z	kazol_	amenado	It runs "/etc/init.d/networking restart"
