2011-06-22T20:22:00.000Z	nophone		do you think it's the file system or that there are bad sectors on the drive?
2011-06-22T20:22:00.000Z	Kyokan	nophone	i ran fsck from a terminal and got stuck there
2011-06-22T20:22:00.000Z	Kyokan	nophone	could be a bad sector or superblock
2011-06-22T20:23:00.000Z	nophone		you could look for a program called spinrite
2011-06-22T20:23:00.000Z	nophone		you boot up from the disk
2011-06-22T20:23:00.000Z	nophone		if it's a disk sector that can be recovered it will do it
2011-06-22T20:23:00.000Z	Kyokan	nophone	 I can only boot from live cd
2011-06-22T20:24:00.000Z	nophone	Kyokan	you could mount it to a thumb drive and boot from there. i didn't realise you were in such dire straights
