2004-11-09T09:47:00.000Z	g3r4rd0		someone knows why monodevelop doesn't show up when i do an apt-cache search monodevelop, i've got main,restricted,universe and multiverse in my sources.list
2004-11-09T09:49:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	I can't find it in synaptic either
2004-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	it is in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/monodevelop
2004-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	but apt-cache doesn't find it :S
2004-11-09T09:52:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	what's the difference between that and mono? is the mono package only the run time env?
2004-11-09T09:53:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	exactly, monodevelop is an IDE
2004-11-09T09:56:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	I remember the time when you just fired up your c-64 and hacked away in basic ;)
2004-11-09T09:56:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	hehehe yeah, i had a radio shack trs8something
2004-11-09T09:57:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	i really don't use monodevelop, i use vi, i just found that weird
2004-11-09T09:57:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	why do you use mono/.NET?
2004-11-09T09:57:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	i mean that monodevelop doesn't show up when i search for it
2004-11-09T09:59:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	I was more thinking why mono instead of Java or something like that
2004-11-09T09:59:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	i need to develop cross-platform apps, c# is, for me, more powerful than java
2004-11-09T09:59:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	i really like java, but c# is better
2004-11-09T10:00:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	Ok
2004-11-09T10:03:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	do you develop apps or something??
2004-11-09T10:04:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	not really. I tinker with lots of stuff. downloaded c# express beta to my xp box and I played around a little
2004-11-09T10:04:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	ok
2004-11-09T10:07:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	But I'll probably go with python on my linux box
2004-11-09T10:08:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	python is good, ubuntu is full of it hehe
2004-11-09T10:10:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	Yeah, and it's easy to be productive in it. Just starting out and i don't have to plow through 435 tutorials ;)
2004-11-09T10:10:00.000Z	g3r4rd0	gruberman_	hehehe cool
2004-11-09T10:12:00.000Z	gruberman_	g3r4rd0	It might not be the fastest language, but I'm not competing with J Carmack's 3D-engine :)
