2007-02-26T11:34:00.000Z	kane77		I am printing some pdf's that have monospace fonts, but on the printed version each letter of the monospace font is chopped off... is it the printer issue or what could it be??
2007-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 chopped off where?
2007-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	each letter is not printed entirely, there's like 3/4 missing (from the right side) this happens only on monospace fonts...
2007-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 now that is odd....
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	and it sucks as I'm trying to print a e-book with a lot of sourcecodes... :D
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 Hmm what you printing them with anyway? acrobat reader?
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	I tried gpdf and xpdf and evince... but the result is the same..
2007-02-26T11:40:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	i'm downloading acrobat...
2007-02-26T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 yea. thats my advice see what it does.. it could be some font specific/printer issue.
2007-02-26T11:41:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	how can I compile from repositories (I have some repos with sources)?
2007-02-26T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 thats somthing ive only done like once.. ages ago.
2007-02-26T11:49:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	just letting you know... acrobad doesn't solve this :(
2007-02-26T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 sounds like it maybe a fonts uploading to the printer issue..  try some other printer driver perhaps?> or a pdf to ps converter  then print the ps?
2007-12-05T22:21:00.000Z	kane77	Dr_willis	^^
2007-12-05T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kane77	 try it and see.. I wouldebnt be suprised if icq then tryes anotehr port.   I tried to block one of them ages ago on my home lan. and never did get it all blocked. Just broke parts of it. :)
