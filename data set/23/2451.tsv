2009-04-27T07:34:00.000Z	luis_		hey ppl, i just installed ubuntu and im trying to apply a gtk2 theme but it doesnt work properly... what could it be??
2009-04-27T07:35:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	theme engine not installed
2009-04-27T07:35:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	could be one thing
2009-04-27T07:36:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	do you know what packed is that? i installed everything related :P
2009-04-27T07:36:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	are there instructions that came with the theme?
2009-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	not really.. i put the themes in the correct folder... they appear in gtk-theme-switch2 list
2009-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	yes, but they sometimes require engines to run properly
2009-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	is there a readme or something?
2009-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	ill take a look.. 1 of them had no readme file or anything like that... maybe the other :X
2009-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	quite possible. I know it's happened to me a few times
2009-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	no readme :P
2009-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	do you remember where you got it?
2009-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	there is a metacity folder and a gtk2.0 folder... with no readme inside
2009-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	do you remember where you got it?
2009-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	yes... gnome-look in the gtk2.0 theme section
2009-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	go back and see if there is anything indicating anything there
2009-04-27T07:43:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	well none of the themes work properly... maybe its something more general :X
2009-04-27T07:43:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	have you tried logging out and then back in?
2009-04-27T07:43:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	yes... twice
2009-04-27T07:43:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	do i need to restart or just relog in X?
2009-04-27T07:44:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	try restarting X, and then if that doesn't work, then I dunno what to tell you. I usually don't use gnome, but when I do, that's what my problem usually is (damn theme engines)
2009-04-27T07:51:00.000Z	luis_	PoetOfShadows	hey i found out something... when i try to change to any downloaded theme using gtk-chtheme, terminal shows the following message: /usr/share/themes/Shiftie_Black/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:1719: error: unexpected character `{', expected character `='
2009-04-27T07:51:00.000Z	PoetOfShadows	luis_	try fixing that, and see where it gets you
