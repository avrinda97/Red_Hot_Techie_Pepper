2008-04-10T05:29:00.000Z	dmsuperman		can anyone help me with getting twinview, or ANY form of full-resolution dual monitor working?
2008-04-10T05:29:00.000Z	dmsuperman		i've got a nvidia 7900 with the nvidia restricted drivers
2008-04-10T05:30:00.000Z	dmsuperman		"gksudo nvidia-settings" opens up a dialog with no options to configure monitors
2008-04-10T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	it's a bit involved -- read the README.txt.gz in /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx -- also see the factoid:
2008-04-10T05:38:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	easiest is to login on a text console (Ctrl-Alt-F1 -- switch back to Xserver with Ctrl-Alt-F7 or -F9)
2008-04-10T05:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	thanks. what command would i use to copy whole folder structures to another folder?
2008-04-10T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	cp -a (consult man cp)
2008-04-10T05:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	thanks
2008-04-10T05:40:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	if you're copying  /dev directories, look at the tar technique suggested by Alan Cox in the Tips-HOWTO
2008-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	then it's metacity --replace
2008-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	i can't even open a terminal because of it
2008-04-10T05:56:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	so switch to a text console, log in and run 'export DISPLAY=:0 ; metacity --replace'
2008-04-10T05:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	thanks:D
2008-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	any likely candidates for a proxy variable setting?
2008-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	what do you mean?
2008-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	sorry, I'm confusing nicks
2008-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	for your apache problem, you probably just have to make your NTFS writable with ntfs-3g
2008-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	that's awesome. shame i just finished copying all my data to another partition and it'll be easiest (According to those who helped me with it earlier)
2008-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	they are probably right
2008-05-18T18:43:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	sun-java6-plugin is only available for i386. Is that what you're on?
2008-05-18T18:43:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	yes
2008-05-18T18:44:00.000Z	soundray	dmsuperman	you need to restart firefox once you've installed the sun-java6-plugin package
2008-05-18T18:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	soundray	I didn't even have firefox open
