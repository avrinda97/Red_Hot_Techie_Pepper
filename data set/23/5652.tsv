2011-02-16T07:23:00.000Z	barf		I am in a text based ubuntu, what is the smallest component I can install to have a functionable startx or similar?
2011-02-16T07:25:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Do you mean you want the minimal amount of packages installed to get a running GNOME desktop?  If you install Xfce, it would take up less memory but may not be smaller number of packages. (There's a xubuntu-desktop package or something like that that you can install from command-line.)
2011-02-16T07:27:00.000Z	barf	kwtm	couldnt find package xfce
2011-02-16T07:30:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	In that case, yuou may want to see what package xubuntu-desktop depends on, then selectively install.
2011-02-16T07:30:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	For example, you mnight not need Firefox, which is part of the desktop.
2011-02-16T07:30:00.000Z	barf	kwtm	I was hoping to have nautilus and FireFox
2011-02-16T07:30:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Basically, the xubuntu-desktop is almost the whole package of Xubuntu (except for what you've already installed, like Linux kernel, bash, etc.)
2011-02-16T07:31:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	You might want to see what else there is that you can cut out.  E.g might not need email client?  Also, xubuntu doesn't even have nautilus ; it uses thunar, I think, which is smaller.
2011-02-16T07:32:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	But, yeah, 101MB is not much room for a GUI.  I used to work with text only Linux, and it would take up about 40MB, so 101MB isn't much room.
2011-02-16T07:32:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	What, debian 2.0 has a graphical environment under 101MB?
2011-02-16T07:33:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	I've found that I can't squeeze a modern KDE into less than 4GB now.  So I'm guessing for a good GUI you'd need at least 500MB.
2011-02-16T07:34:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	You used to run Nautilus and Firefox in 40MB?  Maybe Mosaic or Cello, but not even Netscape could fit into that small a space.
2011-02-16T07:34:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Have you considered using text-only?  Can come in very handy.
2011-02-16T07:36:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Do I understand correctly you are trying to put Linux into a ... what is a Syncmaster, a monitor?  I'd really go for text-only Linux.  Have you tried it?  Elinks, vim, screen ... the text only interface is underrated.
2011-02-16T07:36:00.000Z	barf	kwtm	That is my regular work environment
2011-02-16T07:37:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	I think my 40MB hard disk went with a 80486 15MHz, so I'm pretty sure the Pentium 60MHz had more than 40MB hard drive ...  40MB ram sounds more like it.
2011-02-16T07:38:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Hmm... it's going to be a tight squeeze, but you might want to look into fluxbox or something that is smaller but which needs manual installation.  And I wouldn't put in Firefox just for Youtube, unless you want your son surfing the web.
2011-02-16T07:39:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	If it's okay for you to download the youtube videos and then play the Flash, then just youtube-dl.py, elinks (or links2) and mplayer (which I think doesn't even need X)
2011-02-16T07:39:00.000Z	barf	kwtm	He would have to do that too, to do research for homework
2011-02-16T07:40:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Well, okay, in that case I guess you'll have to check out smaller win managers.  Yes, definitely a USB drive (you might as well get a 1GB drive if not a 16GB drive) would help, although disk access would be slow.
2011-02-16T07:43:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	I'd go with the USB drive thing, if you can get it to boot off USB drive.
2011-02-16T07:43:00.000Z	kwtm	barf	Good move!  Anyway, that's my recommendation.  40" monitor?  Nice.
