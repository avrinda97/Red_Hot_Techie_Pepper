2012-03-12T17:07:00.000Z	inzi		hey everyone
2012-03-12T17:08:00.000Z	inzi		does anyone know if skype 5.8 will run well on ubuntu, with windows 7 under virtualbox
2012-03-12T17:08:00.000Z	speddie	inzi	yes
2012-03-12T17:08:00.000Z	inzi		i want to switch to ubuntu but i use skype a lot.. and the linux version of skype isnt gud enuf
2012-03-12T17:08:00.000Z	speddie		if your host is up to it
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	will all the functions work? camera etc..
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	speddie		you can do that, if you have issues jsut make the virtualbox task a high priority in windows
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	speddie		you could even go the other way and virtualize windows in ubunti
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	speddie		u
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	speddie		i havent tried camera, only voice when i was testing other voip stuff
2012-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	thats the plan, ubuntu is the main OS, while windows is virtualizd
2012-03-12T17:10:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	thanks.. i think i'll hv to give it a try myself
2012-03-12T17:11:00.000Z	speddie		yeh your better off having ubuntu as host and virtualize windows. best thing is because the hard drives are single files, snapshots are just a matter opf copy/paste the file you stuff up windows/get virus whatever, just go back to known working hdd
2012-03-12T17:11:00.000Z	inzi		anyone here using 12.04, stable?
2012-03-12T17:11:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	r u on ubuntu?
2012-03-12T17:11:00.000Z	speddie		11.04 latest
2012-03-12T17:12:00.000Z	speddie		and yeh im on 11.04 inzi
2012-03-12T17:12:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	my skype on 11.10 has dark almost green video, tried all the work arounds on the forum.. hopefully 12.04 fixd the issue
2012-03-12T17:12:00.000Z	speddie		if your CPU has it inzi, make sure vXD is turned on in the bios (or whatever else it may be called)
2012-03-12T17:13:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	im using a laptop
2012-03-12T17:13:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	wat does vXD do?
2012-03-12T17:14:00.000Z	speddie		im not sure about the greenish video, suspect driver but would need to google. vXD is in the processor that helps virtualisation on a hardware level
2012-03-12T17:14:00.000Z	inzi	speddie	oh ok.. thankx alot.. will give it a try
