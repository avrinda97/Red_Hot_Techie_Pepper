2006-09-10T15:44:00.000Z	trogdoor		Is there an IRC channel for help with intel macs running linux? Preferably Ubuntu specific?
2006-09-10T15:46:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	well, i think you can try this channel
2006-09-10T15:47:00.000Z	dark_light		intel macs running linux ubuntu specific is very spefic..
2006-09-10T15:47:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	I have been trying to get help on my sleep issues with my macbook pro for days now on this channel.
2006-09-10T15:47:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	sleep issues?
2006-09-10T15:48:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	i think you could now try google or a ubuntu forum
2006-09-10T15:48:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	It won't wake from sleep ( black screen )
2006-09-10T15:48:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	I tried both of those first.
2006-09-10T15:49:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	i didn't understand, you meant the screen that apeears when the desktop is idle?
2006-09-10T15:50:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	When resuming from suspend
2006-09-10T15:51:00.000Z	dark_light		well.. ugh.. i had never used suspend, and i don't have a mac.. (i don't have a mac with intel processor too)
2006-09-10T15:51:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	what about submiting a bug in launchpad? or to gnome project
2006-09-10T15:52:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	I haven't done that yet, I wasn't sure if it was a bug or user error, I guess  will submit a bug now though.
2006-09-10T15:53:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	if nobody can help you, there is a chance that it is a bug. but i am unsure if you can bug it in launchpad, gnome bugs must be sent to gnome's bugzilla
2006-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	I also haven't tried suspend when not running X, do you know the command for suspend from the terminal?
2006-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	no..
2006-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	what is the command?
2006-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	That is what I am trying to ask :)
2006-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	you can find out the package that provides this command, it's the package that may be with a bug so..
2006-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	ah! heh. (sorry, english isn't my first language..)
2006-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	well, do you know HOW to suspend with gnome? i have never tried!
2006-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	trogdoor	dark_light	yes.
2006-09-10T15:57:00.000Z	dark_light	trogdoor	tell me, heh
