2011-07-15T04:14:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		the lsb_release -a gives these results:   No LSB modules are available.    Distributor ID: Ubuntu     Description:    Ubuntu 9.10    Release:        9.10    Codename:       karmic
2011-07-15T04:15:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		This confuses me, because I upgraded this AM from jaunty, changed the sources to the EOL sources for karmic, and upgraded again...and it spent an hour or two churning through all that.
2011-07-15T04:17:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		Can I do an upgrade by downloading the iso?
2011-07-15T04:17:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	from karmic?
2011-07-15T04:18:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	Apparently I'm still in Karmic...which is confusing me because I thought the last two hours were an upgrade from Karmic...
2011-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	My sources.list, no doubt, needs an upgrade from the Karmic EOL repositories anyway...but that whole thing this morning about setting the prompt in etc/update-manager/release-upgrades to LTS I thought was intended to address this...
2011-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	check the link I just gave you
2011-07-15T04:21:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	Okay, thanks, I'm looking at it now...do I need to adjust my sources.list?
2011-07-15T04:23:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	Okay...there's already a snag: I don't understand Step 1: "Start System/Administration/Software Sources"  I'm not running kde/gnome
2011-07-15T04:23:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	then do the server one
2011-07-15T04:24:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	Okay, thanks.  Technically I'm running kubuntu, but with WindowMaker...
2011-07-15T04:25:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	the steps for server are right there, need help with those?
2011-07-15T04:26:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	No, I think I have it, as long as the Prompt thing is supposed to be normal...thanks!
2011-07-15T04:37:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	how much do you have
2011-07-15T04:37:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	1.1G
2011-07-15T04:37:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	what does the installer say it needs
2011-07-15T04:38:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	at some point you'll need to expand that nonetheless
2011-07-15T04:38:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	up to you when that is.
2011-07-15T04:53:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	yes, dont do it
2011-07-15T04:54:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	bazhang	Thanks.  I thought it seemed like a bad idea.  I'll wait until after the upgrade...which looks like it'll take 8 hours just to download (apparently not using all my bandwidth for the download)
2011-07-15T04:56:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	long term support 3 years desktop, 5 years server
2011-07-15T04:58:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	no, you need to go step by step, for the upgrades, unless it is LTS to LTS which can jump over those
2011-07-15T05:16:00.000Z	bazhang	JoAnneThrax	pooltable please continue this chat in the #ubuntu-offtopic channel, thanks.
