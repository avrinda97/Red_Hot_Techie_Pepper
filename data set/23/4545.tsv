2007-07-15T11:34:00.000Z	Moridin333	wizek	for some reason or another your comp can't use the hard drive, try booting live cd in recovery and reinstall grub
2007-07-15T11:37:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	I've tried install Linux to an absolutly clean HD, third times...

2007-07-15T11:39:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	120GB Samsung ide, about 1-2 yrs old
2007-07-15T11:40:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	Do u hav any idea?
2007-07-15T11:41:00.000Z	Moridin333	wizek	 hmmm, to try and fix it I would boot live cd in recovery mode and reinstall grub.  I know it dounds dumb but it might help, also reset bios to default.  if that doesn't work you'll need to look at the grub config file to check the settings.
2007-07-15T11:42:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	Tell me how can i chack the settings, and which settings are good or bad...
2007-07-15T11:43:00.000Z	Moridin333	wizek	 it all depends on what is actually on your hard drive, it would be a little different for most every computer.  if you have 1 ide hd is should be looking at hda*.  the * is a number defining what partition it should be loading
2007-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	well i can say it is a virgin hd now, after a total format and an ubuntu installed on it... i can't change it, i can't even boot up with my linux...

2007-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	Moridin333	wizek	I'm out of ideas besides reinstalling GRUB or checking the settings and resetting the bios.
2007-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	ok, 'll reinstll GRUB first
2007-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	how can i do that?
2007-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	wizek	Moridin333	do i have to do it from here or from somewhere else?
2007-07-15T11:55:00.000Z	Moridin333	wizek	: this should tell you how https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
