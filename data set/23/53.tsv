2012-09-20T06:32:00.000Z	minetruly		Hi! This is my first time using IRC. I'm considering switching to Ubuntu. I'm willing to lean computer programming. If you don't mind talking to a total newbie, do any of you have words of wisdom for me?
2012-09-20T06:33:00.000Z	minetruly		Thank you, blackshirt.
2012-09-20T06:34:00.000Z	minetruly		What does "port" mean? (Sorry, I'm such a beginner! I promise I learn quickly.)
2012-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	minetruly		What if it's not compatible with something i want to use, or doesn't run well enough with my computer's hardware?
2012-09-20T06:36:00.000Z	minetruly		65000? Why so many? I get the basics like your email goes out one port, or you could specify another....
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	minetruly		Thanks crimsonmane. It'll be nice to use it without hassle. But, I really am planning on learning how to program, and dealing with Linux would be as good a place to start as any.
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	minetruly		I'd love to be able to tweak things.
2012-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	minetruly		Also, I'm done tolerating the glitches Windows gives me. I want the ability to get my hands around a problem until I've strangled it.
2012-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	minetruly		And, you know, solved it.
2012-09-20T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	try ubuntu-tweak and myunity
2012-09-20T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	gogeta: every OS sucks
2012-09-20T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	ports in what sense?
2012-09-20T06:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	all OSes can and do go wrong
2012-09-20T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	depends on how you use it
2012-09-20T06:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	the desktop OS can manage up to 32 cores if memory serves. Quad core isn't anything fancy
2012-09-20T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	the touch screen may be an issue but it depends on the controller for it. I suggest you boot a liveCD OS and test there, it won't modify your installed OS
2012-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	yes, you'll also need RAM to hold the running apps, not just raw CPU speed
2012-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	thats more than enough for Ubuntu, the libs are reused so RAM use is low
2012-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	I run a full desktop and use less than 400Mb
2012-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	the RAM holds the processes as they run, so more RAM means more processes, CPU just means they will run smoother. CPU doesn't determine how many concurrent apps you can run
2012-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	even if you fill the RAM, you wil start to use swap space (slower) and you can run even more. With 8Gb I doubt you will touch swap
2012-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	minetruly	ActionParsnip	What are the other factors? My 2010 PC has more RAM than my 2007 MacBook, but the Windows machine has never once run faster than my Mac.
2012-09-20T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minetruly	its a different OS all together so the resources will be used differently
