2006-05-28T10:44:00.000Z	_daedalus		I just tried to enable the ATI driver on my thinkpad t43 and now can't get back to X.  I'm stuck in the terminal.
2006-05-28T10:45:00.000Z	_daedalus		I followed the instructions on ubuntu.com -- tuxtheslacker: I'm hoping there is a way to finish the task, instead of reverting back...
2006-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	the point would be to get back to X to find a solution.
2006-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	I think I can go backwards from my commands.  I am trying to find them now.
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		to go backwards?
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	I'm just wondering if I just have to do one more thing and it will work... or do I have to go backwards 5 steps and then go foward those 5 steps again.
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	it's easier to just go to the xorg.conf
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	did you check to make sure your ATi card is supported to start with?
2006-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	hmmm... no.  :S
2006-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	I'd check that :-)
2006-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	actually -- yes, before I bought the computer.  Ubuntu works fine on this model
2006-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	yes, I'm asking about the proprietary driver...
2006-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	of course *nix works fine, I'm asking about support for the proprietary.
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	the pages that I read about thinkpad t43 with this video card -- they were able to enable the driver.  I've followed their instructions with no luck.  This is the second time.
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	_daedalus		(the second time that I've tried)
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		oh okay.
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		then I'd go back, and redo those instructions....
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	I have my xorg.cong backed up, so I can just restore that then?
2006-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		I'd revert first ,and then make sure it works :-)
2006-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	you COULD in any other distro, I'm not 100% sure about ubuntu.
2006-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	_daedalus	tuxtheslacker	so go backwards on my 4 or 5 steps?
2006-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		I'd get that double checked in here first.
2006-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	_daedalus	^^
