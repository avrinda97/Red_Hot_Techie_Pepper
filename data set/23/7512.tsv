2005-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	are the files still owned by root?  if so "sudo chown *.mp3"
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	correction: "sudo chown <youruser> *.mp3"
2005-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	hm, how do i chown entire dorectory structures recursively? :P
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	"chown -R <user> <directory>"
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	thanks. :)
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	np.  Actually for completeness you should probably change the group as well "chown -R <user>:<group> <dir>"
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	would if i knew the group :P
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	probably the same as your user - you can see which groups a user is in by typing "groups" (as a command).
2005-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	ah, yes, thank you very much :D
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	yw :)
2005-12-17T09:57:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	install linux-tree
2005-12-17T10:00:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	thanks!
2005-12-17T10:00:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	err, does that set the default kernel config options to the ubuntu defaults?
2005-12-17T10:01:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	i don't know sorry
2005-12-17T10:01:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	that's fine :)
2005-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	if the config file is different to the one in /boot then you could possibly assume so
2005-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	hm, couldnt i just copy over the one from /boot?
2005-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	sure
2005-12-17T10:03:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	any idea where i copy it to?
2005-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	sorry i can't remember.  For me it's so long since i compiled one.  Haven't needed to since using ubuntu (Oct '04) :)
2005-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	bimberi	qt2	perhaps some help here - http://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto
2005-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	thanks ^.^;
2005-12-17T10:05:00.000Z	qt2	bimberi	i'm trying to get ubuntu working perfectly on a toshiba sattelite... ;)
