2008-05-18T01:09:00.000Z	illriginal		Can someone please assist me in enabling permissions for read/write? I have a copied a few folders onto my desktop, but their emblem has a little lock and I can't cut/paste those folders into a different directory.
2008-05-18T01:10:00.000Z	captainFuture	illriginal	what says console if you type la -la ?
2008-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	illriginal		This command: sudo chown -Rv illriginal /home/illriginal/Desktop
2008-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	illriginal		doesn't give me access to those folders for read/write
2008-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	illriginal		hold on captainFuture
2008-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	illriginal		illriginal@illriginal:~$ la -la
2008-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	illriginal		bash: la: command not found
2008-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	illriginal	captainFuture	^
2008-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	captainFuture		@illriginalgo cd Desktop
2008-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	captainFuture		then ls -la

2008-05-18T01:13:00.000Z	illriginal		It lists all the folders I have on my desktop that are restricted from read/write access. captainFuture.
2008-05-18T01:13:00.000Z	captainFuture	illriginal	hten give him access
2008-05-18T01:13:00.000Z	captainFuture		sudo chown yourusername:users  ###andthisfolder###
2008-05-18T01:14:00.000Z	illriginal	captainFuture	how?... I tried the chown command all it does is list every single file in each folder then claims it's retained to me.
2008-05-18T01:14:00.000Z	captainFuture		example sudo chown captainFuture:users myrestrictetfolder
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	illriginal		oh I need to do them to every single folder, captainfuture?
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	captainFuture		no
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	captainFuture		give -R this before  like:
2008-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	captainFuture		sudo chown -R username:users
2008-05-18T01:16:00.000Z	illriginal		sudo chown -R illriginal /home/illriginal/Desktop/foldername  ?
2008-05-18T01:17:00.000Z	captainFuture		sudo chown -R illriginal:users /home/illriginal/Desktop/foldername
2008-05-18T01:19:00.000Z	illriginal	captainFuture	I'm sorry but this command isn't doing anything: illriginal@illriginal:~/Desktop$ sudo chown -R illriginal:users /home/illriginal/Desktop/A
