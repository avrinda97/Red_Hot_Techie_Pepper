2006-03-15T13:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	"sudo dpkg -i <file.deb>
2006-03-15T13:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	if it has a graphical installer replace "sudo" with "gksudo"
2006-03-15T13:22:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	it said need action option
2006-03-15T13:23:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	what is it that you're trying to install?
2006-03-15T13:23:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	sorry, did you happen to use the " that I had there ?
2006-03-15T13:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	sorry, that was my bad, what I meant was to put another at the end, ignore the "
2006-03-15T13:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	so it's just    sudo dpkg -i <file.deb>
2006-03-15T13:25:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	do i need the <> signs?
2006-03-15T13:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	no
2006-03-15T13:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	usually if you see someone write that here, it mean "what's inside" same with the quotes
2006-03-15T13:26:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	it said cannot access archive no such file or directory
2006-03-15T13:27:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	sorry, maybe I assumed too much, type the following (you said the file was on your Desktop?)  cd ~/Desktop
2006-03-15T13:31:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	how we doing there?
2006-03-15T13:33:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	I got it to work finally
2006-03-15T13:34:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	glad to hear. yeah, most times sudo is what you'll use, but in those rare cases where it has a graphical installer, (like Americas Army or Enemy territory) you should use gksudo or risk causing yourself headaches
2006-03-15T13:35:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	I'll keep that in mind
2006-03-15T13:35:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	you wouldn't know about Steam and WINE would you?
2006-03-15T13:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	no sir, I'm sorry I don't, I have never used wine...
2006-03-15T13:36:00.000Z	Neko_Freak	tristanmike	mmk
2006-03-21T11:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	"mkv" support wasn't built in properly to the vlc package, trust me, i just spent 2 days compiling to get it to work
2006-03-21T11:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	you have to configure mplayer in ~/.mplayer
2006-03-21T11:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	Neko_Freak	you won't be able to get subs or change audio tracks for a file by using menus in mplayer
