2008-04-06T16:55:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	put it in /etc/modules
2008-04-06T16:55:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	thanks
2008-04-06T17:16:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	didnt work btw.
2008-04-06T17:16:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	the module was not loaded at boot
2008-04-06T17:25:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	does ubuntu try to load the module?
2008-04-06T17:26:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	how can i find out?
2008-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	i get this in my syslog
2008-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	nvidia module license 'NVIDIA' taints kernel
2008-04-06T19:06:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	then it should be loaded...
2008-04-06T19:06:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	but it isnt.
2008-04-06T19:07:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	maybe there's some error after it? If lsmod doesn't tell you, the module is loaded, then there's something wrong with the module, I guess
2008-04-06T19:07:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	its trying to load wrong version, dunno whereit comes up with it
2008-04-06T19:09:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	then go search for it en eliminate it (preferably with apt) ;)
2008-04-06T19:10:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	i dont get this doing "locate nvidia.ko" finds only one single nvidia.ko
2008-04-06T19:11:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	having "nvidia" in /etc/modules produces that error about wrong version, doing "modprobe -i nvidia" loads the correct version
2008-04-06T19:11:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	yeah done that
2008-04-06T19:12:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	maybe you should update the initrd, but that's just a guess... Try reinstall the nvidia-drivers?
2008-04-06T19:13:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	jesus, i've been isntalling and unistalling nvidia drivers for a day now
2008-04-06T19:13:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	I'm just here for an hour now...
2008-04-06T19:14:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	ok :)
2008-04-06T19:14:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	i just dont get how i can find a single .ko in the system but yet it comes up with two different versions...
2008-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	Tatanka	ensi	my last guess: sudo update-initramfs -c -k all (and/or just check if nvidia.ko is in the initrd somewhere)
2008-04-06T19:30:00.000Z	ensi	Tatanka	how do i check the initrd?
