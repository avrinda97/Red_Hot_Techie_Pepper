2007-03-30T12:05:00.000Z	kashogi		from my linux to windows machine
2007-03-30T12:05:00.000Z	kashogi		i host the ssh in my ubuntu
2007-03-30T12:06:00.000Z	kashogi		i dont understand
2007-03-30T12:07:00.000Z	kashogi		if i am trying to access my ubuntu computer from windows
2007-03-30T12:07:00.000Z	kashogi		which is destination and target
2007-03-30T12:07:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	that's not what you said... twice now.
2007-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	so, you meant connect locally /from/ your windows machine then, right?
2007-03-30T12:05:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	the destination machine has to be running an ssh server. If you're going /from/ Linux /to/ Windows, the Windows machine needs an ssh server.
2007-03-30T12:06:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	then you can't ssh from ubuntu into Windows. It doesn't work that way. The server is on the destination, always.
2007-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	to be perfectly clear, you are on your Windows machine, and you want to access a remote shell to your Linux box, right?
2007-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	how long do you take to type your login, password information?
2007-03-30T12:15:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	it does this every time?
2007-03-30T12:16:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	at what point does it do this? after you enter the password? does it just sit there for a while, or does something else happen?
2007-03-30T12:17:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	can you also ping your windows box from your linux box?
2007-03-30T12:20:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	and that doesn't ping: that means it sent a ping, but didn't get an answer.
2007-03-30T12:20:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	wait, you said the Linux box was 192.168.0.100. What's your Windows box?
2007-03-30T12:22:00.000Z	micahcowan	kashogi	in that case, you shouldn't have been using 192.168.0.100 as the hostname from winscp.
