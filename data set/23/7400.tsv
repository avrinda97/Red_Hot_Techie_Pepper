2006-03-05T07:11:00.000Z	Syco54645		can anyone help me with setting up xorg with the nvidia drivers?  i try to run 1280x1024 and it just wont work, but before i use the nvidia drivers it works fine in that resolution
2006-03-05T07:13:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	pastebin your xorg.conf file
2006-03-05T07:15:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	http://pastebin.com/575926
2006-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
2006-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	monitorrange: 31-70, 55-120
2006-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	replace it with this: http://pastebin.com/575934
2006-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	your monitor rates were really weird
2006-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	well i will go and try this right now, if it doesnt work i will be back... if it does i will again be back (to thank you of course)
2006-03-05T07:20:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	see you soon :)
2006-03-05T07:26:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	well at least x got up again with the new config.  when at gdm the screen was too large for the monitor so it decided to scroll.  now in gnome my resolution is 1280x960.  this the the problem that i always have when using the nvidia drives.... what is up with them?
2006-03-05T07:28:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	sys>pref>screen res.
2006-03-05T07:28:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	can you choose 1280x1024?
2006-03-05T07:28:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	i did have it working once with the nvidia drivers.  but unfortunately i was on gentoo and then the drive crashed
2006-03-05T07:28:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	no i cannot.
2006-03-05T07:29:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	having an ati card ... i'm deferring to nvidia owners. sorry. :-/
2006-03-05T07:29:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	well thankyou for the help.  i just dont understand what this drivers problem is
2006-03-05T07:30:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	now worries.  good luck
2006-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	well i know that i am not in the minority because a search for the problem on google will return alot of results
2006-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	would this line help at all do you think? Modeline "1280x1024" 109.62  1280 1336 1472 1720  1024 1024 1026 1062
2006-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	that's your modelin?  yes.  that is weird
2006-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	it should be Modeline "res" "res" "res"
2006-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	Syco54645	brenner	well no i just used an online modeline generator.  i am shooting in the dark when it comes to x
2006-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	brenner	Syco54645	actually the modeline should follow the format in here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
