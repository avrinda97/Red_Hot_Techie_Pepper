2011-02-03T16:54:00.000Z	sanmugam		i have already used gtk-recordmydesktop,xvidcamp but these are simple
2011-02-03T16:54:00.000Z	sanmugam		will anybody tell?

2011-02-03T16:56:00.000Z	sanmugam		bazhang:yes
2011-02-03T16:56:00.000Z	sanmugam		is it satisfies those features?
2011-02-03T16:58:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	i have used wink before, i think it will be what you need
2011-02-03T17:08:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	Will you tell where i can download the wink package?
2011-02-03T17:09:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	http://www.debugmode.com/wink/download.htm
2011-02-03T17:17:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	in that folder there is a installer.sh how to i run it?
2011-02-03T17:18:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	?
2011-02-03T17:19:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	hmm...i guess you chmod +x installer.sh, then ./installer.sh (i don't know for sure, i only used the windows version of wink)
2011-02-03T17:22:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	we can run the sh file using sh installer.sh
2011-02-03T17:23:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	that works too
2011-02-03T17:23:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	but it needs two more lib dependencies. it is not found in the repositories
2011-02-03T17:24:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	libstdc++.so.5 libexpat.so.0 these are the packages are needed but it is not found in repositries how can i add it?
2011-02-03T17:25:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	i don't know mate, sorry
2011-02-03T17:26:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	its ok ya thanks for your support
2011-02-03T17:26:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	good luck ;-) (wink)
2011-02-03T17:28:00.000Z	sanmugam	bc81	ha ha...
2011-02-03T17:29:00.000Z	bc81	sanmugam	i think you can search debian repos for the packages:  http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libstdc%2B%2B5  and the like
