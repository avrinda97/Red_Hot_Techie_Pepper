2008-10-12T09:51:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		can someone help me sort our my external HDD so that it mounts automatically
2008-10-12T09:52:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/ -ah for the uuid then add that to /etc/fstab with appropriate mount point and options
2008-10-12T09:54:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	why is it so complicated?
2008-10-12T09:55:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	you asked the question the wrong way
2008-10-12T09:55:00.000Z	chaddy		it's not complicated really, it's just a series of simple steps
2008-10-12T09:55:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	and how should I have asked it?
2008-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	chaddy		well, I don't know if you want it to automount at boot, which I answered, or if you want it to automount on insertion, for a start
2008-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	it was doing all of the above and then just stopped doing it ...
2008-10-12T09:57:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	when things seem complicated it's often a good time to have a wee rest till it all seems simple again
2008-10-12T09:57:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	: ha ... thanks ...
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		anyone know how I can easily restore the default settings for my external hdd (usb) ?
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	you could try rebooting and see if it gets better
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	chaddy		it's dirty but it solves a lot of stuff
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	chaddy		sometimes
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	: nope ... does nto help
2008-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		where is fstab located?
2008-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	plug it in then run dmesg|tail, see if there is anything registering
2008-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	chaddy		it might be broken
2008-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	chaddy		 /etc/fstab
2008-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	chaddy	its not broken becasue it mounts when I double-click the hdd icon in Nautilus
2008-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	chaddy		getting an hour out of that old a battery is pretty good going
2008-10-12T10:02:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		anyone?
2008-10-12T10:03:00.000Z	chaddy	zetheroo-ubuntu	this is probably worth a look: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-353412.html
