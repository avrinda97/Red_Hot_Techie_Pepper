2006-06-02T10:18:00.000Z	snoops		my main drive is a sata one..I also have a IDE connected..could it be possible that grub installed itself into the IDE drive's mbr rather than the sata drives?
2006-06-02T10:18:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	maybe.. you can use a boot cd to get into ubuntu so you can toss grub on it
2006-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	I use UBCD for booting into partitions
2006-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	hmm
2006-06-02T10:20:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	here's a question.. the XP partition is set to the boot partition for that drive
2006-06-02T10:21:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	you mean the flag is set for boot?
2006-06-02T10:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	that shouldn't matter
2006-06-02T10:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	whatever the flag is set too
2006-06-02T10:23:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	doesn't the boot partition have to be where grub resides?
2006-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	you have a seperate partion for /boot?
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	yep I do
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	ah, I did the same thing for a while
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	might be able to get a grub binary and install it that way
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	so am I correct in saying if I have a /boot partition that, that partiton needs to be falled as boot?
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	yeah I'm trying to work out WHY ubuntu install doesn't work
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	grub worked fine for me
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	not sure why... it didn't.. for you..
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	maybe you didn't tell it that you loved it
2006-06-27T08:09:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	ah that sucks
2006-06-27T09:08:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	I don't think you need the bs, I didn't use it and I copy isos all the time
2006-07-04T09:53:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	why do you need to switch back and forth?
2006-07-04T09:54:00.000Z	snoops	NickGarvey	because everyone else doesn't use dvorak
2006-07-04T09:54:00.000Z	NickGarvey	snoops	so...?
