2009-08-08T21:38:00.000Z	GPL		what's the diff. between VirtualBox OSE and VBoxGtk ???
2009-08-08T21:39:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	AFAIK, the official VirtualBox GUI is Qt-based, which some dislike. VBoxGtk is an alternate GUI written in Python/GTK.
2009-08-08T21:39:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	: which one is recommended, and more supportive ?
2009-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	VBoxGtk is just an alternate interface to VirtualBox.
2009-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	I'd recommend the one that comes with VirtualBox.
2009-08-20T21:39:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	netsh winsock reset, actually -- but Linux does not have anything evenremotely similar.
2009-08-20T21:40:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	: that command is for windows.
2009-08-20T21:41:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	I know, used it a few times.
2009-08-20T21:48:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	I don't think Linux has "LSP"...
2009-08-23T17:54:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	Do you have Emerald installed? (It's kinda not developed anymore, I think.)
2009-08-23T17:54:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	yeah i ve Emerald Theme Manager Installed .
2009-08-23T19:22:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	Are you using GNOME?
2009-08-23T19:22:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	Yeah.
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	Open compizconfig-settings-manager, "Window decorator", should be there.
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	i uninstalled compizconfig-settings-manager,
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	Then install it again?
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	using that, i couldnt move my windows :(
2009-08-23T19:24:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	compizconfig-settings-manager is just a settings manager, nothing else
2009-08-23T19:24:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	: okay, installing it.
2009-08-25T23:08:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	There are a few reasons to doubt that.
2009-08-25T23:09:00.000Z	GPL	grawity	he just needed a bit of guidance, i think, see now he is on his way.
2009-08-25T23:09:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	A person with the word "tits" in the nick, asking about Office 2008 (the latest is 2007), and using mIRC?
2009-08-25T23:10:00.000Z	grawity	GPL	I'm helpful, but after helping in #ubuntu for a few weeks, I have a very sensitive troll-o-meter .
