2011-10-17T20:13:00.000Z	sburwood1		Anyone wanna help me fix Thunderbird?  I've looked around for a solution to the "Thunderbird already running" problem, to no avail.  I have 11.10 in 64 bit
2011-10-17T20:13:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	Do ps -A to find out it's pid, then kill it with -9 and retry opening it
2011-10-17T20:14:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	The problem is that, when I look in System Monitor, there is no presence of either thunderbird nor thunderbird-bin
2011-10-17T20:14:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	run ps -A | grep thunderbird
2011-10-17T20:16:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	I just did ... and it came back with nothing
2011-10-17T20:17:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	So it tells me that it is running when I try to start it, but it is nowhere
2011-10-17T20:18:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	I'm gonna walk the dog, but I hope you'll be able to find a solution when I get back.  I would appreciate it, in any case
2011-10-17T21:10:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	Any ideas during my absence?
2011-10-17T21:12:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	Thunderbird telling me that it is already running  when I try to start it
2011-10-17T21:12:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	oh I remember now. Is it all the time, i.e. does it happen the first time you open it after booting?
2011-10-17T21:13:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	It started happening during the last days of 11.04 and continues to happen with 11.10
2011-10-17T21:13:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	Hmm, in that case it could be due to a recent update to Thunderbird. If your reboot and try to open it, does it run fine?
2011-10-17T21:13:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	I profited from the fact that, on the EEEPC, I didn't have the problem.  Today the EEEPC went for repairs
2011-10-17T21:14:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	No
2011-10-17T21:14:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	Someone suggested that I do something to a mozilla file or directory
2011-10-17T21:15:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	I really don't know how to help you, unless the problem is another user (root) having some issue with starting Thunderbird on boot or something, which it shouldn't. You could try uninstalling thunderbird and removing your settings for it then reinstalling and reconfiguring it.
2011-10-17T21:16:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	Does that mean deleting ~/.mozilla or ~/.thunderbird?
2011-10-17T21:17:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	depends where its settings are stored. Firefox settings are also stored in ~/.mozilla so you may want to be careful with what you delete.
2011-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	But deleting ~/.thunderbird is safe?
2011-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	Back it up first just in case you need to get some stored emails or something like that out of it later
2011-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	But that won't hurt Firefox or something else?  All I risk to lose is mails that are on the system?
2011-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	sburwood1	Polah	Thanks.  Also arghx
2011-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	Polah	sburwood1	No. Firefox settings are storied in ~/.mozilla. You will lose your mail if you delete it without backing up and you've deleted the mail from your mail server.
