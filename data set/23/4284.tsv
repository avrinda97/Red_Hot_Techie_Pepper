2008-02-25T09:31:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	you have libdvdcss2 installed? www.medibuntu.org has that for you
2008-02-27T13:41:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	what ubuntu?
2008-02-27T13:48:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	apt-get can't find it
2008-02-27T13:48:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-02-27T13:52:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	do I have to log out then back in after changing the effects?
2008-02-27T13:52:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	alt f2 compiz --replace
2008-02-27T13:54:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	then check if you have the 3d driver for your card also check appearances and set it to custom/advanced
2008-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	aiglx is not very good with ati drivers
2008-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	Idont have ati (nvidia) but some of the really smart folks here do--they should be in early am
2008-02-27T13:58:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	I basicaly wanna see how in depth I can go with ubuntu to pass it off as a 100% Viable alternative to windows to non-gamers
2008-02-27T13:59:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	for non gamers (and even gamers, except for dx10) it is already viable ;]
2008-02-27T14:00:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	can it run games such as Hl2 without horrible preformance hits?
2008-02-27T14:01:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	you check wine appdb for what they can do--pretty amazing list
2008-04-26T08:31:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	no not really
2008-04-26T08:31:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	what I mean is it installs under windows' partition and doesn't actually install to the MBR right?
2008-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	that sounds about right (not sure of the *exact* details) but not a VM
2008-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	cool, Only reason I didn't switch this system over is because I do heavy gaming
2008-06-21T10:28:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	I think one part of vido's help actually is useful to the issue... just sugar coated with food
2008-06-22T10:54:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	please take chat elsewhere
2008-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	NetEcho	bazhang	sorry it was a hybrid chat between ubuntu swapfile and other things
2008-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	thanks
2008-06-22T11:00:00.000Z	bazhang	NetEcho	yes
