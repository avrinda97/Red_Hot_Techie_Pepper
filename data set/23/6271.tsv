2008-01-28T22:42:00.000Z	shift1		is it bad to use "restricted drivers" for my Broadcom built-in wireless card
2008-01-28T22:43:00.000Z	shift1		i mean can it mess up my system, or really ruin how ubutnu runs like the "pop-up" claims?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		how can i make it so i dont have to use password to sign-in to ubuntu every time i login, right now im logging in as "home" is that the higest user? it wont let me login as root.. or if you can how do you do that?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		uhuh
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay well, how can i make it so "home" does not keep asking for a password each time i boot, or every time i try to install an app.
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay thats fine, thank you. i just want to remove the password off "home"
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	phenom	shift1	No you do not.,
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	phenom	shift1	Id hom your only user on thtta system?
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	phenom		blah
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	shift1		yes in the list of "users" i have "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	phenom		Is home your only user on that system? You need a password protected sudo user.
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		well i see "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		oh okay
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		thats fine then
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		okay well would removing LOGIN password be bad?
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	shift1	adelie	can i message u?
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	phenom		removing passwords from any user is bad..
2008-01-28T22:49:00.000Z	phenom		If you remove a password of a regular user, people could still connect to your box with that user. might now have root access, but enough to get it.
2008-01-28T22:49:00.000Z	phenom	shift1	I personally wouldn't even dream about not using passes.
