2010-07-25T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kifo	 and dont use the 'close button' ever. :) use exit command..
2010-07-25T08:22:00.000Z	kifo	Dr_Willis	that requires me to leave the terminal open
2010-07-25T08:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kifo	 & and exit wont
2010-07-25T08:22:00.000Z	kifo	Dr_Willis	yes, it will, because as long as transmission is running, it wont complete and go to exit
2010-07-25T08:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kifo	 i run gui apps with & and exit all the time.
2010-07-25T08:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kifo	 i just did 'transmission &'  then 'exit' here.. transmission still ruinning
2010-07-25T08:23:00.000Z	kifo	Dr_Willis	doesnt work for me
