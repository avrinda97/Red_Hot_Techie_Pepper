2005-04-11T11:40:00.000Z	mpt		er, sorry, I meant pon.
2005-04-11T11:41:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	maybe a grep /proc/pci?
2005-04-11T11:43:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	Sorry, find the settings how? By opening the case? :-)
2005-04-11T11:44:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	um maybe in device settings
2005-04-11T11:44:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	i mean manager
2005-04-11T11:46:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	There's a /proc/bus/pci/devices which is full of hex numbers
2005-04-11T11:47:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	... and /proc/bus/pci/00 and /proc/bus/pic/01 which contain binary files
2005-04-11T11:48:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	hmm, sorry, it was a long time ago when i had to find my serial port for my modem
2005-04-11T11:48:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	it turned out to be ttyS14
2005-04-11T11:49:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	S14? yeow, I hope mine's not S87 or something, or trial-and-error could take a while
2005-04-11T11:50:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	yeah, if thats your last resort, as long as you know its not a winmodem
2005-04-11T11:51:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	So in Device Manager will the modem be inside "PCI Bridge"? I see the wireless card in there, and the ethernet card, and and "unknown device"
2005-04-11T11:53:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	try a sudo cat /proc/tty
2005-04-11T11:54:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	that's a directory containing driver/, drivers, ldisc/, and ldiscs
2005-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	sorry, um did you ever try a cat /proc/pci
2005-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	my comp doesnt have anything in the pci slots
2005-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	/proc/pci doesn't exist
2005-04-11T11:56:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	ubuntu must be newer than my linux 2.2 router
2005-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	Quite possibly :-)
2005-04-11T11:59:00.000Z	Akira	mpt	maybe a cat /proc/devices
2005-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	Well, here's about 20 character devices and half a dozen block devices
2005-04-11T12:02:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	None of them look obviously modem-related, though what's obvious to others isn't always obvious to me
2005-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	mpt	Akira	Thanks for your help anyway, I'll keep googling
