2005-04-19T12:29:00.000Z	topyli		now that time is nigh, i've been hit by a _new_ bug. the weather applet doesn't work and i have to actually look out the window :)
2005-04-19T12:29:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	I have that same problem.  :(
2005-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	is it raining there? just debugging :)
2005-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	it actually was
2005-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	It went down around that point, too.
2005-04-19T12:31:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	so let's file a bug: gnome-weather fails when it's raining =)
2005-04-19T12:31:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	cool, show me where to put my two cents
2005-04-19T12:32:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	the ubuntu bugzilla of course :)
2005-04-19T12:32:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	probably typos in the locations strings or something
2005-04-19T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	where are you at?
2005-04-19T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	get christian marillat's mplayer
2005-04-19T12:33:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	Montreal, I use the Dorval area
2005-04-19T12:34:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	this is helsinki/malmi, finland
2005-04-19T12:34:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	I would think that my custom compiled mplayer is better than his generic one O.o
2005-04-19T12:35:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	certainly, if you've already built it
2005-04-19T13:10:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	please note that these drunken imbeciles build operating systems for you
2005-04-19T13:10:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	lol not you guys
2005-04-19T13:11:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	excactly, not me :)
2005-04-19T13:11:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	I was just hauled away to watch trippy winamp plugins with my friends
2005-04-19T13:11:00.000Z	topyli	sataere	oh, i thought you were referring to the gdm theme we were discussing :)
2005-04-19T13:12:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	nono.  Afterall, who could have thought of the concept of linked lists except someone under the influence of heavy inebriation.
2005-04-19T13:13:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	drunken-ness
2005-04-19T13:13:00.000Z	sataere	topyli	yeah, what Flonne said
