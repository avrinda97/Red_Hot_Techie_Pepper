2005-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	TraceGreen		Hello, Can anyone tell me how Ubuntu add bootsplash to LiveCD?
2005-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	you want to add a bootsplash to your installed Ubuntu?
2005-08-28T07:31:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	I want to add it to liveCD
2005-08-28T07:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	:Z
2005-08-28T07:32:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	what do you mean ?
2005-08-28T07:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	bootsplash as in... a GRUB splash?
2005-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	no, i mean i what to add boot splash
2005-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	sorry for my english.
2005-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	usplash? On which part, exactly, do you want the splash to appear?
2005-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	ok, when i boot from knoppix liveCD, it will show many boot message, but like gnoppix, just a progress bar when booting
2005-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	i know gnoppix is based on ubuntu
2005-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	doesn't the LiveCD already have one?
2005-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	knoppix just show splash in the middle of booting, not whole process
2005-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	as i know
2005-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	seems to me like any changes there would have to be made to the LiveCD themselves... not some setting once you're on.
2005-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	do you mean i should customer the liveCD?
2005-08-28T07:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	I'm saying you'd probably have to, for that change. Still not entirely sure what you're trying to get... I was sure Ubuntu had a Splash Screen while it loads modules etc
2005-08-28T07:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	though, as I recall, it was ugly :P
2005-08-28T07:38:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	when boot ubuntu liveCD, it will show many boot message but no splash
2005-08-28T07:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	perhaps it doesn't then
2005-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	do you gnoppix?
2005-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	TraceGreen	Nope. I don't g* :P
2005-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	TraceGreen	apokryphos	anyway, thanks very much!!
