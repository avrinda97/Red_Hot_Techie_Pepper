2009-05-23T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 compiz has such features - (that i normally disable)
2009-05-23T21:59:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	i forgot to mention "aside from compiz"
2009-06-24T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 it works here. :)
2009-06-24T07:01:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	any other methods? :S
2009-06-24T07:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 no idea..I normally know what video cards i put in my machines.
2009-07-02T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 perhaps the code name for the release.
2009-07-02T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 or the ppa maintainer.
2009-07-02T05:26:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	oh okay.. so it's still firefox 3.5?
2009-07-02T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 i imagine 3.5 will be in the normal repos soon enough
2009-07-02T05:27:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	ok, thanks.. then I guess I'll wait
2009-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 Mail Transfer Agent. But i doubt if thats causeing any slow down. You could disable that service i guess.
2009-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	it stays to "Starting MTA" for how many minutes then continues
2009-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	how may i disable it?
2009-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 check the upstart docs, on how to enable/disable services.. i forget the 'proper' way to do it now a days.
2009-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 you may want to rephrase that?
2009-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 most linux apps are fairly light :) compared to windows apps... heh.
2009-08-19T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 check the 'lsbytesum' script at  the following....
2009-08-19T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 check that 'lsbytesum' script i posted - it prints out the size in MB. thats it. :)
2009-08-19T06:57:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Dr_Willis	cool, 'awk' B-)
2009-08-19T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 i use that as part of my prompt. Got it from the bash prompt howto i think
2009-09-23T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 i never was able to get bootlogd to actually work.
2009-09-23T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz	 im not sure it even works at all.
