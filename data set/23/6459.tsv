2006-04-06T07:37:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	if that doesnt work you can run samba
2006-04-06T07:38:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	can you also do a printscreen of your desktop with the error showing and paste it to the pastebin?
2006-04-06T07:44:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	is the printer set up on the ubuntu machine?
2006-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	are you using cups?
2006-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	can you access cups from the laptop?
2006-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	^^see last post
2006-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	i just downloaded a screenshot of my xp error that i am getting.  when u get a chance can u check it out please?
2006-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	what is the address of it?
2006-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	by default xp sends out passod encrypted and CUPS doesnt like it
2006-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	by default xp sends out passwords encrypted and CUPS doesnt like it
2006-04-06T08:57:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	i think so... can u give me specific instructions on browsing for the printer in cups??
2006-04-06T08:59:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	it already lists my printer in there.  should i add the printer again using localhosts:631?
2006-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	when i press one of the buttons on localhost:631 it asks for a username and password.  how do i setup a username and password?

2006-04-06T09:25:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	still a bit confused.  i already have a username set.  do i just need to create a group for my printer and allow my username to be used for it?
2006-04-06T09:27:00.000Z	rmlightning	arrick	can i name the group anything i want?  such as printer?
2006-04-06T09:33:00.000Z	arrick	rmlightning	nickrud you can add yourself to the lpadmin, I've been trying to reember the name of the group but thats it
