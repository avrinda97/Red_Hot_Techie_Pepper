2006-05-05T08:06:00.000Z	Apostle^		xubutnu is popular yes.
2006-05-05T08:07:00.000Z	Apostle^		you don't really need to convert mdf to iso though.
2006-05-05T08:07:00.000Z	Apostle^		since mdf is iso9660
2006-05-05T08:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 it is?
2006-05-27T10:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	was that pointed towards me?
2006-05-27T10:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	and i'm on breezy.
2006-05-27T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 yea.. ya could just start a 2nd x session.. but its a bit of an annoyance
2006-05-27T10:33:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	can you explain that to me, and would it hurt performance?
2006-05-27T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 you would be running 2 instances of X - so of course there would be some loss.
2006-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	i see, right now i have the gnome quick switch applet but it forces me to use gnome on both users
2006-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 in the gnome menus - see if theres a 'login in new session' or somthing similer.
2006-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	just a log out
2006-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 i see a 'new login' in the menus
2006-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	where at?
2006-05-27T10:35:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	yes i see it
2006-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	does that run another X ?
2006-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	then how do i switch between them
2006-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	indeed will try it
2006-05-27T10:40:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	does that new login tool start a new X ?
2006-05-27T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 yes. it should
2006-05-27T10:40:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	ahh, see i don't want to lose any pc performance
2006-05-27T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Apostle^	 got some  thinking to do then..  :P
2006-05-27T10:41:00.000Z	Apostle^	Dr_Willis	well the situation i have now will work i suppose, i just need to try something
