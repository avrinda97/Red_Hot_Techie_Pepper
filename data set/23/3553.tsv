2008-06-24T13:29:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	what sort of icons did you have?
2008-06-24T13:29:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	the usual ones.. text files, trashbin, etc. now nothing is on the desktop it is 100% empty
2008-06-24T13:31:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	they all just suddenly disappeared (the exact cause I cannot recall, I guess it was after some update..)
2008-06-24T13:31:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	well, by default Hardy has no icons on the desktop. But you can add Computer, Home, Network and Trash. As for text files and such, they would have been in the Home folder for your previous user
2008-06-24T13:32:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	but when I dist-upgraded, all the icons stayed in place
2008-06-24T13:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	to add Trash ext. to the Desktop, do an Alt+F2 and run  gconf-editor  , then navigate to  apps - nautilus - desktop
2008-06-24T13:33:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	when hardy came out.. beginning of May. and the disappearance of desktop icons only happened a 2-3 days ago
2008-06-24T13:34:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	ohh, not sure what would have caused that
2008-06-24T13:34:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	I've already tried that, but show desktop has already a tick there
2008-06-24T13:34:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	hmm
2008-06-24T13:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	can you see any contents in a terminal if you type:  ls -al ~/Desktop
2008-06-24T13:36:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	sure I see them there, also see them in Places->Desktop
2008-06-24T13:36:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	very odd
2008-06-24T13:37:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	that is what I told myself.. I hoped that after some restart or upgrade they come back, but they did not :/
2008-06-24T13:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	try changing your wallpaper maybe
2008-06-24T13:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	apart from that, I really have no idea
2008-06-24T13:38:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	the wallpaper is the default hardy one with the bird on it
2008-06-24T13:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	yeah, but it's worth changing just to see if it does change
2008-06-24T13:38:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	ahhhh got it!
2008-06-24T13:39:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	I once again tried the gconf key editor, I've un-ticked the "Show desktop" key, then exited. Then started the app again, ticked the "Swow desktop" key again, and now everything appeared!
2008-06-24T13:40:00.000Z	Hali_303	DistroJockey	thank you for your help!
2008-06-24T13:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	excellent, glad to help
2008-06-24T13:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Hali_303	and you're welcome :)
