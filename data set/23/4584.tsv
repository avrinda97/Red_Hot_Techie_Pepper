2008-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	Marfi		i've seen different versions of an "8 in 1" CD of 8 versions of xp and windows in 1. is there a linux cd like this floating around?
2008-01-06T08:46:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	DVD, perhaps, but not a CD
2008-01-06T08:46:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	look for a Linux Format magazine at your local bookstore
2008-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	bazhang i use ubuntu on a daily basis, and put together an old computer from spare parts. just wanted to see if there was a quick and easy way to mess w/ a few different versions
2008-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	have you tried xubuntu on old hardware?
2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	thats one of the ones on my list. i want to try KDE 4 first, since it is said to run on old hardware
2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	run decently, i should add. =)
2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	sounds like a good plan
2008-01-21T05:57:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	the differences between the drivers are which cards they support
2008-01-21T05:57:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	im using an nvidia 7800
2008-01-21T05:57:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	then check the package details, and use the proper one
2008-01-21T05:58:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	i have enabled them in the restricted driver manager. i just want to know if nvidia-glx-new is the most recent release for the driver, or if there are newer ones
2008-01-21T05:59:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	okay, so by now you understand
2008-01-21T06:00:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	yes. its using the restricted drivers from the package nvidia-glx-new, and didn't know if these are the newest, bleeding edge drivers
2008-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	you have them. I told you...
2008-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	didn't see it, sorry
2008-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	we went through that.  The nvidia-glx-new package is for newer cards.  It's not a newer driver.
2008-01-21T06:05:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	so that is not the newest build of the driver then?
2008-01-21T06:06:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	you're confusing what the name is for.  It's to indicate that it supports the newer cards.  It has nothing to do with how new the drivers are.
2008-01-21T06:07:00.000Z	Marfi	tritium	ah, ok. gotcha there. ;) so how do i install the most recent driver for the card? i know with most drivers and other software for ubuntu, it is the most stable, not the newest
2008-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	if you install something other than the ubuntu packages, keep in mind that we don't support that here.
2009-02-25T08:58:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	it has been made easy
2009-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	tritium	Marfi	you don't need a card unless your current mobo doesnt' have an adequate IGP
