2010-09-10T12:18:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		Howdy all. So, I'm trying to set up a menu item, I've got the icon, the name, and the location but when it launches, it isn't running the same way as if I had clicked to open it. The file in question is the BOINC manager, which I have downloaded manually a while back and am in the middle of work units, otherwise I would probably just use the package provided. Main point being, why isn't it...
2010-09-10T12:18:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		...running normally from the menu item I created, and how do I fix it?
2010-09-10T12:19:00.000Z	Emanon	Spaztic_One	the shortcut you made might not have the same switches on the command as the original check the original with right click properties to see how it calls the target program
2010-09-10T12:20:00.000Z	Emanon		do you have a bluetooth transmitter Noiano?
2010-09-10T12:20:00.000Z	Emanon		like on the computer
2010-09-10T12:20:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Emanon	As far as I can tell it does not have any switches.
2010-09-10T12:21:00.000Z	Emanon		System>Administration>Hardware Drivers Noiano see if it needs a driver
2010-09-10T12:21:00.000Z	Emanon	Spaztic_One	dunno then hope someone can help you
2010-09-10T12:21:00.000Z	Emanon		hmmm maybe the bluetooth module you have is not supported yet
2010-09-10T12:22:00.000Z	Emanon		might consider googleing your model of computer + ubuntu 10.04
2010-09-10T12:22:00.000Z	Emanon		with bluetooth in there somewhere
2010-09-10T12:22:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Emanon	The switches would be in the name,. correct?
2010-09-10T12:23:00.000Z	Emanon	Spaztic_One	they would be in the command
2010-09-10T12:23:00.000Z	Emanon		like wine -s -om -ecommand
2010-09-10T12:23:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		I am not seeing a command.
2010-09-10T12:23:00.000Z	Emanon		sec
2010-09-10T12:25:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Emanon	It is an executable, not a script. Don't know if that changes anything in regards to my question or finding the command.

2010-09-10T12:26:00.000Z	Emanon		right click on your menu and hit "edit menu"
2010-09-10T12:27:00.000Z	Emanon		yea like on your applications menu
2010-09-10T12:27:00.000Z	Emanon		select edit menus then on the right select add menu
2010-09-10T12:27:00.000Z	Emanon		drag it out in the edit menu
2010-09-10T12:29:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Emanon	Oh, of the launcher, not the file itself. Yes, the command is the path and then the file in said path. no switches.
