2008-03-09T05:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	add the medibuntu repos to your sources.list file and use apt or synaptic to get the package you want

2008-04-14T00:47:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	Display options as in screen configuration so far as screen resolution and video card

2008-04-14T00:48:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	are you using the restricted driver ?
2008-04-14T00:49:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	I think it has something to do with me deleting (but making a copy of) the xorg.conf driver a while back in an effort to get my s-video working, I restored the xorg file but this still happens, and no I am not running a restricted driver
2008-04-14T00:50:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	what driver are you running the binary ? if that's the case i dont, know if there is anything you cn do about it , try the restriced, see what happens,  best of luck ,  you can also try researching the problem in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-04-14T00:50:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	or you can maybe try  nvidia-settings
2008-04-14T02:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	nvidia card ? you need the propriatarty driver I beleve
2008-04-14T02:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	fixed what ? sorry busy place , no memory
2008-04-14T02:58:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	I fixed the problem with ubuntu not recognizing my driver on startup
2008-04-14T02:58:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	I used this sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
2008-04-14T02:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	ah , ok
2008-04-14T02:59:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	ya but for S-video I have a nvidia driver as well as an S-video port
2008-04-14T02:59:00.000Z	Flyerfye	Pelo	I also have the cable but I dont know how to get the setting to allow me to use all that to show the contents of my laptop to screen
2008-04-14T03:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Flyerfye	check in the totem prefs , there is a tvout setting maybe that is all you need
