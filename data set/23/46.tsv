2012-10-01T20:25:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	does BIOS recognize them?
2012-10-01T20:26:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	have you tried ubuntu on live-cd and tried to mount hdd there?รง
2012-10-01T20:26:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	it's not a problem, ubuntu should mount ntfs partitions
2012-10-01T20:27:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	ah, the new interface confuses me, there is no upper menu, nor a search option, I didn't evne know how to open console
2012-10-01T20:30:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	the first thing I'd try is to boot from a live-CD and check if Ubuntu see your hdd
2012-10-01T20:30:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	I didn't see a hdd listed in the left menu, there is no upper menu, it just lists 5x office, settings, like 8 things in total
2012-10-01T20:31:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	you should see a cabinet, like an old file storage cabinet on the left menu. There you can mount your hdd
2012-10-01T20:58:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	what does your last post means?
2012-10-01T21:00:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	the installer still does not see the device.
2012-10-01T21:00:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	but did you mount it on ubuntu live?
2012-10-01T21:00:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	no, should I make the partitions via fdisk?
2012-10-01T21:01:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	no. Do you have got free space disk?
2012-10-01T21:01:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	Yes, there is half free
2012-10-01T21:14:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	nice! Thank you for the info, it'd be useful in the future
2012-10-01T21:02:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	it's strange. Anyway, like i'd say, I'd try to mount it on a live cd before. Try Kubuntu, or Fedora
2012-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	I am booting Fedora :)
2012-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	it works via console, I created 2 partitions and I can mount via console
2012-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	OK
2012-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	Are you using the console in Fedora?
2012-10-01T21:06:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	I used console in Ubuntu, it worked fine
2012-10-01T21:07:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	I don't know what might be the problem, but you can try to create a primary partition and a swap partition and check if now the installer see the hdd
2012-10-01T21:12:00.000Z	lgr79	ujjain	OK. Good luck, I can't help you anymore, no more knowledge on my side
2012-10-01T21:13:00.000Z	ujjain	lgr79	I found it, I had to run  sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda
