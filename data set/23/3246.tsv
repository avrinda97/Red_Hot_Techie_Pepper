2009-07-26T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	its a Ralink RT2760 + RT2720
2009-07-26T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	ubuntu is a distrivbution of linux
2009-07-26T06:56:00.000Z	mattwj2002	ActionParsnip	this is true
2009-07-26T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	they are handled by the soutbridge
2009-10-30T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	lucid is in hugely early stages
2010-08-08T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	dont use ubuntu then if its so appauling...
2010-08-08T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	depends on needs, as a first step into linux its great
2010-08-08T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	whats the bug anyhoo?
2010-08-08T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	why do you need vnc? what do you do when you get connected?
2010-08-08T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	sure, but what do you do in the vnc session?
2010-08-08T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	what do you do on the desktop once you get connected via vnc?
2010-08-08T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	if you tell me what you do I may be able to suggest more graceful solutions than VNC
2010-08-08T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	if you are managing torrents (for example) transmission has a web gui
2010-08-08T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	me too but there are much slimmer and sleeker ways to access stuff instead of vnc
2010-08-08T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	its an example as yu havent told me what apps you run on the desktop
2010-08-08T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	setupa shared folder for your files then run the word processor and access the files on the share instead of running vnc
2010-08-08T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	just giving examples how to use lighter options which will run faster
2010-08-08T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	not compared to other solutions
2012-03-10T09:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mattwj2002	nice :) using what app?
