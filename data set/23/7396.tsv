2006-01-03T14:44:00.000Z	lampshade		Hey, I'm building a kinda stereo machine, and although there are command line mp3 players, I want to have playlists, etc, so I figured I was going to install a window manager like XFce, I just wanted to ask the channel for suggestions or better ideas before I go ahead and do this
2006-01-03T14:45:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	dont use xfce.
2006-01-03T14:46:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	just have a script that starts X and xmms. maaaaaybe fluxbox. but you dont really need a WM
2006-01-03T14:46:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	 hmmm that's not a bad idea either.  I forgot about fluxbox
2006-01-03T14:47:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	you want the thinnest wm possible if anything :)
2006-01-03T14:47:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	 how is xmms at things like playlists, library organization, basically, I'm looking for winamp for Linux.  I am also awaiting "SongBird" and am hoping that will be cross platform like Firefox
2006-01-03T14:48:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	XMMS is great for playlists. its also non-DE specific like amarok and rhythmbox
2006-01-03T14:49:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	beep media player is a bit better looking tho.
2006-01-03T14:49:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	also, xmms and bmp both support winamp classic skins. not the modern ones tho :(
2006-01-03T14:51:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	you need universe and multiverse
2006-01-03T14:53:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	thats another option &&
2006-03-07T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	youll need to pass a iwconfig option, but dont remember it...
2006-03-07T08:50:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	I looked through the ifconfig man and I didn't see mode as an option?
2006-04-02T07:20:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	I have that in my sources, but I don't see it with a cache search.  hmm
2006-04-02T07:21:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	its in the dvdshrink package
2006-04-02T07:22:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	?  DVD shrink returns no results for me?  Are there more than one PLF or something?  Just checked in my sources and I do have PLF repos in there :-/
2006-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	wow, I have no idea why they aren't in my repo if they are in yours, I do have the PLF in my sources and I did apt-get update, I have no idea but it doesn't show up for me in an apt-cache search at all
2006-04-02T07:28:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	i get it... look for dvdshrink
2006-04-02T07:30:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	hahah I tried that, and other permutations of the name, got no results back ??  That's really weird.  I mean I can see the plf source in my sources list
2006-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	Toma-	lampshade	whats the exact line for plf u have?
2006-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/ breezy free non-free  which is what is on their site too  I also have the source one right under it
2006-04-02T07:32:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	their site also says it is in the repo.... :-/  I'm as puzzled as you
2006-04-02T07:36:00.000Z	lampshade	Toma-	under closer inspection of the apt-get update output, I noticed that it is saying ign:  for the plf sources,  why is it being ignored??
