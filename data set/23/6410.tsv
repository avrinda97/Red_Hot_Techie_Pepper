2006-04-19T07:57:00.000Z	orbin	Hoochie	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-04-19T07:59:00.000Z	orbin	Hoochie	yes do that first to open up a file you need to edit.  scroll down to Section "Device" then change the driver to "vesa".  exit by pressing ctrl+x, say yes to save, *then* type startx when you get back to the prompt
2006-04-19T08:00:00.000Z	orbin	Hoochie	hopefully you'll get a gui after you do that.
