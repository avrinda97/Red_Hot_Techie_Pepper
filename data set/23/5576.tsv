2007-11-29T18:13:00.000Z	kikokos	infidel	it`s strange cause i used gammu and it doesnt see phone, but when i put cable to usb before start computer, when booting process is ending and KDE starts sudennly KDE is hang up
2007-11-29T18:14:00.000Z	infidel	kikokos	sounds like a configuration issue
2007-11-29T18:14:00.000Z	kikokos	infidel	it`s little bit hard :) cause i`ve moved to new hause (village house) and there is no another computer (just my) and i have no internet ,uff
