2011-01-01T17:53:00.000Z	toiletduck		was wondering if anyone here has any knowledge of WUBI???
2011-01-01T17:54:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	there's probably some ppl in here that do the wubi
2011-01-01T17:54:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	installing?
2011-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	is there some reason you don't want to install the normal way?
2011-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	toiletduck	wyclif	i dont want to install at all
2011-01-01T17:57:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	are you going to set up dual boot?
2011-01-01T17:57:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	why not just reformat with Ubuntu and install it w/o wubi?
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	toiletduck	wyclif	i dont want to install ubuntu
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	OK
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	you want to get rid of the Ubuntu boot option
2011-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	listen to what Linux_Galore is saying. I think it's just a matter of editing your grub2 config file
2011-01-01T18:03:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	boot from your Windows CD if you have one, and enter console mode
2011-01-01T18:03:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	Recovery Console, when it asks if you want to boot Windows or not
2011-01-01T18:04:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	Press "R" when it asks you whether you wanna install Windows
2011-01-01T18:05:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	when you get to the console, if you enter "fixmbr" it will delete GRUB and then yu should be able to boot Win
2011-01-01T18:05:00.000Z	toiletduck	wyclif	ive tried that before many times
2011-01-01T18:05:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	but you have built-in recovery, right? on the netbook?
2011-01-01T18:07:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	can you access a DOS prompt?
2011-01-01T18:09:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	have you tried running fdisk/ MBR?
2011-01-01T18:10:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	you'd need to use a boot disk for that, but I forgot you already said this is a netbook =(
2011-01-01T18:11:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	there is another way
2011-01-01T18:12:00.000Z	toiletduck	wyclif	can you pm me? its so confusing in this channel
2011-01-01T18:12:00.000Z	wyclif	toiletduck	you can still use GRUB to boot Windows by telling it to load your NTLoader
