2010-08-29T02:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dominicdinada	have you been able to determine what the udp packets contain? Like maybe something on your system is _requesting_ them?
2010-08-29T02:42:00.000Z	dominicdinada	greezmunkey	no actually I didnt go that far as i looked for a commandline packet capture and i know wireshark is gui i searched and didnt see the cli
