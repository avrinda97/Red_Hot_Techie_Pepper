2010-09-12T03:12:00.000Z	elijah		Can I mount DMG files directly inside Linux? I am trying to mount DMG files which are actually FAT32 from my camcorder, they esixt on a HFSPLUS partiion on an external drive.
2010-09-12T03:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 i think it may be able to read hfs, but im not sure about hfs+
2010-09-12T03:16:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	I can view the HFS partition just fine but when I try to mount the DMG file using mount -t hfsplus -o loop <filename.dmg> I get an error "wrong fs type..."
2010-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 if you mean your apt 'cache'   - apt-get autoclean cleans the cache.. remove - will remove packlages flagged as not needed any more
2010-09-13T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 both sould be 'safe' commands
2010-09-13T07:01:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	thx
2010-09-13T07:02:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	Do you know where they are stored, so I can see how much space they are using?
2010-12-19T02:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 just chmod +x winetricks then use ./winetricks whatever
2010-12-19T02:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 and if its in /usr/bin/winetricks you dont 'sh winetricks' you would 'winetricks whatver'
2010-12-19T02:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	i  always keep the latest copy of winetricks in my .wine/ dir.
2010-12-19T02:05:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	I was just following instructions at http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks
2010-12-19T02:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 you missunderstood them
2010-12-19T02:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 they are for when you download winetricks and its int he current dir
2010-12-19T02:06:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	Okay, I downloaded wine through the package manager
2010-12-19T02:06:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	when i do the chmod +x winetricks I get 'chmod: cannot access `winetricks': No such file or directory'
2012-06-11T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 time to check some bash guides on 'output redirection'
2012-06-11T17:06:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	ahh, gotcha, basically files vs commands
2012-06-11T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 theres most likely a way to do it in the ccsm plugins. ive used to do things that way. but been a long time.
2012-06-11T17:15:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	what do you do know instead?
2012-06-11T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 err.. middle click in the title bar.. does send it to back here...
2012-06-11T17:15:00.000Z	elijah	Dr_Willis	gotcha,
2012-06-11T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 ccsm has more settings then i can discover. it has a search feature that may do it.
2012-08-08T20:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elijah	 not installed by default
