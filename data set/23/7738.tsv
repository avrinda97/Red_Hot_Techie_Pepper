2005-06-08T07:05:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	you mean make a file image of the partition?
2005-06-08T07:08:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	do you mean run windows in a virtual machine inside linux?
2005-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	check qemu
2005-06-08T07:16:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	a little tip, if you type a person's full nick then they're less likeley to miss questions from you :)
2005-06-08T07:18:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	there's an AOL dialer specifically for linux out there somewhere
2005-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	I think you'll be very lucky getting it to work through any kind of emulation
2005-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	see http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialAOL.html
2005-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	then I've no ideas for you other than discouraging you from wasting time with trying to use emulation. I've not heard of that working... best option is an old machine acting as a proxy for you
2005-06-08T07:25:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	aah, I'm with you now, you've had it working as far as it's meant to. It just gives a connection.
2005-06-08T07:26:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	emulation of the AOL software set to connect through tcp/ip is now a viable option
2005-06-08T07:27:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	firefox worked?
2005-06-08T07:28:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	did it connect to the internet for you?
2005-06-08T07:29:00.000Z	anto9us	Yoda_Sabre	you said it connected and you used firefox didn't you?
