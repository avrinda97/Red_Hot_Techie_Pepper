2007-09-16T06:25:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon		Can anyone please help me resize a partition?
2007-09-16T06:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	you cna use partition software like gparted to do it for you
2007-09-16T06:27:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	I can't get gparted to work. When I boot normally the resize option is grayed out. When I boot from the live cd it says I need to check for errors.
2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	hmmm load from the live CD choosing the first option that uses gui and it might be your downlaod or disk is all messed up
2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	My download and/or disk are not messed up.
2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	ok dont go defensive on me i forgot to type "might" on my last post
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	Sorry... I didn't mean to. I'm positive my HD and cd are both working fine though.
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	kk what is the error you get with gparted and did you check the md5 checksum? but why cant you use it
2007-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	So... What do I do?
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	The... md5 sum? Hang on I'll boot from livecd and tell you the error.
2007-09-16T06:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	kk
2007-09-16T06:38:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	 Ok, in tdetails it says "check filesystem on sda2 for errors and (if possible) fix them". When I expand that, it says "e2fsck -f -y -v /dev/sda2". When I expand that, I get "sda2 mounted" (I just unmounted it) and "e2fsck: 1140 WIP (14 Nov 2006) \n e2fsck Cannot continue, aborting"
2007-09-16T06:39:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	 How *do* I check for errors in ubuntu?
2007-09-16T06:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	sda2 would be ur linux partition if your using one hd and you have to use fdisk command
2007-09-16T06:40:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	oops fck not fdisk
2007-09-16T06:40:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	I tried doing it again, didn't give me the error right away this time. It says it's reszizing... If this doesn't work I'll try doing what you said.
2007-09-16T06:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	check this out http://www.adminschoice.com/docs/fsck.htm
2007-09-16T06:45:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	I don't like the look of this. Livecd's gparted resized my sda2 from 15 gb to 80 gb... But now I have 71 gb full.
2007-09-16T06:46:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ar_Pharazon	kk do you know what you are doing with gparted, i dint read the manual the first time and things went smoothly
2007-09-16T06:46:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	I'm getting the disk usage analyzer thing to scan it.
2007-09-16T06:47:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	Know as in? I know I'm resizing a partition, so that the files aren't touched and the unused hd space is added to that partition as free space.
2007-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	Oh God. This is just great... Disk usage analyzer shows my disk size as 15 gb. When I go to computer, and right click filesystem then do properties, it says the size is "unknown".
2007-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	Pirate_Hunter	 I really don't like the look of this.
