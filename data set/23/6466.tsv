2006-04-06T11:55:00.000Z	Riko		Is there anything I have to do to get my torrent downloads running faster? Normally I used to get like 100+ kb/sec on my win machine, and on ubuntu I only get like 5-10kb/sec
2006-04-06T11:56:00.000Z	healot	Riko	did you setup the upload/download/connection limit?
2006-04-06T11:57:00.000Z	Riko	healot	 yea it's still going uber slow
2006-04-06T11:58:00.000Z	healot	Riko	downloading the same file? or a different file?
