2008-11-20T16:08:00.000Z	shubbar		i updated nvidia driver to 177.82, but it's not working
2008-11-20T16:09:00.000Z	shubbar		nvidia driver 177.80 was working - but without acceleration
2008-11-20T16:09:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	those drivers are not supported
2008-11-20T16:10:00.000Z	shubbar	ikonia	i m stuck with the hardware! what can i use?
2008-11-20T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	what card is it
2008-11-20T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	you sure thats the right model number ?
2008-11-20T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	then it's supported by the .80 driver
2008-11-20T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	you didn't need to go to the .82
2008-11-20T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	are you using 7.10 now?
2008-11-20T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	so don't reference 7.10
2008-11-20T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	you just needed to use the ubuntu packaged drivers (.77 - I think) and it would work
2008-11-20T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	shubbar	don't need to use envy or any nvidia.com drivers
2008-11-20T16:18:00.000Z	shubbar	ikonia	Hardware Drivers says "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
