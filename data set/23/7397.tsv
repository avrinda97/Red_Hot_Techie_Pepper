2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	Luke		I'm setting up a box vista box as a security camera server... how can I access that via ubuntu? anyone know any good solutions to this?
2007-12-05T11:50:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	rdesktop?
2007-12-05T11:51:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	looking into it
2007-12-05T11:52:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	your other option would be VNC, but I'd recommend rdesktop over that if it's windows XP or vista.
2007-12-05T11:52:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	yea i tried VNC and it's not what I was looking for
2007-12-05T11:53:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	rdesktop either spawns a virtual session or connects to the desktop (Depending on how windows is set up).  It can do whatever resolution you want.
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	basically someone else may be using the vista computer... I want to connect in the background
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	rdesktop woudl do that?
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	hmm... I don't think so.  See, in XP, it locks the machine and kicks the current user out.
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	you're connecting to the same session though.
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	basically microsoft wants you to use the server versions if you are having multiple people connected at a time.
2007-12-05T11:54:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	hrm... you know what I mean tho right?
2007-12-05T11:55:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	well then what about connecting to the same session w/ vnc but not disturbing the user on the computer?
2007-12-05T11:55:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	yeah, totally.  I'd imagine there's a registry hack out there for XP / Vista home to let you do that.  Although you might check to see if vista premium lets you do that.
2007-12-05T11:55:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	you can do view-only vnc connections, but...
2007-12-05T11:56:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	basically the computer is doing double doubty. First it's the wifes work computer and second it's the baby monitor
2007-12-05T11:58:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	do you know of anything that could do that.?
2007-12-05T11:59:00.000Z	jack|ass	Luke	well vista CAN do that.  It's just a matter of convincing it that multiple sessions are allow.  I've never tried that since I haven't touched vista much. :)
2007-12-05T11:59:00.000Z	Luke	jack|ass	since i really only use linux... i need someone to hand-hold me through the process =/
