2007-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Can you get to a terminal with ctrl+alt+F1 ?
2007-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Does sysrq K work?
2007-06-24T10:30:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	would you happen to know why ctrl+alt+sysreq+k does nothing with this bug?
2007-06-24T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Either your system is thoroughly crashed ( at the kernel level ) or whatever controls video output is, without ssh enabled ( which I doubt it is ) it's not really possible to tell which
2007-06-24T10:33:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	would you think the official ATI driver is anything but poo?
2007-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	If you have an ATI card I would probably say that is the culprit, use the open source drivers ( if they work for your card ) or disable DRI to get more stability.
2007-06-24T10:35:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	I was using the open sauce drivers :(
2007-06-24T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Oh, they aren't bad stability wise AFIK, just feature and speed wise ( due to lack of documentation )
2007-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Do you have openssh installed?
2007-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	if it's not installed by default, then no
2007-06-24T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Did this computer ever boot correctly? Is this a new install / LiveCD ?
2007-06-24T10:38:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	yes it booted correctly when freshly installed...then after installing the ati driver under the GUI "Restricted Drivers" it broke
2007-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	The restricted driver manager installs the proprietary drivers ( fglrx ) ( the ones I commented were unstable :)
2007-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	ok so what is installed by default? the open source ones?
2007-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Yes
2007-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	what's it's apt-get package name?
2007-06-24T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	They are still installed, just boot a liveCD and change your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use "ati" instead of "fglrx"
2007-06-24T10:41:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	thanks
2007-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	Depending on your card, you may or may not get 3D acceleration with the open source drivers, but if you do they will work with beryl :) ( fglrx won't without XGL )
2007-06-24T10:44:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Jordan_U	all i care about is wine + warcraft 3 :)
2007-06-24T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Oni-Dracula	That may or may not run better with fglrx
