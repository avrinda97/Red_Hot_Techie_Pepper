2011-03-04T19:19:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	thanks
2011-03-04T19:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	does the java -jar just launch the app, or does it install it as an executable , my java knowledge is rather sketchy
2011-03-04T19:26:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	it just runs that jar-file
2011-03-17T19:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	blz , what about aptoncd ?
2011-03-17T19:08:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	no idea, i never used it (actually i don't really know what it does exactly)
2011-03-17T19:09:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	might make sense for people with very slow internet, not usefull for backups imho
2011-03-17T19:12:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	saving packages makes no sense in most cases, the rest easily can be done using rsync (or some scripts around it)
2011-03-17T19:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	it's surprising what ppl want to save , whether it makes sense or not :)
2011-03-17T19:14:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	problem are devs thinking its a good idea to save some stuff inside /usr/....
2011-03-17T19:15:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	as i said, it might be usefull if you have very limited internet access. for _me_ it wouldn't make sense to store packages i could re-download within 10 minutes (32mbit-internet)
2011-03-17T19:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	agreed , I've never bothered with that either , but there's no reasoning or understanding why some ppl attach importance , for whatever reasons and insist on something that seems trivial to us.
2011-05-18T18:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	I've wondering about that whether it's workable to adapt a newer vrsion of an app to an older OS..interesting
2011-05-18T18:30:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	thats how backporting works
2011-05-18T18:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	I always thought backporting was the other way around,  older apps on newer OSs , not vice versa...but it;s good to know
2011-05-26T17:30:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	samba is the smb/cifs server name, smb is just one daemon. "GUI" would be swat
2011-05-26T17:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	right ,but we're talking about samba and smb and the relationship as gui vs daemon
2011-05-26T17:31:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	samba has no gui
2011-05-26T17:32:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	smb is an (outdated) protocol, samba provides it
2011-05-26T17:34:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	i'd call it a nautilus/gnome extension offering the smb-share functionality
2011-05-26T17:35:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	since i'm not native english speaker, you shouldn't ;)
2011-05-26T17:36:00.000Z	BluesKaj	llutz_	, it's ok , that word is so overused , it's tiresome to me
2011-10-28T15:29:00.000Z	llutz_	BluesKaj	medibuntu isn't meant to be used with debian
