2008-03-01T03:09:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	i dont think you can connect two computers simply by connecting them with a lan cable
2008-03-01T03:10:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	there has to be some form of hard ware inbetween that acts as a transmitter
2008-03-01T03:11:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	like a router
2008-03-01T03:12:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	which distro are you running ?
2008-03-01T03:13:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	your online so the problem is probably that your folders havnt been given to the shared foled
2008-03-01T03:14:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	you should go to >system >administeation>sharedfolders
2008-03-01T03:15:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	get samba or equivilant from the synaptic
2008-03-01T03:16:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	are you trying files from different OS`s?
2008-03-01T03:21:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	are you using the router right now ?
2008-03-01T03:18:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	that would mean that theres nothing in the folder ?
2008-03-01T03:19:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	try restarting
2008-03-01T03:21:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	if so the router is running fine
2008-03-01T03:22:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	check to see that your firewall does not conflict your settings ( if you have one
2008-03-01T03:24:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	run terminal type> netstat -r
2008-03-01T03:25:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	how many computers do you see> ip adresses
2008-03-01T03:27:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	there are two computers online
2008-03-01T03:28:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	go to the other computer and try to connect you the opposits shared folder, you will be prompted for a password
2008-03-01T03:30:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	if both pcs have the same system, (unix) then there should not have to be any windows sharing applications involved
2008-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	if you would like to share file between two computers , both of the computers must be configured to do so
2008-03-01T03:32:00.000Z	binaries-AP1	xiix	go to the other computer and share its files over the network
