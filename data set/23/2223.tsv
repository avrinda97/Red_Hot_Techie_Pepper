2009-05-25T04:38:00.000Z	harujai		What would cause fglrxinfo to give me a "Xlib:  extension "ATIFGLRXDRI" missing on display ":0.0". " segmentation fault?
2009-05-25T04:39:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	the phase of the moon?
2009-05-25T04:39:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Anything i could control?
2009-05-25T04:46:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	yes, jaunty uses X1.6 so only catalyst 9.5 will work with it at the moment
2009-05-25T04:47:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Ah i thought so. Thanks.
2009-05-25T04:47:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	have you looked at http://cchtml.com?
2009-05-25T04:48:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	 yes. Following those instructions three times yesterday i wound up with 3 different errors on 3 fresh installs of jaunty
2009-05-25T04:48:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	I used to follow the manual installation instructions (they got balinghup's ati card working last night!)
2009-05-25T04:48:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	It seems to have finally settled on the segmentation error
2009-05-25T04:50:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	when you did the manual install did you you install the 3 .deb packages specifically listed or did you install all 6 created when you did --buildpkg ?
2009-05-25T04:50:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	I didn't install the -dev package, I installed all the others
2009-05-25T04:51:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Last one i think, is synaptic the best way to uninstall the packages or is there a cleaner way
2009-05-25T04:51:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	I use dpkg to install/remove local packages and apt for repository packages
2009-05-25T04:52:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	I see. Thanks.
2009-05-25T04:52:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	but they are basically equivalent
2009-05-25T04:53:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	you might try purging them
2009-05-25T04:54:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	I'm new, how would i do that? -p?
2009-05-25T04:55:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	dpkg --purge <package names>
2009-05-25T04:55:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Roger. For future reference what's the difference between purge and remove
2009-05-25T04:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	purge removes config files as well as the binaries
2009-05-25T05:13:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Is "Xlib:  extension "ATIFGLRXDRI" missing on display ":0.0". " really so vague an error that it could be the phase of the moon?
2009-05-25T05:14:00.000Z	boss_mc	harujai	my experience with the fglrx drivers is that no error was specific enough to no be affected by the gravitational pull of my pet cat
2009-05-25T05:16:00.000Z	harujai	boss_mc	Are there any tricksy ways to disambiguate it?
