2007-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	Kalamarencu		hey I want to replace my Hard disk but other than that all my configuration will be the same
2007-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	Kalamarencu		is there any way to copy the OS to another disk ?
2007-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	Kalamarencu		without reinstalling ?
2007-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	Kalamarencu		something like a disk image ?
2007-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 thers several ways to  copy the os.  You may have to reinstall grub and perhaps tweak the fstab file - depending on how you do it.
2007-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 i used 'mondo/mindi' ages ago. havent tryed any other tools lately.
2007-11-22T10:45:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	 I will look for it
2007-11-22T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 theres proberly a dozen+ other tools that ive never heard of that may do it better. depenng on your needs.
2007-11-22T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 with mondo/mindi i could 'backup' to a network machine. then boot a mondo live cd. and restore from the network box. :)
2007-11-22T10:46:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	that sounds nice
2007-11-22T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 yes. Its an older tool Not sure how its changed in the last year or so,
2007-11-22T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 whenyou start talking about backingup/restoring 300+GB of OS data these days.. it gets to be a task.
2007-11-22T10:47:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	I have 5 Hdds plugged in this computer
2007-11-22T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 heh. I had one pc with 8 at one time.. and was able to replace them all with a single hd. :)  Progress!
2007-11-22T10:48:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	they total 750 GB ... I do not intend backing up all, I want to install to a sata instead of a Pata
2007-11-22T10:49:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	another question somehow related. Does Ubuntu know RAID?
2007-11-22T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 it can do raid.. but i dont use raid any more.
2007-11-22T10:50:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	Why not ? Not stable?
2007-11-22T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 i needed the hds elseware for one.. and really dident see that much of a gain for my needs.  I needed space. more then speed.
2007-11-22T10:51:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	I see
2007-11-22T10:55:00.000Z	Kalamarencu	Dr_willis	http://www.mondorescue.org - is this it?
2007-11-22T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kalamarencu	 yep thats it.
