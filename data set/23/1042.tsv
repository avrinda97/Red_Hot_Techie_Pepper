2010-09-27T19:40:00.000Z	alaing		what does chmod -R 755 /var/www do?
2010-09-27T19:41:00.000Z	Arsic	alaing	it just changes the permissions so you can see the pages. sorry, I didn't hear you original question. you might have to add index.php to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
2010-09-27T19:42:00.000Z	Arsic	alaing	correction, /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf (just checked)
2010-09-27T19:43:00.000Z	Arsic		just make sure index.php is on the DireectoryIndex line
2010-09-27T19:44:00.000Z	alaing		there is already a index.html in /vars/www
2010-09-27T19:44:00.000Z	Arsic		add index.php to it
2010-09-27T19:45:00.000Z	alaing		when i open localhost in firefox i get confirmation that apache is working
2010-09-27T19:46:00.000Z	alaing		ok i create a index.php and it did not ask me to download but the files has no content
2010-09-27T19:47:00.000Z	Arsic		that's because you don't have an index.php in /var/www. you can change the index.html to index.php and it should work
2010-09-27T19:47:00.000Z	Arsic		my dir.conf has this line DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
2010-09-27T19:49:00.000Z	alaing		my dir.conf has those
2010-09-27T19:49:00.000Z	alaing	Arsic	can i msg u instead?
