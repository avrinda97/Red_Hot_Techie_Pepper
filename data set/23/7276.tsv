2005-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	vermyndax		would anyone know why openoffice doesn't seem to find any of the Java RE's that are installed on this system?  They're all blank in the Java options screen
2005-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	You might want to set your JAVA_HOME/JAVA_PATH environments?
2005-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	hmmm... can you tell me how I'd go about doing that properly?
2005-09-19T09:52:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	I know where I put it, so that helps ;)
2005-09-19T09:52:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	 Ok, so you simply do an export JAVA_HOME=/wherever/your/jdk.version/bin
2005-09-19T09:52:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	and the same for JAVA_PATH
2005-09-19T09:53:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	and then start openoffice from that same Terminal
2005-09-19T09:53:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	and that will stick across reboots?
2005-09-19T09:53:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	If it works, we'll make it permanent :)
2005-09-19T09:54:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	okie, I'm on the java options screen... it's scanning busily...
2005-09-19T09:55:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	nothing :(
2005-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	Hm. Then I don't know either ... maybe OO has a cmd line switch or a config file where you can set it.
2005-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	yeah that's what I was thinking... if I leave "use Java runtime environment" checked, it takes about 1 minute to load ooffice2
2005-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	if I uncheck it, it loads in less than a second
2005-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	so I thought maybe I'd point it to Sun Java to see if that loads any faster (it helped Moneydance work better)
2005-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	yuk, that was the cause of yesterday's troubles?
2005-09-19T09:57:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	yep, sure was
2005-09-19T09:57:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	something about the java environment ooffice2 is trying to use isn't working too well
2005-09-19T09:57:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	the weird thing is - I've heard people say that Base requires Java to work, but it seems to work fine for me without that box checked
2005-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	xTina	vermyndax	Do you have "java" or a JRE/JDK from Sun?
2005-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	yes, I put it in /opt
2005-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	/opt/jre1.5.0_04
2005-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	vermyndax	xTina	sorry, I have to run help my wife for a few minutes - back in a bit
