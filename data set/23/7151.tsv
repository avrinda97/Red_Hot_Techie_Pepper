2007-04-27T09:05:00.000Z	eck	jordan	it's possible, i'm not sure how simple it is. i think how you set it up depends on what software mixer you are using (e.g. esd/arts/pulseaudio)
2007-04-27T09:05:00.000Z	jordan	eck	how would I find out which mixer I am using
2007-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	eck	jordan	what DE are you using?
2007-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	jordan	eck	ubuntu 7.04
2007-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	eck	jordan	gnome or kde?
2007-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	jordan	eck	gnome
2007-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	eck	jordan	you are using esd
2007-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	jordan	eck	so, any ideas on what to do?
2007-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	eck	jordan	you can do some simple assignments in the sound configuration thing in gnome (e.g. have a different output for music and video), if you want to do something more complex you have to read the esd docs probably
2007-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	eck	jordan	i know pulseaudio has support for having all the sound sent to both sound cards
2007-04-27T09:09:00.000Z	jordan	eck	thank you very much, im looking into pulseaudio
2007-04-27T09:25:00.000Z	jordan	eck	any idea how to set up pulseaudio in order to do what I want?
2007-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	eck	jordan	after you install it, you can make applications use it by going into the sound manager thing for gnome and selecting pulseaudio instead of whatever it is currently using
2007-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	eck	jordan	i think the instructions for using two cards is on the FAQ in the pulse audio wiki
2007-04-27T09:27:00.000Z	eck	jordan	it is a long term goal of gnome and ubuntu to migrate from esd to pulseaudio so hopefully it will be the default sound daemon in the next release
2007-04-27T09:44:00.000Z	jordan	eck	im getting errors with pulseaudio
2007-04-27T09:45:00.000Z	eck	jordan	what errors?
2007-04-27T09:48:00.000Z	eck	jordan	are you in the right groups, and are you sure that the card is not being used by another process?
2007-04-27T09:49:00.000Z	jordan	eck	it shouldn't be used by another process, theres nothing but xchat and firefox running, and Im not sure about the groups?
2007-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	eck	jordan	i don't have two cards so this is just a guess, but it could be that only the first card (which i think is hw:0) was changed to the pulse audio group
2007-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	jordan	eck	is that a bad thing?
2007-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	eck	jordan	yeah, the sound server doesn't run as root so it can only access devices with the right permissions. check the permissions on your sound cards in /dev
