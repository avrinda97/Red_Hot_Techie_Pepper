2005-10-12T16:26:00.000Z	jrattner1		Anyone heard of you speakers making a noise when your phone is about to ring and ringing? (not purpesoley)
2005-10-12T16:28:00.000Z	jrattner1		but why would the cell phone interfere with the speakers
2005-10-12T16:30:00.000Z	jrattner1		science is so crazy
2005-10-12T16:31:00.000Z	jrattner1		Propagandhi: I just got the speakers, they like mid range twenty dollar speakers from best buy
2005-10-12T05:08:00.000Z	jrattner1		does breezy have better wifi support, not for hardware, but software wise that makes accessing wifi's easier

2005-10-12T05:11:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	oh though lurking on some random irc channel called #ubuntu :)
2005-10-12T05:10:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	i understand it has networkmanager which makes managing wifi easier
2005-10-12T05:11:00.000Z	jrattner1	bimberi	where did you find information about this?
2005-10-12T05:12:00.000Z	jrattner1	bimberi	i hope WIFI software sucks right now, its very tedious to choose networks and such
2005-10-12T05:12:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	FYI here's the wiki page - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager

2006-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	"defaults" should be fine
2006-05-30T11:11:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	oops, i missed Apostle^'s answer (which looks better)
2007-05-15T07:46:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	i'm not aware of one because you get it with your install.  You can always generate a new one via ...
2007-05-15T07:47:00.000Z	jrattner1	bimberi	will that include all the repos multiverse and all that nonsense?
2007-05-15T07:48:00.000Z	bimberi	jrattner1	yep, as much nonsense as you can handle :)
