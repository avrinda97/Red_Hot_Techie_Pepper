2012-02-27T03:47:00.000Z	blud2		my computer is stuck when i turn it on it says "|Checking for running unattended upgrades" and it stays like that forever. Now I am in recovery shell and what do i do to fix it?
2012-02-27T03:49:00.000Z	escott	blud2	why did you end up in recovery shell? what happened when you tried to boot normally
2012-02-27T03:49:00.000Z	escott	blud2	nevermind misread
2012-02-27T03:51:00.000Z	escott	blud2	you could try apt-get remove unattended-upgrade
2012-02-27T03:51:00.000Z	escott	blud2	unattended-upgrades
2012-02-27T03:56:00.000Z	blud2	escott	it says W: not using locking for read only lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock    E: unable to write to /var/cache/apt   E: the package lists or status file could not be parse or open
2012-02-27T03:56:00.000Z	blud2	escott	do i just do sudo first heh
2012-02-27T03:58:00.000Z	escott	blud2	if you are truly in a recovery console you shouldn't need to sudo, but if you aren't root you would need to sudo
2012-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	blud2	escott	i am truly in recovery mode, the prompt is root@computername   and i just did sudo it has no effect
2012-02-27T04:00:00.000Z	escott	blud2	sounds like the lock file is bad. you can remove the lock file and try again
2012-02-27T04:05:00.000Z	escott	blud2	sounds like you need to fsck /
2012-02-27T04:07:00.000Z	blud2	escott	do i just run the command fsck right now in the shell or is that something i have to reboot and pick or w/e
2012-02-27T04:13:00.000Z	escott	blud2	since your / is mounted ro you can safely fsck now
2012-02-27T04:15:00.000Z	blud2	escott	i did fsck , it was instantly done and said clean or something. went back to try those other commands and everything still responds the same way ('read only file system')
2012-02-27T04:15:00.000Z	escott	blud2	so now you can mount -o remount,rw /
2012-02-27T04:18:00.000Z	escott	blud2	when you have an unclean dismount (like a forced power off) then the fs may be dirty and unable to be mounted rw until after fsck is run
2012-02-27T04:22:00.000Z	escott	blud2	/ is ro so nothing is currently writable
2012-02-27T04:44:00.000Z	blud2	escott	Jordan_U  do i just reboot now ?
2012-02-27T04:51:00.000Z	escott	blud2	is that stopping the boot?
2012-02-27T04:51:00.000Z	blud2	escott	I guess so, its just sitting at that screen for a minute now
2012-02-27T04:55:00.000Z	escott	blud2	does ctrl-alt-f1 take you to a login prompt
2012-02-27T04:56:00.000Z	blud2	escott	no, it does nothing
2012-02-27T05:02:00.000Z	escott	blud2	well i guess boot back to recovery and reinstall the unattended-upgrades package. im not sure what exactly has gone wrong with it though
