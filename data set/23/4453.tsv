2007-08-08T11:14:00.000Z	alecwh		For some reason, when I click the power button (or the GNOME power icon), and the screen pops up where you select what you want to do, I don't have a SHUT DOWN option. Only Suspend and Hibernate. What can I do to get the Power button back up there? I've had to just hold down the power button lately...

2007-08-08T07:36:00.000Z	alecwh		Hello everyone. :) I just got my dell laptop, installed ubuntu, but there is one problem... when I hit the power button, that screen pops up where it lets you standby, hibernate... but there isn't an option for "Shut down". I found this strange, does anyone know what's wrong?
