2006-02-27T17:31:00.000Z	rewt_		thanks babyboy
2006-02-27T17:33:00.000Z	rewt_		ANyone have any luck with media readers?
2006-02-27T17:33:00.000Z	rewt_		I can't get mine working :(
2006-02-27T17:33:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	do you mean flash card readers?
2006-02-27T17:34:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	yeah, mine works just fine
2006-02-27T17:34:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	the usual problem is that you dont have the scsi layer loaded in the kernel - thats pretty important, as linux uses scsi emulation for most external storage, and a lot of cd writers
2006-02-27T17:35:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	so howdo I get it running?
2006-02-27T17:37:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	any idea how to get mine working?
2006-02-27T17:37:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	first of all, does it show anything in dmesg?
2006-02-27T17:39:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	I dont know what to look for under dmesg
2006-02-27T17:41:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	What should I look for i dmseg?
2006-02-27T17:42:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	gimme a sec on that one...
2006-02-27T17:43:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	anything related to the usb-storage module.
2006-02-27T17:43:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	okay
2006-02-27T17:54:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	any luck?
2006-02-27T17:55:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	usually most media readers are mounted as a usb storage device... so look for anything related to usb-storage in your dmesg log.
2006-02-27T17:56:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	I dont see anything
2006-02-27T17:56:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	anything with scsi-*?
2006-02-27T06:06:00.000Z	rewt_	asymmetry	so I'm guessing I'm out of luck on my media reader?
2006-02-27T06:06:00.000Z	asymmetry	rewt_	not sure what to do with it, sorry
