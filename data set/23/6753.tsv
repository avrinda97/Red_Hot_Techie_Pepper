2006-03-24T13:31:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	please stop repeating the same question. If someone knows, (s)he will answer. You can try posting on the mailing list too.
2006-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	areyou using samba?
2006-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- On the file server?
2006-04-22T05:53:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	I mean for playing the movie. You say 'via the network', but that can be anything, nfs, samba, sshfs, nc...
2006-04-22T05:54:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- The file server is a Windows 2003 enterprise, and the workstation is a breezy.  For playing the file, I mount a network share from the Windows server, and play it that way.
2006-04-22T05:56:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	you could try downloading it first - samba via nautilus has been wonky in the past
2006-04-22T05:57:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Any other solutions?  In general, this breezy box has had HORRIBLE network performance with that Windows server (i.e., ~20-25Mbps)...
2006-04-22T05:59:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	mount your samba shares instead of using nautilus
2006-04-22T05:59:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- How do I do that?
2006-04-22T06:00:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	a really easy way is downloading and running http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/addsamba
2006-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Is that a file, or what?
2006-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	yes
2006-04-22T06:02:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Ok, I downloaded it, and firefox gave it a .htm extension.  What do I do now?
2006-04-22T06:03:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	bash filename_you_gave_it
2006-04-22T06:07:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- I did that, said yes to installing the smbfs, gave the server, share, username, password, and got an error - cli_negprot: SMB signing is mandatory and we have disabled it.  17098: protocol negotiation failed  umount: /tmp/tmp.vm0GRx: not mounted
2006-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	never seen that error before...
2006-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Can I do this manually, without a script?
2006-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	hang on, trying to find out what that error means
2006-04-22T06:09:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Oh, ok.  Sorry, and thank you...
2006-04-22T06:12:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	http://www.computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/27175.html
2006-04-22T06:15:00.000Z	Seveas	djs_2_6	download this: http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/addcifs
2006-04-22T06:27:00.000Z	djs_2_6	Seveas	- Thank you for that.  The bash addcifs did not work either, but that website helped, so I think I will do some playing...
