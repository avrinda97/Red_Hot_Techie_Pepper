2006-08-07T12:34:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	did you try this one
2006-08-07T12:34:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	replace the /usr/lib/tk8.5/tkfbox.tcl that comes with tk8.5_8.5.0-1~neto3_i386.deb package with the one from http://tktoolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net...?revision=1.58
2006-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	FeestBijtje	cherwin	if i am correct ive followed this guide: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-87001.html
2006-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	your problem has to do with a faulty xorg installation
2006-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	FeestBijtje	cherwin	with means i have to reboot o.0
2006-08-07T12:36:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	no just read this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=216689&page=4
2006-08-07T12:36:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	you will find a couple of solutions there
2006-08-07T12:38:00.000Z	FeestBijtje	cherwin	how do i do this: If you are using xgl, you most probably have the file rgb.txt in /etc/X11 . Xgl in Ubuntu Dapper is usually misconfigured and looks for the file in /usr/share/X11 . Make a symlink to it in /usr/share/X11 and restart your X server.
2006-08-07T12:39:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	ln -s /etc/X11/rgb.txt /usr/share/X11 and then ctrl-alt-Bksp
2006-08-07T12:39:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	be sure to use sudo!
2006-08-07T12:39:00.000Z	FeestBijtje	cherwin	i did that a while aggo o.0
2006-08-07T12:40:00.000Z	FeestBijtje	cherwin	only a restart of gnome is enough?
2006-08-07T12:40:00.000Z	cherwin	FeestBijtje	you have to restart X
