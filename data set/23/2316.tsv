2010-06-30T11:30:00.000Z	Filthpig		hi all! I'm trying to build wine from source ('cus I need to add a patch) on a 64-bit system. However, the config complains about needing 32-bit development files for X, and I can't find them in the repo. Any idea what that pkg is called?
2010-06-30T11:30:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	best resource is #winehq
2010-06-30T11:30:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	but regarding package name maybe here is good too
2010-06-30T11:31:00.000Z	Filthpig	indus	yeah I just thought I'd ask here since the wine devs often get upset with distro-specific questions :p
2010-06-30T11:31:00.000Z	indus		yeah :D
2010-06-30T11:32:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	ah a 64 bit sysztem
2010-06-30T11:32:00.000Z	Filthpig		yes

2010-06-30T11:33:00.000Z	Filthpig		okay, I just got some reply at winehq telling me to ask at wine-dev :p
2010-06-30T11:33:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	i found a link
2010-06-30T11:33:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	btw, there is also a 64 bit wine available
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	Filthpig	indus	but I need to build from source
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	did you see this http://wiki.winehq.org/WineOn64bit#head-b62ae8f996e97e1df7258bb8eaec2e83e54ca799
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	i know buyt you can build a 64 bit wine too it seems :D
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	Filthpig		ah, nice
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	Filthpig		hm
2010-06-30T11:34:00.000Z	Filthpig		anyway I've got this far so I'll just do it the hard way :p
2010-06-30T11:36:00.000Z	Filthpig		heehaw! 275 MBs of extra files. Yummy.
2010-06-30T11:36:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	are you sure you need 32 bit X devel files?
2010-06-30T11:38:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	good luck'
2010-06-30T11:38:00.000Z	Filthpig	indus	yes, the config was very clear on that. However, I just learned that a simple "apt-get build-dep wine1.2" fetches everything I need (and probably more) to build :)
2010-06-30T11:38:00.000Z	indus	Filthpig	yea taht link is a good read
