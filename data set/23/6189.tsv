2006-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		The alternative isn't booting
2006-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		and I don't want to go back to Breezey forever
2006-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Because PCMCIA doesn't work
2006-06-03T13:11:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		:*(
2006-06-03T13:11:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Debian?
2006-06-03T13:11:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		lol

2006-06-03T13:12:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		You realize that you're telling me to jump out of the kiddie pool and go scuba diving right?
2006-06-03T13:12:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		!pcmcia
2006-06-03T13:14:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I need help getting the alternative CD booting, because frankly - it isn't :(
2006-06-03T13:14:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	what did you use to burn it ?
2006-06-03T13:16:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	did you recently get a new spindle of cd's ?  perhaps you need a fimware upgrade.  bios ?  enable boot order.  thats the only thing i can think of.  make sure your hard drive is the last bootable device.  i usually go atapi to floppy to hd.
2006-06-03T13:16:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	avis	I was able to install Breezy Badger without a hitch.
2006-06-03T13:17:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	it makes no sense though unless you are using different media.  i used nero on my windows machine and had it track at once and finalize cd.  natuilus did a great job of burning isos under RC.
2006-06-03T13:19:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	why not fetch the RC version so you dont have to waste much BW ?
2006-06-03T13:48:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	nor am i also run x64 but i've seen the support channels on EFnet where there is a user base and you get alot of garbage there, and that network in general.
2006-06-03T14:04:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	did you check your laptop to see if it works fine under Dapper ?  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops
2006-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	if you like open an iso with something like an archive opener and assume you install if that way you dont want to think about Dapper
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	ok i usually finalize my cd's on xp
2006-06-03T14:35:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	i used track at once and finalize and it worked fine for me
2006-06-03T14:40:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	how can you say that ?  so many people have installed it without a hitch.  perhaps your best suited for windows ?
2006-06-03T16:10:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	out of curiosity what was the problem ?
2006-06-05T16:48:00.000Z	avis	DarkLegacy	hey guy whats going on ?
