2009-11-04T12:05:00.000Z	napster		Hello friends I need to upgrade to 9.10 from 9.04. But I'm not connected to internet and need to download updates from another computer..!
2009-11-04T12:06:00.000Z	theycallmejeff	napster	: download the iso and burn it like you would for a clean install, but just run it as an update package.
2009-11-04T12:06:00.000Z	napster	theycallmejeff	But I need to keep my customisations in jaunty
2009-11-04T12:09:00.000Z	napster	theycallmejeff	But in the upgrade notes they suggest me to apply all the updates for jaunty. How can I do that. I'm using internet from another computer with windows...?
2009-11-04T12:10:00.000Z	napster	theycallmejeff	..?
2009-11-04T12:11:00.000Z	theycallmejeff	napster	in that case i'm not 100% sure how to do it. what exactly do you mean by customizations?
2009-11-04T12:12:00.000Z	napster	theycallmejeff	Like softwares I've installed, themes, Some files in home folder...
2009-11-04T12:13:00.000Z	theycallmejeff	napster	those will not be touched. running an update disc will only change core os files. your themes and installed programs will all still be there provided they are compatible.
2009-11-04T12:14:00.000Z	napster	theycallmejeff	But how can i update my jaunty...? Dist-upgrade should be after update as they say...!
