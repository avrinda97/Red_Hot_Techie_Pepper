2008-05-21T11:32:00.000Z	cypha		which i really really miss from winamp
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	cypha		can someone tell me how to use the git-core?
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	cypha		i'd like to know what files change after installations and options
2008-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	cypha		that way i can learn to manipulate config files manually, without the need for someone to have made a GUI
2008-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	cypha		i so far did sudo apt-get install git-core
2008-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	cypha		git init .
2008-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	cypha		git diff
2008-05-21T11:37:00.000Z	cypha		i thought that's what it did
2008-05-21T11:38:00.000Z	cypha		if i learn to manually edit the config files, i'll be able to pretty much control linux the way i'd like, no?
2008-05-21T11:40:00.000Z	cypha		what's CVS stand for?

2008-05-22T08:31:00.000Z	genii	cypha	sudo rm -R /opt/wicd
2008-05-22T08:32:00.000Z	genii	cypha	Theres no remnant in the dpkg system anymore, it just left some files behind
2008-05-22T08:35:00.000Z	cypha	genii	i did that command
2008-05-22T08:36:00.000Z	genii	cypha	You'll still want the /opt directory
2008-05-22T08:37:00.000Z	genii	cypha	Other things use it to install to for instance
2008-05-22T08:37:00.000Z	genii	cypha	Most likely so far it's the only thing you've installed which needed it to exist
2008-05-22T08:40:00.000Z	genii	cypha	I don't have enough time or energy to guide you through that today. Much depends on hardware etc
2008-05-22T08:41:00.000Z	cypha	genii	i'd be really really grateful if i can finally get my wireless working probably
2008-05-22T08:43:00.000Z	genii	cypha	Aplogies for lag. It's been so far a 17 hour day and am also talking in other channels

2008-05-26T06:54:00.000Z	cypha	genii	that sucks, there should be a database that tells how to properly remove all software
