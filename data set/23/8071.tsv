2005-04-29T15:29:00.000Z	prego		I've been installing ubuntu to a friend of mine, and after a rather sucessful installation I have a couple of concerns. First of all, he uses DSL provider with dynamic ip address... and I want to perform admin tasks remotely. How can I manage to know which is his IP?
2005-04-29T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	ez-ipupdate and visit dyndns.org
2005-04-29T15:30:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	thanks very much
2005-04-29T15:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	no worries :)
2005-04-29T15:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	can you write a little script and link it to a pretty icon on his desktop?
2005-04-29T15:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	then he can just click to go on line
2005-04-29T15:33:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	more or less is what I've done. However it requires sudo ...
2005-04-29T15:34:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	is there a way I can prompt for sudo password via GTK dialog or something?
2005-04-29T15:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	use gksudo as a password dialog
2005-04-29T15:34:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	OK, I'll check those posibilities, thanks again ;-))))
2005-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	I would invite you an expresso coffe ;-)
2005-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	I love espresso coffee :)
2005-04-29T15:43:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	my friend is really impressed right now. He'll be much happier soon ;-)
2005-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	/usr/share I'd say
2005-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	that's where they seem to live...
2005-04-29T15:50:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	yes, but I would rather place at /usr/local/share... the ones I download as tar.gz ... not to forget they don't come from a deb file
2005-04-29T15:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	up to you - you might need to link them to make them system wide
2005-04-29T15:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	if there's only a small number of users, ~/.themes works fine
2005-04-29T15:51:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	that is a good idea! so the fact of coming from tar.gz is retained somehow :-)
2005-04-29T15:53:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	works, as expected ;-)
2005-04-29T15:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	yup, .themes is right :)
2005-04-29T15:54:00.000Z	prego	thoreauputic_	I've placed it at /usr/local/share/themes/Clearlooks-Bluecurve and linked it to /usr/share/themes/. so it works for every user, and I can see that it is set by hand since the actual location is /usr/local/...
2005-04-29T15:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	prego	fair enough :)
