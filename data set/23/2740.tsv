2008-11-25T08:41:00.000Z	klament		Is there any command-line tool I can run that gives a report such as "looking up domain foo.bar on nameserver aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd takes Z (milli)seconds?" nslookup seems to be giving results that disagree with how ping is behaving when pinging a domain versus an IP address
2008-11-25T08:41:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	use dig?
2008-11-25T08:42:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	/ danbhfive: all right, I'll try those. Thanks :)
2008-11-25T09:14:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	sure
2008-11-25T09:14:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	would you try visiting www.tpl.toronto.on.ca? it's the toronto public library.. I'm curious to see if it loads up super fast for you in windows (1-3 seconds) while slow in linux (20+ seconds)
2008-11-25T09:15:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	both about equal speed, 1.13 on win, .95 on firefox/lin.
2008-11-25T09:16:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	interesting.. i'm getting a few people on ##linux with slower results.. those were times in "seconds" right?
2008-11-25T09:16:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	yes, from a 1gbit fiber line.
2008-11-25T09:18:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	heh well with 1gbit its pretty hard to load anything slow unless the server itself is slow.
2008-11-25T09:19:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	if it matters, chrome took about 17 seconds to load it...weird.
2008-11-25T09:20:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	just out of curiosity, have you done anything with your linux install that's changed how the ethernet card behaves? MTU sizes, etc?
2008-11-25T09:22:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	tried it from a Ubuntu machine and a CentOS machine, both loaded <1s in Firefox and 10-20 seconds in Chrome. Both are clean install systems with the exception of a custom mplayer.
2008-11-25T09:22:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	hmm.. it may be a driver problem with my specific network card or linux doesn't like my router then, as even doing an attempt to load the site from ubuntu's boot CD is slow... bizarre
2008-11-25T09:24:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	I'd say it was something on the sonicwall nat/dmz switch but if chrome loads it slow then I'd have to go with something in linux itself. Does the server do load balancing/web server do any kind of scripts/etc based on OS type?
2008-11-25T09:26:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	i'm not too sure to be honest... I just always thought the site was slow by default until I tried loading it up one of the few times I was in windows and was disturbed by the difference in speed
2008-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	dont have time to look through the scripting but I'm guessing it loads an alternate site based on which OS it detects, only thing I can think of. Or a load balancing system that does the same based on OS type.
2008-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	maybe i'll try installing firefox's user agent plugin :)
2008-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	give it a shot, can't hurt =)
2008-11-25T09:56:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	run the app as chroot/different user with restricted permissions?
2008-11-25T09:58:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	/ usser hmm.. ok, thank you :)
2008-11-25T10:00:00.000Z	klament	AidenXi	/ usser that user would still be able to access the internet though, no? ie: the software could open up a new socket and connect elsewhere .. is there any way of having that program run without manually removing eth0 from ifconfig?
2008-11-25T10:01:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	what usser said =)
2008-11-25T10:02:00.000Z	AidenXi	klament	chroot is powerful, really powerful. Look up guides on howtoforge and it should explain how you need to set it up to block networking.
