2008-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	file a bug, i'd say
2008-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	i cant get into my system so i can file a bug
2008-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	well you can file it from anywhere else
2008-04-29T05:09:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	im getting this "Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!"
2008-04-29T05:09:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	anyway, you could try starting the system with the "noapic" or "noacpi" or "irqpoll" kernel options, although these are just standard things to try, not really specifically relevant to a kernel panic per se
2008-04-29T05:09:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	that means it's not necessarily a kernel problem, but might be an ubuntu specific problem
2008-04-29T05:10:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	any ideas?
2008-04-29T05:11:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	how can i enable acpi?
2008-04-29T05:12:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	so theres anything i can do eh?
2008-04-29T05:13:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	i didnt have any problems with 7.10
2008-04-29T05:13:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	ideas, no, links from google, yes. check out this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/149639
2008-04-29T05:13:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	thanks but i cant access firefox :S
2008-04-29T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	not even w3m?
2008-04-29T05:14:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	thats what im getting bug 149639, ubot 5 just said it, it there anything i can do now?
2008-04-29T05:15:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	it's just the link i gave you. find a web browser to open it. w3m would do, if you can't access X.
2008-04-29T05:16:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	how do i access w3m?
2008-04-29T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	type "w3m" in a terminal. although i don't know what state your system is in (i.e. how you're accessing the internet in the first place)
2008-04-29T05:17:00.000Z	eduardo	LjL	maybe i can run elkins?
2008-04-29T05:17:00.000Z	LjL	eduardo	w3m is similar to elinks (and i'd suggest links2 anyway)
