2007-02-28T13:09:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Sans
2007-02-28T13:11:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	yes, the window title is also set to bold
2007-02-28T13:12:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Actually, there is an exception.
2007-02-28T13:13:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Some programs (or part of) use a fixed width fond. Ubuntu uses Monospace as default for these.
2007-02-28T13:13:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Have you set the font size to 10?
2007-02-28T13:13:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	i changed it to 10 in my bitchx the words are overlapping each other specially "m"
2007-02-28T13:15:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	So the fonts are overlapping even when you set them to Sans 10?
2007-02-28T13:15:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	yes
2007-02-28T13:16:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Hang on. Gonna check something.
2007-02-28T13:18:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Ah, I think I figured out the problem. bitchx uses gtk1 and not gtk2. As far as I know all programs that use gtk1 have this problem.
2007-02-28T13:18:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	I don't know if there's a solution to this, other than to ask the maintainers of bitchx to update and switch to useing gtk2.
2007-02-28T13:19:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	thanks. Though it wasnt happening before i changed it. maybe if i restart bitchx it should be ok.
2007-02-28T13:19:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Try it.
2007-02-28T13:20:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Other than that, have a look if you can find anything on configuring setttings for gtk1. Sorry, I don't really know much about it.
2007-02-28T13:24:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	its still the same i guess i will stick with purisa, the only one that doesnt overlap. thanks for your help
2007-02-28T13:25:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	What about using xchat-gnome for irc?
2007-02-28T13:25:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	there is something about bitchx, i like it. :)
2007-02-28T13:26:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	lol, that last message was directed at you
2007-02-28T13:26:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	gotcha ;)
2007-02-28T13:34:00.000Z	pavs	toodles	: I am a genius :) (kidding) fixed it, it was courier 10 pitch. never changing again.
2007-02-28T13:34:00.000Z	toodles	pavs	Cool! Nice one :-)
