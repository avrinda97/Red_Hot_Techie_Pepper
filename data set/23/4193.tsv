2008-11-07T11:49:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	great, can you add these lines to the bottom of your /boot/grub/menu.list
2008-11-07T11:49:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	sorry /menu.lst
2008-11-07T11:50:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	sorry, add the lines listed here http://paste.ubuntu.com/68732/
2008-11-07T11:50:00.000Z	angloman	ziroday	add which lines?
2008-11-07T11:51:00.000Z	angloman	ziroday	I think I tried that and it said invalid device
2008-11-07T11:51:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	did you have this line root (hd0,1) the same
2008-11-07T11:52:00.000Z	angloman	ziroday	I had root (hd0,0) and it said invalid, so i tried editing it a few times
2008-11-07T11:52:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	I believe it should be either (hd0.1) or (hd0,2) please try it again
2008-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	angloman	ziroday	hd0,0 says invalid device, hd0,1 / 2 / 3 says no such partition 4,5,6 says invalid device
2008-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	hmm thats odd
2008-11-07T12:22:00.000Z	angloman	ziroday	I think it has something to do with the fact that windows was installed on the extended partition or something
2008-11-07T12:22:00.000Z	ziroday	angloman	not sure then sorry
