2012-05-07T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	mirak	what's the issue ?
2012-05-07T19:14:00.000Z	mirak	ikonia	i want to know more about the container raid level. I also would like to know if there is ways to reshap raid as easily as LVM allows. I have already LVM inside raid 0 volume. I am wondering if putting RAID inside LVM wouldn't help to have more possibilities of mixing raid levels
