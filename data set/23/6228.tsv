2006-05-30T10:50:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	he isn't printing from windows.
2006-05-31T10:28:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	did you restart cups after making the change?
2006-05-31T10:28:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	yes
2006-05-31T10:29:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	I also made sure my firewall was shut off just so it wouldn't get in the way for this
2006-05-31T10:29:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	can you ssh to the machine or some other kind of connection?
2006-05-31T10:30:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	yes.  Using VNC I can connect to localhost:631 on the server...but nobody else can connect to 192.168.1.3:631 (the server's IP)
2006-05-31T10:31:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	can you pastebin the Allow lines you have in your cupsd.conf
2006-05-31T10:33:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	pasted under my nick
2006-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	you realized that # comments out the line?
2006-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	yes
2006-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	I added a lot of extra lines...what I did is closer to the bottom
2006-05-31T10:35:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	you don't have a <Location> section
2006-05-31T10:35:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	you need to add the Allow lines inside the <Location> tags near the top
2006-05-31T10:35:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	yeah
2006-05-31T10:37:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	still no luck.  Under <Location /> I added Allow From 192.168.1.5 (machine I'm trying to connect from..still nothing.  Won't connect to anything on port 631
2006-05-31T10:38:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	then I'm out of ideas
2006-05-31T10:38:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	me too.
2006-05-31T10:38:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	thanks anyway
2006-05-31T10:38:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	were you following the wiki page?
2006-05-31T10:39:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	no, I installed cups and used the web interface to add some printers and then added those Allow From lines...didnt know there was a wiki.  let me check that out.
2006-05-31T10:39:00.000Z	NoUse	ShastaMaroon	search the wiki for network printing, they have guides
2006-05-31T10:48:00.000Z	ShastaMaroon	NoUse	works now :-D
