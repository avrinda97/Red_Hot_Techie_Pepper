2010-03-17T07:27:00.000Z	nixjr_		i have an external hdd with both usb and esata connections, i have to connect both at once when using esata (usb for power), how can i tell if ubuntu is using the usb or esata for data?
2010-03-17T07:28:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	no. only connect one of those cables.
2010-03-17T07:28:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	both will give power - if needed.
2010-03-17T07:28:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	esata is much faster.
2010-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	my drive dosnt not have a seperate power connection, and esata dosnt provide power, my manual says to connect usb and esata at same time
2010-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	sorry, i was wrong. you would need / want power for esata
2010-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	and. it would be wise to connect power whichever method you chose anyways.
2010-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	its a laptop sized drive 5400 and dosnt have a seperate power connector
2010-03-17T07:30:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	does esata work without power, i'm sorrry, mine can't do it without power... but i have a ext. enclosure. so i might be inncorrect.
2010-03-17T07:31:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	the usb provides the power when your using esata
2010-03-17T07:34:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	i find that odd.
2010-03-17T07:36:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	a easy way would be. see how fast files transfer. usb 2.0 goes at 480 mbits - max. and esata is much faster.
2010-03-17T07:43:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	remember all you have to do is see how fast data moves. usb acn only go 480 mbits... if the transfer is faster, than it's on esata.
2010-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	i have a problem with all my usb and sata transfers (including internal drives), they all suffer from a slowdown effect, the start of a transfer goes at a good speed, but it get progressively slower, so much so that after about 5gb+ things are crawling at <1mb/s
2010-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	i would get spinrite grc.com/spinrite and see how your HDs are (health wise)
2010-03-17T07:47:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	transfering a few large files one at a time works fine, but doing them all at once and it slows to a crawl
2010-03-17T07:48:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	also, i agree with gardar he is right.
2010-03-17T07:50:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	 are you just seeing 'burst' speeds and then they slow down maybe?
2010-03-17T07:53:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	i thinkyour drive needs love. grc.com/spinrite
2010-03-17T07:58:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	when the transfer starts - how fast is it going?
2010-03-17T07:59:00.000Z	nixjr_	thiefy	nautilus dosnt tlel me the speeds right at the start, but after a few seconds it shows up at around 50mb/s
2010-03-17T08:17:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	those speeds look normal.
2010-03-17T08:22:00.000Z	thiefy	nixjr_	i have the same.
