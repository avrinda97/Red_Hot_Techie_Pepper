2007-09-19T09:54:00.000Z	Draggin		hey hey - me again... I need some more help...
2007-09-19T09:55:00.000Z	Draggin		I've actually managed to fully install Ubuntu now (apparently), but I don't have the optino to boot to it - when I reboot, my PC just goes straight to Windows and that's it...
2007-09-19T09:55:00.000Z	Draggin		How do I change that?
2007-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	Draggin		evanlec, I gathered as much from my discussions here earlier, but I couldn't have lost GRUB - Windows was installed first and I literally just finished installing UBUNTU
2007-09-19T09:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	you need to take a look at your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2007-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	- what do I look for in there?
2007-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	paste it to pastebin !pastebin
2007-09-19T10:03:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	- hang on - there is some information here which seems to be conflicting and is confusing me a bit... The URL that you gave me shows you how to overwrite the Windows bootloader in the MBR, yet the original HOWTO that I saw online had the folowing quote:  DO NOT INSTALL GRUB in the Master Boot Record (MBR)! If you install GRUB in the MBR, all bets are off...you're on your own.
2007-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	installing GRUB in the MBR is the only way you can do a dual-boot
2007-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	- any advice or explanation on that?
2007-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	u using windows XP or Vista?
2007-09-19T10:05:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	even
2007-09-19T10:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	thats nonsense, GRUB is your friend, windows MBR is not your friend because all u can do is boot windows with it...
2007-09-19T10:09:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	ooh...u did not install it to primary partition of hd0
2007-09-19T10:10:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	no - that's where my Windows is
2007-09-19T10:10:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	yes, but that is where GRUB has to go...
2007-09-19T10:10:00.000Z	Draggin	Evanlec	yeah, I kinda get that now, but that damn howto put me off trying to do that...
2007-09-19T10:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	yea, i gotcha
2007-09-19T10:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	oops, sgd = super grub disk, google it
2007-09-19T10:12:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	yes, you can, i would say you'll have to do it from your LiveCD or with the Super Grub Disk, since you cant boot into Ubuntu
2007-09-19T10:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	from the LiveCD u can..
2007-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	yes sda1 would be correct
2007-09-19T10:41:00.000Z	Evanlec	Draggin	use nano for your text editor, its easiest, via cmd "sudo nano grub.conf"
