2009-08-18T14:41:00.000Z	kiminaiseah		hi, it is possilble to work 2 apache nodes for 1 task
2009-08-18T14:41:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	why you want this?
2009-08-18T14:42:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	slow query
2009-08-18T14:43:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	then optimize your website/script
2009-08-18T14:45:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	apache will uses for everyconnection one thread, so if you have 2 visitors, apache will use 2 threads (and 2 cpus if you have)
2009-08-18T14:47:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	why? just do a GOOD website
2009-08-18T14:47:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	which isnt using so much cpu
2009-08-18T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	maybe have a look at #httpd  but i dont think so
2009-08-18T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	you mean sql
2009-08-18T14:49:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	optimize your sql-querys. this is the right way. the wrong way is to use more hardware-power
2009-08-18T14:49:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	4 seconds for a query?
2009-08-18T14:49:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	yup
2009-08-18T14:50:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	think of a redesign :)
2009-08-18T14:50:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	my other friend telling to redesign the code and aapproach,
2009-08-18T14:50:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	apache is not the problem, the problem is the programdesign
2009-08-18T14:51:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	oic... hmm...
2009-08-18T14:52:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	i had tried her script with 10 cpu clustered node it works seamless
2009-08-18T14:53:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	it doesnt matter how much cpus you use if the programmer has no skill
2009-08-18T14:53:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	sorry but taht must be a very bad programmer
2009-08-18T14:53:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	or a gigantic website like youtube, google oder something like that
2009-08-18T14:54:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	hmm.. :( she's newbie in programming
2009-08-18T14:54:00.000Z	iceroot	kiminaiseah	yeah, so give her some good tutorials for php, sql and so on
2009-08-18T14:55:00.000Z	kiminaiseah	iceroot	she dosent use OOP approach
