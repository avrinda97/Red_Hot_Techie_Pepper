2011-02-08T13:51:00.000Z	Makuew		[09:42:41] <Makuew> whats wrong with this?
2011-02-08T13:53:00.000Z	Makuew		Seriously, nobody knows?
2011-02-08T13:54:00.000Z	Makuew		I made a network file on ubuntu desktop. It will not bring up eth0. You can see an example here: http://pastebin.com/YhFP7kEd
2011-02-08T13:55:00.000Z	Makuew		I even tried adding network,gateaway aswell to the eth0. but same thing
2011-02-08T13:56:00.000Z	Makuew		It says Dont seem to have all varibels for bringing up lo/eth0
2011-02-08T13:56:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	where did you assign those values?
2011-02-08T13:59:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	Could you reply to the post and remove it?
2011-02-08T14:01:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	I will share my config
2011-02-08T14:01:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	thanks

2011-02-08T14:05:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	Why would it give me this error then?
2011-02-08T14:05:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	at the beggining of your config i saw auto lo eth0
2011-02-08T14:05:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	it should be auto lo
2011-02-08T14:06:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	sad... did you try /etc.init.d/networking restart
2011-02-08T14:07:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	so your running under virtual server
2011-02-08T14:07:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	yea
2011-02-08T14:07:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	what if DHCP?
2011-02-08T14:08:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	Doesent work, as the network provider only supplies ipv4 subnets.
2011-02-08T14:19:00.000Z	geraldv	Makuew	sometimes this works "ifconfig eth0 IPADDRESS"
2011-02-08T14:21:00.000Z	Makuew	geraldv	yes, but what about netmask and so on?
