2007-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	HardDisk		wait there was a link I had about the skype sound issue
2007-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	HardDisk		brb let me get you the link
2007-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	HardDisk		well
2007-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	HardDisk		this is a skype issue
2007-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	HardDisk		that's why I'm planning to move to openwengo
2007-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	HardDisk		or something like it
2007-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	HardDisk		skype just doesn't develop it's linux port fast enough or care enough
2007-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	HardDisk		yea
2007-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	HardDisk		if you go to their forums you'll see
2007-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	HardDisk		because their main focus is windows mobile and pc users
2007-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	the Windows Mobile port is grotty, too
2007-05-30T11:15:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	I had to disable the default codec in the registry before it would work at all
2007-05-30T11:16:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	I'm much happier with jajah
2007-05-30T11:17:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	you use your normal phone with jajah. --- You should maybe ask the openwengo people about your registration issues
2007-05-30T11:18:00.000Z	HardDisk	soundray	well I found that other people posted on their forum with the same problems, they havent replied to those people
2007-09-19T16:13:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	on feisty?
2007-09-19T16:13:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	go to #ubuntu+1 please
2008-06-11T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	sounds like an avoided swearword ;)
2008-06-11T05:35:00.000Z	HardDisk	soundray	haha
2008-06-12T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	are you sure? AFAIK it's only in medibuntu
2008-06-12T23:59:00.000Z	HardDisk	soundray	what is?
2008-06-12T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	HardDisk	acroread
2008-06-12T23:59:00.000Z	HardDisk	soundray	oh the adobe reader..it's in the ubuntu-restricted-extras I forgot whether it's in medibuntu only or not.
