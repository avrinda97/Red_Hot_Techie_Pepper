2007-04-23T09:59:00.000Z	slavik		for login, write a script and add it to your session, for startup, you need to adds tuff to etc/rc2.d/ (or to /etc/init.d/ and then symlink
2007-04-23T10:01:00.000Z	slavik		so > instead of |
2007-04-23T10:02:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	i believe both are wrong :)
2007-04-23T10:02:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	how so?
2007-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	how is gnome like osx? top menu? its not even shared with apps. Kde like windows? kde shows right click menus everywhere and defaults to single click in many places
2007-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	location of clock and tray :)
2007-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	so they are both their own
2007-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	can you describe how each one looks without saying " try each" ?
2007-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	did you see gnome in linux mint? its configured like vista of sort, also kde with kickoff or whatever
2007-04-23T10:05:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	in that case, describe blackbox :)
2007-04-23T10:05:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	i say, icewm looks like win95 ;)
2007-04-23T10:05:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	the rest are original
2007-04-23T10:06:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	ah yes, that version, also gnome old
2007-04-23T10:06:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	they used to look as ugly as windows
2007-04-23T10:06:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	exactly
2007-04-23T10:11:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	with WoW, and Steam HL2 stuff, it runs out of the box :)
2007-04-23T10:14:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	I suggest against ATI (my current card), on my lappy (200M) I can do suspend/hibernate with ati, but can't with fglrx
2007-04-23T10:15:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	the point of choosing those chipset is to AVOID ati drivers, and use open 3d instead
2007-04-23T10:15:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	if you have the rv350 or less, you do not use ati binaries, instead use driver "radeon" and aiglx
2007-04-23T10:16:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	X800 and 200m, not supported by radeon/ati yet
2007-04-23T10:16:00.000Z	Artemis3	slavik	of course, thats why i said rv350 (r9500) or less
2007-04-23T10:16:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	by the time they are, I will be running an 8800gts (hopefully)
2007-04-23T10:19:00.000Z	slavik	Artemis3	AMD is not very open either. keep in mind the same ati management is making the decisions
