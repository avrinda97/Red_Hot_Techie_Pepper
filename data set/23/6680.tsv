2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		what is the biggest reason a computer wouldbe laggy?
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	explain "laggy"
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		oh no on ubuntu
2007-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo on my ubuntu if i have beryl running when i try to type its really laggy but apps open just fine and the cube runs very smooth
2007-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo i cant figure out the problem
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	take a look in /var/log/messages & /var/log/Xorg.0.log & google for anything that looks like an error
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		k
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	tail -f those logs while its lagging
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo how do you tail -f in terminal ?
2007-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	eg: tail -f /var/log/messages
2007-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo so its something other than the video card hopefully?
2007-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	who knows?
2007-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo yeah its just weird that everything works fine but text input
2007-07-27T06:16:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard	lietu	yeah and its not a ram problem its been pretty annoying i have to turn beryl off everytime i need to do something using typing
2007-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard	lietu	what could cause high strain ?
2007-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	you should try removing the wacom definitions in /etc/X11/xorg.conf which you don't need (back it up before you start fiddling)
2007-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo so i do need to back that up
2007-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard	lietu	yeah i've turned off the wobbly windows and other stuff im not using but i coudln't find anything else really
2007-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	start with basics - what does 'top' say your % cpu is when you have these probs?
2007-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard		frogzoo i dont know where to see that
2007-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	run 'top' in a terminal
2007-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	chrisLAbeard	lietu	yeah it does
2007-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	chrisLAbeard	it will have a line "Cpu"
