2009-10-31T23:57:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	I'm on a laptop
2009-10-31T23:57:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	Seriously, you could also kindly ask the menufacturer of the sound hardware to support Linux.
2009-10-31T23:58:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	menufacturer = manufacturer
2009-10-31T23:58:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	But what is the sound hardware on your laptop that it is not supported? Seems strange ...
2009-11-01T00:02:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	via vt1708A
2009-11-01T00:07:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	What does "lspci" say about sound or multimedia interfaces?

2009-11-01T00:24:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	any ideas about my sound problem?
2009-11-01T00:24:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	I am still waiting for that lspci output about sound and/or multimedia devices.

2009-11-01T00:28:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	did you get my lspci data?
2009-11-01T00:28:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	Sorry overlooked it at first. Got it. I am thinking, googeling and trying to solve my own problems at the same time. Please wait :)
2009-11-01T00:29:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	ok, thanks. take your time :)
2009-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	Hmm
2009-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	Hard to say from here.
2009-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	I have read on various sources that they got it running on linux. What are your symptoms?
2009-11-01T00:40:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	when I've just started up ubuntu, the internal speakers work and the sound card shows up in the sound manager. the headphone jack doesn't work though. at some point sound stops working on the internal speakers as well and the sound card disappears from the sound manager
2009-11-01T00:40:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	if I restart the system the speakers start working again but the headphone jack remains silent
2009-11-01T00:44:00.000Z	fribuntu	petew	I am sorry, I cannot help you any further with that issue. Seems to be a buggy configuration more than a driver issue. But I am not sure. Try opening a bug and hope for the best. Good luck.
2009-11-01T00:45:00.000Z	petew	fribuntu	Aww, ok. Thanks anyway, will keep searching for a solution
