2006-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser		hello. im installing ubuntu on my laptop. it has 2GB of RAM. do i really need a swap partition?
2006-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	if you want to hibernate, yes
2006-06-09T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	no, I told you that you _do_ need it if you want to hibernate
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	how much do i need to hibernate my laptop
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	as much as your RAM to be safe
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	2GB
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	is it:
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	okay, then
2006-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	jesus..
2006-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	are u sure
2006-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	yes
2006-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	state gets saved to the swap partition in hibernate
2006-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	people told me that 512 would be enough
2006-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	they weren't thinking about hibernating
2006-06-09T08:38:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	you can't guarantee that 512 is enough
2006-06-09T08:38:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	what about 1gb:
2006-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	at the moment that i would like to hibernate i just need to make sure that im note using more that 1gb of ram to be safe right?
2006-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	are you hard drive space constrained?
2006-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	ya
2006-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	again, one cannot predict exactly, so I will give you no guarantees
2006-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	could i predict it exactly just by checking how much of ram im using before try to hibernate?
2006-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntunewbieuser	maybe
2006-06-09T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntunewbieuser	tritium	i will just use it to program and browse the web.. i wont use 2gb of ram so i think 1gb will be enough
