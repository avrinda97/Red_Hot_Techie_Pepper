2010-08-13T13:06:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	You need FF 4.X +
2010-08-20T05:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	Can you help her with that ?? I've not done that before.
2010-08-20T07:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	Here's the Modem Info: http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=PCGTR3AP1&upd_id=1387&os_id=7
2010-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	Aliselyn: Instead of "make install" you probably want to run "make debprecomp" to make a .deb package for your current kernel. .deb packages are easier to remove afterward.
2010-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	Any idea why the modem isn't showing up in lspci? I think any driver is doomed to fail if the hardware isn't even listed in lspci.
2010-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	No, I dont and it is a worry Aliselyn Are you sure the modem is enabled in the BIOS ?
2010-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	It doenst ahve the Deps, that what I jsut checked wiht the Build script.
2010-08-20T09:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	The CD has build-essential and all its dependancies, I just checked.
2010-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	You want to wlak her though that part then ?
2010-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	Sure.
2010-08-20T10:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	Try installing the build-essential package while the install CD is in the drive.
2010-08-20T10:27:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	dont you need the build tools for that to buold the lernel modules though ?
2010-08-20T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	You need at the very least a C compiler and the kernel headers.
2010-08-20T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	She now has build-essential installed. Handing off back to you :)
2010-08-29T12:21:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 Only problem at the minute is, apt's not finding the repo's, she's mounted on /sda5 where she needs to be, but not finding grub-pc for install.
2010-08-29T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	The best approach is to use the grub-pc that's on her installed system by chrooting.
2010-08-29T12:23:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 I've not installed grub that way before, via chroot
2010-08-29T12:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 but the prob is, the bootloader isn't installed or not installed properly at least, on /sda5
2010-08-29T12:25:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 and somethign, beforehand has taken the windows MBR out of it's previous state, Im assuming that happened during the install initially. I wasn't in here at that point.
2010-08-29T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	I think he's running into the problem with braindead windows applications explained here: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2010/08/28#2010-08-28-windows-applications-making-grub2-unbootable
2010-08-29T12:27:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 ouch, well that would certainly be an issue if that's the case.
2010-08-29T12:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KE1HA	We're continuing the discussion in #grub since it's lower traffic.
2010-08-29T12:29:00.000Z	KE1HA	Jordan_U	 ok, brt.
