2005-11-02T16:21:00.000Z	Mabus06		basically my computer freezes when loading hotplug subsytem if my bios is set to read the geforce instead of the onboard video
2005-11-02T16:21:00.000Z	Mabus06		if you didn't remember my problem, gnomefreak
2005-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	Mabus06		what gnomefreak?
2005-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	Mabus06		just search for illuminati on that site, Magnus-swe
2005-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	Mabus06		I think he is talking about the global conspiracy HappyFool, but I don't know why he chose to come here to ask about it.
2005-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	he has discovered our secret! send out the black helicopters!
2005-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	'cd /media/cdrom0'
2005-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	try also looking in the 'places' menu, unless you need the command-line
2005-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	in ubuntu?
2005-11-06T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	isn't it perhaps running already?
2005-11-06T13:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	apt-get sometimes starts services
2005-11-24T12:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	what does 'file' think it is? ('file filename.bin')
2005-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	i mean, run the file command to find out what sort of file it is
2005-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	Mabus06	HappyFool	it says they are data files
2005-11-24T12:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	means file can't guess what they are. If you know for sure that it's a movie file, you can try mplayer/xine/vlc, but i imagine most movie files would be identified by 'file'
2005-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	Mabus06	HappyFool	it was from a torrent site but it's very popular and everybody who commented seemed to affirm it was the right movie
2005-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	sorry, i'm out of ideas
2005-12-01T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	that is easiest
2005-12-08T11:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	what hlen suggests works for me here
2005-12-08T11:24:00.000Z	Mabus06	HappyFool	well I can add shortcuts manually, but I'd prefer a variable shortcut
2006-03-24T13:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	ddd is a graphical front-end for gdb; probably a bit easier to use
2006-03-24T13:07:00.000Z	Mabus06	HappyFool	how come it says there is no /home/nick/sysdeps/i386/start ... etc when I try to open /home/nick/prog ?
2006-03-24T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	Mabus06	no idea, sorry
