2007-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	Trentster		hey all,
2007-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	Trentster		last update seems to have wacked, my kernel-generic and replaced it with kernel-386, how do I get -generic back and then recompile nvidia support for that kernel?
2007-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	synaptic
2007-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	pls elaborate
2007-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	why ? start synaptic, install kernel-generic, reboot.. that's about it
2007-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	thanks,,,
2007-02-18T12:16:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	is the only way to have proper multi core support and cpu frequency scaling working is to have generic kernel, is this correct..
2007-02-18T12:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	yes, you need a generic kernel for SMP
2007-02-18T12:28:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	how do I force install of generic kernel and install nvidia-glx for it..
2007-02-18T12:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	there is nothing to force, just install it
2007-02-18T12:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	that's because you're not *running* an SMP kernel
2007-02-18T12:29:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	ive tried..had the generic kernel running, all was well did apackage update, and it broke.
2007-02-18T12:30:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	not really helpful - "broke" how ?>
2007-02-18T12:30:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	you need restricted-modules for generic as well - get those
2007-02-18T12:30:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	ok gonna install now
2007-02-18T12:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	open synaptic, search for linux-image, check the "generic" one, search for restricted, check the same one, then install those, then reboto in to the generic kernel, THEN install nvidia-glx
2007-02-18T12:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	does generic edgy not still have issues with core 2 ?
2007-02-18T12:32:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	I don't know
2007-02-18T12:32:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	I know edgy jmicron support is stuffed...
2007-02-18T12:33:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	you reccomend i use something besides edgy if im using a core 2?
2007-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	not to my knowledge, but as I said - I seem to recall there were many issues with core 2 and the edgy kernels
2007-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	adaptr	Trentster	only one way to find out, obviously
2007-02-18T12:35:00.000Z	Trentster	adaptr	thanks.....gonna reboot and see if i can resolve
