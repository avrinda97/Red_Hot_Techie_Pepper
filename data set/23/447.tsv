2012-01-13T03:04:00.000Z	heat1		Hi, I'm having a problem with my Update Manager
2012-01-13T03:05:00.000Z	heat1		When I try to update some ubuntu packages I receive this messasage error: http://pastebin.com/sei2WsKD
2012-01-13T03:06:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	you're using the wrong distro release. feisty has been 'end of life' for ages
2012-01-13T03:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	which version of ubunt are you using? "lsb_release -d"
2012-01-13T03:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	i42n that link will not help. he has feisty ppa's added not maverick
2012-01-13T03:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	change the ppa to point towards lucid instead of feisty
2012-01-13T03:09:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	How can I do that?
2012-01-13T03:10:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	how did you add the ppa?
2012-01-13T03:10:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	What is ppa?
2012-01-13T03:11:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	how did you add the wine repository?
2012-01-13T03:14:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	I'm going to send you my repository list
2012-01-13T03:17:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	this is my repositoty list: http://pastebin.com/RzH8S3Jv
2012-01-13T03:19:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	are you there?
2012-01-13T03:20:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	you have hardy repositories added in that list. that is a great way to break your system.
2012-01-13T03:20:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  for more. i would guess the wine repository is listed there.
2012-01-13T03:21:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	yeah, But I'd like to reset that list from internet
2012-01-13T03:21:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	How can I do that?
2012-01-13T03:24:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	comment (add a #) to  lines 57 and 59 on http://pastebin.com/RzH8S3Jv  .. also look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ for other lists
2012-01-13T03:24:00.000Z	bastidrazor	heat1	also line 54.
2012-01-13T03:30:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	Thanks a lot
2012-01-13T03:31:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	You're the best, that's the solution...}
2012-01-13T03:31:00.000Z	heat1	bastidrazor	the error dissapear...
