2006-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	abbot45		i have ubuntu installed on a 10gb drive.  i also have a 40gb drive that i want to put stuff on.  is there any way to do that?
2006-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	mount the 40gb hard drive. what filesystem is it?
2006-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	i don't know that its formated.  i think it has an old linux install on it.
2006-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	grap GParted (or QTParted if you are on KDE) and format it
2006-04-25T11:48:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	how should i make the new partitions?
2006-04-25T11:49:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	however you want
2006-04-25T11:49:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	ex2 file system?
2006-04-25T11:50:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	primary or extended partition?
2006-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	ok.  so its called /dev/hde1
2006-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	now you need to mount it
2006-04-25T11:53:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	sudo mount /dev/hde1 /media/hde1 (you can make a folder in /media with the name of the place you want to mount it on if you want)
2006-04-25T11:55:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	mount point /media/hde1 does not exist
2006-04-25T11:55:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	you have to create it then do   sudo mkdir /media/hde1
2006-04-25T11:55:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	then do sudo mount /dev/hde1 /media/hde1 again
2006-04-25T11:56:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	good deal.  so that should be visible there in my file system right?
2006-04-25T12:01:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	want me to tell you how to add it to fstab?
2006-04-25T12:03:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	no
2006-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	how do i unmount that drive that i just mounted.  i want to change the mount point name to something different.
2006-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	sudo umount /media/hde1
2006-04-25T12:35:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	can the mount point be different than the name it displays under the icon.  for instance /home is displayed as Home Folder.
2006-04-25T12:36:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	you can name the mountpoint whatever you want. just sudo mkdir /media/customnamehere then mount it /media/customnamehere
2006-04-25T12:40:00.000Z	abbot45	me2win	i guess what i'm saying is.  i want to keep the mount name simple without spaces and such for command purposes, but for it to display something different under the desktop icon.  either that or get rid of the desktop icon.
2006-04-25T12:41:00.000Z	me2win	abbot45	im sure there is, but im not sure off hand how to do it
