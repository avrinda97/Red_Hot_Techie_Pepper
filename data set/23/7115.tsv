2008-12-17T07:45:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		can't find my printers... System > Prefs or Admin doesn't have Printing/Printers option.. ugh - where did it go?
2008-12-17T07:47:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		can someone help me? System > Admin/Prefs under Network Tools is supposed to list "Printing" but it does not - where did it go???
2008-12-17T07:49:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		1334 people and no one can help me with finding the Printing selection that has mysteriously disappeared??
2008-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		nope
2008-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		I thought I would find it there and it would be deselected... but it's not even there
2008-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		this is ridiculous
2008-12-17T07:51:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	make a new item
2008-12-17T07:51:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	what do I connect it to?
2008-12-17T07:51:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	that runs: system-config-printer
2008-12-17T07:52:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	work?
2008-12-17T07:52:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	"Failed to execue child process "system-config-printer" (No such file or directory)
2008-12-17T07:52:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	did you uninstall printing?
2008-12-17T07:52:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	without a doubt definitely not - it's hooked up to cups
2008-12-17T07:53:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	*facepalm*
2008-12-17T07:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	clarification?
2008-12-17T07:53:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	huh?
2008-12-17T07:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	clarification on the face palm
2008-12-17T07:54:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	what did you do for it do go bye bye?
2008-12-17T07:54:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	I seriously did nothing, I printed from it yesterday... today, I might have ran System Update, but that's it.
2008-12-17T07:55:00.000Z	ranok	CaptainMorgan	hmm, dunno, try rebooting if you did something, installing ubuntu-desktop to ensure you have all the req. packages, other than that, I have no idea, but I must be off, good luck!
2008-12-17T07:56:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	k, thanks!
2008-12-17T07:56:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	magikid oddly, I'm able to print right now - I just tested printed a document... and it printed fine... but why can't I find Printing?
2008-12-17T08:20:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ranok	thanks! I actually had to run system-config-printer-gnome/common because apparently it wasn't installed... very VERY strange... I distinctly recall it being there after system install and even after setting up the printer.... gosh
