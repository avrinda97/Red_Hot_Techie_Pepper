2012-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	bsidhipo	nullcall	what's the name of the package you want to remove?  if you don't remember, "dpkg --get-selections | grep ftp"
2012-03-29T10:13:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	now my system is starting in only CUI mode n i dont know wt i do to fix it
2012-03-29T10:13:00.000Z	bsidhipo	nullcall	what does that have to do with ftp (or dpkg --get-selections) ?  am confused
2012-03-29T10:14:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: if it's a vm, yeah :-)  that's probably why it was slow before.  because all the reads and writes have to be emulated
2012-03-29T10:14:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	my firefox and many more application removed due to this command line
2012-03-29T10:14:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: which is why xvfb would be a lot faster since it's all software framebuffer, no driving hardware involved
2012-03-29T10:14:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	i want to remove my ftpd
2012-03-29T10:15:00.000Z	bsidhipo	nullcall	what command line?
2012-03-29T10:15:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	and gadmin-ftp
2012-03-29T10:15:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	: i made "sudo apt-get remove ftp*"
2012-03-29T10:15:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: yeah, same thing :-)  vncserver implements a virtual framebuffer internally.  the reason vncserver is so big is because it is entire X server inside ;-)
2012-03-29T10:16:00.000Z	bsidhipo	nullcall	i don't know if that should have even worked :-)  ok, let's say it did, how many package did it remove?  a lot?  a few?  what?
2012-03-29T10:17:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	a lot with garaphic n firefox also
2012-03-29T10:17:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: because of dependencies.  use graphical tool or remove the virtual package
2012-03-29T10:17:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	might be apt-get also
2012-03-29T10:18:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: there's a virtual package that depends on all X server variants
2012-03-29T10:18:00.000Z	bsidhipo		thesarge: i forget what the name is ... maybe someone will chime in
2012-03-29T10:19:00.000Z	bsidhipo		i dislike c++ ... much rather use c, or objective-c
2012-03-29T10:19:00.000Z	bsidhipo		(or smalltalk)
2012-03-29T10:20:00.000Z	bsidhipo		oh it's a joke ... haha, it's late :-p  i should go to bed
2012-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	nullcall	bsidhipo	now i got cui ut i cant start GUI its asking for low graphich
