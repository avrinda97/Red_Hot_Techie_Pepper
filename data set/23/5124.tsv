2007-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	thanks! i tryed http://www.fs-driver.org/ but had some problems....
2007-02-24T10:47:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	the ext3s are inside vmware?
2007-02-24T10:48:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	not.... vmware runs on a physical partition where i have xp installed....
2007-02-24T10:50:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	let me get this straight. you want to copy files from inside vm to outside vm. ext3 -> xp
2007-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	 i have sometimes to work on some files inside my VMware machine (XP, running from a physical partition, not on a virtual disk)
2007-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	then ext3 should be fine, i reckon
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	what would you suggest to access those files inside windows Xp? because the drive would be actually loaded both inside ubuntu (ext3) and then loaded with that special tool inside Xp... could that cause problems?
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	you've just managed to confuse me. sorry. :(
2007-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	i run ubuntu and have on dev/hda2 all my data... sometimes i have to boot windows xp inside vmware (it starts from a physical disk partition inside Vmware) and access those files to work with them inside XP... which is the best way to access ext3 inside a virtual XP?
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	the XP file system is not inside a .vmware file?
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	no. it's my old XP system loaded with a special hardware profile directly from a NTFS partition /dev/hda5
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	you want to access XP from linux or vice versa
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	i would like to access linux ext3 partitions from inside the virtual XP...
2007-02-24T10:58:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	well, doesnt the virtual XP see its partiton as the "entire" disk? could it see other parts, even with explore2fs?
2007-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	my XP can see ext3 files but i wonder if that is risky... the drive is at the same time mounted in ubuntu...
2007-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	copying should be ok, i reckon, just dont modify. but then again, backiup, backup, backup
2007-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	i think i will create a networks share... sounds more secure....
2007-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	sure, good luck
2007-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	krantix	lastnode	thanks for your help! i will follow rbil suggestions......
2007-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	lastnode	krantix	sure, go for it.
