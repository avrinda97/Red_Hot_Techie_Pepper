2006-03-23T14:09:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	I already have xfce4 installed ... is there any advantage of giving it xubuntu-desktop ?
2006-03-23T14:09:00.000Z	RQ	ipfw	well try running apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and see what packages it wants to install
2006-03-23T14:10:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	yeah, guess that would be the easy way to see if it truely adds much :P
2006-03-23T14:10:00.000Z	RQ	ipfw	yup
2006-03-23T14:11:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	Wanna here something funny ... My wife use to call me all the time, asking what the heck was wrong with her computer (win2k/win98), After I got back from Iraq I slapped Linux on it, and the only thing I've had to trouble shoot was my son pulling out the cords :P

2006-03-23T14:12:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	I can't even remember what flavor/version of Linux she is running
2006-03-23T14:12:00.000Z	RQ	ipfw	did your wife kill herself?
2006-03-23T14:13:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	She complained about Linux looking different for a few minutes, then after she played with it for week she wouldn't let me put windows back on :P

2006-03-23T14:13:00.000Z	ipfw	RQ	My son loves XFCE too, he likes that he can launch apps, close them, and scroll through the desktops (he's almost 2 years old) :P
