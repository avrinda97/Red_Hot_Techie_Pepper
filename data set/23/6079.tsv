2010-02-14T05:45:00.000Z	sysdoc		xorg.conf on a fresh Karmic install reflects that the driver is "nvidia" and not "nv" what driver is this exactly??
2010-02-14T05:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	how did you install the driveR?
2010-02-14T05:46:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	I didn't, like I said it is fresh install
2010-02-14T05:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	System > Administration > Hardware Drivers  may tell you which driver is activated
2010-02-14T05:46:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	X does not load
2010-02-14T05:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	ouch
2010-02-14T05:47:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	yea suckage
2010-02-14T05:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	I thought that a bit weird too
2010-02-14T05:57:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	Well I got a bone stock POS install of Karmic that will not boot into X. Weird thing is that I have 9.10 already installed on another drive that I upgraded to 9.10 that runs just fine
2010-02-14T05:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	if it were me, I'd just do a fresh install, seems something broke.. never heard of Ubuntu installing the nvidia driver during fresh install
2010-02-14T05:58:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	Ummm this IS a fresh install...ACK!!
2010-02-14T06:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	I know, but I would do it over.. I just sense something went wrong somewhere and you never know what else may be borked once you get x working. But that's just me
2010-02-14T06:00:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	I have installed from the LiveCD and Alt CD numerous times.... Reinstall will NOT help[ anything
2010-02-14T06:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	Ah, ok I understand. Not sure how to help from here but you might try the ubuntu forums
2010-02-14T06:03:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	I have been running the buntu for 5 years... Been there done ALL that you could suggest.... Something is jacked in Xorg
2010-02-14T06:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	want to see my xorg.conf, it may help
2010-02-14T06:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	for reference: http://ardchoille42.pastebin.com/m1dcb5dfd
2010-02-14T06:04:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	I have one that works just great.... Like I said already...
2010-02-14T06:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	how can it be "working great" and "jacked" at the same time?
2010-02-14T06:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	sysdoc	nvm, got it
2010-02-14T06:06:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	I said once already the 9.10 is already installed on the machine runs great... Got to 9.10 through distro-upgrades
2010-02-14T06:07:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	Which chipset and driver are you running? Juast for grins
2010-02-14T07:19:00.000Z	sysdoc	ardchoille	U there?
