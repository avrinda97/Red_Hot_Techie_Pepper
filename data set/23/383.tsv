2012-03-06T21:19:00.000Z	VIPER-II		They dont particularly need to send/receive data with you... the only fact that u're listed in the "leecher' is enouhg... is't it?
2012-03-06T21:20:00.000Z	VIPER-II		Trevor: indeed. so this program avoids you from even connecting to those trackers?

2012-03-06T21:25:00.000Z	mneptok	VIPER-II	are you using Ubuntu?
2012-03-06T21:25:00.000Z	mneptok	VIPER-II	if so, Transmission comes pre-installed.
2012-03-06T21:26:00.000Z	mneptok	VIPER-II	i highly suggest you run it before continuing.
2012-03-06T21:26:00.000Z	mneptok	VIPER-II	i also highly suggest you take a long look at all the preference panes.
2012-03-06T21:29:00.000Z	mneptok	VIPER-II	Edit > Preferences
