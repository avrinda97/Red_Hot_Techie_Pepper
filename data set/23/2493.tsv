2009-05-28T04:22:00.000Z	elitecoder		that's my config
2009-05-28T04:24:00.000Z	elitecoder		just because it's second?
2009-05-28T04:25:00.000Z	elitecoder		ok
2009-05-28T04:25:00.000Z	elitecoder		im reading it too
2009-05-28T04:26:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	pastebin your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2009-05-28T04:26:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	I never edited it. I'll paste it now if you want.
2009-05-28T04:27:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	u need to make sure you don't ask for gateway in the dhcpclient conf file
2009-05-28T04:28:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	here it is
2009-05-28T04:29:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	remove the router
2009-05-28T04:29:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	you mean "routers" from the request line?
2009-05-28T04:29:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	then for one of the interface you add the default gw ..
2009-05-28T04:29:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	yes
2009-05-28T04:30:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	And I add that in the interfaces file?
2009-05-28T04:30:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	your /etc/network/interfaces should look something like this http://pastebin.com/d17100ada
2009-05-28T04:31:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	yes
2009-05-28T04:33:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	OHH yeah that's a bit different
2009-05-28T04:34:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	So on the secondary interface I add the default gw?
2009-05-28T04:35:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	there will be one default gw .. pick your interface and tie with it
2009-05-28T04:36:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	u can have as many gw's as you like .. just append them to the right interface.. but only one will be default
2009-05-28T04:36:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	it does not matter as long as the IP address of the interface is on a subnet that can reach the default gw
2009-05-28T04:37:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	ok makes sense.
2009-05-28T04:37:00.000Z	elitecoder	axisys	and quitte thank you guys. I'm rebooting now to see if it works :]
2009-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	axisys	elitecoder	np
