2009-03-10T07:07:00.000Z	HIjustme		Can anyone tell me how to install my INtel gfx?
2009-03-10T07:08:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	you asked that earlier.  There is nothing to do.  It is automatic.
2009-03-10T07:10:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	why?
2009-03-10T07:11:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	sure
2009-03-10T07:12:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	looks normal.  What is your concern with it?
2009-03-10T07:13:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	I have really low FPS in a online game, ET. I thought i cant have done it right
2009-03-10T07:15:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	you're definitely using Intel driver
2009-03-10T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	You have to keep in mind that Intel drivers don't perform anywhere near as well as nVidia or ATI for accelerated 3D
2009-03-10T07:16:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	ok, i was told on a forum i could give it a go
2009-03-10T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	you can, and there is a problem (see above)
2009-03-10T07:58:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	ubuntu supports intel just fine
2009-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	 which release are you running?
2009-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	8.04
2009-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	try 8.10, then
2009-03-10T08:00:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	that will work? (more fps in et) :)
2009-03-10T08:01:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	I don't know what problem you have specific to your hardware.  Intel graphics have always been supported.  At any rate, it's always best to try the latest release when you're having issues.
2009-03-10T08:02:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	how do i completely remove 8.04 so i can install a higher version?
2009-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	 you can either upgrade, or do a completely new install
2009-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	upgrade will be easier i think
2009-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	before you do either, I'd boot from the LiveCD, and see if it works as you expect it to.
2009-03-10T08:07:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	then it's working as you want it, and you can consider upgrading, or reinstalling from scratch with 8.10
2009-03-10T08:09:00.000Z	HIjustme	tritium	thanks mate, im off to bed now, 4:08am here
2009-03-10T08:10:00.000Z	tritium	HIjustme	I'll be here.
