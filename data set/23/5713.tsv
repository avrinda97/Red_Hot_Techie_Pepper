2007-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	xukun		can somebody please tel me how I can reinstall grub on /dev/hdb first partition?
2007-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	grub-install (hd1,0)
2007-09-10T06:48:00.000Z	xukun		My ubuntu os is installed on the second harddisk, but grub was installed on the mbr of the first harddisk which is now defect
2007-09-10T06:48:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	thanks that sounds easy
2007-09-10T06:51:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	if I do grub-install (hd1,0) then I get this error: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `hd1,0'
2007-09-10T06:52:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	try grub-install /dev/hdb1 then
2007-09-10T06:53:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	then I get this error: /dev/mapper/casper-snapshot does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
2007-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	are sur it's hdb not hdc ?
2007-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	*r u sure*
2007-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	I think the problem is becouse I started the live cd and the disk's are not mounted
2007-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	I don't think they need to be mounted to do that
2007-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	I see the disk if I do cfdisk /dev/hdb
2007-09-10T06:56:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	Hmm
2007-09-10T06:56:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	did you use sudo
2007-09-10T06:56:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	I did sudo -s
2007-09-10T06:56:00.000Z	xukun		then the grub command
2007-09-10T06:57:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	in fact this command can't work from the livecd
2007-09-10T06:58:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	you mean the grub-install command?
2007-09-10T06:58:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	yes, you must boot in your actual system to run it
2007-09-10T06:58:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	or maybe using chroot
2007-09-10T06:59:00.000Z	xukun	LinAsH	that is the problem my first disk which had the mbr and grub is brokken, but my ubuntu OS is installed on the second disk
2007-09-10T07:05:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	did you try to chroot into your system?
2007-09-10T07:05:00.000Z	LinAsH	xukun	did you used a /boot partition that was on your crashed disk?
