2010-03-16T00:54:00.000Z	sam555		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KarmicUpgrades is not working for me :(  I've allegedly got all the updates...
2010-03-16T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	any specific part that doesn't work for you? or you can't open the link in your browser?
2010-03-16T00:56:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	when I got to update manager, and check for updates, it does not say I have an upgrade waiting
2010-03-16T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	what version are you using now?
2010-03-16T00:56:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	9.04 ubuntu
2010-03-16T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	hmm.. no errors when you run the update?
2010-03-16T00:57:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	no
2010-03-16T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	can you pastebin the output of "sudo apt-get update" ?
2010-03-16T01:03:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com/395809/
2010-03-16T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	"sudo apt-get update"... not "sudo apt-get install update"
2010-03-16T01:05:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	my bad :(
2010-03-16T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	no worries

2010-03-16T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	if you run the update-manager and click the settings-button.. there might be a setting to only show new LTS releases.. or show all new releases.. can you see if you can find that? I think it's the same settings as "system, administration, software sources"
2010-03-16T01:11:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	looking
2010-03-16T01:13:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	unsupported and prereleased was not checking, so I'm re running the update manager via the gui
2010-03-16T01:13:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	I also tried to do an update using the 9.10 cd that was not the alternative and that did not work.  Could that be the issue?
2010-03-16T01:14:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	I don't think that should affect it.. not 100% sure though
2010-03-16T01:16:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	I looked at the upgrade-page on ubuntu.com as well.. didn't see anything mentioned about problems upgrading from 9.04.. at least nothing like your issue
2010-03-16T01:18:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	well it's installing the updates.  Maybe I should burn the alt cd and try that way incase it won't do it on it's own.
2010-03-16T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	did you try the "Upgrading using the Alternate CD/DVD" that's mentioned here? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KarmicUpgrades
2010-03-16T01:29:00.000Z	sam555	Slart	thanks for the help.  I think I'm going to do a reinstall later.
2010-03-16T01:30:00.000Z	Slart	sam555	I'm holding out for lucid lynx.. it's only a  month away or so
