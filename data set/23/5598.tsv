2007-09-14T14:29:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok all, so i added my wlan0 to /etc/network/interfaces, but i can't seem to just ifup it, where do i configure this connection?
2007-09-14T14:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	sudo ifup?
2007-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	 i get No DCHPOFFERS received. when i do that
2007-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	using wep/wpa?
2007-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	argh. you on gnome? there should be a wifi networks tool. Can you see your access point in it?
2007-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	yes i can and i can see the name of it but it has no signal and I think i added that manually
2007-09-14T14:32:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	and i take it from windows it works fine?
2007-09-14T14:32:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	yes
2007-09-14T14:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	what card again?
2007-09-14T14:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	usb, dwl-g132 by dlink, also ndiswrapper shows both drivers as being installed, says device is present
2007-09-14T14:34:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	i know that i didnt have to add anything to /etc/network/interfaces, ubuntu just found(tm) it.
2007-09-14T14:34:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	lsusb shows it, 2001:3a02
2007-09-14T14:36:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	hmm. a toughy. Never used that type of setup....... out of ideas (not that i had any really....)
2007-09-14T14:37:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	also modprobe -r ndiswrapper freezes my system every time
2007-09-14T14:38:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	argh! and i take it no native drivers for this usb card...
2007-09-14T14:39:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	i don't know how you define native, also i know i've gotten it working before on a previous installation, same hardware too
2007-09-14T14:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	ah the joys of linux. I have had that before........   native as in, not using windows drivers...
2007-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	no, im in ndiswrapper hell, but oddly ndiswrapper is reporting all is well, even iwconfig wlan0 looks right, i just can't get dchpoffers or start the connection
2007-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	hmm strange, now sudo ifup wlan0 is saying interface already configured
2007-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	all i can do is wish you good luck and may google present you with a workaround..... or here maybe...
2007-09-14T15:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	NemesisD	your dhcp server isnt restriced in its leases in any way, right?
2007-09-14T15:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	im getting destination host unreachable for my router and the computer im speaking with you on
2007-09-14T15:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	aftertaf	shouldn't be, but im using static remember
