2005-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	monkey89		reagent - maybe no one knows?
2005-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	monkey89		what's your question again
2005-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	so how do you install ubuntu then...
2005-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	I'm looking for the netinstall images...
2005-08-31T10:57:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	ftp://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
2005-08-31T10:57:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	and a howto here http://www.wrigley.me.uk/wp/?p=71
2005-08-31T10:58:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	great, thank you
2005-08-31T10:59:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	well ok ubuntu netinstall image not first result
2005-08-31T11:00:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	well I got 504 results for ubuntu netinstall image so I guessed there were no netinstall images at all...
2005-08-31T11:03:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	The link to the ftp archive is for netboot, not netinstall
2005-08-31T11:04:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	oh... but the howto mentions netinstall, doesn't it?
2005-08-31T11:04:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	by netinstall... do you mean doing stuff like that, or do you just want it to install packages from the repositories instead of the cdrom?
2005-08-31T11:04:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	yes, but I think it means netboot :). Anyway I'll look at the files and maybe it's even possible to pack them together on a cdrom
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	yeah I want to install ubuntu from an online repo using a small iso image to boot
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	if thats all you need to do, whats wrong with doing a standard install and then doing apt-get upgrade
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	I don't have a CD and it would take me 2 hourse to download the image
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	and probably just as long to download the updated files? :)
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	no we have a local mirror
2005-08-31T11:08:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	ok.  i can't say im sure how to make a custom CD... but perhaps looking somewhere (google/ubuntu forums) for install cd creation scripts might help
2005-08-31T11:08:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	ok, thank you anyway for your efforts
2005-08-31T11:13:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	ftp://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/installer-i386/current/doc/manual/en/ch05s01.html section 5.1.2 is closest to what I want to do
2005-08-31T11:14:00.000Z	monkey89	reagent	yeah, thats netboot
2005-08-31T11:14:00.000Z	reagent	monkey89	no that's boot from a kernel and initrd which is on the harddisk
