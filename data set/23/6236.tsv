2006-06-27T07:02:00.000Z	Zambezi		Does anyone know what -v (verbose) means?
2006-06-27T07:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	it prints out in the term what the command is doing while it does it
2006-06-27T07:03:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	Thanks. I'll do that. I can't get an application to work, so this might be helpful.
2006-06-27T07:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	if yu can't get an app to work, always a good idea to try running it from a terminal and see if there is any error output
2006-06-27T07:06:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	That's what I'm trying, but I can't make it work. I don't understand Linux yet.
2006-06-27T07:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	then you're in the perfect channel to learn about it :)
2006-06-27T07:09:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	I use pastebin. Is there a faster than http://pastebin.com ?
2006-06-27T07:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	yes:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-06-27T07:16:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	Here it is: http://pastebin.ca/72646
2006-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	what is that?!?!?
2006-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	Of course xxx is changed on my computer to the real ip/user/pass.
2006-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	Just help me. :-)
2006-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	I can't help you if I have no idea what that is
2006-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	What is the problem?
2006-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	It extracts files via the network to my XBOX. It won't even begin the extration.
2006-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	never heard of it
2006-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	It not common, but extract-iso doesn't work. Many experience problems so I'm trying with this instead. I really need it too work.
2006-06-27T07:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	an ISO is a finalised file system, you don't extract it, you mount it and then copy files from it
2006-06-27T07:22:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	This mounts and copies it.
2006-06-27T07:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	I've never used it so I cannot help with it
2006-06-27T07:23:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	I'm feeling desperate. I need it to work!
2006-06-27T07:23:00.000Z	Zambezi	ardchoille	But you can probably guess what I should right? Then I report to you and we make it work.
2006-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	Zambezi	find someone else to help you please
