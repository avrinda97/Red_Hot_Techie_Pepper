2010-01-13T05:58:00.000Z	kanazky		and its causing me not to be able to install ubuntu
2010-01-13T05:58:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	you can install from the alt-install cd , it's a text based installer
2010-01-13T05:59:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	could your video card be dying ?
2010-01-13T05:59:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	or your monitor ?
2010-01-13T05:59:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	still possible, that's what warranties are for
2010-01-13T06:00:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	the problem would be the driver then, can you boot hte recovery mode and reset x ?
2010-01-13T06:01:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	not even the recovery mode ?
2010-01-13T06:01:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	have youtried booting the live cd , does the computer work with that ?
2010-01-13T06:02:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	 so the  live desktop session doesn't work for you ?
2010-01-13T06:02:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	i,m thinking hardware problem here, I don'T think a reinstall will do anything
2010-01-13T06:03:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	maybe the driver caused a problem and damaged your video chip  no idea ,
2010-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	can you get in the bios ? is that display the way it should be ?
2010-01-13T06:05:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	the bois had bad colours ? you have hardware problems , nothing to do with the os or the drivers
2010-01-13T06:06:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	hardware problems you go to the store and ask for a replacement or sent it to the manufacturer for repair
2010-01-13T06:06:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	 assuming it 's still on warranty
2010-01-13T06:06:00.000Z	Pelo	kanazky	no way to tell
