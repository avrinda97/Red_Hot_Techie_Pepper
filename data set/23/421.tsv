2012-01-13T01:46:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		Hello, how can I get x11vnc to start at boot on Ubuntu 11.10? /etc/gdm/Init/Default doesn't exist.
2012-01-13T01:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 11.10 dosent use gdm by default
2012-01-13T01:48:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	What can I do to start x11vnc at boot than?
2012-01-13T01:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 11.10 uses lightdm. I tend to use other vnc clients/servers, rarely wanted to use x11vnc.

2012-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	What do you recommend I use for a VNC server?
2012-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		This is for remote support.
2012-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 totally depedns on how you are going to use vnc.
2012-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 i normally DONT want to share the 'current visiable' desktop. I want hidden seperate vnc sessions.
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 gnome has the vino vnc server built in that shares the current visible gnome desktop i belive.
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	Yes, but I do need to see the display as the user sees for my purpose.
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		it does
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		but not at boot
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 first hit for x11vnc lightdm --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1906745
2012-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 why do you need to share the login screen?
2012-01-13T01:52:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	Incase I need to get into my admin user.
2012-01-13T01:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	if you need to get remote admin access to a machine. You really should be using SSH, not relying on VNC
2012-01-13T01:53:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	I do use SSH
2012-01-13T01:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 or you can ssh in, run a vncserver as that user, then connect. No need for people to be able to see your current desktop and what you are doing as an admin. unless you are teaching a class or somthing.
2012-01-13T01:54:00.000Z	GRMrGecko		that's vnc4server
2012-01-13T01:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 x11vnc is a specilized vnc server that shares the 'current visible' desktop. MOST vnc servers DONT do it that way. they spawn their own hidden desktop.
2012-01-13T01:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	GRMrGecko	 vnc4server is one of many vncservers out there.
2012-01-13T01:55:00.000Z	GRMrGecko	dr_willis	I think I am able to figure it out from here on out, thanks for pointing me into the right direction.
