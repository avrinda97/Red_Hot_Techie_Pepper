2008-06-07T06:27:00.000Z	Bodsda		hey guys,.,.how can i tell when a file was created not when it was last modified?
2008-06-07T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 filesystem only keeps track of the one date as far as i know.  thats it.
2008-06-07T06:28:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	kk cheers
2009-05-02T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 try 'system->Preferances->display' ? each user can have their own res settings.
2009-05-02T19:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	theres no way of saving the setting from there
2009-05-05T21:42:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	you still need 'mount' somewhere in that command :)
2009-05-05T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 Hmm theres a ntfs-3g command i recall. :)
2009-05-05T21:43:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	oh, my bad,never new that did the same as mount -t ntfs-3g
2009-10-31T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 thers the screen savers AND theres  the power savers.. check both the settings for them.
2009-10-31T16:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	cheers - I have changed monitor sleep from 40 mins to never. Hope this works, cheers dude
2009-10-31T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 i noticed befor it would kick in the screen saver.. id wiggle mouse.. then it would power down the monitor. :)  it can be weird
2009-10-31T16:45:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	haha, that would be irritating.
2009-10-31T17:30:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	so what is the equivilant of /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2009-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	I'll stick to Grub1 thanks. Works fine for me
2009-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 i will stick with grub2 now that i got it booting ISO files..
2009-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	touche
2009-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	run  a 'dff' on both the files
2009-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 one just calls the other. heh
2009-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	how utterly pointless. My guess it is there for future expansion and compatibility
2009-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bodsda	 or for ease of removeale later..
2009-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	true
2009-10-31T18:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	its Â£200 isnt it?
2009-10-31T19:01:00.000Z	Bodsda	Dr_Willis	it refused to boot 'Skynet' for me... something about the end of the world, meh I wasnt expecting much from it anyway
