2009-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	balzac		I'm extremely disappointed with Sun's Java
2009-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	balzac		a travesty of licensing incompetence.
2009-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	try icedtea
2009-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	balzac		it won't work with everything
2009-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	balzac		will it?
2009-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	balzac		i just want to use a browser-based screen-sharing app
2009-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	balzac		and i looked in synaptic and i have sun's JRE installed
2009-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	balzac		but it's not in firefox
2009-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	balzac		then there's these properly licensed but technically impaired implementations
2009-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	balzac		Sun should be deeply ashamed of what they've done to java
2009-09-10T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	try: sudo find / -name "*.so" | grep java
2009-09-10T01:41:00.000Z	balzac		i'll try that ActionParsnip
2009-09-10T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	the make sure the relevant .so file is symlinked in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-09-10T01:41:00.000Z	balzac	ActionParsnip	sounds like you need to be a sysadmin to get the plugin installed
2009-09-10T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	i simply install ubuntu-restricted-extras and its all worked fine
2009-09-10T01:42:00.000Z	balzac		i'll try that
2009-09-10T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	i suggest you run: sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-09-10T01:43:00.000Z	balzac		I'd like to be a purist, but I have to compromise on codecs and java
2009-09-10T01:44:00.000Z	balzac		you know what's happening with the incompatibilities - it's active denial. people break their APIs on purpose because some suit tells them to.
2009-09-10T01:44:00.000Z	balzac		i don't know how many times i've seen something integrated which is later broken
2009-09-10T01:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	happens in all OSes
2009-09-10T01:45:00.000Z	balzac	ActionParsnip	i'm committed to Ubuntu, but it's like a political consensus building to keep people on the same page
2009-09-10T01:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balzac	i just use what works
