2011-09-12T17:07:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco		when i "apt-get upgrade" on my ubuntu11 it tries to install packages i dont even have installed instead of jus upgrading the ones i have. what should i do to upgrade just the packages i really hav?
2011-09-12T17:09:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco		hello how to make "apt-get upgrade" to only upgrade packages i realy have and dont install other packages?
2011-09-12T17:09:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	what kinds of 'other packages' is it trying to install?
2011-09-12T17:10:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	its trying to install samba, cups and many other
2011-09-12T17:10:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	those are all packages you already have installed as part of the base ubuntu install
2011-09-12T17:10:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	i already have removed them
2011-09-12T17:10:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	and it stills try to install, how o workaround it?
2011-09-12T17:10:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	right, the metapackage 'ubuntu-desktop' is probably trying to pull them in again
2011-09-12T17:11:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	solution is to apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
2011-09-12T17:11:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	though i have no idea why you would want to remove samba and cups
2011-09-12T17:11:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	i dont have printer nor share files
2011-09-12T17:13:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	it didnt worked, same thing
2011-09-12T17:13:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	sill trying to install those packages
2011-09-12T17:14:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	bcuz i dont need it
2011-09-12T17:14:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	sounds like premature optimisation to me, you aren't exaclty going to save scads of RAM or anything by uninstalling a few daemons
2011-09-12T17:15:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	ok thx anyway
2011-09-12T17:19:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	Click on networking icon, "Connection Settings", go into the settings for your WLAN connection, check the box "make this connection available to all users" and "connect automatically"
2011-09-12T17:21:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	will try that
2011-09-12T17:25:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	ty it worked
2011-09-12T17:25:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	sweet, that's three problems solved tonight
2011-09-12T17:29:00.000Z	lws	LocoenelCoco	if you can't get used to unity, you can always revert o 'ubuntu classic' at login
2011-09-12T17:29:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	yeah i know
2011-09-12T17:30:00.000Z	LocoenelCoco	lws	im just giving it a try
