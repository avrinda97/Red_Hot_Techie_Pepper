2007-07-06T10:45:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 Try to start beryl-manager again -- should be under applications somewhere
2007-07-06T10:46:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 You should just be able to pick what you want and then hit "quit"
2007-07-06T10:46:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 After you go to "swtich window manager" and hit "beryl"
2007-07-06T10:47:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 k, hmm
2007-07-06T10:48:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 what are you trying to add?
2007-07-06T10:50:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 like the burning and stuff?
2007-07-06T10:50:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 if you go to beryl settings manager and then "visual effects" on that next window, do you have "animations" listed on the left?
2007-07-06T10:51:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 do you have one called beryl settings manager?
2007-07-06T10:52:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 That's where the burning and stuff is on mine
2007-07-06T10:54:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	mine was in "beryl settings manager" > "visual effects" > "Animations" > then under "Close" I did "Burn" for #1 and #2
2007-07-06T10:54:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	And make sure animations is checked
2007-07-06T11:09:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	This is what Linux is all about, man
2007-07-06T11:25:00.000Z	Truman_	hende	 you mean in your ubuntu, or in windows itself?
