2007-04-08T16:01:00.000Z	virtuoussin13		!APIC
2007-04-08T16:01:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	apic question?
2007-04-08T16:02:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	give me an idea of your computer's specs
2007-04-08T16:02:00.000Z	virtuoussin13	xtknight	failing that?
2007-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	huh?  i need to know what your computer's specs are
2007-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	CPU?
2007-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	are there any options about HPET timers in the BIOS?
2007-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	i would check.  if there is HPET (high precision event timer), i would enable it
2007-04-08T16:04:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	come back here whatever the case and report success/failure
2007-04-08T05:26:00.000Z	virtuoussin13	xtknight	I couldn't find anything
2007-04-08T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	ohh hmm,  yeah it was HPET
2007-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	hmmm do you remember the exact error again?
2007-04-08T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	hmm.  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/54621
2007-04-08T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	tnneresting, hpet is mentioned there
2007-04-08T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	i suggest you post output to help them fix the bug
2007-04-08T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	maybe kernel options "noapic noacpi nolapic acpi=off irqpoll pci=routeirq"
2007-04-08T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	stabbing in the dark
2007-04-08T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	that actually has a good chance of fixing it, but you will lose a CPU
2007-04-08T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	lose a CPU core i mean.  only one will showup with that
2007-04-08T05:33:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	if you use those commands, they may boot your system but only one Core of your CPU will work
2007-04-08T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	try all of them i guess, or combinations of them
2007-04-08T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	virtuoussin13	those are all the debug commands i know of
