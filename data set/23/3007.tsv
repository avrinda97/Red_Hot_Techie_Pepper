2008-10-17T11:10:00.000Z	error404notfound		I have a network problem... I have this: http://pastebin.com/m60a316d4 and everytime I reboot I have to manually setup the default gateway... why?
2008-10-17T11:11:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	can you pastebin the output of sudo route -n before you have to add the route?
2008-10-17T11:12:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	restarting system...
2008-10-17T11:13:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	ok
2008-10-17T11:17:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	http://pastebin.com/m5786db4e
2008-10-17T11:18:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	what is the peth0 interface?
2008-10-17T11:19:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	that's Xen's interface...
2008-10-17T11:19:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	how can you have the same ip on both interfaces? you need to relook at the config.
2008-10-17T11:20:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	forget about peth0 if you don't know about xen...
2008-10-17T11:20:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	forget about getting your packets to go out of eth0 with that configuration
2008-10-17T11:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	also pastebin route -n after that route addition, you will see the difference
2008-10-17T11:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	the best way is to bridge the interfaces if you want to do that
2008-10-17T11:21:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	when I try to add now, I get: SIOCADDRT: File exists
2008-10-17T11:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	sorry i cant help you, i dont know anything about xen; please try the xen channel (if there is one)
2008-10-17T11:23:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	##xen
2008-10-17T11:24:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	have been there already... but it is problem that occurred today, and Xen was installed on the system for months
2008-10-17T11:25:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	does it work if you do a sudo ifconfig peth0 down ?
2008-10-17T11:25:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	nope...
2008-10-17T11:26:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	whats your route -n after you bring that iface down?
2008-10-17T11:26:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	seems same
2008-10-17T11:27:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	are you sure? sudo ifconfig should not show an ip address on peth0 (which would indicate that it is down), also ifdown peth0 should do the same
2008-10-17T11:28:00.000Z	error404notfound	outbackwifi	sudo ifconfig doesn't even show peth0 :(
2008-10-17T11:29:00.000Z	outbackwifi	error404notfound	just delete the default route that points to peth0  (if that is not connected to the outside world)
