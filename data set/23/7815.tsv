2006-12-29T09:56:00.000Z	indypende		someone can help me writing a line in /etc/fstab for an ext3 partition?
2006-12-29T09:56:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	surely someone could, but you could just look for examples.
2006-12-29T09:57:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	sorry
2006-12-29T09:58:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	surely you have an 'ext3' line in your existing '/etc/fstab' Just change the first two columns.
2006-12-29T09:58:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	i have the root partition only
2006-12-29T09:58:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	ahhhhh
2006-12-29T09:59:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	anyhow it will be something like '/dev/SOMETHING /mnt/SOMETHIN2 ext3 default 0 1'
2006-12-29T09:59:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	i want the partition to be readeable and writeable for every user
2006-12-29T10:01:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	i know the bases of fstab
2006-12-29T10:02:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	that you cannot do via '/etc/fstab', but via UNIX style permissions.
2006-12-29T10:02:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	do something like 'chmod a+rwxt' on the top directory in that filesystem.
2006-12-29T10:02:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	but there is a lot of options. defaults let only root write on the partition
2006-12-29T10:03:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	no, not at all. 'defaults' means to let anybody who has permission to write. If the top directory in that filesystem is owned by 'root' and writable only by 'root' then of course only 'root' can write to it.
2006-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	if i mount the partition in /media/data , how can i make /media data readable and writeable for normal user?
2006-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	as I mentioned, 'chmod a+rwxt /media/data'
2006-12-29T10:19:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	hi
2006-12-29T10:19:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	i do the sudo chmod 777 /media/data
2006-12-29T10:20:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	but i can't write on the directory as normal user
2006-12-29T10:20:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	it was almost the same but better to do 'sudo chmod a+rwxt /media/data'
2006-12-29T10:21:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	note that you said the filesystem was 'ext3'...
2006-12-29T10:21:00.000Z	indypende	Blissex	ext3
2006-12-29T10:21:00.000Z	Blissex	indypende	so it *must* work as indicated.
