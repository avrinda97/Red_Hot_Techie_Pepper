2004-11-17T17:42:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		seb what do you mean?
2004-11-17T17:42:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		you got problems too? is it a bug?
2004-11-17T17:43:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		when I did a dist-upgrade it removed the trash applet
2004-11-17T17:44:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		when I want to reinstall it it has to remove gnome-applets plus ubuntu-desktop
2004-11-17T17:44:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	you dist-upgraded to what ?
2004-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	are you talking about wanting the debian menu back in?
2004-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	no, I am trolling about it ;)
2004-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	you don't want it? :)
2004-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	yes, you can consider it as a request :)
2004-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	I want it
2004-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	I hope you don't succeed sorry
2004-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	succeed to what ? to trolling ?
2004-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	in getting the debian menu back in
2004-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	was one of the main reason for me to install ubuntu
2004-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	for not having it
2004-11-24T07:47:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	ubu has been pretty good with adding launchers.. so far I only had to add one
2004-11-24T07:47:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	well when I tried, they did not appeared in the list, or not even in the applications:// menus
2004-11-24T07:54:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	I find the debian menu rather hidious.. it tosses everything and anything in it
2004-11-24T07:56:00.000Z	mirak	Tsjoklat	me too. But as I said what I like is that I can just drag launcher items, and put them in the normal menu. KDE have this kind of menu handling system, and that's usable.
2004-11-24T07:56:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	that is true
2004-11-24T08:14:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	mirak	wb
