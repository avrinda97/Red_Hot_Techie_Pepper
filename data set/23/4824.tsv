2007-05-15T15:47:00.000Z	tondar		do you guys recommend automatix on feisty?
2007-05-15T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	no.
2007-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	do you mean local art or online?
2007-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	did you enable the plugin?
2007-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	local
2007-05-20T13:33:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	hm, lemme check
2007-05-20T13:33:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	what is the name of the plugin?
2007-05-20T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	that's only relevant if you want album art retrieved over the 'net
2007-05-20T13:34:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	how about local art?
2007-05-20T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	are they named .folder.jpg ?
2007-05-20T13:34:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	what they have to be named that way?
2007-05-20T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	e.g., ./Tori Amos - To Venus and Back/.folder.jpg
2007-05-20T13:35:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	I have to make a folder for each song and name the art that?
2007-05-20T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	that's one way.
2007-05-20T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	it may also support dragging n' dropping; it has been some time since I used Banshee.
2007-05-20T13:36:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	so I should manage all same album songs in a folder and put the correct image inside keeping the name convention??
2007-05-20T13:36:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	try drag n' drop first.
2007-05-20T13:36:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	drag drop art?
2007-05-20T13:36:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	right.
2007-05-20T13:36:00.000Z	tondar	crimsun	drag to where? on song?
2007-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	it uses cover.jpg.
2007-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	crimsun	tondar	see http://banshee-project.org/Guide/See
