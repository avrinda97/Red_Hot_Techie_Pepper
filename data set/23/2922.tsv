2009-04-25T09:19:00.000Z	jerbear		does jaunty support installing to an encrypted partition?
2009-04-25T09:19:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	yes
2009-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	as in... the installer creates it and installs to it?
2009-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	you need to use the alternate install CD, but yes, I'm running on an encrypted parition right now
2009-04-25T09:28:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	do i choose "encrypted lvm"?
2009-04-25T09:28:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	yeah, thats how I'd recommend doing it, then you can put your swap and root/home in that same LVM. This will let you hibernate AND have an encrypted swap
2009-04-25T09:29:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	just make sure you have a small /boot partition outside of the encryption
2009-04-25T09:29:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	how do i set that up?
2009-04-25T09:30:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	you mean how to set up the /boot outside the encryption or how to set up the LVM?
2009-04-25T09:30:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	in particular, the /boot partition. and anything else i need to know to set it up
2009-04-25T09:31:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	before you make the encrypted parition, make a small (150M should be fine) partition for boot.  Set it's mount point at /boot.  Then when you create the encrypted partition, you can say "use the rest of the space"

2009-04-25T09:32:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	can i create it from the boot cd?
2009-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	yeah, you just create a regular partition, formatted ext3, that you set as "/boot."  The installer will take care of putting all the files in there, all you have to do is create it.  Normally the installer makes all this stuff it self, but when you do encryption you need something that isn't encrypted that can run stuff to decrypt the rest of the system
2009-04-25T09:34:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	where do i go in the boot cd to get to fdisk? or an equivalent?
2009-04-25T09:35:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	If you use the Alternate Installer, when you get to the step about "partioning the drives" if you select custom, it has a good GUI for creating all the encryption/LVM stuff
2009-04-25T09:35:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	ok
2009-04-25T09:39:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	bootable flag for /boot?
2009-04-25T09:39:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	yes
2009-04-25T09:40:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	ok, i created the /boot but it wont let me commit the changes unless there's a root partition
2009-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	have you created the encrypted parition, an LVM VG inside of it, LV's for root?
2009-04-25T09:42:00.000Z	jerbear	inasmu	no, i went to manual, created /boot. trying to get back to the menu that had "encrypted lvm" now
2009-04-25T09:42:00.000Z	inasmu	jerbear	hang on, I'll quickly launch the alternate install so I can remember the exact steps
