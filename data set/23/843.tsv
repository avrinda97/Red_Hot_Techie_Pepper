2011-01-15T15:11:00.000Z	Sheepherd		top right i mean :)
2011-01-15T15:13:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	you want the mail notification to detect thunderbird?
2011-01-15T15:14:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	yea i think so.
2011-01-15T15:15:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	Ok, give me a second, I'll try to see what I can find out about that
2011-01-15T15:16:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	thanks alot
2011-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	Ok, are you ready?
2011-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	yessir
2011-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 What you first want to do is head over to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/indicators-for-thunderb-223374/      and install the extension
2011-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 then In Thunderbird, go to Tools > Add-ons, click the Install button, locate/select the file you downloaded, and click OK.
2011-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	You will note that the envelope indicator will be green when you get new mail,
2011-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 If you get an error msg complaining that libnotify-bin must be installed then type in:  sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin      in the terminal to install libnotify
2011-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	wow great it works!
2011-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 yay, im glad your problem is resolved
2011-01-15T15:26:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	but now do i remove those old evolution mail entries?
2011-01-15T15:27:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 what do you mean? To remove your accounts from Evolution, open up the program, manage accounts and delete the accounts.  Or do you mean something else?
2011-01-15T15:29:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	thats what i mean http://img.xrmb2.net/images/590539.png
2011-01-15T15:30:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 Oh I see, you want to remove that entry.  Hmm give me one second, ill try and figure it out
2011-01-15T15:31:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 Ok, type open up the terminal and type in:  sudo apt-get remove evolution-indicator
2011-01-15T15:32:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 Let me know if that works or not, another option may be to remove Evolution as a whole (since you use Thunderbird anyways)
2011-01-15T15:33:00.000Z	Sheepherd	edified	ive already removed evolution. but i logout to see if it works
2011-01-15T15:37:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	 Ok, let me know, but do try the command I send over: sudo apt-get remove evolution-indicator
2011-01-15T15:47:00.000Z	edified	Sheepherd	peace.  good luck
