2007-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	kmcq__		wow does no one know?
2007-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	kmcq__		great.
2007-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	which loading screen ?
2007-07-08T08:42:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	could be any of several reasons.  first guess is that you changed the  'vga=' line  ?
2007-07-08T08:42:00.000Z	kmcq__	intelikey	 no, i dont believe so
2007-07-08T08:43:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	grep vga /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-07-08T08:43:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	that's xorg has nothing what so ever to do with usplash
2007-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	grep vga /boot/grub/menu.lst   <<<< run that
2007-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	if it outputs one line show me      if more than one, don't flood the channel
2007-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	is that the only one
2007-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	kmcq__	intelikey	 lets talk in pm, it will be easier
2007-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	not for me it wont
2007-07-08T08:46:00.000Z	kmcq__	intelikey	 yes its the only line
2007-07-08T08:46:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	ok then the reason is because the initramfs image is not starting framebuffering and the link from ubotu will tell you how to fix it    "maybe"
2007-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	kmcq__	intelikey	 so any idea why it was broken to being with?
2007-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	i don't call not starting framebuffering "broken"  so no
2007-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	yes indeed that could explain it.
2007-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	kmcq__	intelikey	 is there a file i can modify to allow me to see the usplash?
2007-07-08T08:49:00.000Z	intelikey	kmcq__	look at the message from ubotu
