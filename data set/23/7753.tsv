2005-05-07T12:37:00.000Z	Determinist		erm , the ubuntu devs are really into python , arent they? lol
2005-05-07T12:38:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	seems so and it makes Ubuntu so charming :)
2005-05-07T12:42:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	how about installing libapache2-mod-php4?
2005-05-07T12:57:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	pardon sir , but i have not been able to locate libapache2-mod-php4
2005-05-07T12:57:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	what does synaptic provide, when you search for php?
2005-05-07T12:58:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	nothing , empty search , no packages found
2005-05-07T12:58:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	alright , thanks
2005-05-07T13:02:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	well on my system (Hoary) it is located in section "Internet" in synaptic. I am using vanilla Ubuntu Hoary and just added restricted. But it ought to be available on your system.
2005-05-07T13:02:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	what does your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?
2005-05-07T13:03:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	havent had a look at it yet , brb tho , i'll check
2005-05-07T13:06:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	no internet section under synaptic here
2005-05-07T13:06:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	strange...
2005-05-07T13:07:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	can you paste me your sources.list in a query? there must be something wrong with it...
2005-05-07T13:07:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	http://rafb.net/paste/results/RlAoub60.html
2005-05-07T13:08:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	guess I found it... moment please. :)
2005-05-07T13:09:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	okay.. here we go. Comment out the line with the Ubuntu CD. Just put an # in front of it. Then insert "deb http://il.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted" into it. do apt-get update and then apt-get install php4 ... this should do it.
2005-05-07T13:10:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	background is... php4 is part of Ubuntu in general, but not on the cd. And synaptic browses your local "database".
2005-05-07T13:10:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	i see
2005-05-07T13:13:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	did it work for you?
2005-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	still playing with it , one moment please
2005-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	no need to hurry. I was just curious. :)
2005-05-07T13:15:00.000Z	Determinist	fitheach	yes sir , it did work , thank you very much :)
2005-05-07T13:15:00.000Z	fitheach	Determinist	fine. I am pleased I could help you.
