2009-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	lws		pqwerl: Hmm.   Well I have the net right now anyways, so it should be good if I could get these dependencies to resolve.
2009-10-31T00:53:00.000Z	lws		pqwerl: I'd like to just force upgrade all the packages.   There shouldn't be any conflicts once -- and I"m booted from the live CD now anyways since it fubared everything
2009-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	lws		Halaband: That's not a karmic problem likely.   You probably have your regular DNS as your first entry in resolv.conf which is no longer accessible due to the VPN.    It has to time out before it moves on
2009-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	lws		Halaband:   I've had similar problems when NOT connected to VPN due to the remote DNS being inserted first.
2009-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	lws		Halaband: Make sense?
2009-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	it's 'Halabund' (use tab completion).  (I'm saying that just so I don't miss your replies)
2009-10-31T00:55:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	Terribly sorry, I've got my comp hooked up to a crappy TV at the moment.
2009-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	I didn't mess with DNS settings.  Everything worked fine with Jaunty (and it works fine in Windows).  The first entry in resolv.conf is actually from the VPN.
2009-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	There's no logical reason why DNS would be slow over VPN unless it's trying to use the wrong DNS server.
2009-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	Do you still have a jaunty install to test it?   It could just be their DNS is acting up coincidentally.
2009-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	Or windows even
2009-10-31T00:59:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	I checked the the settings in Windows, and it seems to use the same DNS servers as Karmic, in the same order.  Actually Karmic also has the 3 old DNS servers (which are not from the VPN) listed at the end of resolv.conf.  I don't have Jaunty any more, I upgraded it to Karmic.  Does the system try to use the DNS servers in the same order as they appear in resolv.conf?
2009-10-31T01:00:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	and a strange thing is that not all programs are affected.  XCHat connects very quickly.  Unfortunately Firefox and apt-get are affected.
2009-10-31T01:01:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	that is weird.   I wonder if Karmic added some other place programs get DNS information...?
2009-10-31T01:01:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	that's what my resolv.conf looks like. http://pastebin.com/d3dd46744
2009-10-31T01:01:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	the 129.* are from the VPN.  ipconfig /all in Windows lists the same two DNS servers for the VPN
2009-10-31T01:03:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	also, the third and fifth server don't work when I'm connected to the VPN (I tried testing them with nslookup.  I hope I did it right.  Using nslookup was a bit confusing)  So there are (may be) two DNS servers that don't work.  Maybe it's trying to use them for some reason.
2009-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	"host" is easier to use FYI.
2009-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	I wonder if it's possible to edit resolv.conf by hand.  Does anyone know if this is possible and if it is necessary to do anything special to make the settings take effect?
2009-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	Halabund	lws	Thanks, I'll take a look at man host
2009-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	It's very possible, that's what I was suggesting.   Hypothetically the dns libaries read it whenever a program is launched
2009-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	So if you connect to vpn and leave firefox on you would have problems... for example.
2009-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	lws	Halabund	Man resolv.conf, it's format is really trivial
