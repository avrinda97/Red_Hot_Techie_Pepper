2008-11-27T22:47:00.000Z	atari		is it possible to add a shell script to the network manager to execute instead of a device or so?

2008-11-27T22:48:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	you can mark a connection not to start by default
2008-11-27T22:49:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	i have a script for VPN. now i'd like to use them
2008-11-27T22:49:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	you can setup the VPN in the network manager as well
2008-11-27T22:49:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	it is easier since you do not have to sudo each time you need the VPN
2008-11-27T22:50:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	can youu tell me how? i have a working config for openvpn but i cant add it to the network manager
2008-11-27T22:50:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	I'm sorry, I thought it was cisco's vpnc
2008-11-27T22:50:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	nope :/
2008-11-27T22:51:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	search if there is a package for network-manager and openvpn
2008-11-27T22:51:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	yes there is
2008-11-27T22:51:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	but i cant add the existing config
2008-11-27T22:52:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	 :( no option at right-mouse on network-manager -> VPN->new?
2008-11-27T22:52:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	sorry: left mouse btn
2008-11-27T22:52:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	sure. i can add it. but the plugin doesnt accept the config...
2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	i dont know where the debug mode is to find out whats going wrong
2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	and you cannot fillin the data?
2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	thats not that easy...
2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	I don't know, it was soo easy to setup vpnc through nm....
2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	atari	Guillem	i need more options than these in the form. thats why i'd like to use the existing config
2008-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	OH, bad news I guess then. This happened to me with the previous network-manager... with this new one, I can setup all the things I need for my vpnc case.
2008-11-27T22:56:00.000Z	Guillem	atari	have to go... good luck....
