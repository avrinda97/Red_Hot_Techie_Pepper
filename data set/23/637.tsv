2011-07-01T22:57:00.000Z	engammalsko		Hi, I wanna acces a folder (var/www) With a normal user instead of root. How do I do this?
2011-07-01T22:58:00.000Z	engammalsko		I changed permission, I can't still add files to the folde.r
2011-07-01T22:59:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	you could add the group of the folder you want to access to the groups of the user you want to access with
2011-12-08T03:17:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	there is no gnome-panel in 11.10. there is gnome-shell or gnome-fallback
2011-12-08T03:18:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	I used install gnome-shell, gnome-panel and gnome-tweak tool and change to gnome berfore signing in.
2011-12-08T03:19:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	Isn't the gnome-panel installed after that?
2011-12-08T03:19:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	there is no gnome-panel. there is gnome3 and gnome3-fallback. what you know of as the "panel" is gone
2011-12-08T03:20:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	You can install gnome 2.
2011-12-08T03:20:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	no you cannot
2011-12-08T03:24:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	if you really want gnome2 and the customizable panel then you either need to check out gnome3 extensions or start looking for a different desktop environment or distribution. if you have some question about how gnome3 works let us know what it is

2011-12-08T03:30:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	That's gnome 2 on 11.10. The clock is placed weird and there is no show desktop nor a trash can.
2011-12-08T03:31:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	there is no gnome2 on 11.10. that looks like fallback, and it looks normal
2011-12-08T03:31:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	Okay then I got it wrong I guess. Can i make fallback look like gnome 2?
2011-12-08T03:32:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	not really. gnome3 is not intended to be as configuratble
2011-12-08T04:31:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	the whole part of gnome fallback is to not have the unity dash or gnome-shell expose
2011-12-08T04:31:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	gnome fallback is there to approximate the old gnome-panel layout
2011-12-08T04:32:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	I know. I just wondered if I could open it in the terminal.
2011-12-08T04:35:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	How do I add System to the panel?
2011-12-08T04:35:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	what do you mean "add System"?
2011-12-08T04:36:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	To the menu in the top left with "Program" and "Places"
2011-12-08T04:36:00.000Z	escott	engammalsko	you can't
2011-12-08T04:36:00.000Z	engammalsko	escott	Argh.
