2010-05-18T17:58:00.000Z	DexterF		how do I make gnome remember sessions? I' all kde/xfce, decided to check how gnome's doing lately and the 10.04 test install just comes up with an empty desktop after each reboot
2010-05-18T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	its under the startup items applications in preferences
2010-05-18T17:59:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	is that a list of apps to be started or real session management?
2010-05-18T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	yes but click the options tab in the same app ;)
2010-05-18T17:59:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	ill check, thanks
2011-01-18T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	its still in the reops, it's just optional now
2011-01-18T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	how is it depreciated?
2011-01-18T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	debian isnt ubuntu
2011-01-18T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	no they arent stable at all, its very experimental
2011-01-18T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	it is necessary in some cases but your driver may not work with the version of xorg it gives
2011-01-18T06:33:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	well, it's just that the ones that come with the dist are outdated
2011-01-18T06:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	it's your choice, the X server is working isn't it?
2011-01-18T06:34:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	its for a video box and hence should run vdpau the best it can
2011-01-18T06:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	the vdpau team ppa may help
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	never heard of. where..?
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	you'll find it if you search
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	did
2011-01-18T07:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	both wil do the same thing, the gui just gives a pretty gui
2011-07-14T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	kill the x server process should do it
2011-10-22T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DexterF	check system76
2011-10-22T22:07:00.000Z	DexterF	ActionParsnip	mh, nice, thanks
