2012-05-09T18:49:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	thanks for the info
2012-05-09T22:25:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	whats wrong with the 2x series?
2012-05-09T22:28:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	mosaic functionnality is broken
2012-05-09T22:28:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	mosaic? new one on me
2012-05-09T22:28:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	i don't mind installing 10.04 if that solves it.
2012-05-09T22:29:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	mosaic? or that it's broken?
2012-05-09T22:29:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	never heard of it in connection with vlc
2012-05-09T22:29:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	only the little tiles in art
2012-05-09T22:29:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	it allows you to put multiple videos in one
2012-05-09T22:30:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	but maybe you have another working solution: i need to import a stream, capture from a device, put both vids side-to-side, and stream the whole thing online.
2012-05-09T22:31:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	sorry, i'm not quite that advanced
2012-05-09T22:32:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	and about installing vlc 1.x?
2012-05-09T22:32:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	i think you mentioned your best bet: use 10.04 (in a vm if you want)
2012-05-09T22:33:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	auronandace and then, simply apt-get install vlc will be the correct one?
2012-05-09T22:33:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	yes
2012-05-09T22:33:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	it is in the repos
2012-05-10T15:15:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	i see you're still online, maybe you have a quick fix for me ^^
2012-05-10T15:17:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	i'm trying to install a driver for a external video aquisition connected through firewire
2012-05-10T15:17:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	i have no experience with firewire
2012-05-10T15:18:00.000Z	gaston_	auronandace	oh then forget it, thanks anyways :)
2012-05-10T17:56:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	you can use a ppa but we can't support you if it goes wrong
2012-05-10T18:32:00.000Z	auronandace	gaston_	or use a ppa, which we can't support if it goes wrong
