2009-09-23T13:31:00.000Z	gp5st		 i have a macbook pro, i installed ubuntu on it, and used ntfstools and gparted to make a 3rd partiion on the same drive ntfs, but the mac os won't recognize that it's formated
2009-09-23T13:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	What verion of OSX, IIRC OSX only natively supports reading NTFS, and only recently at that
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	Yes, just not write
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	No
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	It's less than ideal
2009-09-23T13:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	There isn't
2009-09-23T13:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	What exactly is the problem you are having with ntfs-3g on OSX ?
2009-09-23T13:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	I didn't give you a link, and I am pretty sure there is no way currently to write to a journaled hfs+ partition from linux
2009-09-23T14:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	That's interesting, that patch is years old and so probably won't work with a current kernel, but there may be a more up to date patch available. That it's not in mainline though suggests that its not high quality
2010-09-24T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	What version of Ubuntu, and are you sure you need to install the bootloader to a partition? Grub should be able to boot all your various operating systems, and installing to a partition requires blocklists which are unreliable.
2010-09-24T13:03:00.000Z	gp5st	Jordan_U	it's my guess.  It's a mac pro using efi.  I um have efi seeing the partition (as a legacy os, not as linux, which bothers me) and when I go to that partition toboot it says "os not found" I'm running 10.04 (upgraded continuously since like 8.x).  I had a disk almost fail, so i reinstalled mac os to another disk (so that i could set up refit to allow me to boot other OS's and have an efi shell.  Then I just copied all the files over and set
2010-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	You should install to the mbr, but only grub2. I'm not sure if grub legacy deals with GPT properly, but I know grub2 does.
2010-09-24T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	Follow this guide: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-09-24T13:05:00.000Z	gp5st	Jordan_U	thanks. how do i not find these links:(
2010-09-24T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	If you can, you should also create a BIOS boot partition http://grub.enbug.org/BIOS_Boot_Partition (but head the warning at the bottom of the page).
2010-09-24T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	You're welcome.
2010-09-24T13:34:00.000Z	gp5st	Jordan_U	thanks, with a little googling I think I got it all working
2010-09-24T13:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	You're welcome.
2010-09-24T14:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	You should install to the mbr, not to a partition. And be sure you have a BIOS boot partition. That's hte only way to get a truly reliable configuration (though I'm surprised it's failing quite that often).
2010-09-24T14:33:00.000Z	gp5st	Jordan_U	instead of grub-install /dev/sda3 i did grub-install /dev/sda and it seems to work and didn't mess up the other os's. sorry i'm still a  n00b at grub and the fine art of partitions and disk structure:(
2010-09-24T14:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	Np, there are still a lot of people who recommend, incorrectly, to install grub2 to a partition with intel macs. The only reason, as far as I can tell, is that grub *legacy* used to overwrite the GPT data when you did this as it doesn't understand GPT. Grub2 has no such problem, but it's still a very common misconception.
2010-09-24T14:36:00.000Z	gp5st	Jordan_U	thanks:)
2010-09-24T14:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gp5st	You're welcome :)
