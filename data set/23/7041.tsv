2005-10-26T09:58:00.000Z	termin8tor	pybe	: Thanks i'll check that out

2005-10-26T09:59:00.000Z	termin8tor	pybe	: I mean a FLASH utility which i can use to flash a firmware onto a drive
2005-10-26T10:00:00.000Z	pybe	termin8tor	whats sort of firmware?
2005-10-26T10:01:00.000Z	pybe	termin8tor	would touch anything else other than what the manufacturer provides other wise you will kill you device most likely
2005-10-26T10:01:00.000Z	termin8tor	pybe	: The device is already dead from a bad flash
2005-10-26T10:01:00.000Z	pybe	termin8tor	nice
2005-10-26T10:10:00.000Z	pybe	termin8tor	I can extract one for you and put it somewhere to download
2005-10-26T10:11:00.000Z	termin8tor	pybe	: I'd really appreciate that a lot =)
