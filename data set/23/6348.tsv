2006-05-05T06:52:00.000Z	sharpy		how do i install an applet that monitors my network/cpu/mem ? I dont have such applets in kubuntu?
2006-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	gkrellm
2006-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	"sudo apt-get install gkrellm"
2006-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	i tried that but it's too BIG. i would like something that just sits on my main bar.
2006-05-05T07:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	Try gdesklets (I think thats it)
2006-05-05T07:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	Don't like gkrellm?
2006-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	apt-getting it... No gkrellm is too big and bulky and it sits right on my desktop.
2006-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	You can close it/skin it you know
2006-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	when u say close...it sits on my dock apps?
2006-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	I mean, hit right click and then click close
2006-05-05T07:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	It doesnt sit in your dock, as far as I know. You might be able to get a mod for it though
2006-05-05T07:02:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	hmm. Sounds like you like it.
2006-05-05T07:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	I do :P
2006-05-05T07:03:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	i just want the basics not a system wide stats sit-on-my-beautiful-desktop app.
2006-05-05T07:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	The cool thing about it is this, if you're on someone else's computer in a different nation, you can use gkrellm to monitor your computer still
2006-05-05T07:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	That, and you can go and add or remove things you want from the list (eg, CPU and net, but not disk or ram
2006-05-05T07:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	But gdesklets I think is another app you might like
2006-05-05T07:04:00.000Z	sharpy	rukuartic	I might use it if it's transparent or blends in with my desktop.
2006-05-05T07:07:00.000Z	rukuartic	sharpy	gdesklets is a pretty slick looking thing
