2004-10-04T09:05:00.000Z	toyowheelin		hello, dose anyone know how to specify what sound card to use in this os? I have 2 sound cards and I think it just automaticly chose one but its the wrong one
2004-10-04T09:06:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	thats a good one
2004-10-04T09:06:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	first, run gstreamer-properties and switch everything to use ALSA instead of OSS
2004-10-04T09:14:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	after you did that gstreamer thing, you need to quit all apps using the sound card
2004-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	yeah, 2 for ALSA and 2 for ALSA emulating OSS
2004-10-04T09:19:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	?
2004-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	what'd you do?

2004-10-04T11:22:00.000Z	toyowheelin	subterrific	I kinda feel bad making demands on the development team because I have so little to offer to projects but this is one thing that should definately have a gui tool :)
2004-10-04T11:24:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	it should. sound is something that needs to Just Work, and ALSA is getting really close to making it happen, but its so new still

2004-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	subterrific	toyowheelin	that doesn't seem like an app you'd put on a desktop system
