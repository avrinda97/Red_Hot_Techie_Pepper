2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	petrik		Thanks Jowi
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	petrik		Can anyone help me with this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14622
2006-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	sounds like maybe your kernel modules arnt installed properly, so there was no /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/ like there was supposed to be?
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	How would I go about fixing that? I guess I'm on the right track with what I'm doing there then
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	im not sure what your doing, or if your on the right track. just judging from the "make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop."
2006-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	what is it you are installing, exactly?
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	What I belevie is some drivers for webcams in a hope to get mine going. At the moment it freezes the system as soon as I try to turn it on
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	ahh
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	what directories are in your /lib/modules/ directory?
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	2.6.12-9-386 and 2.6.12-10-386
2006-05-27T16:22:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	hmm. sorry i'm not sure where 'build/' comes from
2006-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	you should avoid that stuff until you are really good with linux IMO
2006-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	How do you become good at it if you don't do these things?
2006-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	baby steps
2006-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	you dont even really unedrstand what SHOULD be on its own partitions and things until you have used it a while
2006-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	read a lot, and explore your filesystem, figure out what everything in /usr/bin does, for example. read about what /usr and /usr/bin and /bin and /lib and all those are for.
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	Well I guess it is the M$ mentality. I want to get my data on different drives
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	i like to make a directory called /data on another drive, and then i make dirs there for anything i want to keep, and symlink that to the real filesystem where things i want to not loose go (for example /home and /var/lib/mysql)
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	but its one of those things every system admin has their own ways and only experiance gets you there
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	but until your an expert at the commandline and copying files and things, you should avoid moving important system files around
2006-05-27T16:43:00.000Z	petrik	Rubin	Will go and study up on access paths now to figure out how to format this drive in diskmanager
2006-05-27T16:44:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	as far as formatting, use fdisk to make the partition, and mkfs to make a filesystem on it
2006-05-27T16:44:00.000Z	Rubin	petrik	man the following: fdisk, mkfs, cp, mv, ln, fstab, mount
