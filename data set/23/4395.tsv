2008-10-29T02:19:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	sudo aptitude install atd
2008-10-29T02:20:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	Couldn't find package "atd".  However, the following
2008-10-29T02:21:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	packages contain "atd" in their name: <long list without anything to do with at'
2008-10-29T02:22:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	my mistake, if you're talking about the tool to start commands with a delay, it's sudo aptitude install at
2008-10-29T02:22:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	it will run a daemon called atd ;)
2008-10-29T02:22:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	No candidate version found for at
2008-10-29T02:23:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	that's fishy.
2008-10-29T02:23:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	can I not just find a link to the .deb somewhere?
2008-10-29T02:24:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	goolge for 'at' is a mistake. lol
2008-10-29T02:24:00.000Z	aurel42		ubun: packages.ubuntu.com/at should help, but it would be better to fix the underlying problem.
2008-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	like make sure that your package manager has all the necessary package sources or something like that.
2008-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	I got to this page, but don't see anything but a "source" download.  http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/admin/at
2008-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/i386/at/download -- if on i386
2008-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	oh, duh. :)
2008-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	but still, you shouldn't need to.
2008-10-29T02:27:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	maybe my sources.list is missing a repo
2008-10-29T02:27:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	have you tried refreshing your package list (in your package manager or using "sudo apt-get update")
2008-10-29T02:27:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	yeah
2008-10-29T02:27:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	if so, it's not "a repo", it's "the main repo that you cannot live without".
2008-10-29T02:28:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	well this is a work system, so they have apt-proxy.  But I just did an apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and it worked.
2008-10-29T02:28:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	fishy.
2008-10-29T02:29:00.000Z	ubun2	aurel42	btw, downloading and isntalling the .deb fixed the problem (original one anyway)
2008-10-29T02:29:00.000Z	aurel42	ubun2	excellent
