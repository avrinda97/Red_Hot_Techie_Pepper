2011-09-30T13:20:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	Use the package manager
2011-09-30T13:22:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	i just removed the package and install it manually each time
2011-09-30T13:22:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	'cos 6 was horrible when it first came out
2011-09-30T14:13:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	 What is the actual essid of ajah's wireless router?
2011-09-30T17:10:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	We should see what lspci says about it.
2011-09-30T17:13:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	ionite  Realtek 8172  is a wifi NIC, I'm pretty sure.
2011-09-30T17:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	yes i know
2011-09-30T17:14:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	maybe hes unloaded the module when trying to compile a new driver (which is what he was doing when i stepped in)
2011-09-30T17:15:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	That's possible.  I see discussion Ubuntu forum about Realtek 8172 Wireless but it's a couple years old.  That indicates to me that it's supposed to just work now.
2011-09-30T17:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	yes that what i think too :)
2011-09-30T17:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	whats funny from this post of Jan 11 is that they've recommended compiling a driver for the 8192 as a workaround  -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1665892
2011-09-30T17:22:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	I see...  "driver=rtl819xSE"
2011-09-30T17:23:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	I think you're right, he probably  needs rtl819xSE

2011-09-30T17:29:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	he seems to have the correct module (8192se)
2011-09-30T17:29:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	Oh?   What does iwconfig say?
2011-09-30T17:30:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	I see:  r8192se_pci    I guess that is it...
2011-09-30T17:56:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	Is he on  Ubuntu 11.04 ?
2011-09-30T17:56:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	im assuming he is
2011-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	usr13	phlak_user	g0rs Or just connect directly.
2011-10-11T18:21:00.000Z	phlak_user	usr13	he's talking about M$SQL (SQL Server?)
