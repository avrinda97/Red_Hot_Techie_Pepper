2010-10-03T13:39:00.000Z	mert_d		someone can tell me please which files on ubuntu has the options of "open with" menu for different filetypes ?
2010-10-03T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 i dont think its one file. its a database generated from the various .desktop files.  the ubuntu-tweak program has a consoladated front end to set a lot of those from one location. Which can be handy.
2010-10-03T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 sounds like you shoudl check out 'ubuntu-tweak' then
2010-10-03T13:41:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	i tried ubuntu-tweak but it can not make many thinks. it is better to do one by one from nautilus :)
2010-10-03T13:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 make many thinks? Huh?
2010-10-03T13:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 it has them organized into a better layout..  Other then that. ive never noticed any other tools to let you change the ghings.
2010-10-03T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 Theres proberly somne gfonf settings to let you set the defaults, but ive never messed with the gconf editor for that part
2010-10-03T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 im not clear on what you are needing to do exactly.
2010-10-03T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 its not a directory. the gconf stuff is gnomes version of the ssytem reguiestery.
2010-10-03T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 there Might be some dirs that have some settings.. but ive never noticed any, They would be in the natutilus directories i imagine
2010-10-03T13:46:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	 hmm i had to find them thank you!
2010-10-03T13:47:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	you told me that you did not understand me. on my ubuntu even 7z or many many udio files are not asscociated with any applciation. but vlc can open most of them. i know.
2010-10-03T13:47:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	that is my problem. i will backup my system but before that i want to associate many application for many filetypes.
2010-10-03T13:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 the file --> /usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop
2010-10-03T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 defines what default mimetypes are set for vlc by default
2010-10-03T13:50:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	there is no vlc.desktop file on that directory. i just have VLC MEDÄ°A PLAYER which opens vlc media player applcaiton.
2010-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 odd.. try 'locate vlc.desktop' and see where yours is.
2010-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 the locate command will find it for you
2010-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 the .desktop files define the default mimetypes those programs are set for. you could edit the mimetypes enntry and add new filetypes if you wanted to do this system wide for all users. Personally i just right click on files and set them what to open with. :)
2010-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	 i think i can not explain you the problem :) look lets start again :) i know that i can do everything with "open with" menu from nautilus. but many times i don't know which programs can open it properly for filetypes (which i don't see them before). Additional, it will be very nice if i can see on the "open with" menu the possibilities of the applications which can open that filetype properly. That is my problem. sorry for my english :)
2010-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 that list is generated from the various .desktop files. if the .desktop file dosent give out the info. theres no way the system knows that some new file extensioon can work with vlc, or whatever. you will juat have to learn and add the ones you need.
2010-10-03T14:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mert_d	 if vlc should also be in the list for various video formats that  its not.. then you could file a bug report. and it may get added to the list.
2010-10-03T14:02:00.000Z	mert_d	Dr_Willis	ok. thank you!
