2008-08-26T10:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	if you're patient, yes. :) you say the password is incorrect?
2008-08-26T10:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	random lockups or only during certain times?
2008-08-26T10:14:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	are you sure you own the system?
2008-08-26T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	yeah, see, this question right here.... 00:13 < Gnea> Gigadelic_IIDX: random lockups or only during certain times?  is not a yes/no question.... you need to clarify which one it is.
2008-08-26T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	okay, which certain times?
2008-08-26T10:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	what are the specs of your computer?
2008-08-26T10:18:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	well, if you can get the system to stabilize and not lock up anymore, it might be possible to fix that...
2008-08-26T10:18:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	well, that doesn't help.
2008-08-26T10:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	okay, did you build yourself or is it brand-name?
2008-08-26T10:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	okay, have you tried re-routing the IRQs?
2008-08-26T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	i don't have much more time... let's keep this public
2008-08-26T10:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	how long ago did you install the system?>
2008-08-26T10:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	seriously, calm down please.
2008-08-26T10:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	all you have to do, to TRY to fix the lockups, is add the following to your kernel line at bootup:  quiet splash pci=routeirq
2008-08-26T10:26:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	once you get the lockups to stop, it will be easier to fix the user/pass
2008-08-26T10:30:00.000Z	Gnea	Gigadelic_IIDX	any luck with the routeirq?
