2012-07-10T19:07:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	I want to use KDE but I don't want to use Plasma. Today I've seen Internet provider's laptop. It was Kubuntu but without Plasma!
2012-07-10T19:07:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	You can even use KDE with Openbox if you like it.

2012-07-10T19:09:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	but it doesnt work
2012-07-10T19:10:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	"Doesnt work" means?
2012-07-10T19:11:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	I can't connect to the internet using 100 Mbit connection because of my provider. I set up Windows 7 driver and it works on 10 Mbit/s. How can I swiitch it on Ubuntu?
2012-07-10T19:13:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	Usin ethtool?
2012-07-10T19:13:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	Yes.
2012-07-10T19:14:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	Could you type a command?
2012-07-10T19:15:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	That wont help you, I guess :) How about starting with ethtool -s speed 10 eth0
2012-07-10T19:29:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	so, do u have any idea of changing ethernet speed?
2012-07-10T20:29:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	I already told you, didnt I?
2012-07-10T20:30:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	I don't know why your methods don't work. I use all that I found
2012-07-10T20:30:00.000Z	sassas123	bekks	Unfortunately, I did it in Windows 7 many times faster
2012-07-10T20:31:00.000Z	bekks	sassas123	I am sorry, but I dont care about Windows :)
