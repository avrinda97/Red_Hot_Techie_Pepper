2007-06-22T08:55:00.000Z	ryan__		hi, i have ubuntu 7.04 with gnome and networkmanager, and for some reason my wireless doesnt work. i dont know if i have the driver, does anyone know how to add it on a normal dell inspiron with intel?
2007-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	get to a terminal, type lspci
2007-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	select its output and put it in a pastebin
2007-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	get all that?
2007-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	here's your problem: Broadcom Corporation Unknown device 4328 (rev 01)
2007-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	if that's indeed your wireless card
2007-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	and I'm pretty sure it is
2007-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	its not an intel
2007-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	intel cards are seen by the kernel just fine
2007-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	broadcom's on the other hand........ are EVIL
2007-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	and DON'T work
2007-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	(no open source driver that fully works)
2007-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	ok... scoping out info on that model
2007-06-22T09:03:00.000Z	ryan__	neozen	thanks i really appreciate it
2007-06-22T09:04:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	WHICH e1505 ... I see 3 listed here: http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/cto_inspn_e1505?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs
2007-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	yeah.... its got to be the dell one
2007-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	I've got an intel 3945abg..... worked out of box from dapper on up
2007-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	ryan__	neozen	yeah my friends worked fine, his intel prosetwireless one
2007-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	and was recognized by the kernel as exactly what it is
2007-06-22T09:10:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	closed source driver... but WORKING driver
2007-06-22T09:10:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	lets see what we can do to get you set up
2007-06-22T09:10:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	someone's probably duct-taped some solution together for this dell card
2007-06-22T09:11:00.000Z	neozen	ryan__	scoping out now
