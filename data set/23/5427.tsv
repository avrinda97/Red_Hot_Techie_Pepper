2006-12-01T07:56:00.000Z	MoXoM		okay how the h*ll do i edit the fstab file?.. i have opened the /etc/fstab but i cant save it? :(
2006-12-01T07:56:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	You need root permission. You can use sudo for editing it: sudo nano /etc/fstab
2006-12-01T08:12:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Well you can use pastebin for that if there are lots of lines
2006-12-01T08:17:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	here is the paste :) http://pastebin.ca/263397
2006-12-01T08:17:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Awesome :)
2006-12-01T08:19:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Looks good, as long as /disk1 and /disk2 exist and those drives are ext2 :P
2006-12-01T08:21:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	hehe yeah off course... well it was formatted as ext2 as default in the disk drive program... so i thought, well yeah why not, let's do that... hmm how do i make a new folder?... wasn't something with /mkrdir or something?
2006-12-01T08:22:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	you use mkdir <folder>
2006-12-01T08:23:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	The way -I- make folders is creating them with sudo and then chmodding them 777. However that's 'cause I'm the only one using this PC and don't like to mess with user groups and all that heck
2006-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	no, no one in this house does even get close to this computer... i want it to function as a server for my and my mom and dads website...
2006-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Ah, I see, then I guess you should ask how to set the folder permissions both in chmod and the fstab so it's more secure (since it's gonna be a webserver...)
2006-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Because I don't know how to mess with that stuff ^_^;;
2006-12-01T08:26:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	omg noo... does it get even more complicated than it is all ready?
2006-12-01T08:27:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Not at all, it's just that with 777 it gives public permissions and such, I dunno how that can affect you but better safe than sorry :)
2006-12-01T08:27:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	You just have to give the folder access only to your user and in the fstab too. Once that's done, you're set
2006-12-01T08:28:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	no okay... i can understand that... hmm but there must be somewhere on the internet i can read about all that stuff about ubuntu and folder options and so on... right?
2006-12-01T08:28:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	I think so, tried www.ubuntuguide.or? there must be some chhmod stuff in there I think
2006-12-01T08:28:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	*www.ubuntuguide.org
2006-12-01T08:28:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	yeah okay, ill try that...  hehe
2006-12-01T08:30:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	It isn't too hard either :) just gotta know the chmod parameters and what to put in fstab, and I don't know that :(
2006-12-01T08:31:00.000Z	MoXoM	DARKGuy	 no okay... if i find out of it, ill come back to ya and explaine it to ya ;)
2006-12-01T08:31:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	Thanks a lot xD
2006-12-01T08:31:00.000Z	DARKGuy	MoXoM	you too :p
