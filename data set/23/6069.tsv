2008-03-05T18:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	st_iron	Is that some sort of usb sound card or internal?
2008-03-05T18:12:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	internal intel hda sound
2008-03-05T18:12:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	in an asus f7f notebook
2008-03-05T18:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	st_iron	The people over in /j #Alsa can help you get that going...  I am still waiting for coffee to wake me up
2008-03-05T18:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	st_iron	remember when you compile the drive, it mutes all the channels.. you did check that right
2008-03-05T18:14:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	alsamixer doesn't work :O
2008-03-05T18:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	st_iron	let me see if I have my notes on that..
2008-03-05T18:17:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	I think I have to set the default sound device
2008-03-05T18:17:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	I'm just wondering where can I do that
2008-03-05T18:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	st_iron	Do one more thing  remove and reinstall libasound2  with synaptic
2008-03-05T18:23:00.000Z	st_iron	Jack_Sparrow	ok
