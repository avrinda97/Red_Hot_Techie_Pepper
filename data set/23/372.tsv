2012-02-01T07:02:00.000Z	Miggs		Hi guys. I got myself into a spot of PPA trouble with Pidgin. I'm trying to clean it up but apt is giving me an error that I don't know how to deal with. Can someone please look at this http://pastie.org/3292911 and give me a hint?
2012-02-01T07:03:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	what files are in ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2012-02-01T07:04:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	morgan@lappy:~$ ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* | grep -i pidgin  finds nothing.
2012-02-01T07:06:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	apt-get update
2012-02-01T07:07:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	then do apt-get remove pidgin && apt-get install pidgin
2012-02-01T07:09:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	apt-get remove pidgin && apt-get install pidgin
2012-02-01T07:09:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	apt says pidgin is not installed so it can't remove it, then the install has the error in nthe pastie.
2012-03-11T06:21:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	you have to add the user to the sound group
2012-03-11T06:21:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	*audio
2012-03-11T06:21:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	thanks. I'll look at the groups first thing
2012-03-11T06:22:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	it could be a problem with alsa not forwarding to pulseaudio
2012-03-11T06:22:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	You were bang on. Adding the pulse-access group to my user fixed it straightaway
2012-03-11T06:23:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	np
2012-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	perhaps you can help sort out another part of this mess. The computer in question is an HTPC (nVidia ION). I just moved to an HDMI connection for surround sound and lots of things I used to do apparently don't  work anymore. Specifically, I can't ssh into the HTPC with X forwarding and play music anymore. Any idea why?
2012-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	well it could be forwarding your pulse, it was really awesome
2012-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	try padev whatamanot
2012-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	oh yeah nvidia
2012-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	well does sound work locally?
2012-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	yep. That was the annoying bit.
2012-03-11T06:38:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	are you using the propritary nvidia driver?
2012-03-11T06:38:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	is the ~/.asoundrc set to use pulseaudio, or just ALSA directly?
2012-03-11T06:39:00.000Z	scientes	Miggs	well then pulseaudio apps wont work unless you set pulseaudio to send through alsa
2012-03-11T06:39:00.000Z	Miggs	scientes	what does it use by default? I thought it used ALSA anyway?
