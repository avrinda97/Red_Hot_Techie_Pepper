2007-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	saxartist		Hi everyone.  I'm having a friggin' crazy problem
2007-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	saxartist		I have a FAT32 partition, called /stuff
2007-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	saxartist		it's always worked fine
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	saxartist		yesterday, that thing at boot "xxxxx has been mounted 28 times without being checked"  And it usually works fine,
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	saxartist		but this time, it gave an error
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	saxartist		now my partition appears as empty
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	saxartist		but in WINDOWS it's there, just fine
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	do you have live cd ?
2007-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	 yes, and Windows mounted it just fine
2007-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	can you do fsck.ext3 from live cd
2007-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	I suppose I could do that!  What's that command do?
2007-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	It's a FAT32 partition
2007-07-04T13:20:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	if it is fat32 and is mounting in windows the something else is wrong. i thought you had ext3 parition
2007-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	when mauting manualy check dmesg
2007-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	Ubuntu is on an EXT3 partition, windows is on NTFS, and I have a "shared" partition runnning on FAT32, plus SWAP
2007-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	you know how to mount fat32?
2007-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	I've never done it manually before, I'm reading up on it as we speak
2007-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	the partition shows up in fdisk -l
2007-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	are you shoure its not permission problem ?
2007-07-04T13:24:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	I haven't changed any permissions: check out this groovy error: mount: only root can mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/44E4-FD0D on /stuff
2007-07-04T13:25:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	any suggestions on fixing those permissions?
2007-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	saxartist	rambo3	Thanks a LOT!  I got it fixed
2007-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	rambo3	saxartist	good
