2007-12-30T19:54:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Okay, qtparted is telling me (when I click the sda hdd) .. Error: \SYSTEM~1\_RESTO~1\RP895\CHANGE~1.1 is ok, but it has 4 clusters (16k).
2007-12-30T19:54:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Can I fix this since it is NTFS?
2007-12-30T19:55:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, whats on the disk? vital information?
2007-12-30T19:55:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	Well, it is his daughter's computer and it looked like it had quite a bit of stuff on it.. I can use ntfs-3g mount and see/edit the stuff in it .. Just wont boot into MS's OS.
2007-12-30T19:56:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, have you tried to fix mbr with xp bootdisk?
2007-12-30T19:57:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	I tried a couple fix things on the disk.. Think it was fixboot fixmbr and rebuild boot.ini .. they all gave errors . I might call him and say "I can save all your daughters stuff, but you are going to have to re-install.
2007-12-30T19:58:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, could be one of the solutions, is the disk label active?
2007-12-30T19:59:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	How do you mean disk label? In the live cd it doesn't show up as anything but sda1/ntfs format.
2007-12-30T20:00:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, on the livecd start gparted and take an look at the disks, the one you need most should have an active label...as in bootable
2007-12-30T20:01:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	aha .. yeah .. there are two on there .. It is an Compaq box, so I'm assuming the little 5gb spot in the beginning is the compaq rescue partition ..
2007-12-30T20:01:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, if that fails, you could resort to an third party non free "hirensboot cd" wich might help, but i think it boils down to backup all and reinstall
2007-12-30T20:02:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	that is odd. The little compaq portion is sda2 but starts at the beginning and the ntfs portion is sda1..
2007-12-30T20:03:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, the ntfs should be the active , does it have an active label?
2007-12-30T20:03:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	yeah, they both have active .. the fat32 5gig and the 70 gig ntfs . should I kick the active off the little one?
2007-12-30T20:04:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, give it a try
2007-12-30T20:04:00.000Z	unimatrix9	NineTeen67Comet	, what happened before the computer arrived at your place, what was the complain?
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	will do .. thanks for the ideas .. it's late here and my brain is cooked .. lol ..
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		heh
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		ok, good luck
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		:P
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		off to play, bye bye
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		savage!
2007-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	unimatrix9	It had a bad PS. I replaced it and it didn't boot well (long and a few blue screens before it finally gave me these) .. so I tossed a live cd in and looked it over and nothing seemed gone, so I rebooted into the partition table error ..
