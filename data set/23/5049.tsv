2007-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	Steve_C2		HI, I'm a Linux-ubuntu newbie and I need some help connecting to a windows 2000 system and to a network printer on my home network.
2007-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	Steve_C2		I have installed samba but still having problems
2007-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	specifically...?
2007-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	what would you like to know
2007-03-03T11:08:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	just what you mean by 'still having problems'
2007-03-03T11:08:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	not printing
2007-03-03T11:09:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	the printer is added but when I do a test page nothing comes out. The job appears in the print queue
2007-03-03T11:09:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	you mean it appears on the 2k machine's print queue?
2007-03-03T11:10:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	the printer is added and I'm able to go into properties and print a test page but nothing comes out
2007-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	uhm, so really this is a windows problem.
2007-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	I kinda doubt it since the printer works fine in windows on my network
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	i'll ask again: does the test page show up on the 2k machine's print queue, or the ubuntu one?
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	the system I'm on right now using linux is a dual booted system with XP and ubuntu. The printer works fine when printing from XP
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	that is not what i am talking about.  i'm asking this: when you print the test page from ubuntu, does it show up on the 2k machine's print queue?
2007-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	I know it shows up on ubuntu, I'll go look and see if it appears on the win2000 system
2007-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	yes, please.  that is what i have been asking all along.
2007-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	their are no documents showing up in the print queue on the windows 2000 system
2007-03-03T11:15:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	is this what you are doing: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPPrinter
2007-03-03T11:15:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	let me go check
2007-03-03T11:17:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	essentially yes. I will follow the instructions and will get back to you in a minute
2007-03-03T11:17:00.000Z	eobanb	Steve_C2	okay, good; and make sure to try disabling bidirectional support
2007-03-03T11:26:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	ok I did as instructed and still no go
2007-03-03T11:32:00.000Z	Steve_C2	eobanb	any more ideas on how to get my printer to work?
