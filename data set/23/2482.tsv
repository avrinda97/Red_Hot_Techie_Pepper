2009-03-03T10:56:00.000Z	^law^		guys how 2 get list of services from terminal?
2009-03-03T10:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	"services" per say, is a windows thing
2009-03-03T10:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	ps aux
2009-03-03T10:58:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	the closest thing linux has to services:  ls -l /etc/init.d
2009-03-03T10:58:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	then ls -l /etc/init.d
2009-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	as long as you haven't removed any via update-rc
2009-03-03T11:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	then the command I gave should be fine
2009-03-03T11:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	yes, by default
2009-03-03T11:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	then System -> Preferences -> Sessions   are executed on start up
2009-03-03T11:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	ps aux | grep 'service'
2009-03-03T11:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	sorry meant that sessions are executed on LOG IN....
2009-03-03T11:04:00.000Z	^law^	Titan8990	ps aux | grep 'service doesn't list up any services
2009-03-03T11:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	replace 'service' with the process that you are looking for
2009-03-03T11:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	then:   ps aux | grep 'samba'
2009-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	for more info:   man grep   and    man grep
2009-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	ehh sorry one of those should have read   man ps
2009-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	and ZykoticK9 is correct, the samba daemon is smbd
2009-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	in linux, there is no real difference from a services and process
2009-03-03T11:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	ps aux
2009-03-03T11:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	server = proccess
2009-03-03T11:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	err service, not sure I can have more typos while helping the same person....
2009-03-03T11:10:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	yes, but in linux a deamon/service is synomous with a proccess
2009-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	^law^	np
