2011-11-14T12:49:00.000Z	|Long|		hi, where do i change new ip from ssh?
2011-11-14T12:49:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	change it where?
2011-11-14T12:52:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	is that machine sitting next to you or like 1000 miles away?
2011-11-14T12:53:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	and you want to change its IP address?
2011-11-14T12:53:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	and that ip address is replaces the one that you used to connect over ssh?
2011-11-14T12:54:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	do you realize that your ssh session will get disconnected midway?
2011-11-14T12:56:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	ok, if its a server install, go to /etc/network/interfaces and change the ip address that appears in front of eth0
2011-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0 (with the first command, you will get disconnected so you have no way of knowing whether the second was fired)
2011-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	thanks let me try now
2011-11-14T12:59:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	yw and remember if that interface does not come back up; you need to get physical access to that machine
2011-11-14T13:01:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	will let you know in 2 seconds
2011-11-14T13:23:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	you still here?
2011-11-14T13:27:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	yes
2011-11-14T13:29:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	is it a server or a desktop?
2011-11-14T13:29:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	oh ok
2011-11-14T13:29:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	desktops used the network-manager
2011-11-14T13:30:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	i can only login from ssh session
2011-11-14T13:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	you could forward X via ssh or use VNC to connect graphically
2011-11-14T13:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	i am not aware yet of any command-line way of manipulating the network manager
2011-11-14T13:33:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	this box doesn't boot from GUI :(
2011-11-14T13:33:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	oh wait; there seems to be something called nmcli
2011-11-14T13:35:00.000Z	phlak_user	|Long|	here you go -> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/nmcli.1.html
2011-11-14T13:35:00.000Z	|Long|	phlak_user	thanks
