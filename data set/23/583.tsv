2011-05-27T00:54:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	Did you try quoting the spaces?
2011-05-27T00:54:00.000Z	yassine_hell	cheapie	: what do u mean?
2011-05-27T00:55:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	Like "part\ 2\ yassine" instead of "part 2 yassine".
2011-05-27T00:55:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	So is "part 2 yassine" one folder?
2011-05-27T00:55:00.000Z	yassine_hell	cheapie	omg thx so much !
2011-05-27T00:56:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	The "backslash trick" (quoting) works for all special characters (I think).
2011-05-27T00:57:00.000Z	yassine_hell	cheapie	: lol space is a special character? :) thx u again
2011-05-27T00:57:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	It interprets it as an argument separator.
2011-05-27T00:58:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	Cd was seeing "Argument 1='part' Argument 2='2' Argument 3='yassine'". With the backslashes, it tells it that you want "Arugment 1='part 2 yassine'".
2011-05-27T00:59:00.000Z	yassine_hell	cheapie	: ahh it make sense ..
2011-05-27T00:59:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	Is that all or do you need more help?
2011-05-27T01:00:00.000Z	yassine_hell	cheapie	:) thx u so much ^^
2011-05-27T01:00:00.000Z	cheapie	yassine_hell	Glad I could help. BTW, I just learned about quoting last month...
