2012-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	If the bootloader is showing, then what happens if you choose the normal ubuntu OS
2012-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	Also, if no-one responds, that probably means no-one can help so please stop spamming
2012-02-26T11:47:00.000Z	kuldeepdhaka	hydrox24	i installed minimial ubuntu ,bootloader is loading but after that i cannot see anything ,,,,,i read a tutorail in which it is not expected
2012-02-26T11:47:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	do you mean the GRUB menu by "bootloader"?
2012-02-26T11:48:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	can't you use the up/down keys to change to the OS/Kernel you want?
2012-02-26T11:50:00.000Z	kuldeepdhaka	hydrox24	i can use the grub menu but when i click to load minimal ubuntu i cant see anything ...no responce from that point of time
2012-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	just checking... by "click" I am gonna assume you mean "hitting enter key"
2012-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	kuldeepdhaka	hydrox24	click means enter key
2012-02-26T11:54:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	OK, and do your other OS's still work? if so, what OS's are they?
2012-02-26T11:59:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	try choosing the ubuntu-minimal option, then wait a minute or so, then hit the ctrl-alt-F1 key combo
2012-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	hydrox24	kuldeepdhaka	that will change it to a terminal and tell us if the issue is with X or the graphics card or if you truly have a non-booting system
2012-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	kuldeepdhaka	hydrox24	ok
2012-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	kuldeepdhaka	hydrox24	i will return i a while i have to change the screen to see i will tell u if it work
