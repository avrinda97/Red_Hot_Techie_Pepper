2012-07-27T22:53:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	Is this a Ubuntu system?
2012-07-27T22:54:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	If you used webmin to configure apache, that is more-than-likely your problem.
2012-07-27T22:55:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	lsb_release -r
2012-07-27T22:57:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	If you install webmin on your 12.04 server then you will more-than-likely have problems.  Problems that webmin can't fix, ones that *you* will have to fix.
2012-07-27T22:58:00.000Z	IUC	usr13	i am what exactly i am trying to do at the moment
2012-07-27T22:58:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	What did you download from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server ?
2012-07-27T22:58:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	webmin
2012-07-27T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	At any rate, what does the log say?
2012-07-27T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	Bug?  What are you talking about?
2012-07-27T23:00:00.000Z	usr13	IUC	pastebinit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-ispconfig.vhost
2012-07-27T23:07:00.000Z	IUC	usr13	got any idea about the error?
