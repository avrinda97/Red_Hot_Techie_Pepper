2011-09-05T05:14:00.000Z	Ningirsu		How can I use Boot Repair when I have to boot from its iso?
2011-09-05T05:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	can you tell us what the problem actually is?
2011-09-05T05:16:00.000Z	Ningirsu		Well, my Grub doesn't work because I recently removed an unused partition of my hard drive and I need to use Boot Repair but I can't do it on my live session because my damn Trisquel distro won't allow it
2011-09-05T05:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	if your setting it up for possible future failures it is a cheat tool you can do the same with a live cd, much more accurately.
2011-09-05T05:18:00.000Z	Ningirsu	urlin2u	No, it's actually necessary to fix my recent grub problem
2011-09-05T05:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	what OS's are still on the computer?
2011-09-05T05:19:00.000Z	Ningirsu	urlin2u	There's Trisquel Taranis 4.1 and Windows 7
2011-09-05T05:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	so first your on the wrong channel, if Trisquel Taranis 4.1 is a bootable OS I suspect easybcd will boot it, so use a recvery disc or install disc of W7 to boot to a recovery terminal, and run bootrec.exe /fixmbr to get windows back at this time.
2011-09-05T05:23:00.000Z	Ningirsu		urlin2u,: I know that I'm on the wrong channel but the most detailed descriptions on how to use this software is situated on Ubuntu's page so I figured that there might be somebody who knows how to make it work
2011-09-05T05:24:00.000Z	Ningirsu	urlin2u	: What's easybcd?
2011-09-05T05:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	it is a bootloader you can install in windows to boot other OS's like XP if needed and linux stuff.
2011-09-05T05:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	lots of windows users use it if they want to keep the ms boot in the mbr.
2011-09-05T05:26:00.000Z	Ningirsu	urlin2u	:The problem is that I don't have a rescue disk of anything besides Trisquel and my problem is that I have to make this software work somehow
2011-09-05T05:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	if you have a ubuntu cd you can install llio to boot windows do you have a ubuntu live cd?
2011-09-05T05:27:00.000Z	urlin2u		lilo*
2011-09-05T05:28:00.000Z	Ningirsu		urlin2u,: If I have an Ubuntu liveUSB, won't I have Boot Repair anyway? :S
2011-09-05T05:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	I have never used boot repair, that is for noobs.
2011-09-05T05:29:00.000Z	Ningirsu	urlin2u	: Rescatux?
2011-09-05T05:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	I don't like hidden processes in other words that app just save the mbr I believe and needs the OOS it was installed in still there.
2011-09-05T05:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	I have a simple fix here that is all I can offer.
2011-09-05T05:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	here is the lilo instructions if you need them its dinner time for me now.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/681328/
2011-09-05T05:32:00.000Z	Ningirsu		Ok. So let me rephrase my question: How can I install Boot Repair from its CD using a terminal?
2011-09-05T05:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	Ningirsu	you are on the wrong channel in the end this is for ubuntu only support you do not have ubuntu. In spite of that I have given you some options, so ethoier use them or go to a channel that might help.
