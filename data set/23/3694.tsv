2008-02-17T19:42:00.000Z	artti		Can i cancel updating/upgrading some packages?
2008-02-17T19:42:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	probably not a wise idea
2008-02-17T21:16:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	all the time in #ubuntu-offtopic ;]
2008-02-17T22:45:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	nice work!
2008-02-17T22:45:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	but maybe with some problems.
2008-02-17T22:46:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	there is a direct upgrade path to Hardy (due out in april) if you want to wait for that
2008-02-17T22:46:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	yesterday i had Ubuntu 4.10 and its 6.06 - i'm little bit happy.
2008-02-17T22:47:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	thus my advice for waiting to upgrade direct from 6.06 to 8.04
2008-02-17T22:47:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	i readed. Now i explore in Ubuntu 6.06
2008-02-17T22:51:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	sure it will clean out the apt archives iirc
2008-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	how are you planning on removing them and what apps
2008-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	there's ubuntu-artwork, ubuntu-standard
2008-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	and removing how?
2008-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	apt-get remove ubunu-artworks
2008-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	no worries then
2008-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	alright then
2008-04-25T20:29:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	i have .iso files. But somehow i can't burn them right on dsik.
2008-04-25T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	this is gnome? or windows
2008-04-25T20:31:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	right click on iso open with cd/dvd creator
2008-04-25T20:31:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	gnome? windows?
2008-04-25T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	you checked the md5 sums also?
2008-04-25T20:35:00.000Z	artti	bazhang	how i do that?
2008-04-27T11:43:00.000Z	bazhang	artti	you can use kde with gnome if you wish
