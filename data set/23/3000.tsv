2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	jdahm		I'm getting an error: "ERROR: modinfo: could not find module nvidia_current"  And then the installer seems to have stopped, but nothing has crashed
2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	jdahm		is this something I should just wait for or try again?
2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	it is because you don't have the nvidia driver installed
2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	ok, but I'm just installing 11.04.  Why would it expect that I have it
2011-04-29T01:34:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	thats sort of what I expected but how can I make it continue and not worry about that?
2011-04-29T01:34:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	well.. it could have gotten messed up the install. try using the proprietary driver install tool
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	I'm still on the livecd installing...
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	it's not even done installing
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	it's just sitting there
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	oh well is it continueing regardless?
2011-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	no, it seems to have stopped.  At least no other output is generated after that
2011-04-29T01:36:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	what graphics card do you have?
2011-04-29T01:36:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	nvidia tesla
2011-04-29T01:36:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	whaaa
2011-04-29T01:37:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	it's a current nvidia card
2011-04-29T01:37:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	isn't the tesla serierss those cuda cards?
2011-04-29T01:38:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	it's a modern nvidia card.  It's something like a GTX495 or something
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 430] (rev a1)
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	well wow... I think you may have a fairly rare card if its a tesla series card.. your bug report would be valuable
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	oh, it seems to have continued now
2011-04-29T01:39:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	oh so its not a tesla or at least it is one but has the chip for the gt 430
2011-04-29T01:40:00.000Z	jdahm	dotblank	ok it's done installing now.  Now I have to deal with adding mdadm to the startup modules and then I should be OK.  I'll keep you posted on what happens after I restart
2011-04-29T01:41:00.000Z	dotblank	jdahm	and you ahve raid.. damn what system do you have
