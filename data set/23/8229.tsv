2004-11-22T12:44:00.000Z	encryptio	JDahl	you're a  windows convert, rihgt?
2004-11-22T12:44:00.000Z	encryptio		like dvds
2004-11-22T12:44:00.000Z	JDahl	encryptio	what gave me away?
2004-11-22T12:44:00.000Z	encryptio		?
2004-11-22T12:44:00.000Z	encryptio	JDahl	you're amazing concern for security.
2004-11-22T12:45:00.000Z	JDahl	encryptio	adding nopasswd to sudoers doesnt disable it for all users, just for me...
2004-11-22T12:45:00.000Z	encryptio		i know... but still
2004-11-22T12:45:00.000Z	encryptio		root access needs to be at least password protected, no matter what (in my mind)
2004-11-22T12:47:00.000Z	encryptio		eh?
2004-11-22T12:47:00.000Z	encryptio		i'm thinking nopasswd means "don't ask for a password"
2004-11-22T12:48:00.000Z	JDahl	encryptio	did you change ubuntu to ask for password every time you use it?
2004-11-22T12:48:00.000Z	JDahl		sudo, I mean
2004-11-22T12:49:00.000Z	encryptio	JDahl	only if sudo hasn't been used in the last minute
2004-11-22T12:49:00.000Z	encryptio		successfully, at least
2004-11-22T12:49:00.000Z	encryptio		or shorten it
2004-11-22T12:49:00.000Z	encryptio		either way
2004-11-22T12:49:00.000Z	encryptio		yes
2004-11-22T12:52:00.000Z	JDahl	encryptio	how about using ssh with pgp to avoid typing password when connecting to a different machine... that's a bad windows habit also?
2004-11-22T12:52:00.000Z	encryptio	JDahl	if it's root, yeah
2004-11-22T12:53:00.000Z	JDahl		I wasnt talking about root
2004-11-22T12:54:00.000Z	JDahl		but anyway, I agree security matters - Im just lazy
2004-11-22T13:14:00.000Z	encryptio		how do i perrmanently kill the x server? like to kill and not come back?
2004-11-22T13:15:00.000Z	JDahl	encryptio	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, even ;)
