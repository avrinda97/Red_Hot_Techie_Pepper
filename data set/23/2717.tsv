2010-06-03T23:20:00.000Z	hou5ton		Downloaded a program and the user manual says .. To install Sweet Home 3D, move the uncompressed directory to one of your choice.     What directory should I use?
2010-06-03T23:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	you mean the executable file? or the source code? what's in this directory?
2010-06-03T23:21:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 well ... about everything that is part of the program
2010-06-03T23:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	i'd move it to /usr/local (you'll beed to be root) and then link executable to /usr/local/bin
2010-06-03T23:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	you'd link executable with a command like this (again, as root) ,  ln -sv /usr/local/<program_directory>/<name_of_executable_file> /usr/local/bin
2010-06-03T23:34:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 when i do this command you gave me, will it show up in the Applications menu?     you'd link executable with a command like this (again, as root) ,  ln -sv /usr/local/<program_directory>/<name_of_executable_file> /usr/local/bin
2010-06-03T23:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	no, it will not. use... System --> Preferences --> Main Menu
2010-06-03T23:38:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 When I did that .... it already opens SweetHome3D ... so why do I also do that command ?
2010-06-03T23:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	what did you do exactly? i'm not following what you're doing exactly that causes "already opens SweetHome3D"
2010-06-03T23:40:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 I put the path to the executable file in System/Preferences/Main Menu
2010-06-03T23:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	ok, sounds good so far
2010-06-03T23:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	so what's wrong?
2010-06-03T23:42:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 nothing I guess ... I was just asking if I still needed to do that command you gave me .....    ln -sv /usr/local/<program_directory>/<name_of_executable_file> /usr/local/bin
2010-06-03T23:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	no
2010-06-03T23:43:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 although I would like to be able to Alt/F2 and type in the program shortcut .... and that doesn't seem to work
2010-06-03T23:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	only if you care about starting it up on command line, then you'd probably need that command
2010-06-03T23:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	ok, that is like using the command line
2010-06-03T23:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	using Alt+F2 is like using the command line
2010-06-03T23:44:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 ok ... so I'll open a terminal and sudo that command.
2010-06-03T23:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	roger.. good luck
2010-06-03T23:44:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 "Good Luck?????"     :-)     ... that makes me nervous.
2010-06-03T23:49:00.000Z	hou5ton	onetinsoldier	 ok ... works wonderfully .... thanks for the help
2010-06-03T23:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	hou5ton	cheers. you're welcome :-)
