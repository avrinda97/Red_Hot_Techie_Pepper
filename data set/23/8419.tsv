2004-09-12T10:12:00.000Z	glyph		is there any way to set up ubuntu over an existing sid installation?
2004-09-12T10:14:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	I've used the ubuntu apt sources over an existing sid install with no problems. I would assume however, that the devs don't care for bug reports that end up as a result however
2004-09-12T10:14:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	Yeah, I could see that
2004-09-12T10:17:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	I've "upgraded" to ubuntu packages from existing sid and experimental packages on a box before.
2004-09-29T12:59:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	yeah, that's the amd64 iso you want.
2005-06-19T13:33:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	Hmm, curious
2005-06-19T13:33:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	yeah, totally odd, I wouldn't expect that to totally freeze a machine.
2005-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	I have been having a lot of trouble with my centrino laptop - power management does not like the ipw2200 at _all_ - will breezy (despite the disclaimer of the topic ;-)) potentially fix some of those?
2005-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	sometimes you have to put ipw2200 in the list in the acpi file to restart it on wake up.
2005-06-19T13:35:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	are you talking about the MODULES list in /etc/defaults/acpi-support ?
2005-06-19T13:35:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	been there, done that ;)
2005-06-19T13:36:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	the driver is buggy as shit
2005-06-19T13:36:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	that is what's up with that ;)
2005-06-19T13:37:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	testing hoary or breezy?
2005-06-19T13:38:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	don't just go upgrading to breezy just for that. It's pretty broken for lots of people.
2005-06-19T13:39:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	I don't read the list (got plenty of email as it is) but if there is a call for breezy testing I will give it a shot
2005-06-19T13:39:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	"fix stuff" is a pretty broad category, but I'm a 5+ years debian user, and a python programmer, I can usually figure stuff out if it's figure-outable (i.e. kernel bugs are off limits to me)
2005-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	if you know dpkg well enough to do the occasional overwrite, then breezy should be fine for you. Unless X is broken again.
2005-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	doesn't sound any worse than sid :)
2005-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	and I ran _that_ for about 3 years
2005-06-19T13:45:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	us.archive.ubuntu.com has been doing that for me for 2 days now
2005-06-19T13:45:00.000Z	glyph	whiprush	other hosts more forgiving?
2005-06-19T13:45:00.000Z	whiprush	glyph	not sure, I'm just riding it out.
