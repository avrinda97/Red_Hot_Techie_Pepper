2009-12-29T00:02:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	so with security off, it works. I've gone back to the old kernel I was using this morning, so it must be due to the bloody router upgrade.
2009-12-29T00:02:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	thoughts?
2009-12-29T00:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	well you did two things instead of one.  it could be the encryption or the kernel
2009-12-29T00:03:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	no I've just booted into the kernel version I was running this morning when all was well
2009-12-29T00:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	my guess is you have a broadcom wifi device and it don't work encrypted
2009-12-29T00:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	well if it's encryption then you eather have the wrong key set or it's the driver
2009-12-29T00:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	I've spent a whole day working on getting broadcom wifi to work encrypted on ubuntu 8.04 and failed.
2009-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	I guess it's the driver - the reason I started messing about with this is the machine has been dropping it's connection
2009-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	what does lspci say?
2009-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	or is it a usb device lsusb
2009-12-29T00:07:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	yeah it's a usb device - Linksys WUSB54GP
2009-12-29T00:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	never played with that never seen any bad things about it
2009-12-29T00:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	if you want encryption then maybe go VPN instead forget wpa
2009-12-29T00:08:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	i just want security - I live in central london
2009-12-29T00:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	turn off dhcp go static IP and go VPN.  maybe too much trouble and not easy for many to use
2009-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	the thing is, I was using a static IP until this morning too - it's a server basically so that's the use case I want
2009-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	I actually thought DHCP would be simpler!
2009-12-29T00:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	not on the sever side I keep them static
2009-12-29T00:11:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	I notice from here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/LinksysWUSB54GP that people have had to do hacky things to get WPA to work
2009-12-29T00:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	aah that's it then
2009-12-29T00:11:00.000Z	mattwynn_	sacarlson	but that was on an older version of ubuntu
2009-12-29T00:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	mattwynn_	well seem in the later version just more things are broken not less
