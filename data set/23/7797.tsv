2007-07-13T09:00:00.000Z	DanaG		Is there any easy way to preview GDM themes?
2007-07-13T09:01:00.000Z	DanaG		vps?  What is vps?
2007-07-13T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	I'm not running it right at the moment, but I think system-admin-login manager shows them
2007-10-21T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	they must be planning a new toolchain for the lts
2007-10-21T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	you live in SF?
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	you'd have to edit the theme definition manually
2007-10-26T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	lives in CA?
2008-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	it doesn't deactivate, it makes sure any data that needs to get written to the device does get written before you remove the device
2008-01-13T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	in other words, we don't know why your Cowon reads differently, possibly becuause you're using speciallized software in windows to control the device
2008-01-13T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	so, what is the issue then? It works
2008-01-13T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	and when you're using it on windows, was there some software that came with it that you installed? Something that provides more than data transfer?
2008-01-13T09:08:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	that bug is about pulling kernel modules out of the kernel and thereby shutting down devices
2008-01-13T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	ah, pdf. What was the question :)
2008-01-13T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	pdfedit is in the repos, but it sucks last time I used it
2008-01-13T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	convert to ps, replace the text with the block, convert back to pdf. That one is simple
2008-01-13T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	an answer anyway: most pdf/ps manipulations are done with ghostscript, which is available in windows
2008-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	pdf2ps is a shell script using ghostscript, pdftops uses poppler as it's backend
2008-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	ps is just a text file
2008-01-13T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	I warned you
2008-01-21T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	you running compiz?
2008-01-21T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	that's a side effect of compiz, I run  alt-f2 metacity --replace to watch movies, then when done alt-f2 compiz --replace to get back
2008-01-21T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	try changing the video output type, or another player. I find vlc to pretty stable
2008-01-21T08:57:00.000Z	nickrud	DanaG	try alternate video output types if you want to give mplayer a better chance
