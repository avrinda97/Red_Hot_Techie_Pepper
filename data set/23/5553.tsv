2007-06-03T10:55:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	what is a "SO"?
2007-06-03T10:56:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	your interfaces yesterday lacked a line "auto eth0"
2007-06-03T10:57:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	does dhclient eth0 still work?
2007-06-03T10:58:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	I told you what you have to do
2007-06-03T10:59:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	and I don't believe you. you had typos in your interfaces file yesterday ath0 vs. eth0. and no auto eth0 line
2007-06-03T11:00:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	then paste your new,changed  interfaces
2007-06-03T11:01:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	just do it
2007-06-03T11:37:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	took you long enough for a simple reboot
2007-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	novato_br	wols_	look at: http://pastebin.ca/534065 -> interfaces file
2007-06-03T11:41:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	what is the network card for eth0?
2007-06-03T11:42:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	that is no ethernet card
2007-06-03T11:43:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	it will still show up in lspci as separate device
2007-06-03T11:44:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	lsmod |grep forcedet
2007-06-03T11:46:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	try "sudo echo forcedeth >> /etc/modules"
2007-06-03T11:49:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	sinc you haven't told me the error, I don't know. there is an error in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/kern.log or /var/log/messages after bootup.
2007-06-03T11:52:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	have you rebooted yet with the forcedeth in /etc/modutils/?
2007-06-03T12:45:00.000Z	novato_br	wols_	are you here?
2007-06-03T12:51:00.000Z	novato_br	wols_	why doesn't connect the computer on the net without resolution DNS?
2007-06-03T12:52:00.000Z	wols_	novato_br	how would I know? a DNS server entry without connection to the internet is pretty useless...
2007-06-07T12:58:00.000Z	novato_br	wols_	 how can I make work my microphone ?
