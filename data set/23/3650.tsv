2008-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	sleepster		I want a text based browser, but I want it to be multithreaded and to render images (or pretend to render images) just like IE
2008-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	sleepster		it's for testing purposes
2008-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	ka2	sleepster	no images are possible but links is good for text only

2008-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	sleepster	ka2	well as long as the images are downloaded... that will be sufficient
