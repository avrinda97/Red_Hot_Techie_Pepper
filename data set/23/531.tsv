2011-07-04T22:34:00.000Z	alexleon		i try to make a video call from live messenger to emphaty and when i answer i get this message
2011-07-04T22:34:00.000Z	alexleon		alex's software does not understand any of the video formats supported by your computer
2011-07-04T22:34:00.000Z	alexleon		what is it
2011-07-04T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	probably not supported
2011-07-04T22:35:00.000Z	alexleon	ikonia	i can make videocalls to laptops but not to desktops :(
2011-07-04T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	the laptop / desktop has no difference in the software
2011-07-04T22:36:00.000Z	alexleon	ikonia	but enphaty recognizes laptop's webcam but not desktop's webcams i have proven it
2011-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	then the desktop probably uses an unsupported webcam
2011-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	all desktops ? as in all in the world ?
2011-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	you know desktops don't have a web cam installed by default don't you ?
2011-07-04T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	it's nothing to do with it being a desktop
2011-07-04T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	no
2011-07-04T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	what webcams are the desktops using ?
2011-07-04T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	have you tested if the webcam is working ?
2011-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	how are you testing them in ubuntu
2011-07-04T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	how are you testing the web cam is working in ubuntu
2011-07-06T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	there isn't one
2011-07-06T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	that can be a problem
2011-07-06T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	he's using swat which does require the root password
2011-07-06T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	it means you need the root account
2011-07-06T21:52:00.000Z	alexleon	ikonia	explain it to my step by step :)
2011-07-22T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	alexleon	go to a music site, purchase tham and download them
