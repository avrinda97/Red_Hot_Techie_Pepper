2009-11-10T14:51:00.000Z	k_		Ubuntu 9.10 is a very nice distro, but I have one question, why do all the windows open (maximise)
2009-11-10T14:52:00.000Z	om26er	k_	using ubuntu netbook remix?
2009-11-10T14:52:00.000Z	om26er	k_	did you install maximus?
2009-11-10T14:55:00.000Z	om26er	k_	in ubuntu netbook remix it maximizes all applications except some to fit netbbok screen.
2009-11-10T14:57:00.000Z	om26er	k_	might not work but try sudo apt-get purge maximus. will remove maximus if its installed. try
2009-11-10T14:57:00.000Z	k_	om26er	thanks, and lets try that
2009-11-10T14:57:00.000Z	om26er	k_	try getting back to previous theme and see if this helps
2009-11-10T14:57:00.000Z	k_	om26er	already tried
2009-11-10T14:58:00.000Z	om26er	k_	tried reboot?
2009-11-10T14:58:00.000Z	k_	om26er	yep, was trying to sort this when I install last night
2009-11-10T15:00:00.000Z	k_	om26er	given the changes that have been made with autoremove, ill reboot
2009-11-10T15:08:00.000Z	k_	om26er	im stomped into why this is happen, reading about compiz, there is an option that can max all windows, Windows layouts, if i untick this, it ticks itself.
2009-11-10T15:09:00.000Z	k_	om26er	I think this is the problem, bug in compiz
2009-11-10T15:10:00.000Z	om26er	k_	disable compiz and see if it helps
2009-11-10T15:10:00.000Z	k_	om26er	how do you do that
2009-11-10T15:10:00.000Z	k_	om26er	uninstall?
2009-11-10T15:10:00.000Z	om26er	k_	no
2009-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	om26er	k_	go to system--> preferences
2009-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	om26er	k_	appearances
2009-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	om26er	k_	then go to visual effects and make them none
2009-11-10T15:16:00.000Z	om26er	k_	reboot
2009-11-10T15:22:00.000Z	k_	om26er	thankyou mate
