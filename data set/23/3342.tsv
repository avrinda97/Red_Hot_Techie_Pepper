2008-06-18T14:21:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	What kind of wireless card do you have, and is there anything in System->Administration->Hardware Drivers?
2008-06-18T14:21:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	How old is the laptop?
2008-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Is there a button anywhere to turn the wireless on and off?
2008-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Press it, and wait a few seconds.
2008-06-18T14:49:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Is your wireless visible in Network Manager?
2008-06-18T14:54:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	It won't be ther last one, but you should know which it is...
2008-06-18T14:58:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Not if it works.
2008-06-18T15:00:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	That's unfortunately normal on some Intel cards.
2008-06-18T15:04:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Nothing, hopefully.
2008-06-18T15:07:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	You only have broken video drivers if you notice them. You don't need to check. You'll notice if they don't work
2008-06-18T15:09:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Correct.
2008-06-18T15:14:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	If you need help, just ask here.
2008-06-18T15:19:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	The installer will let you do that easily. It will ask if you want to resize the existing Windows partition.
2008-06-18T15:20:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	Microsoft Exchange unfortunately uses a highly proprietary protocol, so  you cannot use its full functionality using Free software at this time, though support is coming.
2008-06-18T15:22:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	You could use IMAP in pretty much any email client.
2008-06-18T16:17:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	See you soon.
2008-06-18T16:17:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	How are you chatting with us now?
2008-06-18T16:18:00.000Z	wgrant	newbeginer	There is an IRC application installed by default - Pidgin can do it.
