2011-04-26T04:44:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	error messages?
2011-04-26T04:45:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	NTFS is either inconsistent or there is a hardware fault.
2011-04-26T04:47:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	Error mounting: mount exited with code 13: ntfs_mapping_pairs:decompress() failed: input/output error
2011-04-26T04:48:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	It shows the win logo while loading drivers, then crashes with a blue screen, but too fast to read It.
2011-04-26T04:48:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	insert your windows disk and run the recovery option
2011-04-26T04:48:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	Ubuntu can see there is a ntfs partition. but cant mount It
2011-04-26T04:49:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	aah.. thanks. have the disk here. will try :)
2011-04-26T04:49:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	hmm. will I ruin the grub then ?
2011-04-26T04:49:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	should I make a boot disk on usb first for Ubuntu ?
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	uhm i don't know. i don't know how your partitions/installs are set up
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	no Wubi. 10.10 alongside win7
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	oh
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	well then you don't mount the hdd
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	you are running from that partition, so it can't mount it
2011-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	look in /host
2011-04-26T04:52:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	you should have told us this ages ago
2011-04-26T04:53:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	im not running Wubi. installed Ubuntu from DVD alongside windows.
2011-04-26T04:53:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	so how are the partitions set up?
2011-04-26T04:55:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	ntfs, ext4, and swap. NTFS configuration tools says /dev/sda1 /media/System_Reserved. and /dev/sda2 <enter a mount point>
2011-04-26T04:55:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	when trying to mount I get a long message in a popup
2011-04-26T04:56:00.000Z	mickster04	paw	i'm off for lunch, keep asking around
2011-04-26T04:56:00.000Z	paw	mickster04	thanks :) and damn Win7
