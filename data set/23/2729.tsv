2008-12-09T08:56:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix		i accidentally installed the i386 version of ubuntu...is there an easy way to go to x86_64 or do i need to reinstall again?
2008-12-09T08:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	We strongly suggest new users go with 32 until they are up to speed
2008-12-09T08:58:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	define up to speed....i generally kknow what im doing on linux...
2008-12-09T08:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	Do you understand chroot and 32bit environments on a 64 bit box
2008-12-09T09:00:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	no i do not because ive never had to do it when i used 64 bit :)
2008-12-09T09:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	flash seems to also give 64's a few problems
2008-12-09T09:05:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	does 64bit give anything other than more ram?
2008-12-09T09:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	Marginal speed improvement but hardly noticable for many
2008-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	sudo apt-get install fusion-icon
2008-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	did you enable universe
2008-12-09T09:26:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	why have i never had to do that before?
2008-12-09T09:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	it is a fact of life
2009-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	Have patience and wait for an answer and stop repeating
2009-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	and gold-bug after login on the live cd the boot hangs on a beige screen
2009-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	dont use sudo su
2009-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	ok well just please tell me the password...so i can sudo fdisk
2009-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	it is your regular user password, as long as you are not an added user to the admin account'

2009-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jimi__hendrix	You are treading in a grey area reserved for trolls..
2009-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	ok why is it that no matter what command i run in tty it just hangs and some messages print about certain proccesses being killed for having too much ram
2009-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	jimi__hendrix	Jack_Sparrow	can you do stuff in tty or will it not let you because it is not letting me
