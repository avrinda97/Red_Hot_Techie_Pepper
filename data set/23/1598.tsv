2011-12-17T23:53:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		Is there a way to see a notification for new messages in thunderbird on Unity?
2011-12-17T23:53:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	Yes.
2011-12-17T23:53:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	Give me a second.
2011-12-17T23:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	Wait, is it not integrated into the Messaging Menu by default?
2011-12-17T23:55:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	I'm not sure what that is. I'm looking for something that will pop up a notification of sort without explicit intervention on my part.
2011-12-17T23:56:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	the firetray extension stopped working on unity
2011-12-17T23:57:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	There is no longer a tray in Unity.
2011-12-17T23:57:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	I guess that's the reason:/
2011-12-17T23:57:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	Were you saying there's an alternative?
2011-12-17T23:57:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	If you want a notification about emails, you would want messaging menu integration.
2011-12-17T23:58:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	How could I set up that?
2011-12-17T23:58:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	But it is already there by default.
2011-12-17T23:58:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	oh, does it mean something will pop up when a new message arrives?
2011-12-17T23:59:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	isn't there a way to also show the number of unread messages somewhere?
2011-12-17T23:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	Yes. https://static-ssl-cdn.addons.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/54/54609.png?modified=1299090242
2011-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	I see. No way of having the same thing on the dash icon?
2011-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	I mean, like liferea does.
2011-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	Take a look at the omgubuntu.co.uk, I bet these geeks have made something up.
2011-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	it's good enough anyway, thanks for the hint
2011-12-18T00:01:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	I will
2011-12-18T00:02:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	It is already here.
2011-12-18T00:02:00.000Z	paulsomebody	cousin_luigi	http://mozillalabs.com/messaging/2011/03/14/more-ubuntu-unity-integration-for-thunderbird/
2011-12-18T00:03:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	paulsomebody	perfect. That's exactly what I needed:)
