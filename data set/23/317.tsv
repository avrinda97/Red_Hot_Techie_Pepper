2012-02-20T00:22:00.000Z	matju		question for anyone : How do I customise common colours of the GNOME 3 UI ? I seem to only be allowed to pick one of too few themes, but Ubuntu 11.10 seems to have removed features like this or moved them to unknown locations.
2012-02-20T00:23:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	gnome3? gnome-tweak-tool
2012-02-20T00:23:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	I think you actually mean how to change gtk3 aka gtk+ themes
2012-02-20T00:32:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	what is «GNOME Color Chooser» ? It has two fields for choosing Compiz colours, but applying them has no effect.
2012-02-20T00:33:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	your colors are handled by your themes most likely. gtk3 themes are not color customizable from any gui yet. you need to edit the themes directly. also when choosing new themes you may need to log out and back in or reboot. if that is in fact what we are talking about here
2012-02-20T00:35:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	why does the GNOME design team think it's a good idea to rewrite stuff from scratch, dropping support randomly, and keep old customisation tools around for extra confusion ?
2012-02-20T00:35:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	not sure. I don't use gnome
2012-02-20T00:36:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	what do you use then ?
2012-02-20T00:36:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	openbox
2012-02-20T00:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	lxde is a desktop environment like gnome, kde, xfce, etc.. you will still have to learn to customize your themes either way though.
2012-02-20T00:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	if all you want is a window manager though you dont have to run a desktop environment
2012-02-20T00:39:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	actually, what I want is a desktop environment such as GNOME 2.
2012-02-20T00:40:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	yeah gnome2 is a dead duck. most of the other ones are pretty betaish still. Have you tried xfce? as in xubuntu
2012-02-20T00:42:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	well no, I haven't tried XFCE, I'm more worried about why would the default choice for a desktop environment would be something in which Alt+tab is crippled, scrollbars are crippled, ui options are crippled, app menus are crippled and themes are crippled.
2012-02-20T00:43:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	Sounds like you are using regular ubuntu hahahaha. try xubuntu. youll see
2012-02-20T00:44:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	*Nope* ! it sounds like GNOME is doing their best to make microsoft look like a good idea.
2012-02-20T00:44:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	I hope so. The larger the community gets the worse we will be in the end anyways. guaranteed
2012-02-20T00:44:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	oops, replied to the wrong person
2012-02-20T00:46:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	If you are over the fancy effects and stuff. Try out a fast window manager that doesn't f**k around. Like --> awesome, openbox, fluxbox etc..
2012-02-20T00:49:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	yeah, i'd rather have less special effects at this point... I might look into alternatives sooner or later, but nowadays I'd see that as a complication (whereas I used to be a fan of PWM, the tabbing window manager by the author of Ion).
2012-02-20T00:50:00.000Z	bobo37773	matju	oh cool. so you know what your doing. well I like openbox as a floating window manager and awesome as a tiling window manager. They seem to be the most popular choices.
2012-02-20T00:51:00.000Z	matju	bobo37773	thanks for the hints.
