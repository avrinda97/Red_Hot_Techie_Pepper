2008-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	Thank you very much sir!!
2008-07-09T14:00:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	I did follow the intstructions but the problem I am takling about is a bit different
2008-07-09T14:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	what is the issue
2008-07-09T14:03:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	the issue is that my laptop has the wireless on/off button located on front side. However, even when the button is at the ON position, the Hardware Drivers in Kubuntu says "Not In use" in status. Thus, is there anyway to turn the wireless "on" manually? because it is turned on physically.
2008-07-09T14:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	you are flipping that button on/off regularly?
2008-07-09T14:04:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	No
2008-07-09T14:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	what does ifconfig show in terminal two entries or three
2008-07-09T14:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	have heard about that before but no idea how to fix as I eschew windows
2008-07-09T14:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	you will need to use ndiswrapper from that link I gave you
2008-07-09T14:13:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	the problem is not the driver,,, or anything like that.. the problem is that this device will not turn on in "Linux"
2008-07-09T14:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	there is no windows install left?
2008-07-09T14:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	install windows then fix grub; no need for linux reinstall
2008-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest1286	you also may wish to try xchat
2008-07-09T14:30:00.000Z	Guest1286	bazhang	I will try that after I settle this first with pidgin sir
