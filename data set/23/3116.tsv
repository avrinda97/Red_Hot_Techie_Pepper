2008-07-27T12:59:00.000Z	preben_		hi! How do I turn off that f-spot is opened when I connect a camera in XFCE. I got a dialog and misunderstood it so now it opens f-spot which I don't use every time I connect camera. I would like to change it to ignore

2008-07-27T13:00:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	(there's two places)
2008-07-27T13:00:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	in removable I can only turn on and off the command I want to run
2008-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	so turn it off
2008-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	I use another program but still f-spot get opened two
2008-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	so turn it off, and then look at the other spot I mentioned
2008-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	but i want my command to run, not f-spot
2008-07-27T13:02:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	so. check. the. other. spot. I. mentioned.
2008-07-27T13:02:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	ok
2008-07-27T13:04:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	and then in places | <anything> | Edit | Preferences | Media
2008-07-27T13:04:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	don't find this
2008-07-27T13:05:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	you mean from thunar, then I get same menu
2008-07-27T13:05:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	I said xfce
2008-07-27T13:06:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	you might want to check out #xubuntu, they'll probably be a bit more familiar with where autolaunching things are set
2008-07-27T13:06:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	if I turn off the importing my command doesn't get run but f-spot opens anyway
2008-07-27T13:06:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	so I guess it is gnome thing
2008-07-27T13:06:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	you aren't running nautilus for a desktop are you?
2008-07-27T13:06:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	try running nautilus from a terminal, and then check the Edit | Preferences | Media thing
2008-07-27T13:07:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	i instaleld ubuntu and xubuntu packages and kubuntu packages
2008-07-27T13:07:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	(ctrl+c in the terminal, possibly followed by a killall nautilus will kill it off if it starts misbehaving)
2008-07-27T13:09:00.000Z	cwillu	preben_	nothing there?
2008-07-27T13:10:00.000Z	preben_	cwillu	found it in gconf-editor some gnome autorun command and I turned it off and now my script runs only
