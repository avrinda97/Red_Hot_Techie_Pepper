2007-04-07T11:24:00.000Z	dinochopins		hi there
2007-04-07T11:24:00.000Z	dinochopins		is there any user's mail on Ubuntu ?
2007-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	dinochopins		I check on MAIL environment variable
2007-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	dinochopins		echo $MAIL, and the result is '/var/mail/root'
2007-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	dinochopins		but there isn't any folder of that result
2007-04-07T11:26:00.000Z	nomin	dinochopins	I think you need to set up an account.
2007-04-07T11:26:00.000Z	dinochopins	nomin	setup account instead root ?
2007-04-07T11:26:00.000Z	nomin	dinochopins	for email.  I think ubuntu is set up to use evolution by default.
2007-04-07T11:27:00.000Z	dinochopins	nomin	No.. I don't mean any Internet's email account. What I mean is internal mail for Linux's accounts
2007-04-07T11:27:00.000Z	dinochopins	nomin	in Fedora/Red Hat I have my users's mail account
2007-04-07T11:28:00.000Z	dinochopins	nomin	so if anything happened on my system, some job will email some notification to the related user's mail
