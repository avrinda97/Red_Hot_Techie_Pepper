2012-02-07T01:55:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	it doesn't use that much more space than not having it
2012-02-07T01:56:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	you're probably seeing two copies of everything, the one in your home dir, and the one in the /home/.ecrypt dir
2012-02-07T01:56:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	then you've got a problem
2012-02-07T01:57:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	you didn't ecrypt the whole drive did you?
2012-02-07T01:58:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	do       df         on the command line, and see what it says
2012-02-07T01:58:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	or pastebin it
2012-02-07T02:03:00.000Z	exiff	IanWizard	http://pastebin.com/zs4AiqBf
2012-02-07T02:04:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	that's awfully small
2012-02-07T02:04:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	35G
2012-02-07T02:14:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	do a       du -ch /home/nova
2012-02-07T02:14:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	and paste it.
2012-02-07T02:15:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	sorry for the delay, getting lunch
2012-02-07T02:17:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	yep, you can just paste the last few lines if you want
2012-02-07T02:17:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	or just the last (grand total) line in here
2012-02-07T02:19:00.000Z	exiff	IanWizard	http://pastebin.com/iRinTer4
2012-02-07T02:21:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	I would say that something is seriously messed up.
2012-02-07T02:22:00.000Z	exiff	IanWizard	im guessing i'll have to migrate home
2012-02-07T02:22:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	maybe just try rebooting, if that doesn't work... maybe you have to drop ecrypt
2012-02-07T02:25:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	migrate the data, then I would completely remove the home dir, and .Private
2012-02-07T02:26:00.000Z	exiff	IanWizard	Double restart didn't change anything
2012-02-07T02:27:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	I would take everything in /home/nova  (and any other encrypted /home dirs), and put it on a flash drive
2012-02-07T02:32:00.000Z	IanWizard	exiff	good luck :)
