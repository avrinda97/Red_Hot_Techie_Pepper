2008-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		hi all. I'm having trouble installing 8.04. The installer just hangs where it should show the partition tool. The system stays reactive, and when i run gparted directly, it takes a while to skan media, but it works eventually. Any clues? I'm a bit frustrated.
2008-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		It would be ok with me to skip that step and just *pick* a partition.
2008-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		or maybe there's a non-gui setup routine i could try?
2008-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		this is a complete show stopper :(
2008-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	this is dual boot?
2008-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	for now, yes. old ubuntu and new ubuntu :)
2008-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	why does it matter?
2008-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	then I would suggest the alt cd which is text based
2008-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	:( ok, i can try that. any idea how i could grab an error report or otherwise help to investigate the problem?
2008-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	you could file a bug at lanchpad-->let me get you a link
2008-06-03T12:46:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	i was hoping to at least provide a detailed error message with any bug report
2008-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	is there some tool (like hwinfo or some such) i can run from the live cd to create an overview of my system config? for attachign it to a bug report.
2008-06-03T12:50:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	bash: hardware: command not found
2008-06-03T12:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	from the gui under system administration :)
2008-06-03T12:51:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	bah, newfangled gui cruft :P
2008-06-03T12:53:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	bah, it wants to mail it to launchpad, where i would have to sign up. this is useless. all i want is a tedxt dump.
2008-06-03T12:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	if you want to file a bug you need to sign to there anyway :)
2008-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	true. but before it sends mail, i want so see exactly what it sends, at least. it doesn't say.
2008-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	hm, fun. mounting partitions from the "places" menu silently fails.
2008-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	this is the livecd? best to install via alt cd then worry about bug reports later :)
2008-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	but i have to at least store the report from syslog somewhere
2008-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	bazhang	well... i could stuff it in my wiki i guess :)
2008-06-03T13:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Duesentrieb	nice work :)
