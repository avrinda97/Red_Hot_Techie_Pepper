2005-11-26T10:22:00.000Z	Agrajag		wow
2005-11-26T10:22:00.000Z	Agrajag		with 3rd-party software though
2005-11-26T10:24:00.000Z	Agrajag		But again, everyone does it.
2005-11-26T10:25:00.000Z	Agrajag		FAT is very simple and quite open. I've done a fat12 driver from scrath for a class years ago, with freely available info
2005-11-26T10:26:00.000Z	Agrajag		it's illegal under the DMCA, because it cracks the CSS encryption
2005-11-26T10:27:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	no, the law says that you can't export your method of cracking encyption
2005-11-26T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	cracking it, per se, is not illegal
2005-11-28T11:57:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	what are you seing?
2005-11-28T11:57:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	what is it doing that makes you think it is broken?
2005-11-28T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	or, what is it doing wrong?
2005-11-28T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	it's not terribly efficient, but it does better than that for me  :)  But I don't have that hardware here to see if it is different there
2005-11-28T11:59:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	I think I would have heard, though
2005-11-28T12:03:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	xzf from the .gz, or xf from the .tar is the same
2005-11-28T12:03:00.000Z	Agrajag	sethk	yeah yeah, didn't see what he was trying to do
2005-11-28T12:03:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	neither did I, for a while  :)
2005-11-28T12:03:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	in fact I'm still not sure I understand what is really going on
2006-02-27T12:55:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	no, that's never true
2006-02-27T12:55:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	alsa supplies an oss compatibility layer
2006-09-15T16:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	sethk	no
2006-09-15T16:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	sethk	VMWare server is free.
2006-09-15T16:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	sethk	always has been
2006-09-15T16:00:00.000Z	sethk	Agrajag	I didn't say anything about vmware
2006-09-15T16:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	sethk	GSX server was not.
