2006-03-19T11:51:00.000Z	manji		alright, so i run the nvidia official driver installer, and it tells me that i need gcc-3.4 to work properly
2006-03-19T11:51:00.000Z	manji		so how can i get that to work?
2006-03-19T11:52:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	sudo apt-get install gcc-3.4
2006-03-19T11:52:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	yeah but the system wants to use gcc-4.0 only
2006-03-19T11:54:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	why not use the nvidia module in the restricted-modules package as opposed to building it?
2006-03-19T11:54:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	because after a fresh install, glxgears were running horribly
2006-03-19T11:55:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	did you check your glxinfo to make sure direct rendering was working?  i use GLX with the Ubuntu nVidia drivers
2006-03-19T11:55:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	no, i didnt.
2006-03-19T11:56:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	might want to do that.  "glxinfo | grep direct" should say yes, not no
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	direct rendering: no
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	but, this is after i uninstalled all my stuff
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	let me get back to you, and thanks for the help
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	np, i'll be around for a while
2006-03-19T12:00:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	gonna give her a restart, brb
2006-03-19T12:04:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	yeah so i re-installed what i figured was glx stuff, restarted, and now X doesnt even start with GLX
2006-03-19T12:05:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	any ideas?
2006-03-19T12:05:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	as in no direct rendering?  do you have the nvidia modules installed?  are you using the nvidia xorg module as opposed to nv? (I hope I'm on the right train of thought)
2006-03-19T12:06:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	X does not have GLX extensions running at all currently, and how does one go about using nvidia-xorg instead of nv?
2006-03-19T12:07:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	Driver "nvidia" instead of "nv"?
2006-03-19T12:07:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	as volCOM_B0i said, look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and ..... yeah...what he said
2006-03-19T12:09:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	thanks so much, got everything working
2006-03-19T12:10:00.000Z	manji	cilynx	you have a good night
2006-03-19T12:10:00.000Z	cilynx	manji	np.  congrats on getting it up and running.  you too.
