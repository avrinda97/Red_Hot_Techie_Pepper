2006-10-31T11:06:00.000Z	timhaughton		Can anyone help - my only user no longer appears to be in the sudoers file, and it's a remote server I can't easily get access to.
2006-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	that sounds like trouble.
2006-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	I'm getting that feeling too.
2006-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	feel like going for a drive ;)?
2006-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	are you the only user on that box?
2006-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	There's one other remote user, but he doesn't have any admin access.
2006-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	You're trying to scare me :)
2006-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	I'm not, actually. But it's a valid question, no?
2006-10-31T11:11:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	Absolutely. I've just checked the forum, I was doing a chgroup command at the time this started. Someone else has reported this problem starting when trying to chgroup
2006-10-31T11:12:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	are you still in the admin group?
2006-10-31T11:13:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	How do I check?
2006-10-31T11:13:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	type 'groups' at a console.
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	hmmm, it just says timhaughton developer. I just thought I added myself to the developer group. I bet I wiped out my other groups.
2006-10-31T11:16:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	that's exactly what happened.
2006-10-31T11:16:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	Bugger.
2006-10-31T11:16:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	I feel a late night recovery console coming on.
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	usermod -a newgroup will append the group to your list.. Just for future reference.
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	yeah I don't think you are going to recover from that without actually being there unfortunately.
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	root can be a dangerous thing. Especially remote admin. Use the man pages!
2006-10-31T11:18:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	I promise to rtfm from now on :(
2006-10-31T11:18:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	:)
2006-10-31T11:19:00.000Z	timhaughton	dcraven	Still, the 105 mile journey will give me time to reflect on my error :)
2006-10-31T11:19:00.000Z	dcraven	timhaughton	we all learn that lesson the hard way. No matter how good at adminning we think we are.
