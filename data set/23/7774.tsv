2005-04-29T09:35:00.000Z	ivoks		dump my gentoo or not, that is the question
2005-04-29T09:35:00.000Z	ivoks		i would like to try ubuntu again, but...
2005-04-29T09:35:00.000Z	ivoks		if it's compiled for 486, it would be a shit...
2005-04-29T09:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	I believe most packages are compiled for 386, and you can choose the kernel you run
2005-04-29T09:36:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	kernel is enough
2005-04-29T09:37:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	486 for ogg and mp3 ripers means no mmx support
2005-04-29T09:37:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	and that means slow riping
2005-04-29T09:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	there are several kernels you can run, including one for 686
2005-04-29T09:37:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	but kernel isn't enough

2005-05-07T14:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	I don't really care, but it is nice to see how other people are thinking about the same things
2005-05-10T10:56:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	please stay civil here
2005-05-10T11:03:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	aparently, people have problems with them
2005-05-10T11:03:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	WeirdAl|Foods didn't manage to get it work with that
2005-05-10T11:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	on his machine?
2005-05-10T11:04:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	yes
2005-05-10T11:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	the docs are coming along
2005-05-10T11:08:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	?
2005-05-10T11:08:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	there allready are docs
2005-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	there is a new portal coming to make it easier to read and find
2005-05-13T13:14:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	if it stays like this... it would be great
2005-05-24T05:00:00.000Z	ivoks	Burgundavia	isn't
2005-05-24T05:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ivoks	rhythmbox is installed by deafult, as it is part of gnome
