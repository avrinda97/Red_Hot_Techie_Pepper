2010-03-20T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	cp -pr ./folder /dest
2010-03-20T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	-p to (preserve) -r to recursive copy all subfolders
2010-03-20T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	its all in the man pages.....
2010-03-20T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	yes :D
2010-03-20T11:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	YES
2010-05-06T07:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	there is no single best application for any task you can think of
2010-05-06T07:54:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	I know, what's the best in your opinion.
2010-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	is it GUI or CLI?
2010-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	its a gui app
2010-05-06T07:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	could just make an ISO of the disk. Much easier ;)
2010-05-06T07:57:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	I'd love that.
2010-05-06T07:57:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	how would I go about doing that?
2010-05-06T07:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	dd if=/dev/sr0 of=~/image.iso
2010-05-06T07:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	assuming /dev/sr0 is your optical drive. you can use: sudo lshw -C drive    to check
2010-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	that command didn't have any output
2010-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	it won't, its working away
2010-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	no the lshw
2010-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	then try: sudo lshw -C disk
2010-05-06T08:03:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	ActionParsnip	that showed all disks
2010-05-06T08:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	yes as well as the names it goes under like /dev/sr0 etc
2012-10-11T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	make sure nm-applet is running
2012-10-11T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	Lucid is EOL real soon, have you considered a clean install of Precise?
2012-10-11T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shazbotmcnasty	i recommend you install a clean install of Precise which is supported til 2017. Lucid desktop dies in April next year
