2007-12-27T09:46:00.000Z	JoshJ		So, I take it that ubuntu ignores /etc/fstab ?
2007-12-27T09:46:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	of course not
2007-12-27T09:47:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	then explain this (details coming)
2007-12-27T09:49:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	there you go
2007-12-27T09:52:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	in ubuntu, fstab uses UUIDs by default, is yours?
2007-12-27T09:52:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	yeah, i haven't changed it
2007-12-27T09:53:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	are you just looking at the comment in fstab which says /dev/sda4, or are you comparing the actual UUID using the blkid command?
2007-12-27T09:53:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	it's still showing the date on fstab as being 2007-07-29 and i repartitioned yesterday
2007-12-27T09:53:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	well how did you repartition?
2007-12-27T09:56:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	you've implied you used some tool to do the partitioning which adjusted fstab... I'm not surprised it didn't touch the comments
2007-12-27T09:56:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	yeah, it was ubuntu's built-in gparted
2007-12-27T09:56:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	I think only the install process sets those comments
2007-12-27T09:56:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	i should probably suggest to the gparted/livedisc people to check to see if the comments are the same as they were originally
2007-12-27T09:58:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	it could be a useful option... keep in mind it's something that Ubuntu does, the comment thing is not standard, and most distros don't even use UUID yet I believe
2007-12-27T09:58:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	no problem
2008-05-31T05:24:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	do what?
2008-05-31T05:24:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	ahh I see the question
2008-05-31T05:24:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	i used to have ubuntu on this laptop; i nuked the ubu partition so i could resize the windows partition to full
2008-05-31T05:24:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	have your windows cd?
2008-05-31T05:24:00.000Z	JoshJ	astro76	somewhere :)
2008-05-31T05:25:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	boot from it and run something like fdisk /mbr to restore windows mbr... people in #windows will know for sure
2008-05-31T05:25:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	but the /boot/grub/menu.lst was on the linux partition
2008-05-31T05:26:00.000Z	astro76	JoshJ	alternatively, suposedly the super grub cd can install a syslinux bootloader for windows, but I tried it once without success
