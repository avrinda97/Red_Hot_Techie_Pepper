2009-05-25T03:33:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	lol, we meet again, eh? under a different user name.... :)
2009-05-25T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	you got a differnet one?
2009-05-25T03:34:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	no, I'm using mibbit... couldn't figure out how to register one, or get in using pidgin!
2009-05-25T03:34:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	you remember I was asking yesterday about a filter? ;)
2009-05-25T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	yep I remember
2009-05-25T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	you got somewhere with that?
2009-05-25T03:35:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	for now just doing openDNS, except I'm kind of stuck here editing one of the conf files
2009-05-25T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	ah ok
2009-05-25T03:43:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	you familiar with openDNS?
2009-05-25T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	nah
2009-05-25T03:43:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	cuz I'm plain stuck, not knowing exactly what I'm supposed to change in this file :)
2009-05-25T03:43:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	ok, lol
2009-05-25T03:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	,but maybe I can get someone to join here, that can help, instead of telling you to join their channel, since I am not just meant to do that
2009-05-25T03:44:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	openDNS has their own channel?
2009-05-25T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	maybe
2009-05-25T03:45:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	haha, I'm looking into it
2009-05-25T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	I thought one of them knew, but  I don't know. well you can try #networking
2009-05-25T03:46:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	okay, thanks
2009-05-25T03:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	and the channel I was on about is not that one
2009-05-25T03:53:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	is there a way to turn off access to a wireless network for a ubuntu user?
2009-05-25T03:54:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	I mean, so they can't access the internet?
2009-05-25T03:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tm1	probably
2009-05-25T03:55:00.000Z	tm1	sebsebseb	distatica: would this work? http://www.ubuntugeek.com/disable-internet-access-for-particular-user-in-ubuntu.html
