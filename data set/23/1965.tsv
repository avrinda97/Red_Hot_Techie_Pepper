2009-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	bcurtiswx		what port does SAMBA use?
2009-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	bcurtiswx		i.e. i have a web server.. i want to allow others to SAMBA to listen to my music
2009-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	bcurtiswx		anyone know which port SAMBA uses?
2009-08-30T07:17:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	1st off, a lot of ISPs block samba on the internet, 2nd, it uses port 139
2009-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	yeah, i hate ISP blocks... so I typically work around them
2009-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	also, samba isn't very secure at all, not recommended over the interwebs
2009-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	only trusted people will know about it (i.e. family)
2009-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	no they won't
2009-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	theres bots scanning 24/7 for open samba, and other vulnerabilities
2009-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	why not set up http? or ftp?
2009-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	they scan for the typical SAMBA ports... and with me opening a different one to bypass ISP blocks... they'll have a much tougher time
2009-08-30T07:22:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	ftp? http? also, your friends will have a lot harder time getting it too
2009-08-30T07:23:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	whats the best FTP server to use?
2009-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	in your opinion
2009-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	i like vsftpd, but i dunno if thats in ubuntu repos
2009-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	it is.. thx.. actually heard good things about that too
2009-08-30T07:31:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	what port does vsftpd use... 20?
2009-08-30T07:31:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	all ftp servers generally use port 21
2009-08-30T07:33:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	is it possible my ISP blocks port 21?
2009-08-30T07:34:00.000Z	Ben64	bcurtiswx	i guess its possible
2009-08-30T07:38:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	whats the default place to put your FTP files... i can't connect to my own ftp server... says failed to establish connection
2009-08-30T07:45:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	do I need a separate package to allow people to use a browser to access my ftp?
2009-08-30T07:46:00.000Z	bcurtiswx	Ben64	web browser
