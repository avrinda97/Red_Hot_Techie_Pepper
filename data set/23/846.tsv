2011-01-13T11:31:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	you mean the guest add on for usb 2.0 support?
2011-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	yeah, it does other stuff also. display wise.
2011-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	I just specified the filters for my mouse and keyboard
2011-01-13T11:46:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	he wanted to know how to copy into his current dir
2011-01-13T11:56:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	this is a good webpage for blank screen problems.   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen
2011-01-13T11:58:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	thanks, elik did you see theify's link
2011-01-13T12:08:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	what about system - prefs - appearance and killing it on that last tab - visual effects
2011-01-13T12:11:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	did you install guest additions in the vm?
2011-01-13T12:11:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	yes for usb 2.0 support
2011-01-13T12:12:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	then i would think you do not need to hit a button to move your mouse out of the vm.   i don't...
2011-01-13T12:12:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	i have a feeling my filters arent added right or something, dont know
2011-01-13T12:12:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	under 'usb' do you just have it enabled
2011-01-13T12:12:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	i don't need a filter to use the mouse.. it just works.
2011-01-13T12:13:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	ok if i reboot its because i got stuck in vbox
2011-01-13T12:13:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	yeah, i have both checkboxes in there checked.
2011-01-13T12:13:00.000Z	sta7ic	thiefy	ive tried multiple configs...can you tell me what you have checked off under usb
2011-01-13T12:14:00.000Z	thiefy	sta7ic	yeah, i have both checkboxes in there checked.   and nothing in the 'filters' area. it's blank.
