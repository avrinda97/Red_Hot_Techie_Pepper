2011-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	naryfa		I ran into a little problem, all of the themes in appearance prefs suddenly have no thumbnails. Everything is X, they work but you don't know what you're choosing. Anybody knows how to correct that?
2011-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	did you install a theme recently?
2011-04-10T07:25:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	nope
2011-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	yes sir
2011-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	do you know how to use a terminal?
2011-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	ofc, why
2011-04-10T07:28:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	if you downloaded something from gnome-look or a similar site recently it could be that
2011-04-10T07:28:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	that's the only thing I get: (gnome-appearance-properties:1905): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_display_sync: assertion `GDK_IS_DISPLAY (display)' failed
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	yes
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	ok, thanks.
2011-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	there's no such channel
2011-04-10T07:32:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	it's not a channel
2011-04-10T07:33:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	lol
2011-04-10T07:34:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	Something is wrong really because even starting appearance prefs eats up 3rd processor core at 100%
2011-04-10T07:35:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	don't try to start it again - there must be a broken theme or engine
2011-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	the process doesn't die when I close appearance prefs
2011-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	I have to kill it
2011-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	I think you're right
2011-04-10T07:37:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	and how did you correct it
2011-04-10T07:38:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	how did you find it??? trial and error?
2011-04-10T07:39:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	someone on the ubuntuforums site was able to find out which theme was the offending one and told me which one to remove
2011-04-10T07:39:00.000Z	naryfa	rolandixor	ok, thanks man
2011-04-10T07:40:00.000Z	rolandixor	naryfa	np
