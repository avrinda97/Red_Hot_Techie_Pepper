2009-10-04T03:40:00.000Z	steffan	neip	build-essential is often required when compiling from source, if that is what you're doing then you'll need that
2009-10-04T03:46:00.000Z	neip	steffan	is there something that I need to change in this command (./configure --disable-rpath --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix /usr) when I paste it.. it says please read INSTALL.txt
2009-10-04T03:59:00.000Z	steffan	neip	read INSTALL again
2009-10-04T04:00:00.000Z	neip	steffan	this what INSTALL.txt says 2) run configure, with any options that you might prefer:
2009-10-04T04:00:00.000Z	neip	steffan	not sure what it means, this is the first time I compile lol
2009-10-04T04:00:00.000Z	steffan	neip	that is what the INSTALL file is for
2009-10-04T04:01:00.000Z	steffan	neip	what package are you attempting to install?

2009-10-04T04:04:00.000Z	steffan	neip	add ppa:loell/ppa to your /etc/apt/sources.list and install
2009-10-04T04:05:00.000Z	steffan	neip	more specifically, adding http://pastebin.com/m6b3b91e0 to your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-10-04T04:05:00.000Z	neip	steffan	how do I add ppa:loell/ppa ?
2009-10-04T04:06:00.000Z	steffan	neip	following https://launchpad.net/~loell/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=jaunty will help
2009-10-04T04:06:00.000Z	neip	steffan	thanks a lot, I'll try it
2009-10-04T04:22:00.000Z	neip	steffan	I followed this page (https://launchpad.net/+help/soyuz/ppa-sources-list.html) and I got this error after apt-get update (Reading package lists... Done W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net jaunty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7D2C7A23BF810CD5  W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems)
2009-10-04T04:22:00.000Z	steffan	neip	you didn't follow that page
2009-10-04T04:23:00.000Z	neip	steffan	how so
2009-10-04T04:23:00.000Z	steffan	neip	the section on 'Telling Ubuntu how to authenticate the PPA' is required
2009-10-04T04:24:00.000Z	neip	steffan	I did type as it says and changed the key after the slash (sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys DB2035A6)
2009-10-04T04:27:00.000Z	neip	steffan	but I did type the right key as it says what could have caused the GPG error
