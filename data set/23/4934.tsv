2009-05-12T15:39:00.000Z	ror		is there a way to get the volume control in Jaunty back to how it was in Intrepid (i.e. vertical, or at the very least so scrolling up increases volume!) (at the moment scrolling up with the mousewheel slides it left, reducing volume
2009-05-12T15:41:00.000Z	ror		really? is that not normal? try it
2009-05-12T15:41:00.000Z	ror		ok
2009-05-12T15:42:00.000Z	ror		what package should I assign it to?
2009-05-12T15:42:00.000Z	ror		wow that's just insane :)
2009-05-12T15:42:00.000Z	ror		is there a way I can capture video?
2009-05-12T15:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	interesting bug, does the same thing here. Nice find...
2009-05-12T15:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	launchpad.net is where Ubuntu bugs go
2009-05-12T15:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	after you file that bug, post the URL here please, curious to follow it myself
2009-05-12T15:53:00.000Z	ror	Madpilot	I'm just filing the bug now, not sure which package it would be though, can't work out if it's gnome-applets or gnome-control-center
2009-05-12T15:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	you can leave the package blank if you're not sure
2009-05-12T15:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	that works, and if it's not the right package, someone connected to -applets will add the correct one
2009-05-12T16:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	your bug had actually already been filed. I marked it as a duplicate.
2009-05-12T16:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	it's one of those irritating bugs, known before release but not fixed...
2009-05-12T16:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	duplicate bugs just vanish, basically, so no need to change status
2009-05-12T16:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	the "new" tag is set remotely - notice the "assigned to" field has a link to Gnome's bugtracker
2009-05-12T16:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	and the Gnome bug's had no action on it since it was filed
2009-05-12T16:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	exactly, and Launchpad has a bot that tracks the status of bugs like that one on other bug reporting sites
2009-05-12T16:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	if you're a coder, go for it. You could also use the Launchpad bug to work out the patch, and let LP send it upstream
2009-05-12T16:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	#ubuntu-bugs & #ubuntu-desktop are two useful channels
2009-05-12T16:18:00.000Z	ror	Madpilot	I'm half a coder ;), I code at work in my job but I've never tried contributing to open source/large projects before so I don't know so much about how the management side of it works
2009-05-12T16:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	Ubuntu is run thru IRC channels & mailing lists, basically.
2009-05-12T16:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	ror	that -desktop channel - and the desktop mailing list - are probably the best places to start. Say hi, ask questions, get someone to help you, etc
