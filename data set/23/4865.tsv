2009-08-21T18:27:00.000Z	dustin		seems better than the other ircs I've tried lately :) everyone gets aggravated when I ask a question
2009-08-21T18:28:00.000Z	dustin		alright, I wiped windows, installed fedora and opensuse, and grub isn't showing it on the bootlist. I'm not altogether comfortable working from a terminal, so I was wondering about swapping to lilo
2009-08-21T18:29:00.000Z	dustin		would swapping to lilo be... simple?
2009-08-21T18:30:00.000Z	dustin		can anyone tell me if swapping to lilo would be particularly difficult?
2009-08-21T18:31:00.000Z	dustin		what do you mean by annoying at times?
2009-08-21T18:32:00.000Z	dustin		if I swap to lilo, how would it affect me? I'm running 8.04 btw
2009-08-21T18:32:00.000Z	dustin		anyone?
2009-08-21T18:33:00.000Z	dustin		How would swapping to lilo affect me?!?!
2009-08-21T18:33:00.000Z	dustin		I'm not the type to follow blindly
2009-08-21T18:33:00.000Z	dustin		bootloader
2009-08-21T18:33:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	you will get a complete different bootmanager, why do you want lilo?
2009-08-21T18:35:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	configuring lilo is even more tricky than grubs config. imho one needs a good reason to use lilo today
2009-08-21T18:36:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, add those entries, be happy
2009-08-21T18:36:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-08-21T18:37:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	when installing fedora/suse, have they wirtten their grub into partition?
2009-08-21T18:38:00.000Z	dustin	llutz	opensuse has not, I think THINK that fedora has
2009-08-21T18:39:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	you know on what partition you installed fedora/suse?
2009-08-21T18:40:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	please pastebin your /boot7grub/menu.lst
2009-08-21T18:40:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	please pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-08-21T18:41:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	good luck
2009-08-21T18:43:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	pastebin output of "sudo fdisk -l" please
2009-08-21T18:46:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	i doubt that
2009-08-21T18:47:00.000Z	llutz	dustin	i'm not sure if it will perform an OS-scan. it will work, but maybe not as you expect
