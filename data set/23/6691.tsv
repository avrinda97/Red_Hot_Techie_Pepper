2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	Hey I haven't been following your problem. Just saw the last part of the discussion. If you don't have anything important in your firefox profile I would delete that, and the mark firefox for reinstallation in synaptic, and see if that fixes firefox, and then install flash support with something like automatix
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	zoople	TLE	how?
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	Are you using the 64 bit version ?
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	of Ubuntu
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	zoople	TLE	no
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	ok, then first of all if you don't have anything important in you profile like bookmarks or something like that then we'll start by deleting you profile to make sure it is not posing problems. Close firefox, than in the top menubar (if you are using GNOME) clike places - home.
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	zoople	TLE	done
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	then make it show hidden files, if it is GNOME it is in tha menu show
2006-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	zoople	TLE	done
2006-11-07T17:03:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	then open the directory called .mozilla and in that open the directory called firefox, there you should see a folder that has a name with some jibberish followed by a .default in my computer it is vtfrhpug.default, then delete that
2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	zoople	TLE	yup done that..and reinstalled..all fine now thanks :D
2006-11-07T17:07:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	Your welcome, now if you want flash I would recommend using automatix to get, though some people would advice against it. It has alwasy worked fine for me, I have flash working just fine
2006-11-20T15:02:00.000Z	TLE	zoople	what deal how to install it ?
