2008-01-20T06:09:00.000Z	misslecommander		i sill cant remove the other install of Ubuntu without GRUB still failing, it seems i need an "active" install , in order for GRUB to function. so i am out 3gig of space
2008-01-20T06:10:00.000Z	misslecommander		is the linux swapfile shared accross installs ?
2008-01-20T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	if you set it up that way
2008-01-20T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	check your fstab
2008-01-20T06:12:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	thank you, will do
2008-01-20T06:15:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	will you look at this pastebin and make heads or tails of it please ?
2008-01-20T06:15:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	sure
2008-01-20T06:17:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	i have 2 physical drives and 1 cdrom http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/52722/
2008-01-20T06:19:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	i know it may look like a mess, but i have 3 OS on this machine, and need all the parttitons
2008-01-20T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	and, you're wondering where the swap space is so you can share it?  Right now you have no swap space.  You have five ntfs partitions, three on on drive, two on the other, and then on the former drive, you have another partition, which has your linux install on it
2008-01-20T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	Right now, we can't tell whats on each NTFS drive (well, at least not from the fstab), you'll have to either compare sizes, or drive contents or something like that
2008-01-20T06:21:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	yes, that is correct. i didnt want to mess with the swapfile as that is on an account that allows me to use this one
2008-01-20T06:22:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	if i can manage somehow, i will want to remove the other account from using it, so this one, will be the only one using it.
2008-01-20T06:22:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	thank you
2008-01-20T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	You have two accounts using what?  I don't see a swap file/partition at all
2008-01-20T06:25:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	yes thats right. i had to install another account to fix GRUB
2008-01-20T06:26:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	this is the account i would like to keep running, i tried to reove the "fixer" account, in hopes GRUB would remoin working, but it didnt. so install on the "fixer" account detected the swapfile i made on this account
2008-01-20T06:26:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	if that made sense :/
2008-01-20T06:26:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	i used Gparted to make swapfile on this account, but wasnt sure i made it active.
2008-01-20T06:27:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	evidently it isnt, which is good in a way
2008-01-20T06:27:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	i am out 3 gig of space, but, as long as this account keeps running i dont mind
2008-01-20T06:29:00.000Z	misslecommander	Flannel	thanks for your help on that
2008-01-20T06:30:00.000Z	Flannel	misslecommander	no problem
