2012-10-30T05:02:00.000Z	Guest23102		ich hab hier schwierigkeiten mit fehlerhaften Sektoren
2012-10-30T05:02:00.000Z	Guest23102		gibt es eine MÃ¶glichkeit die zu reparieren?
2012-10-30T05:04:00.000Z	Guest23102		I got troubles on some sectors...is there any possibility to repair them?
2012-10-30T05:05:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	probably not. not repair. with a lot of luck maybe ddrescue or something can find some of the data.
2012-10-30T05:08:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	there are two packages named ddrescue or similar in the repositories (software center) install the right one, then use it from a terminal. BUT depending on the kind of problem, you may want to do all the work from a healty disk when rescuing date from a faulty disk.
2012-10-30T05:11:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	before bother installing in a live session, plan for on what medium you want to save data
2012-10-30T05:13:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	you can open Disk Utility to see what s.m.a.r.t data says about it, how bad it is.
2012-10-30T05:15:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	are we talking system files that can be re-installed when you have a new disk, or is it invaluable family photos, which should be backed up anyway?
2012-10-30T05:16:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	and no backup? (otherwise you wouldnt ask i guess)
2012-10-30T05:18:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	there is info on data rescue on ubuntu support sites, e.g.: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
2012-10-30T05:19:00.000Z	Guest23102	David-A	just follow the steps?
2012-10-30T05:20:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	and remember, don't use/mount the disk if it is bad and deteroating, let the tools copy data to a new disk as good as they can
2012-10-30T05:20:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	check what steps apply to you
2012-10-30T05:20:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	do you have a good available disk to copy to?
2012-10-30T05:22:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	is the usb-pin big enough? if you use ddrescue it must be at least the size of the partition copying from.
2012-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	you can use foremost or similar to read only certanin filetypes directly from the faulty disk, then usb-pin only need space for the documents plus ghost copies.
2012-10-30T05:25:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	but if the disk is bad, i'd recommend a full ddrescue first and foremost on the copy. then you need space for the copy.
2012-10-30T05:26:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	package name is gddrescue
2012-10-30T05:28:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	if you use ddrescue you must have space for the copy, like a new disk. how big is the failing partition? how big is the usp-pin?
2012-10-30T05:32:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	it is safer to buy a new disk. you can run "foremost" or "testdisk" to try recover certain filetypes directly from the faulty partition, but it will take an awful lot of time, during which the disk can become worse. and the usb-bin can still be too small if they find a lot of ghost copies of chosen document types.
2012-10-30T05:39:00.000Z	David-A	Guest23102	hope it works out. mind to participate in my poll? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2001222 :)
2012-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	Guest23102	David-A	I can't participate in this poll...but if it helps: I'd say once or a few times a year.  --> But just the system. Important files are safed more often. Let's say every day...
