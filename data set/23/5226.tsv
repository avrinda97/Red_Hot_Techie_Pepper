2007-06-19T16:01:00.000Z	|Osiris		vols, just use the grub commands
2007-06-19T16:01:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	is it set correctly in /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2007-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	should be # groot=(hd0,6)
2007-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	is there a comment like that in menu.lst. if not update-grub will fail
2007-06-19T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	should be in the automatic kernels list section
2007-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	you should have the directive I mentioned or update-grub wont work
2007-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	|Osiris	mwe	you meen the groot?
2007-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	# groot=(hd0,6)

2007-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	it should be a comment that's how update-grub works

2007-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	it reads the comments in the automatic kernel list
2007-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	|Osiris	if you don't have a such a section the file is broken
2007-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	|Osiris	mwe	so it is correct?
