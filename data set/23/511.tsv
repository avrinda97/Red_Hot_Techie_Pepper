2012-04-20T20:06:00.000Z	LmAt		Hi, there.  I'm having trouble with my ssh client.  It doesn't display some window-drawing extended ascii characters properly.
2012-04-20T20:07:00.000Z	LmAt		http://www.asciitable.com/ shows some codes.  For instance, number 196 is a vertical table line.  It shows up as little a with an hat (accent ague?). :(
2012-04-20T20:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	consider your shell as the issue rather than the SSH client
2012-04-20T20:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	that's Accent Grave
2012-04-20T20:08:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	oh, hat, Accent Circonflexe
2012-04-20T20:08:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	What does my shell have to do with it?
2012-04-20T20:08:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	I'm using bash...
2012-04-20T20:08:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	isn't the shell displaying it?
2012-04-20T20:09:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	um... my ssh client is displaying the program that is displaying those characters (tmux or elinks in this case).
2012-04-20T20:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	in bash, run 'local'
2012-04-20T20:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	in bash, run 'locale'
2012-04-20T20:10:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	okay.  What should I expect?  I see LANG=en_US.UTF-8
2012-04-20T20:10:00.000Z	LmAt		and 10 or so others.
2012-04-20T20:10:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	"my ssh client is displaying", you're referring to x forwarding?
2012-04-20T20:10:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	I'm using putty.
2012-04-20T20:10:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	in ubuntu?
2012-04-20T20:11:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	I'm running Microsoft Windows XP.
2012-04-20T20:11:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	this is #ubuntu
2012-04-20T20:11:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	Where should I look for help with putty for Windows?
2012-04-20T20:11:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	I was hoping it would be a $TERM issue or something :(
2012-04-20T20:12:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	I guess I should see if putty for linux has the same issue...
2012-04-20T20:12:00.000Z	ldiamond	LmAt	putty has a bunch of settings for that. Look through the setting window
2012-04-20T20:13:00.000Z	LmAt	ldiamond	thanks.
