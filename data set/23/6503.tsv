2006-03-27T09:31:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	how do I change my firefox icon
2006-03-27T09:33:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	I'm not sure... /usr/share/pixmaps/mozilla-firefox.png maybe
2006-03-27T09:34:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	do I need to replace that file?
2006-03-27T09:34:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	what icon exactly do you want to change?
2006-03-27T09:34:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	the blue firefox icon
2006-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	I believe you can just replace that icon
2006-03-27T09:39:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	when I move the file into the directory I get you do not have permission to write to this folder
2006-03-27T09:40:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	so what would the command be for replacing this icon?
2006-03-27T09:42:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	sudo mv /usr/share/pixmaps/mozilla-firefox.png /usr/share/pixmaps/mozilla-firefox.png_backup && sudo mv /path/to/your/new/icon/here /usr/share/pixmaps/mozilla-firefox.png
2006-03-27T09:47:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	I still got a permission error
2006-03-27T09:47:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	what does 'sudo echo hi' do?
2006-03-27T09:48:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	prints hi
2006-03-27T09:48:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	paste the exact command you used
2006-03-27T09:51:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	pastbin.com/615566
2006-03-27T09:52:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	you missed a sudo
2006-03-27T09:56:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	thanks, I justd do sudo home/username/filename /usr/share/pixmaps/ and it worked
2006-03-27T10:03:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	on a different subject how do I install apache web server
2006-03-27T10:06:00.000Z	ddg_bluesky	_jason	that is great apache already installed in one simple command, I noticed in that link that php4 and mysql 4 are used, why not 5?
2006-03-27T10:06:00.000Z	_jason	ddg_bluesky	php5 is in the repos, mysql5 is not
