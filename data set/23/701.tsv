2011-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	DrMorphias		ok i need help installing ubuntu.  i cant boot into it?!?
2011-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	You can boot a live CD.  Try that
2011-04-01T07:20:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	i can boot a live cd , and install it, but after installing grub window never shows up.
2011-04-01T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	What happens when you boot?
2011-04-01T07:20:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	my computer just idles then reboots continously, and yes its 10.10.
2011-04-01T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	press shift a whole bunch after bios but before the reset thing.  See if you can get the grub menu to show up
2011-04-01T07:22:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	i think it has something to do with the rocketraid inside my computer.  it isnt using any raid but i think it might be confusing grub :/
2011-04-01T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	It might be.  BUt it sounds to me that grub is loading, loading Ubuntu, and Ubuntu is crashing
2011-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	i know how i can boot into ubuntu, and thats using EasyBCD in windows but im trying to GET RID of windows lol
2011-04-01T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	Well you need Ubuntu to boot before you can get rid of windows.
2011-04-01T07:27:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	pressing shift during boot time is what makes the grub menu show up.  Yes
2011-04-01T07:27:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	You press shift to get it to show the menu.  Some boot loader is running or the system would say 'no operating system found'
2011-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	it got me to see grub loading and then it restarted
2011-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	You saw the menu?  What option did you choose?  What options were there?
2011-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	it didnt show the menu. just a blinking cursosor and then grub loading then restart.
2011-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	Mmm,  I'm not sure.  Maybe grub is crashing?  If you can't get to the menu I don't know what to tell you
2011-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	Try resetting the bios?
2011-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	like take out the bios battery?
2011-04-01T07:58:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	There usually is an option in the bios to 'reset to factory defaults' taking out the battery is too much work for what you need to do.  We just need all the settings reset
2011-04-01T08:02:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	that didnt work
2011-04-01T08:02:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	I'm not sure then.  Sorry!  :(
2011-04-01T08:07:00.000Z	DrMorphias	edbian	grub stores logs someplace right? i mean since its grub thats crashing maybe you can help me diagnose the output?
2011-04-01T08:08:00.000Z	edbian	DrMorphias	If you could get the output.  Are you able to get to the menu?  I'm not sure you're even getting shift to activate anything
