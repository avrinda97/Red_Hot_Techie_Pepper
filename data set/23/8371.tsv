2005-03-01T11:28:00.000Z	Echylo		question :p
2005-03-01T11:28:00.000Z	Echylo		how you update to hoary? just with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2005-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	Echylo		ok
2005-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	Echylo		that was a little detail I missed :P
2005-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	Echylo		where is the sources.list again?
2005-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	/etc/apt/
2005-03-11T13:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	desktop shortcut or console shortcut ?
2005-03-11T13:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	in your home directory there is a file called .bashrc look in there for some aliases
2005-03-14T11:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	can you load the mp3's in a piece of editing software like audacity then split them ?
2005-03-14T11:44:00.000Z	Echylo	LinuxJones	I'll check it ou
2005-03-15T10:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	you have a big mp3 with a few songs you want to seperate ?
2005-03-15T10:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	the songs are in 1 mp3 file and you want to seperate them right ?
2005-03-15T10:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	you can use audacity but you will need to install the mp3 encoder 1 sec I will get it for you
2005-03-15T10:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	you need audacity and libmad0
2005-03-15T10:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	you will then need to tell audacity where the library is under File >> Preferences >> File Formats >> Mp3 Export Setup
2005-03-15T10:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	it's >> /usr/lib/libmad.so.0
2005-03-15T10:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	when you see the filter select "all files"
2005-03-15T10:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	sorry that was audacity and liblame0
2005-03-15T10:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	throw that .cue file away you can just mark each mp3 manually then export it as a single song.
2005-04-27T13:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	it would be faster to do a re-install
2005-04-27T13:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	what kind of printer do you have ?
2005-04-27T13:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Echylo	if it's usb yeah
