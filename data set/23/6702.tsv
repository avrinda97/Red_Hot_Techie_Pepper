2007-03-03T07:37:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	people use windows because as soon as their hear linux they have no idea what it is and run
2007-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	you can get the windows source code from ms?
2007-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	generally people run Windows because the majority of business software is bespoke or written by small software houses purely for Windows
2007-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	of course, if you partner with them / pay enough money
2007-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	sorry, I am a poor college student who wants to be a gamedev or a *nix sys admin :)
2007-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	well, as a game dev you'll be buying vista and developing on windows, so you can develop stuff that will port easily to xbox360 to maximise your sales :)
2007-03-03T08:49:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	there is nothing like mIRC, unfortunately :(
2007-03-03T08:50:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	or fortunately? :)
2007-03-03T08:50:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	unfortunately in my case - I used to IRC like this - http://www.jamesfry.com/irc.png
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	holy crap, dude
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	gaim gives me tabs :D
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	you should see it now I use freenode too :)
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	I hate tabs
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	I'm on xchat now anyway, I'm getting used to tabs, but it is a bit odd
2007-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	any experience with encoding?
2007-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	as in crypto? or in audio coding ?
2007-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	video/audio, I am looking around for nice GUIs for mencoder
2007-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	or text encoding? eg unicode/ etc
2007-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	no idea sorry - not my cup of tea (I'm more into NLP / text processing, semantic web/networks/understanding, and music)
2007-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	k
2007-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	I probably should get into that too though :)
2007-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	slavik	linxeh	one problem I have so far is that there is no avisynth on linux and hence no YATTA
2008-01-07T04:16:00.000Z	linxeh	slavik	try #lad / #lau # alsa
