2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		Haha.
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		Really?
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		Hmm.
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		I checked it for defects twice.
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		Should I try re-burning the ISO?
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		k
2007-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	Oswy		Haha.
2007-03-18T14:32:00.000Z	Oswy		Anyone?
2007-03-18T14:33:00.000Z	Oswy		Kernel panic, what do I do?
2007-03-18T14:34:00.000Z	Oswy		Checked the CD, getting a kernel panic; should I just try reburning the ISO?
2007-03-18T14:34:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	have you seen this: http://lists.slug.org.au/archives/slug/2005/01/msg00084.html
2007-03-18T14:36:00.000Z	Oswy	Innatech	I don't get what that link is for.
2007-03-18T15:00:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	Well.....I think you can net install Ubuntu.
2007-03-18T15:02:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	Links incoming! Somewhat outdated, but should be a decent start.

2007-03-18T15:05:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	yeah.
2007-03-18T15:05:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	Here, try this. It's more detailed and updated for breezy.
2007-03-18T15:08:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	You don't want to do it exactly the way he describes. Check the link at the bottom too: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot
2007-03-18T15:09:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	you'll need a DHCP server to give you machine an IP. Your router will be running one. You should be fine from there. Read through the blog entry, but follow the instructions in the linked Ubuntu community page.
2007-03-18T15:12:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	just a sec. I'll read through it and see if I can host what you need for a little while. It'll be slow over the net but better than nothing.
2007-03-18T15:12:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	yes--if you have a laptop, that's idea.
2007-03-18T15:13:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	You can put a TFTP server on your windows laptop (google: solar wind tftp) and then point your server at it to netinstall.
2007-03-18T15:20:00.000Z	Innatech	Oswy	ok. I'm afraid I've got to run. Hopefully others here can help you out from here.  However, before you get too far down the rabbit hole, I'd suggest trying to boot Knoppix. It's worth burning it to have it around, and if you can get that up and running you can come at it from that angle.
