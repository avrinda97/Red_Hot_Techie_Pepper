2005-03-30T09:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	what are you trying to do?
2005-03-30T09:47:00.000Z	madstop	apokryphos	just installing kde.  Synaptic is confusing me; not sure which package I should install first.
2005-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	glad it's working well :)
2005-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	you'll wanna turn on anti-aliasing fonts
2005-03-30T10:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	cool :). Any other questions you can ask in #kubuntu ;)
2005-03-30T10:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	then scroll down to Panel, and change the shortcut for Popup Launch menu.
2005-03-30T10:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	:P
2005-03-30T10:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	you can :)
2005-03-30T10:36:00.000Z	madstop	apokryphos	don't know how, used to be kde default (when I installed from universe before or whatever, pre-kubuntu warty) Never mind, I'll google it -- er koogle it...
2005-03-30T10:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	heh. If you hold on for a sec, I'll find the exact command to put as a shortcut.
2005-03-30T10:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	capabilities of DCOP are unlimited :)
2005-03-30T10:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	You don't even need DCOP for this one :)
2005-03-30T10:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	kcontrol > Regional & Accessibility > Keyboard Shortcuts
2005-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	I see that Win-key is now used as an alternate to Ctrl/Alt in KDE. That means that you'll have to make the shortcut like Win+<somekey> I think. :|
2005-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	madstop	apokryphos	the panel popup launch won't let me set just the win logo key
2005-03-30T10:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	it's kind of annoying, but I can see why they would do that.
2005-03-30T10:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	Well, konqueror does happen to be one of my very favourite progs of all time. :)
2005-03-30T10:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	there have been some great GUI advances in 3.4, yup.
2005-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	now, now. No trolling ;). Many gnome-users here.
2005-03-30T11:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	hehe
2005-03-30T11:24:00.000Z	madstop	apokryphos	are you an ubuntu developer?
2005-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	not at all :P
2005-03-31T08:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	madstop	odd; it's fine here...
