2008-07-30T21:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	m0u5e	most likley its gonna be /etc/gconf/.....
2008-07-30T21:39:00.000Z	m0u5e	gnomefreak	but this is a user setting, why would it be under there? :X
2008-07-30T21:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	m0u5e	it can be either but most likely /etc as its not really a user setting as the rest of $HOME is
