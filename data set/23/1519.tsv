2010-02-15T20:32:00.000Z	NoOutlet		I'm having some difficulty setting up a dual boot system. I have two hard drives and I'd like to set up Linux on my Master, XP on my Slave. Is that possible or should I install them both on the Master in order to dual boot?
2010-02-15T20:34:00.000Z	NoOutlet		Well, XP is not loading from GRUB. I'm concerned that since it's a drive that I have to mount once I've loaded Ubuntu, maybe it's not being looked at for Grub?
2010-02-15T20:35:00.000Z	NoOutlet		So Ubuntu on slave and XP on master?
2010-02-15T20:35:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	what's your configuration of drives?  what types of drives, whats on each drive?
2010-02-15T20:38:00.000Z	NoOutlet	Trek	I'm not sure how you mean "configuration". They both have a single partition. One has Ubuntu, one has XP. The one with XP is a Seagate Barracuda. I'm not sure what the other is.
2010-02-15T20:38:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	I meant drive interface type, IDE SATA etc.  Better question is how old are the drives?
2010-02-15T20:39:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	I'm trying to figure out if there's any BIOS issues here
2010-02-15T20:39:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	hence my questions
2010-02-15T20:39:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	both of them>
2010-02-15T20:40:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	it should be detecting, which drive is GRUB installed on?
2010-02-15T20:41:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	if Windows drive has the boot loader on it, set it to master, then set the other to slave
2010-02-15T20:42:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	whichever has grub on it should be the master, the BIOS will see it first
2010-02-15T20:42:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	if its not detecting Windows, it means there's issues with your drives, have you updated GRUB's list lately?
2010-02-15T20:43:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	lets try this, boot to only one of the drives (Disconnect the other)
2010-02-15T20:44:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	whichever one has grub on it should be master
2010-02-15T20:44:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	other should be slave.'
2010-02-15T20:44:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	the other issue is if GRUB can see the drive...
2010-02-15T20:45:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	if the computer boots to the drive individually, then the issue lies not in drive issues, but GRUB issues...
2010-02-15T20:45:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	you might look into updating the GRUB list hold on a sec...
2010-02-15T20:48:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	try in console: sudo update-grub, not sure if it will update GRUB's lists of partitions
2010-02-15T20:58:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	then perhaps its stored on the Ubuntu drive
2010-02-15T20:59:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	you need the Ubuntu drive in as well, the bootloader files are stored on there
2010-02-15T21:54:00.000Z	Trek	NoOutlet	good to hear
