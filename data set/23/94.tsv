2012-07-24T18:55:00.000Z	Searli		Hi there
2012-07-24T18:55:00.000Z	Searli		I am having problems with Unity
2012-07-24T18:55:00.000Z	Searli		Did an update
2012-07-24T18:55:00.000Z	Searli		and now it wont start
2012-07-24T18:55:00.000Z	Searli		get only the wall paper on login
2012-07-24T18:56:00.000Z	Searli		I looked on hte internet
2012-07-24T18:56:00.000Z	Searli		and tried various suggestions
2012-07-24T18:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	can you log in through terminal?
2012-07-24T18:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	tried reinstalling unity?
2012-07-24T18:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	when you reinstalled Unity, did you purge it first or just uninstall?
2012-07-24T19:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	actually, now that I think about it, did you try logging in as a different user?
2012-07-24T19:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	guest should be fine as well, but you could always create a new user and try to login with that (delete it afterwards if it bothers you)
2012-07-24T19:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	well, if it works, then it's config files causing problems (probably compiz) so you should just delete them and it should create new ones next time you login
2012-07-24T19:12:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	did the new user work or not?
2012-07-24T19:42:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	if I were you, I would just wipe any config files I can find related to unity/compiz
2012-07-24T19:42:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	or if you don't have any application settings you really need to change, just get rid of all of the config files
2012-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	change=keep
2012-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	Searli	gaelfx	I would love to ... which ones? Where?
2012-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	pretty much all of the files in your /home that start with .
2012-07-24T19:44:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	of course, you shouldn't have to delete any of the applications you recognize, just anything else, especially if you're not sure what it is or where it came from
2012-07-24T19:45:00.000Z	Searli	gaelfx	.... hmmmm I dont think so ....
2012-07-24T19:45:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	and almost everything in your home folder with a . in front is a config file/folder
2012-07-24T19:46:00.000Z	gaelfx	Searli	yeah, like I said, you don't have to delete the ones you know you want to keep, just eveerything else
