2007-10-31T03:35:00.000Z	Magdin		Hi everyone, have a problem with sound - no sound at all with Gutsy! I installed manually latest ALSA (v15) and no success. My sound log from alsa-script.sh is here  - http://pastebin.ca/755861. Please help
2007-10-31T03:36:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	did you install from CD (clean install) or upgrade with upgrade-manager from feisty?
2007-10-31T03:36:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	from CD. I updated but i got million other problems. so i reinstalled from live CD
2007-10-31T03:37:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	can i have alsa and oss installed at the same time?
2007-10-31T03:37:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	have you checked your mixer levels?
2007-10-31T03:37:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	i did, even installed alsa gui mixer, nothing works
2007-10-31T03:38:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	how can i debug it step by step?
2007-10-31T03:38:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	checked lsmod for appropriate modules?
2007-10-31T03:38:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	have a look here -  http://pastebin.ca/755861 is it all i need?
2007-10-31T03:38:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	I'm not sure... sound is a bit of a black box to me.  My experience has always been either that it just worked, or just doesn't... :-/
2007-10-31T03:39:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	speakers plugged in ;)
2007-10-31T03:40:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	its a notebook :)
2007-10-31T03:40:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	when you say you installed the latest Alsa manually, do you mean from ubuntu reps or from upstream source?
2007-10-31T03:41:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	got sources (driver, lib, util) compiled installed
2007-10-31T03:41:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	you tried it with the ubuntu ALSA first, I assume?
2007-10-31T03:43:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	yes bu i couldnt run sound recorder and skype want working eather (no sound). Now i can round sound recorder but all apps without sound
2007-10-31T03:43:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	did aps other than skype have sound?
2007-10-31T03:43:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	yes
2007-10-31T03:43:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	some of them did
2007-10-31T03:44:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	that is a very odd problem indeed....  It is quite likely out of my league...
2007-10-31T03:45:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	yeah im confused. i can try to reinstall it again, but i'm sick of doing it again and again
2007-10-31T03:45:00.000Z	j85wilson	Magdin	fair enough...  I really wish I could be more help.
2007-10-31T03:45:00.000Z	Magdin	j85wilson	no worries, thanks anyway
