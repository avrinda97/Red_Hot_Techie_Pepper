2009-03-11T12:44:00.000Z	Aberration		Hi all!
2009-03-11T12:45:00.000Z	Aberration		I installed fedora next to ubuntu, but I can't find no ubuntu in grub... I tried to paste the ubuntu's grub list into the fedora's grub list... it didn't work :(
2009-03-11T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	did you use a seperate /boot partition ?
2009-03-11T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	or a shared one ?
2009-03-11T12:46:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	sorry... again : Hell I don't know!
2009-03-11T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	the bottom line is when you install 2 linux distros to different /boot directories/partitions you create a conflifct as there will be two menu.lst files
2009-03-11T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	which menas grub will only reference one (you have to work out which one) but each OS will update it's own menu.lst file which keeps them out of sync
2009-03-11T12:47:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	I got 2 list files!
2009-03-11T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	yes, thats not good
2009-03-11T12:49:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	oooki... do you have an idea of the solution?
2009-03-11T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	well, there are manu solutions, however you want to "fix" this so you don't have to keep fixing it
2009-03-11T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	the answer to that is re-install both OS's - but make sure you use a shared /boot partition
2009-03-11T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	no
2009-03-11T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	sorry - "no" wasn't for you
2009-03-11T12:50:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	argh... but... what if I delete fedora and restore grub?
2009-03-11T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	that won't change anything
2009-03-11T12:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	if you want to do it right, delete ubuntu and fedora, restore your windows boot loader, then re-install the linux distros you want, but use a shared /boot partition
2009-03-11T12:55:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	if you don't mind I'll try to find a more subtle solution first... I did too many things to configure ubuntu properly ot re-install it from scratch...
2009-03-11T12:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	ok - deelte fedora, re-apply grub from within the ubuntu livecd pointing grub at your menu.lst file on ubuntu partition
2009-03-11T12:57:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	many many thanks... but I find it weird that linux put vista on its grub and not other  linuxes...
2009-03-11T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	re-read what I just said and it explains why it uses it's "own"grub
2009-03-11T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Aberration	it's user error
2009-03-11T12:58:00.000Z	Aberration	ikonia	as always ... i'll try to do this more carefully next time!
