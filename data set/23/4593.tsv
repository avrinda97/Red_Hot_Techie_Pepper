2007-11-08T10:02:00.000Z	Gnea		oh split-sh!t, the upgrade from feisty to gutsy is blowing some hairy goat nads.
2007-11-08T10:02:00.000Z	Gnea		!gutsy
2007-11-08T10:02:00.000Z	Gnea		gdm won't work right, but X by itself will
2007-11-08T10:02:00.000Z	Gnea		it shouldn't be this way, it should simply work right
2007-11-08T10:03:00.000Z	Gnea		!sound
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	it's not an ordinary sound problem, I've already tried the Comprehensive Sound Guide of Ubuntu Forums
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	to say what it is
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	s/to/so/g

2007-11-08T10:20:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	I tried following a comprehensive sound guide but when I enter "alsamixer" I get an error
2007-11-08T10:21:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	"alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device"
2007-11-08T10:21:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	anything in /proc/asound/cards?
2007-11-08T10:22:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	is that a directory..?
2007-11-08T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	it's a file, cat it
2007-11-08T10:22:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	yeah:  "1 [default        ]: USB-Audio - PnP Audio Device"
2007-11-08T10:23:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	and u have some sort of usb headphones or something plugged in?
2007-11-08T10:23:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	No. It's my onboard sound. It's located on the USB bus rather than on the PCI bus like usual
2007-11-08T10:24:00.000Z	Gnea	ShadowApex	never heard of it, what make/model is that?
2007-11-08T10:24:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	It's a terrible motherboard; lol. It's an ASUS M2N-Plus SLI
2007-11-08T10:25:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	It's C-Media 6501 I think.. the sound chipset
2007-11-08T10:28:00.000Z	ShadowApex	Gnea	any ideas..?
