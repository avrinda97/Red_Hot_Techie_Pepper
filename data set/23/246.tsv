2012-03-07T10:35:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  64 bit works for intel and amd.
2012-03-07T10:54:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  won't run = what exactly?
2012-03-07T10:55:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	A caching problem it seems. It stops part way through the wall of text and says "No Caching mode page present"
2012-03-07T10:56:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  on 64 and 32 @ boot?
2012-03-07T10:56:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	I had it on both for the same roblem.
2012-03-07T10:56:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  name brand of computer?
2012-03-07T10:57:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	I built it myself. It's my first custom build ever.
2012-03-07T10:57:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	So "Lirth Electronics"?
2012-03-07T10:57:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  ...  OK  :)
2012-03-07T10:58:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	Intel i5 2500k
2012-03-07T10:59:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  ...and I imagine you've got a good name brand mobo with that.  I'm guessing there's a configuration switch somewhere that you should look at, but as it's a custom build, where to start?
2012-03-07T10:59:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	Huh? As I said this is my first build, so simplification is greatly appreciated.
2012-03-07T11:00:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	I got the Asus Sabertooth (someletterhere)67 for my motherboard
2012-03-07T11:01:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  sorry.  I was merely reflecting on the fact that you seem to have a name brand cpu and motherboard.  I suspect a configuration switch needs to be set somewhere, but I wouldn't know where to start.

2012-03-07T11:03:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	Thanks, I'll check that out tomorrow. I have school in the morning and should get to bed.
2012-03-07T11:04:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  good luck.
2012-03-11T05:56:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	also were they both installed the same way?  i.e. upgrade or fresh install?
2012-03-11T05:57:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  *bet* login window settings are different...
2012-03-11T05:57:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	Yeah. I had some problems installing my desktop though because of my gpu. I don't remember changing any login settings.
2012-03-11T05:58:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Lirth	  clean install = 100% default settings.  upgrade = retained settings ...
2012-03-11T05:58:00.000Z	Lirth	CFHowlett	Clean installs. I made it dual boot on my laptop and have only Ubuntu on my desktop (which I built a week ago).
