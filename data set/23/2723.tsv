2008-11-30T22:05:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		im currently running the ubuntu distro and im trying to set a media center, the problem is my nvidia drivers are not installing correctly, they only display 648X480
2008-11-30T22:06:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		i have not
2008-11-30T22:07:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		where can i find this live cd? i tried the envy app, and its also displaying my monitor as CRT, so its not detecting right. i have not been able to run the command line to edit the xorg, it only gives me keyboard options
2008-11-30T22:08:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		rug alt+ctrl+F7 have you tried this?
2008-11-30T22:09:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		ok that is the keystroke to get into GNOME
2008-11-30T22:09:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		you will need to edit the init file in order to boot to GNOME permanently
2008-11-30T22:10:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		^for rugb
2008-11-30T22:11:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		rugb ==> /etc/init
2008-11-30T22:12:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		you will have to change the runlevel to something other than command line
2008-11-30T22:14:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton		someone told me to check out the livecd. i can already run ubuntu off the cd, how would this work any better for installing nvidia drivers?
2008-11-30T22:14:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	you can install nvidia drivers and then ctrl+alt+backspace and the nvidia drivers will be loaded without a restart
2008-11-30T22:17:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton	Larrxi	have tried something like this, but nvidia returns the option that my kernel needs to be modified and everytime it tries it fails
2008-11-30T22:18:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	ive never got anyhing like that when installing the ubuntu nvidia packages
2008-11-30T22:19:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton	Larrxi	ubuntu is not fully updated, but it is a fresh install and i cannot edit the xorg file or install the drivers without the "failed to build kernel" error
2008-11-30T22:21:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	do you get failed to build kernel when you are installing the drivers from apt-get or synaptic?
2008-11-30T22:24:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	try to find a ubuntu package for the version you want
2008-11-30T22:25:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton	Larrxi	i have tried the envy install, that seems to work, but when i get into ubuntu the screens is locked in 640X480
2008-11-30T22:26:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	did you run nvidia-config or whatever it is called? also you can try to add the resolutions manually to xorg.conf
2008-11-30T22:27:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton	Larrxi	i cant edit the xorg.conf file it only gives me keyboard options :(
2008-11-30T22:28:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	then add for the monitor
2008-11-30T22:30:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	do you got the section "screen"?
2008-11-30T22:30:00.000Z	Kevin_Hampton	Larrxi	i had to boot into windows right now, :P screen is way too messed up on ubuntu
2008-11-30T22:32:00.000Z	Larrxi	Kevin_Hampton	ok but here is how to add resolutions: http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=58134
