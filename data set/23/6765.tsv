2006-01-10T17:24:00.000Z	dos-assassin		I am sitting on a network with 2 other computer, both on Windows XPSP2 OS, and instead of installing my printer, cause its evil and doesn't want to be on my machine, I am going to install it to one of the windows machines... will I still have use of my printer with it being on another machine?
2006-01-10T17:25:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	Yes, but you'll have to set up printer sharing on the machine it's connected to.
2006-01-10T17:25:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Ok can I ask for some guidance on how to do this?
2006-01-10T17:25:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	I can help with the Ubuntu side of it... :)
2006-01-10T17:26:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Lol... that'll be good enough... I recently switched to Linux so I am just learning how to operate it... but I know Windows like the back of my hand
2006-01-10T17:34:00.000Z	dos-assassin	PuMpErNiCkLe	you still there?
2006-01-10T17:36:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	yup
2006-01-10T17:36:00.000Z	dos-assassin		So you gonna help me with the Ubuntu part of it? lol
2006-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	Ready if you are.
2006-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Yep, I got all the time in the world
2006-01-10T17:38:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	Okay... it should be fairly straightforward.  Go to 'System' -> 'Administration' -> 'Printing'
2006-01-10T17:38:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Ok
2006-01-10T17:38:00.000Z	dos-assassin		I got that
2006-01-10T17:39:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	From the 'Printer' menu, select 'new printer' -> 'windows printer (SMB)'
2006-01-10T17:39:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	(you'll have to select 'network printer')
2006-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	And then fill in the textboxes as required.  Some of that might be auto-detected.
2006-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Cool... alright I think I can handle it from here... thanks alot
2006-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	Cool :)
2006-01-10T17:41:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Just one more question... once it is installed on the other machine... will I need the driver to use the printer or can I just tell the printer to print and it will work?
2006-01-10T17:43:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	dos-assassin	It shouldn't require the driver, as it's not operating the device... windows is doing that, the ubuntu box is just sending the printable data.
2006-01-10T17:43:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Sweet... again thanks alot lol... I really needed the use of this printer or it was my ass tomorrow at work lol... much appreciated... later
2006-01-10T06:27:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Anyone know how to install Yahelinux on this OS?
2006-01-10T06:29:00.000Z	dos-assassin	PuMpErNiCkLe	you still in here?
