2010-08-29T03:23:00.000Z	MrJones		hi
2010-08-29T03:23:00.000Z	MrJones		I'm on 8.04 lts and installed python-openssl and python-pyopenssl and still 'python -c "import ssl"' gives me ImportError: No module named ssl - what am I doing wrong?
2010-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	it sounds like your trying to import a file named ssl
2010-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	MrJones	buntunub	I am trying to import the ssl namespace, as usually done in python
2010-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	try using the filename to import
2010-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	MrJones	buntunub	filename?
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	MrJones		I want to access the system's installed openssl python binding
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	buntunub		mrq
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	MrJones		therefore I'm using "import ssl" to import the library's namesapce
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	ike import.ssl
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	MrJones	buntunub	are you sure that's valid python?
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	no its just an example
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	MrJones	buntunub	whatever you're aiming for, it gives an invalid syntax
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	MrJones		example for what?
2010-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	yea
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	MrJones		my problem is, openssl for python is installed, yet "import ssl" fails
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	MrJones		so what's wrong? :(
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	MrJones		normally this should work if the system python had ssl installed
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	its seeing nothing but ssl as the filename so its giving the error
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	MrJones		you noticed the -c, did you
2010-08-29T03:27:00.000Z	MrJones		which executes commands on the python command line
2010-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	MrJones	buntunub	python -c "print 'hello world'"
2010-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	buntunub	MrJones	yea not sure its complaining at me too when i do that
