2008-05-07T05:40:00.000Z	jpastore		hi I upgraded to 8.04 and now my wireless driver is no longer working. can someone point me in the right direction.
2008-05-07T05:42:00.000Z	jpastore		intel 3945
2008-05-07T05:43:00.000Z	jpastore		I tried to compile the linux driver which was the iwl driver that I downloaded from intel but the it failed...
2008-05-07T05:43:00.000Z	jpastore		it was workign in 7.10
2008-05-07T05:43:00.000Z	jpastore		I was using wicd which got upgrade and stopped working
2008-05-07T05:44:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	some folks have been hit with a bug with the transition from ipw to iwl
2008-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	I think that might be the case here from what I've been seeing on the forums but can't verify
2008-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	how is taht bug resolved?
2008-05-07T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	oddly enough, a fresh install of kde4 had it workining out of the box for me-->perhaps gnome might do the same might try the live cd and check it out
2008-05-07T05:46:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	I tried booting off a live cd and it didn't seem like it was working...but my dhcp server was screen and nm-applet seems to have a problem working when you take an adapter off roaming mode
2008-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	best when in live cd to drop to a shell and see what ifconfig/iwconfig turn up
2008-05-07T05:48:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	ok let's say for a second, that it's successful. how does that help me unless I go for a complete reinstall which is not an option right now
2008-05-07T05:49:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	clearly not, just lets you know that it is upgrades and not fresh installs that has the bug-->though you could copy your home partition elsewehre and just copy it back
2008-05-07T05:49:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	fair enough
2008-05-07T06:49:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	so booting from the live cd didn't help...no love with the wifi
2008-06-30T17:23:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	that site loads fine here
2008-06-30T17:23:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	how do I troubleshoot why this isn't loading for me?
2008-06-30T17:24:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	you installed flashplugin-nonfree?
2008-06-30T17:24:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	yes I do...
2008-06-30T17:25:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	that is odd; is there some other setup you have going that might affect this?
2008-06-30T17:25:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	I don't think so...
2008-06-30T17:27:00.000Z	jpastore	bazhang	thanks a restart got it working...I should have tested that before bothering you guys...
2008-06-30T17:27:00.000Z	bazhang	jpastore	nicely done :)
