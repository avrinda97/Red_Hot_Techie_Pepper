2010-04-16T17:28:00.000Z	seidl		hm i'm a bit frustrated nobody here is trying to help me with my gpanel problem
2010-04-16T17:30:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	people come in and out of here all the time. restate your question every 10-15 minutes, and you'll likely find someone who can help before much longer.
2010-04-16T17:31:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	well i ws used to get help here immediately - but ill try later thx
2010-04-16T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	if you need help immediately, i imagine you can purchase support from Canonical.
2010-04-16T18:06:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	what are the permissions of the directories /home/<username>/.gconf and /home/<username>/.gconfd?
2010-04-16T18:08:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	they are rwx------- and owned by me - it cpompared that to another machine and this somehow seem ok
2010-04-16T18:09:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	the thing ist also: i can change gconf keys but nut the ones for the panel apps
2010-04-16T18:09:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	others seem to work
2010-04-16T18:09:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	and the permissions of all subdirectories are similar?
2010-04-16T18:10:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	yes
2010-04-16T18:10:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	you haven't run X as root, or run the configuration editor via sudo, right?
2010-04-16T18:11:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	the first thing not - the second thing i dunno
2010-04-16T18:11:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	i might try that?
2010-04-16T18:11:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	or rather not?
2010-04-16T18:11:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	i wouldn't :-)
2010-04-16T18:13:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	i think i did but i didnt change anything
2010-04-16T18:13:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	my guess is that one of the registry files is owned by root. might be worth a look, anyway.
2010-04-16T18:14:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	somehow i dont get where the config is coming from - i allready deleted the whole panel directories of the .gconf dir but nothing changed. should i try restarting gconfd?
2010-04-16T18:14:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	did you touch .gconfd as well?
2010-04-16T18:14:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	no
2010-04-16T18:16:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	what is saved state in .gconfd? is itz also config info?
2010-04-16T18:17:00.000Z	sipior	seidl	i don't know exactly what gconfd sticks in that directory. i've tried to learn as little as possible about gconf :-)
2010-04-16T18:18:00.000Z	seidl	sipior	ok :)
