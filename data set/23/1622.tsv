2011-01-16T15:34:00.000Z	nfrs		I've got a mystery here. "ssh user@localip" works fine. however, "scp user@localip:/path ." apparently interprets localip as a domain name!
2011-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	you didnt mention the file to be copied
2011-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	it shoud be like scp file_name ser@localip:/path
2011-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	it shoud be like scp file_name user@localip:/path
2011-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	nfrs		ubuntulog: no, the command I gave was fine as I wrote it (assuming /path leads to a file, which it does)
2011-01-16T15:36:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	^
2011-01-16T15:36:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	 ;)
2011-01-16T15:38:00.000Z	ubuntusage		bc81:adobe-flashplugin ofcourse I guess
2011-01-16T15:40:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	debug1: Connecting to LOCAL_IP [67.215.65.132] port 22.
2011-01-16T15:40:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	67.215.65.132 is an OpenDNS ip, which is what I use for dns
2011-01-16T15:41:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	which makes me think that scp tried to resolve LOCAL_IP at opendns, and opendns returned its generic error ip address in response
2011-01-16T15:43:00.000Z	ubuntusage		nfrs:I see, you checked for host entries too?
2011-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	nfrs		ubuntulog: /etc/hosts has nothing with that
2011-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	nfrs		(with LOCAL_IP)
2011-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	^
2011-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	also, ping LOCAL_IP works fine, too
2011-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	local IP is your machine IP itself or some other IP in your LAN?
2011-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	nfrs		ubuntulog: the latter
2011-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	nfrs		ubuntulog: 10.0.0.XYZ
2011-01-16T15:47:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	^
2011-01-16T15:48:00.000Z	nfrs	ubuntusage	you really should change your nick name :)
2011-01-16T15:48:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	haha maybe ;)
2011-01-16T15:49:00.000Z	ubuntusage	nfrs	wats with log and sage? couldnt  find any similarity ;)
