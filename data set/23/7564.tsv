2005-06-28T05:26:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		sudo is great for console work ect
2005-06-28T05:26:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		but if i need to delete a folder created by root
2005-06-28T05:26:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		and i want to use the graphical interface .. nautilus
2005-06-28T05:26:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		how do i get permission ?
2005-06-28T05:26:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		my user dont have permission without sudo, and i cant type sudo in the grpahical
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Swoop|Around	do NOT use nautilus as root!
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Swoop|Around	Seveas	i wasnt
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Swoop|Around	well, you want to
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		i was merely in that situation before and i crippled my install
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas		but you shouldn't
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		i need to delete a faulty placed usr directory
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		but by accident in the console i delete the /usr dir
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		and thus .. machine didnt work all that well :(
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Swoop|Around	hehe, can imagine :)
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas		I had that once with /var/lib
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		so i was wondering isnt it possible to temp gain root access to stuff like that
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Swoop|Around		get it to ask for root pw or something when performing tasks
2005-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Swoop|Around	that's what sudo is for :)
