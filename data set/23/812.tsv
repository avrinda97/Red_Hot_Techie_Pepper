2011-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	A_J		what did i do wrong ?
2011-05-30T11:15:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	read the readme.. u may need to use autoconf
2011-05-30T11:36:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	you get CRC errors on any hd device to that usb prot?
2011-05-30T11:36:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	really?
2011-05-30T11:37:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	does 'dmesg' say anything about resets/
2011-05-30T11:37:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	sure.. (don't feed the troll)
2011-05-30T11:39:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	don't paste things in here
2011-05-30T11:43:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	try opening the machine and see if there are any loose cards
2011-05-30T11:45:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	you're getting an OOPS.. kernel dump.. there's a module choking somewhere
2011-05-30T11:45:00.000Z	A_J	yagoo	how do i fix it ?
2011-05-30T11:46:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	maybe it's an irq-sharing conflict. Try allocating resources manually if its the reason
2011-05-30T11:46:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	like in bios has Pnp/irq-sharing options
2011-05-30T11:47:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	or look at any dipswitches on recent new hardware insatlled
2011-05-30T11:48:00.000Z	A_J	yagoo	 can I access my hdd from a live cd ?
2011-05-30T11:48:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	notice this-> "hda-intel: IRQ timing workaround is activated for card #1. Suggest a bigger bdl_pos_adj."
2011-05-30T11:51:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	ask in #kernel.. what u can do with bdl_pos_adj.. this is another interest
2011-05-30T11:51:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	ignore the troll..
2011-05-30T11:52:00.000Z	A_J	yagoo	it's a hardware issue /
2011-05-30T11:52:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	your output mentions this IRQ timing workaround..
2011-05-30T11:53:00.000Z	yagoo	A_J	i suggest to look into this bdl_pos_adj parameter.. i believe u can pass other options or specify a higher count value for it
