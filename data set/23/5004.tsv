2007-03-16T14:52:00.000Z	eck	Dusk_	grub has your hard drives swapped so it is looking for the right partition on the wrong drive
2007-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	can you look at my grub menu list?? http://rafb.net/p/lTfTNb44.html

2007-03-16T14:56:00.000Z	eck	Dusk_	read the part about drive mapping here http://www.novell.com/documentation/suse91/suselinux-adminguide/html/ch07s04.html
2007-03-16T14:57:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	ok let me have a look
2007-03-16T15:02:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	i read the 7.4.2. The File device.map section...do i need do change device.map file index?
2007-03-16T15:02:00.000Z	eck	Dusk_	if it is not correct
2007-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	eck	Dusk_	check your actual hard drives against the device.map file
2007-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	they're true but if i change lines does that mean something??
2007-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	i have 2 hdds it's tru
2007-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	eck	Dusk_	try switching the drives in that file and reinstalling grub
2007-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	thanks
2007-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	Dusk_	eck	 let me try
