2007-04-30T16:39:00.000Z	AaronMT		Hi, does anyone else have issues with the Alsa HDA ATI SB (Alsa Mixer) being very quiet when volume is 100%?
2007-04-30T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	kill $(lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/mixer* /dev/snd/*) && sudo modprobe -r snd_hda_intel && sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel model=auto
2007-04-30T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	we've already fixed it upstream in hg.
2007-04-30T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	please don't query me.
2007-04-30T16:41:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	depends if it resolves your issue.  That test is temporary (works until next modprobe -r).
2007-04-30T16:47:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	did you execute the precise command I gave you (copy & paste)?
2007-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	then log out of gnome, log into a console (ctrl+alt+F1), then execute the command.
2007-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	please read http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the script linked from that page.
2007-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	AaronMT	crimsun	The url? http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/scripts/output.txt
2007-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	no.  Download the alsa-info.sh script, execute it with ``bash ./alsa-info.sh'', then tell me the url that the script generated.
2007-04-30T05:08:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	I'm waiting on my git tree.  I'm connected via a 56kbps dialup; it take a minute.
2007-04-30T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	are you passing model=ref ?
2007-04-30T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	hmm.  Ok, use model=ref instead and see if that resolves it.
2007-04-30T05:12:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	which Dell is it?
2007-04-30T05:12:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	anything more specific, like a model/revision # ?
2007-04-30T05:13:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	I'm well aware.  :)
2007-04-30T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	ok, quiet refers to speakers or headphones?
2007-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	ok, and you have a 9200, correct?
2007-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	we could probably special-case that codec revision
2007-04-30T06:29:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	not the model of your laptop.  The model of your Sigmatel HDA codec.
2007-07-19T05:04:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	we disable it, because we handle updates separately.
2007-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	AaronMT	crimsun	what is the proper method?
2007-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	AaronMT	wait for it to appear in $release-security
