2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	xrr		Hey. I need some help guys. I am trying to install ipwraw-ng, by using "make". But I get the error when trying to make: "Error 1, and also Error 2". I have got the same problem trying to install or make other programs..
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	did you run configure yet?
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	xrr	gmcastil	I guess not..
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	have you ever built anything from source before?
2008-02-04T02:46:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	there will typically be a couple files in the top of the source tree: INSTALL and README
2008-02-04T02:46:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	they usually explain the build process, but, in general, it's usually something like:
2008-02-04T02:47:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && make install ...dont't blindly run those commands, though
2008-02-04T02:48:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	since ubuntu uses a package manager, though, you want to avoid mixing and matching prgs built from source with deb packages
2008-02-04T02:48:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	i would probably install it in your home directory or in /usr/local if you must
2008-02-04T02:48:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	that said, you'll want to make sure that you get everything configured correctly (man pages in /usr/local/share, etc)
2008-02-04T02:49:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	its totally fine to build and install in /usr/local, but you don't want to install it in /usr or partially in /usr or /usr/local
2008-02-04T02:49:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	i would advise you to install it in $HOME
2008-02-04T02:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	that way if you want to remove it, you can just manually delete it
2008-02-04T02:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html is a good place to start with learning how linux software _ought_ to work
2008-02-04T02:55:00.000Z	xrr	gmcastil	When trying to use config, i get this error: No 'cfg' found in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipwraw.
2008-02-04T02:56:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	what command did you try to run?
2008-02-04T02:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	you didn't read the README or INSTALL files, did you
2008-02-04T02:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	config deals with openssl library configuration - configure is a script in the top of the source tree
2008-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	./configure --help
2008-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	that will show you all the configuration options that are available to you
2008-02-04T02:59:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	what directory are you in?
2008-02-04T02:59:00.000Z	gmcastil	xrr	you'll need to untar the source tarball, then cd into the top of the source tree, then run the configure script
2008-02-04T03:02:00.000Z	xrr	gmcastil	I am in the directory where i untar'ed the files. Where the INSTALL and README files are
