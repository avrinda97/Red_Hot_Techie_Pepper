2005-10-09T08:13:00.000Z	bpf		any of you using breezy with an IBM thinkpad? I just scored a new x40 from work yesterday and need to get the wireless and the sleep/suspend to work
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	bpf		everything else has been awesome so far
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	I'm using an X40-2527 just fine.
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	did you have to do anything special to get those 2 things to work?
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	I did, yes, but you shouldn't have to.
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	why is that?
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	because I've been testing Breezy on this for a long time.
2005-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	since you will dist-upgrade to Breezy (or install it fresh, then update) today, you won't have the issues I had
2005-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	i did a dist-upgrade yesterday after installing and enabling the universe repos
2005-10-09T08:16:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	you really need to be updating every hour or so
2005-10-09T08:17:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	and just waiting for it to work?
2005-10-09T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	it works as of right now.
2005-10-09T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	again, you'll have missed all the bloody hacking to get it working :)
2005-10-09T08:18:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	ah, I did not realize it was working now. things must have changed since yesterday evening
2005-10-09T08:18:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	glad I missed all the bloody hacking :) but appreciate all of you early adopters (i try when i have the time, it's always fun)
2005-10-09T08:19:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	does the wireless work with WEP keys?
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	out of the box, yes
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	it also works through wpasupplicant and xsupplicant
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	thank you for your help and patience with my n00b questions :)
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	as well as WPA, WPA2, and 802.11x
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	bpf	crimsun	do you know how well breezy is working with amd64?
2005-10-09T08:21:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	I can't comment on the desktop amd64 experience, since I only use amd64s as pbuilders.
2005-11-02T08:40:00.000Z	crimsun	bpf	hotplug+udev are intelligent enough, usually. lspci -v|more
