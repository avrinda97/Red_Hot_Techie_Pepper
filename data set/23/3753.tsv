2008-02-05T19:47:00.000Z	peleg		Buddies, I have a problem to access the internet in the last 6 hours now. I have tried to solve it a few times with a few people who helped me, but all had to leave in the middle of it. All I need is someone to guide me for a few minutes through interfaces file, iwconfig, or something similar
2008-02-05T19:48:00.000Z	peleg		could anyone help me with that, please?

2008-02-05T19:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	peleg	What was the hardwareagain?  Did you look in the supported hardware page for info on it? HAve you tried fwcutter or ndiswrapper?

2008-02-07T03:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	peleg	Not just the brand of card, but the chipset in the card..  sometimes the same card model will have different chipset

2008-02-07T03:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	peleg	I am not a wireless type person, but start with a google on the card to try and get all the info you can then ask again in channel
