2008-11-09T19:13:00.000Z	Myrstidal		Sorry to ask again, but I need some help with Debian Packaging this BIN please, help would be greatly appreciated
2008-11-09T19:14:00.000Z	Myrstidal		It just says a file doesn't exist
2008-11-09T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	what bin?
2008-11-09T19:15:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	I'm just trying to install Java in Ubuntu, and I hit a snag
2008-11-09T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	java is in the repositories
2008-11-09T19:16:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	I'm using a tutorialat http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180131, and I'm up to a part where I need to Debian Package a BIN file
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	no, use the repositories
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	what java do you want to install?
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	So I opened up the terminal and used "fakeroot make-jpkg root/jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin", but it says that the BIN doesn't exist
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	why are you not listening?
2008-11-09T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	did you find the java you wanted in the repositories?
2008-11-09T19:22:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	Sorry about that, let me rephrase that, I'm installing the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update 10 BIN
2008-11-09T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	ok.  Throw the bin in the trash.  Java is in the repositories.  Just install the sun-java6-jre package
2008-11-09T19:27:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	Thanks a lot!  You've been a great help.
2008-11-09T19:31:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	no problem!
2008-11-09T19:33:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	Uh oh, this is a really newbish question, (I just started Ubuntu) but I got this "Package Configuration" window in my terminal
2008-11-09T19:34:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	What shall I do now?  Or what can I do?
2008-11-09T19:34:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	can you give more details or pastebin what it is asking?
2008-11-09T19:35:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	It's just "Configuring sun-java6-jre" and gives me a lot of legal jargon
2008-11-09T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	right, just accept (assuming you agree to sun's license)
2008-11-09T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	hit enter, or maybe tab then enter
2008-11-09T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	Myrstidal	or space bar.  A combination of those :)
2008-11-09T19:37:00.000Z	Myrstidal	jrib	Wow, worked like a charm!  I hope it'll be smooth sailing from now on.
