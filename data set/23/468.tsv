2011-08-21T03:10:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		how would i fix the bootloader after (unfortunately) installing vista on a partition?
2011-08-21T03:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	grub2?
2011-08-21T03:11:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	yes. would the ubuntu cd be able to just restore the bootloader without actually writing to a new partition?
2011-08-21T03:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	yes which cd and install do you have?
2011-08-21T03:12:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	well, right now i have 4.10, but i'll probably just burn a more recent one ;)
2011-08-21T03:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	how did you install the linux and what is it=release?
2011-08-23T23:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	freebsd is multi disks
2011-08-23T23:38:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	one dvd though
2011-08-23T23:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	you might turn off the md5 in plugins
2011-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	isn't there a boot disc besides a dvd.
2011-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	i don't mind that it checksums, but why two different burning cycles?
2011-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	... what... fml
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	the freebsd site says "The FreeBSD CDROM and DVD images are bootable and can be used to install FreeBSD without any other special preparation." Wouldn't this imply that the main dvd is bootable?
2011-08-23T23:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	yes you are correct the dvd can do it all, as far as the install, check the md5 of that ISO.
2011-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	the ways i found online of checking the md5 of a disk have never returned the same md5 as the iso i burned, but the md5s they return is consistent across different disks. any suggestions on how to check the disk?
2011-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	when I actually check I use this link. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2011-08-23T23:49:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	uh... i can't even read the dvd from ubuntu at this point... i put it back in the drive (brasero ejected it) and now it's doing cyclical 5 second spin ups and then stopping
2011-08-23T23:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	I have seen that happen, I use a couple of apps in this area, generally another works.
2011-08-23T23:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	WHAT_UP	also note that a burned ISO has to be checked differently then the ISO
2011-08-23T23:52:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	yep. i noticed that
2011-08-23T23:52:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	the way i was doing it before was copying the disk to /tmp/something.iso and then md5ing the iso
2011-08-23T23:52:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	but now i'll try "dd if=/dev/dvdrw bs=1 count=810356736 | md5sum" if it ever lets me
2011-08-23T23:54:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	urlin2u	restarting for a sec
