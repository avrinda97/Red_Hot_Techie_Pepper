2008-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	what type of video card do you have? I have a Radeon 7500 (32mb) and general graphics performance is very poor. I installed the open source ATI driver but it seems to have made very little difference?
2008-10-02T14:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	I am using a T42 and Firefox 3, and this combination is not slow. You might consider 'Links 2'.
2008-10-02T14:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc. RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10].
2008-10-02T14:16:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	Windows XP runs about 200% better on this laptop than Ubuntu does... I am worried
2008-10-02T14:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	So your configuration is at fault. What does hdparm -tT say?
2008-10-02T14:18:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	it's a completely stock standard install of Hardy plus the open source ATI drivers.  Timing cached reads:   418 MB in  2.00 seconds = 208.58 MB/sec,  Timing buffered disk reads:   94 MB in  3.20 seconds =  29.34 MB/sec
2008-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	I have a new hard disk. My 1st value is 50% higher, my 2nd 50% lower than yours. I think these are no  unusual values. The misconfiguration is somewhere else.
2008-10-02T14:25:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	you got any idea where? I feel it's a graphics problem... but it works OK in windoze? :(
2008-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	What does glxgears say?
2008-10-02T14:37:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	2178 frames in 5.0 seconds = 435.513 FPS, 2295 frames in 5.0 seconds = 458.162 FPS, 2274 frames in 5.0 seconds = 454.776 FPS, 2227 frames in 5.0 seconds = 444.832 FPS
2008-10-02T14:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	And how much RAM size?
2008-10-02T14:37:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	system has 512mb ram and vid card has 32mb
2008-10-02T14:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	Your glxgears values are poor. I have here 1934 FPS. 1 MB RAM.
2008-10-02T14:39:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	yah... for some reason yesterday when I tried it I was getting close to 2000FPS but not now
2008-10-02T14:40:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	how can I confirm which video driver is being loaded at boot?
2008-10-02T14:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	I do not know why, but suddenly my glxgears jumped to 5700 FPS.
2008-10-02T14:41:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	yeah mine did that yesterday, the first 3 or 4 lines were ~500 FPS and then after that I was jumping to 2000FPS
2008-10-02T14:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	Please analyze (grep) Xorg.0.log for "ATI". ATI is a wrapper which loads probably radeon_drv.so.

2008-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	Please analyze (grep) Xorg.0.log for "driver". Sorry for the inconvenience.
2008-10-02T15:12:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	did you have a chance to see my pastebin?
2008-10-02T15:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	BonezAU	I had a look at http://pastebin.com/m7dfae676. Do you mean that?
2008-10-02T15:51:00.000Z	BonezAU	bullgard4	yes
