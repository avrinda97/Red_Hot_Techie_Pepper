2006-11-28T10:53:00.000Z	Nerd42		um, i'm worried about something that happened during my installing ubuntu
2006-11-28T10:53:00.000Z	Nerd42		it said a file was corrupt and it couldn't download a package
2006-11-28T10:53:00.000Z	Nerd42		i tole it "continue" and its still installing but um ... was that bad ??
2006-11-28T10:54:00.000Z	Nerd42		um ... i dont kno ... should be the latest PPC ubuntu
2006-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nerd42	Do you remember anything more about the error? ( a package is like an intaller for a specific part of ubuntu )
2006-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		ah
2006-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		wish i did
2006-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		i'm such a noob - should have written it down
2006-11-28T10:57:00.000Z	Nerd42		If ubuntu comes up like it's supposed to - is there an easy way to get it to check itself and download any files it might be missing ??
2006-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	Nerd42	r00t_	what i've noticed thus far is that ubuntu falls far short of its goal
2006-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	Nerd42		or else it has the wrong goal
2006-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	Nerd42		The goal ought to be to make a "Free Software" OS that does everything that Windows does and is just as easy to understand and use as Windows is.
2006-11-28T10:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nerd42	Yeah, but it gets better every version, and for the record I find Ubuntu MUCH easier than windows
2006-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	Nerd42		oh crap
2006-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nerd42	See also http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
2006-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	Nerd42		it says "Warning: failure while configuring base packages. This will be attempted 5 times"
2006-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	Nerd42		yeah windows has bugs
2006-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	Nerd42		windows *is* a bug
2006-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	Nerd42		ubutntu apparently sees my computer as "unclean"
2006-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	Nerd42		whoah dude, this is getting Biblical
2006-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	Nerd42		heh, i've never even heard of that
2006-11-28T11:05:00.000Z	Nerd42		o rly? LOL
2006-11-28T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nerd42	Close, it detected that your CD was "unclean" hence the corrupt package :)
