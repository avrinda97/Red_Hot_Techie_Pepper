2011-10-16T23:31:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	you can try restarting your computer. I'll still be here, I suppose.
2011-10-16T23:32:00.000Z	de2	purpleyuan	okey i will try that brb i will tell you how it went
2011-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	did it work?
2011-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	de2		yes
2011-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	de2		its worked tyvm
2011-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	no prob. I had the same issue. :)
2011-10-16T23:36:00.000Z	de2	purpleyuan	ok :) do you know if there is anyway to change to the normal ubuntu start menu instead of this 3D
2011-10-16T23:37:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	Do you mean change it back go gnome-shell?
2011-10-16T23:38:00.000Z	de2	purpleyuan	i mean so i can change it to the menu with utility office system buttons
2011-10-16T23:39:00.000Z	purpleyuan		Ahhh. Um. de2: You can try installing gnome-shell
2011-10-16T23:40:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	then try gnome-session-fallback to get it back to the way it was before 11.10
2011-10-16T23:40:00.000Z	de2		purokeyuan okey tyvm
2011-10-16T23:40:00.000Z	purpleyuan	de2	but it's not exactly the same, btw. If you want it more similar to how it was before I suggest sticking with Gnome3
2011-10-16T23:41:00.000Z	de2	purpleyuan	tyvm for you help it rly helped me :)
