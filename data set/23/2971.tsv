2008-09-12T09:21:00.000Z	brolly81		i just did a system update and my volume thing, thing still is not working
2008-09-12T09:21:00.000Z	brolly81		anyone have any info on the volume thing thing on the panel
2008-09-12T09:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	Could you be a little more specific, please?
2008-09-18T02:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	alsamixer from the terminal doesn't work??
2008-09-18T02:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	g++ on its own is just used from the terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal). Example g++ <source_filename> will compile single source files.
2008-09-18T02:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	bah, sorry
2008-09-18T02:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	If you please, we need to know if you've gone into the terminal and tried alsamixer.
2008-09-18T02:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	Applications->Accessories->Terminal. Type alsamixer. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, and adjust the level bars up and down.
2008-09-18T02:29:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	i did and nothing adjusts
2008-09-18T02:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	What does it say for card and chip?
2008-09-18T02:30:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	analog f does adjust volume
2008-09-18T02:32:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	card:  CA0106 ///// chip is blank
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	that's what I figured
2008-09-18T05:51:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	Truth be told, given the value of card in Alsamixer, I'd almost suggest buying a separate card, perhaps one that's more of a mainstream brand.
2008-09-18T05:54:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	 i just installed ubuntu a week ago and reinstalled it. when i came on to this chat room someone gave me the solution in matter of mins. i just dont rememeber all the steps the dude gave me
2008-09-18T05:55:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	its not the soundcard its a soundblaster which apparently ubuntu supports
2008-09-18T05:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	That IS a soundcard in my vocabulary. So, it's a soundblaster, what model?
2008-09-18T05:59:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	soundblaster xtreme fidelity
2008-09-18T06:02:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	its not the soundcard, at least i dont think it is, its more of the program and the settings of the volume panel. what i need to configure to make it work so it can adjust volume
2008-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	true enough
2008-09-18T06:05:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	Are you on a 32 or 64-bit system?
2008-09-18T06:05:00.000Z	brolly81	bobertdos	64, i think
2008-09-18T06:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	brolly81	There is a blog post that says there are alsa compatible drivers for your line on 64-bit........
