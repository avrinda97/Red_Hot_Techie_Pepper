2008-01-10T20:11:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	same shell?
2008-01-10T20:12:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	bash yes I tried using aptitude also and get the same error
2008-01-10T20:13:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	I meant same instance, sorry.  But check what 'echo $http_proxy' returns
2008-01-10T20:14:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	It returns nothing!
2008-01-10T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	pastebin the full output when you 'sudo apt-get updaet'
2008-01-10T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	pastebin the full output when you 'sudo apt-get update'
2008-01-10T20:25:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	APT dosn't want to time out now, it just hands there with Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com message ??
2008-01-10T20:27:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	not really sure what's going on.  Sometimes you can comment everything in your sources.list, apt-get update, then uncomment, and update again.  Since I'm out of ideas, you can try that
2008-01-10T20:29:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	thanks, but is there a specific port used for the package manager ?
2008-01-10T20:29:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	maybe its blocked? or is it standard port 80?
2008-01-10T20:33:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	Hmm here is something interesting, I try to connect to www.google.ca from w3m text browser since I dont have gui installed yet, and it hangs also with message Opening socket...
2008-01-10T20:34:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	thats also port 80 ?
2008-01-10T20:34:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	should be
2008-01-10T20:40:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	OK I have made another discovery It seems that internal sites to my company load but external ones like google hang and since REPO is external it also hangs so its some firewall issue
2008-10-12T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	apt-cache policy gvfs.  What version do you have installed?
2008-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	GVFS 0.2.5
2008-10-12T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	smb:/// work?  There's bug 185756 but it's fix-released and network:/// works for me
2008-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	no protocol works even ftp I am using Xubuntu with nautilus
2008-10-12T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	hmm.  Can you load gnome to troubleshoot?
2008-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	dtolj	jrib	no that sound like an overkill i would have to instal gnome to fix nautilus
2009-02-25T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	bchunk
2010-01-06T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	dtolj	the package doesn't exist according to packages.ubuntu.com
