2008-01-05T09:34:00.000Z	ballin		wasn't important enough for pm.
2008-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	ballin		while i'm in here, there's no gui to partition my hard drive in ubuntu (or windows for that matter), correct?
2008-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	tried gparted yet?
2008-01-05T09:37:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	yeah. There's an equiv for KDE folks...forgot the name though
2008-01-05T09:38:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	qtparted is the KDE equiv of gparted
2008-01-05T09:41:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	an alternative desktop environment. Ubuntu comes with the GNOME desktop. want KDE? > sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kde-desktop qtparted. But if u want just a GUI partition proggie, gparted will suffice i.e. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-01-05T09:42:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	nah. a ton of others here r not me
2008-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	ok. U r a cool dude but try to stay relevant. Peace. ;)
2008-01-05T09:46:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	Once installed, KDE will become an option when u login i.e. via the login manager GDM by default unless u have chosen to install kdm and supplant gdm as the deafult login manager instead
2008-01-05T09:47:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	that will suffice.
2008-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	no need to restart/reboot
2008-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	just type sudo gparted
2008-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	np ;)
2008-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	rajasun	ballin	fm? ffmpeg u mean
