2009-01-02T01:42:00.000Z	derekmounce		I know this isn't even remote the right place for this... but... anyone know if there's any way to `svn export` but only the changed files?
2009-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	svn up
2009-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	er, export as in
2009-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	commit your changes to the server or update your sandbox from the server?
2009-01-02T01:44:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	I'm in a slightly odd situation, using mosso for hosting, so I have SSH access.  Right now, I'm using lftp to mirror the contents of an svn export from my dev server
2009-01-02T01:44:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	oh... as in an actual export
2009-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	i think you should forget about lftp and get rsync. or maybe even sshfs or nfs
2009-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	rsync doesn't support ftp, does it?
2009-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	nope
2009-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	but ftp isn't really the solution for keeping things synced like you want
2009-01-02T01:46:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	Unfortunately then, I'm stuck...  Mosso doesn't have anything but ftp right now.
2009-01-02T01:46:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	if you have ssh, you most likely have sftp too. you can still use sshfs
2009-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	That's what I mean, I don't have ssh at all.  I have only plain old ftp.
2009-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	huh?
2009-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	 2:44:28 derekmounce> raylu: I'm in a slightly odd situation, using mosso for hosting, so I have SSH access.
2009-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	whooooooops.  typo. ;) "don't" have ssh
2009-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	oh.
2009-01-02T01:48:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	why do you have it set up this way anyway? can't you just use mosso as the svn server?
2009-01-02T01:48:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	mosso doesn't currently have subversion support, or root access
2009-01-02T01:49:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	oh. i suppose they don't have dav_svn installed either...
2009-01-02T01:49:00.000Z	raylu	derekmounce	in that case, why are you using svn?
2009-01-02T01:49:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	naw, not just yet
2009-01-02T01:50:00.000Z	derekmounce	raylu	Using svn because my codebase is 20k. ;)  Plus, I've been running the beta of my web app on a custom VPS.  But mosso scales like the amazon services, which is why I'm doing final hosting on them.
