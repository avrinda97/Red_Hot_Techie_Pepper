2011-09-03T23:22:00.000Z	eiriksvin		Can someone tell me why the Ubuntu installer would fail at resizing the partitions?
2011-09-03T23:24:00.000Z	eiriksvin		I used the Ubuntu installers GUI for selecting partition sizes and it showed the Windows Vista partition, but when I tried to install Ubuntu along side vista, it failed to resize the partition
2011-09-03T23:25:00.000Z	eiriksvin		ok, I'm going to bring up Gparted
2011-09-03T23:26:00.000Z	eiriksvin		I'm on the live USB right now
2011-09-03T23:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	if you resize vista far enough it will want a auto chkdsk probably be prepared for that.
2011-09-03T23:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	how mant=y windows partitons do you see?
2011-09-03T23:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	you can only have a maxium of 4 promary partitions.
2011-09-03T23:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	or 3 primaries and a extended, for logical partitions for ubuntu.
2011-09-03T23:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	are you counting the unallocated as a partition?
2011-09-03T23:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	cool make sure you put a exteneded in the unallocated, then logicals inside the extended.
2011-09-03T23:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	take a screen shot of gparted and imagbin it.
2011-09-03T23:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-09-03T23:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	I yink you probably need to run a chkdsk on that
2011-09-03T23:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	yeah chkdsk /f/r
2011-09-03T23:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	make sure your defragged as well, how much data is in sda3?
2011-09-03T23:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	not without gparted being able to read it, be careful here you could damage the vista without following a protocol.
2011-09-03T23:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	good idea. :D
2011-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	you don't know the desktops?
2011-10-07T06:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	so your question really is can you install kde is this correct if so yes.
2011-10-07T06:51:00.000Z	eiriksvin	urlin2u	yes, can I install KDE on 11.04?
2011-10-07T06:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	so when you start to mix desktops they can have overlapping apps, and the desktop can be difficult to remove that you have added if you don't like it, personally I would download a kubuntu version of natty and check it out first. With natty being tied to compiz I think you can just install kubuntu but not sure of the consequences overall.
2011-10-07T06:53:00.000Z	eiriksvin	urlin2u	well, thanks for that nice bit of info
2012-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	eiriksvin	in the bot link is the wiki for ones that work.
