2009-03-28T07:01:00.000Z	microman		hey guys.. I'm using  Ubuntu 8.04 - the Hardy Heron. I want to upgrade to latest version.
2009-03-28T07:01:00.000Z	microman		how to do that?
2009-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh	microman	I believe the command is "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade" or just use the update manager
2009-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		somebody correct me if Im wrong
2009-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	microman	Iceman_B^ssh	: tried
2009-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	microman		but nothing is happening.
2009-03-28T07:03:00.000Z	microman		$sudo apt-get update
2009-03-28T07:03:00.000Z	microman		$sudo apt-get dist upgrade
2009-03-28T07:03:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh	microman	I'm afraid that's all I know, i'm realtively new to linux as wel
2009-03-28T07:10:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		does anyone know the quickest way to add a new harddrive to Ibex?
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		it has 3 NTFS partitions which I want to keep for now, and I want to mount all of them in a certain dir
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		oh and I want to use quotas on it
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh	microman	the command should be "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" exactly like that
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		if you're still looking to upgrade
2009-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	microman		yeah.
2009-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	microman		I did the same, but no result.
2009-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh		what did happen ?
2009-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	microman		I followed the procedure mentioned here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
2009-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	microman		but still no result.

2009-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	Iceman_B^ssh	microman	afraid thats all I know, you could try downloading the image for Ibex and burning that to a cd, then boot from it and install/upgrade
