2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	yes
2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	is there a way to refer to this player's home directory?
2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	no, why?
2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	for a script of mine
2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	want to refer to a user as root
2005-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	but i want the original user to be the main user
2005-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	what are you trying to do?
2005-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	I'm trying to chown and chgrp a directory and its contents to theprimary use
2005-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	ok...
2005-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	in a script
2005-05-15T15:09:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	well, you can use getent to do that
2005-05-15T15:09:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	but are you sure you always want uid 1000 to own the file?  then you can just use "chown 1000:1000 /path/to/whatever/"
2005-05-15T15:10:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	oh, cool, thanks
2005-05-15T15:13:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	any efficient way to refer to user 1000's home directory?
2005-05-15T15:13:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	use getent.
2005-05-15T15:15:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	sorry to annoy you again, but is there a way to specify an item in a delimetted list?
2005-05-15T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	nate____2	use the "cut" tool
2005-05-15T15:24:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	I can narrow it down to the row
2005-05-15T15:24:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	with only the user id and home directory
2005-05-15T15:24:00.000Z	nate____2	bob2	how can i split it?
