2005-06-05T09:20:00.000Z	Gus_		i have this weird thing happening: when i want to launch Firefox through the shortcut on the panel, it seems to load, then stops, and nothing happens. when i run the command line in term, it launches perfectly... same for thunderbird btw... any idea ?
2005-06-05T09:22:00.000Z	Gus_		anyone ? =/
2005-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	not adviced to run browsers as root
2005-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	 i guess so, malicious code and stuff, but see my explanation above =)
2005-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	but you should correct it by other means :-p
2005-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	permission problems then?
2005-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	 i tried to change the permission but it wouldn't work, so i guess i didn't do it properly =)
2005-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	I'd guess so too :-p

2005-06-07T15:37:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	thanks, i'll check it out, but i think it doesn't deal with my card
2005-06-07T15:38:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	if that doesn't work, I think you are out of luck :-|
2005-06-07T15:39:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	but when i do what that guy says (replacing "ati" with "fglrx" and then restart X) it crashes, it says X is not able to restart
2005-06-07T15:40:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	wait a sec and I'll take a look
2005-06-07T15:42:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /var/log/Xorg.0.log on www.pastebin.com there could be some advices on the problem
2005-06-07T15:42:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	okay i will
2005-06-07T15:46:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	 i have pasted things there, name is Gus
2005-06-07T15:48:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	have you tried it without those two options that are now commented aout?
2005-06-07T15:49:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	ok
2005-06-07T15:51:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	and are you sure that log is from the time when X did not start?
2005-06-07T15:52:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	no. it is the logs i opened just now, and in the meanwhile i restarted once correctly (since i am able to talk to you right now =D)
2005-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Gus_	sorry, but I can't get a crasp on what's wrong :-\
2005-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Gus_	Fator_Dee	don't be sorry, thanks for trying to elp =)
