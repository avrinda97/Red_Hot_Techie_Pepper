2008-11-22T01:43:00.000Z	ratpoison		hello! ubuntu 8.10 amd64 user. Pulseaudio server seems to crash and I can't connect to it using teh manager app
2008-11-22T01:44:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 try killing its process then starting it from the console so that it gives you output - then you'll have something to diagnose it from
2008-11-22T01:45:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	I don't have a pulseaudio process right now
2008-11-22T01:46:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 ok - so just start it from the terminal to see what it says
2008-11-22T01:46:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	/etc/init.d/pulseaudio start   ?
2008-11-22T01:47:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 nah - use 'pulseaudio'
2008-11-22T01:47:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 gives you more output
2008-11-22T01:47:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	 W: ltdl-bind-now.c: Failed to find original dlopen loader.
2008-11-22T01:48:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	for more precise output, wait for pastebin
2008-11-22T01:48:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	 http://pastebin.com/m4235f185
2008-11-22T01:49:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	I'm also pasting my asoundconf list output
2008-11-22T01:49:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	http://pastebin.com/m608cd5e9
2008-11-22T01:49:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 OK - I think the problems most likely to be with it not finding the definitions
2008-11-22T01:50:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	"definitions" ?
2008-11-22T01:52:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 "Unable to find definition" <-- that problem - does pulseaudio proceed to stay running or does it die?
2008-11-22T01:52:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	it keeps running
2008-11-22T01:53:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 OK - so it does in the end find something that makes it work. When its running like that can you connect to it from the manager?
2008-11-22T01:54:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	to describe my problem more accurately: pulseaudio seems to start properly and then for some reason it crashes, never to be restored. I can't connect even after running pulseaudio from the terminal
2008-11-22T01:55:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	hmmmm that's a weird coincidence, updates only just showed up, and I have some concerning pulseaudio
2008-11-22T01:55:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	 I'll check if the updates fix teh prob
2008-11-22T01:55:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 try installing those and see if it helps - otherwise I suggest you ask the guys in #pulseaudio - they know the software like the back of their hand
2008-11-22T01:56:00.000Z	ratpoison	elliotjhug	 o.k. I didn't realise there was a channel for that...
2008-11-22T01:56:00.000Z	elliotjhug	ratpoison	 Well its always best to check with distro first - in case theres a bug thats already known
