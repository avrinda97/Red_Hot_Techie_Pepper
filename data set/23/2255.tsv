2009-05-13T03:56:00.000Z	Mirux		Anyone give me a hand with SVN server on ubuntu JJ?
2009-05-13T03:57:00.000Z	Mirux		Please.
2009-05-13T03:57:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	What's the problem?
2009-05-13T03:58:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	I am trying to use svn to backup my projects file. I have win xp virtualized with VirtualBox. I work there, and after I finish I want to do a commit and save the latest version on my ubuntu svn repository.
2009-05-13T04:00:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	You need samba to be continously mounted to your Windows disk
2009-05-13T04:00:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	can't i do this over lan?
2009-05-13T04:01:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	I have internet on win xp virtualized, so do I have network.
2009-05-13T04:01:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	Sure But you need WINS
2009-05-13T04:01:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	what do you mean? I don't get it, sorry.
2009-05-13T04:02:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	Which meansthe product package Samba
2009-05-13T04:02:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	sudo apt-et intsall samba
2009-05-13T04:02:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	I do have samba installed on my ubuntu system
2009-05-13T04:02:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	configured as well.
2009-05-13T04:03:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	Then you have to SHARE your dis.
2009-05-13T04:04:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	then I do not need to use svn?
2009-05-13T04:04:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	I thought svn would be a better way to keep track of my versions, and at the same time, backing up changes and stuff.
2009-05-13T04:04:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	I can do that like... share a folder and copy the whole project folder from win xp to ubuntu but..
2009-05-13T04:05:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	Just share the directory with the svn source
2009-05-13T04:05:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	i thought having a svn server on my ubuntu and comitting the changes via lan would be better.
2009-05-13T04:06:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	Set up the firewall so it is not accessible from the internet though
2009-05-13T04:13:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	when i try to commit it says the repository has uuid?
2009-05-13T04:14:00.000Z	younder	Mirux	You can't disable authentifification.
2009-05-13T04:16:00.000Z	Mirux	younder	thanks but i'll find another way to acomplish what I want.
