2009-04-19T21:30:00.000Z	s0101		or higher
2009-04-19T21:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	it might be checking the version string incorrectly
2009-04-19T21:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	which version of firefox are you using?
2009-04-19T21:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	what's the version shown in help > about mozilla firefox?
2009-04-19T21:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	that pastebin entry is empty
2009-04-19T21:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	apparently it is looking for firefox 2.0
2009-04-19T21:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	I was just able to access that site using 3.0.8
2009-04-19T21:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	does that only happen with a correct username and password?
2009-04-19T21:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	which version of firefox do you have on windows?
2009-04-19T21:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	I'm not sure if removing the version checks would be a good idea
2009-04-19T21:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	it depends on how the site is set up
2009-04-19T21:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	firefox doesn't use activex so the site itself likely doesn't use it.  If it does, then it would only be used for IE
2009-04-19T21:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	it depends on the way the site is set up
2009-04-19T21:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	s0101	usually, yes
