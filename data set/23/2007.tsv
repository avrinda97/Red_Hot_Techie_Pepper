2009-12-31T22:28:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	I believe those sounds should be under /usr/share/sounds
2009-12-31T22:33:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	In /usr/share/sounds/alsa/ I only find 8 test sounds but no event sounds.
2009-12-31T22:34:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	if you're using the default sound theme on karmic, it should be /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo
2009-12-31T22:38:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	Yes. --  But for example '~$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg' produces a terrible sound. What test program is better suited to play an .ogg file?
2009-12-31T22:38:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	I was just using audacious to play them, sounded like the correct files to me
2009-12-31T22:47:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	My Audacious does not play these files correctly. For example /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg. The sound is interrupted heavily.
2009-12-31T22:50:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	that's odd, most things on ubuntu should play ogg fine, the bell.ogg is only half a second long, which is why it may sound odd
2009-12-31T22:55:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	'~$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/phone-incoming-call.ogg; Playing raw data '/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/phone-incoming-call.ogg' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono' Produces a terrible noise which is not recognizable as an incoming call sound. What does ist mean that it is playing 'raw data'?
2010-02-15T22:52:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	I believe it stands for desktop experience (from a quick read of the blueprint)
2010-02-15T22:53:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	Ah! A good idea! Thank you.
2010-02-20T22:32:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	right click on the clock, properties, 24-hour format
2010-02-20T22:32:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	you can actually use any format you want if you edit the gconf clock preferences and set it to custom, with a custom string in the strftime format
2010-02-20T22:35:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	Wonderful! --  Thank you very much for your help.
2010-03-24T20:59:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	there is, your home directory, you should almost always build the code in your home directory
2010-03-24T21:00:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	Yes, I know. But today I need a certain package and be sure to find it again which I am not goind to compile.
2010-03-25T01:19:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	it is part of gnome screensaver (I'm pretty sure anyway)
2010-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	Hm.
2010-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	if you were looking to activate it from the command line, you can use: gnome-screensaver-command -l;
2010-03-25T01:42:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	In order to test I can only input this command in a virtual console. I obtain: "**Message: Failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon: /bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed."
2010-03-25T01:42:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	yes, it won't work unless the DISPLAY is set properly so it can find your dbus session bus
2010-03-25T01:45:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	so basically you need to execute it inside your gnome session (not from a virtual terminal) or set DISPLAY (and perhaps XAUTHORITY) correctly
2010-03-25T02:14:00.000Z	bullgard	trism	I agree. But I do not know if it then helps me anything because the aim was to determine the name of this particular dialog window.
2010-03-25T02:14:00.000Z	trism	bullgard	ahh, I misunderstood what you were looking for
