2006-09-29T07:06:00.000Z	t9k232		hello
2006-09-29T07:06:00.000Z	t9k232		I'm installing Ubuntu on a Windows virtual machine
2006-09-29T07:06:00.000Z	t9k232		on the virtual machine, there is a fat32 partition with Windows already installed
2006-09-29T07:07:00.000Z	t9k232		but, when I try to use the partitioning software included in the "install"
2006-09-29T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	sorry if i cut you off before you even start explaining, but why don't you just use a fresh virtual machine?
2006-09-29T07:07:00.000Z	t9k232	LjL	it's to try the GRUB
2006-09-29T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	ok
2006-09-29T07:08:00.000Z	t9k232		when trying to partition the hard disk
2006-09-29T07:08:00.000Z	t9k232		I have the following problem
2006-09-29T07:08:00.000Z	t9k232		I can't see Used and Unused space
2006-09-29T07:09:00.000Z	t9k232		so i can't resize the partition
2006-09-29T07:09:00.000Z	t9k232		(FAT32)
2006-09-29T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	is that VMWare?
2006-09-29T07:09:00.000Z	t9k232		yes, it is
2006-09-29T07:10:00.000Z	t9k232		Unable to read the content of this filesystem. because of this some operations may be unavailable.
2006-09-29T07:10:00.000Z	t9k232		etc etc
2006-09-29T07:10:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	bah... that feels like a problem with the way vmware simulates HDs to me, to be honest
2006-09-29T07:11:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	though i don't seem to find any relevant reference to the problem on google
2006-09-29T07:11:00.000Z	t9k232		maybe the problem is due to the snapshot I created
2006-09-29T07:11:00.000Z	t9k232		so there is a virtual hard disk part of a virtual hard disk
2006-09-29T07:12:00.000Z	t9k232		maybe gparted doesn't understand that correctly
2006-09-29T07:12:00.000Z	LjL	t9k232	uhm, you've lost me on that. i don't know what's that nexted HD thing in vmware
2006-09-29T07:13:00.000Z	t9k232	LjL	no problem ;) thanks very much for your support
