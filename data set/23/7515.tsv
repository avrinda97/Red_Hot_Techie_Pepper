2005-07-30T14:43:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	you can also install rar and unrar, then the file roller can open them up
2005-08-04T06:47:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	you are probably running vesa graphics drivers
2005-08-04T06:47:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	what kind of video card do you have?
2005-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	I don't know that exactly... how can i learn that?
2005-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	good question :) its hard to answer because you haveto know what you are looking for
2005-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	sounds like your video is onboard
2005-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	is it this? VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  65x/M650/740 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter
2005-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	for 3d games like quake or something
2005-08-04T06:54:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	I don't play games at all
2005-08-04T06:54:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	i don't either, sis drivers should be enough for both of us, i use sis chipsets a lot
2005-08-04T06:55:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	how many memory should the card use?
2005-08-04T06:57:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	how many memory should the video card use?
2005-08-04T06:57:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	just hit enter
2005-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	now it asks something about framebuffer
2005-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	if you don't know hit enter
2005-08-04T06:59:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	as long as you selected the sis driver in the beginning just accepting the defaults should be okay
2005-08-04T06:59:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	ok thanks for the help :)
2005-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	now should i restart?
2005-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	holycow	thespiritoftal	when you are done on comman line do: sudo /etc/init.d/gmd restart
2005-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	thespiritoftal	holycow	sudo: /etc/init.d/gmd: command not found
