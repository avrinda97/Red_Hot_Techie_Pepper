2006-09-23T06:47:00.000Z	MugginsM		Adobe doesn't even really have a *linux* version, never mind ppc
2006-09-23T06:47:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	umm Flash 7 is out for linux flash 9 should eb out next year or so
2006-09-23T06:47:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	not on my 64 bit machine
2006-09-23T06:47:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	flash doesn't work on x86_64
2006-09-23T06:47:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	a really old version, available for only one of the many Linux platforms, doesn't really count methinks
2006-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	umm Flash doesn't work on windows x64 either
2006-09-23T07:24:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	you don't have to though
2006-09-23T07:25:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	you don't have to do anything on the internet, but it is/was a standard
2006-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	it all depends on how you set it up :)
2006-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	well the problem with mail is you need to communicate with stuff that you don't set up yourself :)
2006-09-23T08:02:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	umm they use the same programs like I said it's ease of use
2006-09-23T08:03:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	Suse lets you configure networks of desktops a lot easier, Ubuntu doesn't fall into package hell as often, ease of use goes a long way :)
2006-09-23T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	it's available for all linux you have to use nswrapperplugin to work on x86_64 though
2006-09-23T08:39:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	not on PPC
2006-09-23T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	sure it is you never used emulation before
2006-09-23T08:40:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	point me to an emulator that runs on Ubuntu PPC that can emulate anything that runs flash
2006-09-23T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	umm install gnuash it not great but works
2006-09-23T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	flash 9 isn't out yet
2006-09-23T08:42:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	try gnuash it might run youtube videos now
2006-09-23T08:46:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	well it's probably not in the repos due to that it's not stable yet
2006-09-23T08:46:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	I'm fine with source code, but not if I can't find it :)
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	kitche	MugginsM	it's Gnash sorry :(
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	MugginsM	kitche	thanks, downloading :)
