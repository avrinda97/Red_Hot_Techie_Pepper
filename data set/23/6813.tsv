2007-09-13T13:19:00.000Z	tico		hi
2007-09-13T13:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	vmware is great
2007-09-13T13:23:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	what version of vmware? maybe vmware server or any other.... what do u tink i have ubuntu dapper
2007-09-13T13:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	what do you want to use it for?
2007-09-13T13:28:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	I want to open my wind. partition using a virtual machine in ubuntu
2007-09-13T13:28:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	i'm not sure if that's actually possible, windows is very fragile when it comes to changing hardware
2007-09-13T13:29:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	vmware is also considered a new machine as far as activation/registration/etc.. are concerned
2007-09-13T13:29:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	yes in fact i saw a post about some guy how install virtual machine and his wind. partiton just crash!
2007-09-13T13:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	duplicate your windows partition and try booting that
2007-09-13T13:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	or at least backup the partition
2007-09-13T13:33:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	if i just install vmware u think i will have problems with my win partition?
2007-09-13T13:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	probably
2007-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	i will double check it.....  thanks for your time!!!!!!
2007-09-20T13:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	are you using an atheros card?
2007-09-20T13:26:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	no i use the broadcom which comes with my hp notebook
2007-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	but it show to me all wireless with 100% signal and it is  not true..
2007-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	could be a bug in network-manager or the driver
2007-09-20T13:28:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	maybe .. thanks by the way
2007-09-20T13:29:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	if you do: iwlist eth1 scan (assuming eth1 is the interface) does it show the correct signal strength?
2007-09-20T13:31:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	i think so.. Quality:0/100  Signal level:-83 dBm  Noise level:-256 dBm
2007-09-20T13:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	tico	so probalby a network-manager bug
2007-09-20T13:33:00.000Z	tico	dystopianray	Thanks a lot, i think it's a bug in network manager because if i check wifi_radar it gave me the real signal power
