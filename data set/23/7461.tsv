2005-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	belhifet		anyone can tell me how to get ubuntu to connect to the internet?
2005-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	what connection are you on
2005-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	ok you ready?
2005-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	dailup isnt real easy in linux
2005-07-23T09:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	well what kind of modem do you have
2005-07-23T09:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	but you may not have drivers and such
2005-07-23T09:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	do you already have the drivers?
2005-07-23T09:43:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	well then this wont be too hard. it isnt a winmodem?
2005-07-23T09:43:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	ok you see there are two kind of modems
2005-07-23T09:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	software and hardware respectively
2005-07-23T09:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	the hardware ones usually work ootb with linux but the software ones only have the software for windows
2005-07-23T09:45:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	so if yours isnt an outside box then its safe to say it is software aka winmodem
2005-07-23T09:45:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	ok then all we should need to do is put in your isp info into the KDE network prog
2005-07-23T09:46:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	oh well you said it was easy with kde i assumed you were in kubuntu i appologize
2005-07-23T09:47:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	try system>network and see if there is anything that sounds like it would set up a connection
2005-07-23T09:48:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	ok at yuor pace =D
2005-07-23T09:54:00.000Z	belhifet	hybrid_goth	look i tried what you suggested yesterday and it brought a screen with the modem config etc, but now i started ubuntu and it says "could not look up internet address for . this might prevent ubuntu from functioning properly. add to etc/hosts/ " or smt like that
2005-07-23T09:55:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	is ubuntu installed?
2005-07-23T09:56:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	ok h/o just a second ill see if there is a command line command for all this
2005-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	wvdial is semi graphical
2005-07-23T10:00:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	man wvdial i think it will help you and it should show you all you need to do
2005-07-23T10:01:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	belhifet	hey i got to go for a few minutes try that wvdial it should do it
