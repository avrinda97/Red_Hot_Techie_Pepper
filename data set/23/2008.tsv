2012-08-26T07:24:00.000Z	lagreca		hi folks! nautilus won't show thumbnails, even though I've already installed thumbnailers. What can I do to fix it?
2012-08-26T07:26:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	delete ~/.thumbnails/fail/ (you often need to restart your session as well after installing thumbnailers)
2012-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	I tried it, but it didn't work.
2012-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	tried which, both?
2012-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	I tried it previously.
2012-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	deleting the fail folder and restarting
2012-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	which thumbnailer?
2012-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	lagreca		trim: and reinstalling the thumbnailers
2012-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	lagreca		trim: ffmpegthumbnailer and mplayerthumbnailer
2012-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	where did you install them from, maybe they aren't updated properly, the argument format changed slightly in 11.10 or 12.04
2012-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	check /usr/share/thumbnailers/
2012-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	i'll do it.
2012-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	I can see 4 text files each one for a different thumbnailer
2012-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	including totem.thumbnailer
2012-08-26T07:35:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	see if any of them use %u, I think it changed to %i
2012-08-26T07:39:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	hmm, maybe that doesn't really matter, which thumbnailers are in /usr/share/thumbnailers/ ? I seem to already have three by default, maybe you just need to write a .thumbnailer file for ffmpeg and mplayer
2012-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	yes, they use %u
2012-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	then I'll write a thumbnailer file for ffmpeg
2012-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	I notice totem still uses %u so that must be okay
2012-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	I changed my zip thumbnailer to %i for some reason, been a while since I messed with it
2012-08-26T07:41:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	I'll write a .thumbnailer for ffmpeg and see what happens
2012-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	lagreca	trism	thanks
2012-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	trism	lagreca	alright, good luck
