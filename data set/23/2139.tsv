2010-07-20T14:40:00.000Z	ankaboot		Hi! Is this the right place to ask about encountering an issue upgrading from karmic koala to lucid lynx? I'm using a laptop and use ubuntu along with windows 7 if that helps.
2010-07-20T14:41:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	yes, this is the right place, please ask directly, don't ask to ask
2010-07-20T14:53:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	i honestly recommend doing a CLEAN install
2010-07-20T14:54:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	separate your / and your /home/ and the next time, you won't have to save anything in an external drive, just make sure you don't format /home/
2010-07-20T14:55:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	I'm sorry what are these slashes?
2010-07-20T14:55:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	those slashes are the UNIX paths to files
2010-07-20T14:55:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	think of / as C:\ in Windows
2010-07-20T14:56:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	/home/ is similar to saying C:\Documents and Settings\
2010-07-20T14:56:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	oh
2010-07-20T14:56:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	but then where do i do that?
2010-07-20T14:57:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	at the installation, configure manually your disks, and set / and /home separately.
2010-07-20T14:57:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	/home/ needs the most space
2010-07-20T14:57:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	with let's say 50 GB in /, you'll be totally okay
2010-07-20T14:58:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	Oh... but actually I already have 30GB for ubuntu and i still have a lot left
2010-07-20T14:58:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	oh, well in that case, assign at least 5, or 10% of your HDD space to /
2010-07-20T14:58:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	/home/ is where you save EVERYTHING, related to your user
2010-07-20T14:58:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	/ is for sys config files, packages and system-wide themes
2010-07-20T14:59:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	so what I understand from you is that in any case, i better do a fresh install? am i right?
2010-07-20T14:59:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	yes, and with your separate /home, you will be able to do clean installs without losing data, apart from installed packages
2010-07-20T14:59:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	because your program settings, for your user are saved in /home/
2010-07-20T15:00:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	google for "separate home partition linux" for more
2010-07-20T15:00:00.000Z	ankaboot	Beyecixramd	I see. Well, thank you Beyecixramd
2010-07-20T15:00:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	ankaboot	you're welcome :)
