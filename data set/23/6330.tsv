2008-01-21T23:45:00.000Z	AristoMagnus		After setting up bind9 nsswitch.conf and openldap+samba for a directory server, Sometime, i can't login, the boot process stuck at bind9 startup... Did you ever see that problem with 7.10 server?
2008-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	AristoMagnus	bind9 has nothing to do with nsswitch.conf
2008-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	I know but when i bootup, if it stuck at bind, i cant login with root and it stuck
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	AristoMagnus	you can't login to ubuntu as root any way
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	But if bind start and the rest just start, i can login...
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	yes you can if you configure a password for root ;)
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	AristoMagnus	look at the syslog for bind start issues, the hang is probably it trying to contact it's masters/slave ?
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	anyway, that's not the point
2008-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	AristoMagnus	the point is if you doing things like configuring root passwords and dns servers you should know how to do basic debugging
2008-01-21T23:48:00.000Z	AristoMagnus		i know ;)
2008-01-21T23:48:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	anyway thanks for the cue
2008-01-21T23:57:00.000Z	AristoMagnus		Anyone knows why I got that error in dmesg: [   56.700897] Failure registering capabilities with primary security module.
2008-01-22T00:00:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	did you know why I got that error message?
2008-01-22T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	AristoMagnus	I didn't see your error, sorry

2008-01-22T00:01:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	error in dmesg: [   56.700897] Failure registering capabilities with primary security module.
2008-01-22T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia		aslan: thats nothing to with bind
2008-01-22T00:02:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	ok
2008-01-22T00:12:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	I don't think the bind hang because of a misconfiguration..
2008-01-22T00:14:00.000Z	AristoMagnus	ikonia	It is intermitent, but when bind hang on startup, samba and openldap doesnt start and that disable the login to work (nsswitch.conf is configure to be compat ldap)
