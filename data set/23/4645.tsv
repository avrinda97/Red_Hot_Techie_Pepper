2007-07-05T07:04:00.000Z	MSIGuy		So, I'm having a problem, I installed Azerus but everytime I start it, it closes just after it opens.
2007-07-05T07:04:00.000Z	MSIGuy		Really, what caused it?
2007-07-05T07:05:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	run it from the command line and see what errors you get
2007-07-05T07:06:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	how did you install it?
2007-07-05T07:06:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	Feisty?
2007-07-05T07:06:00.000Z	MSIGuy	mneptok	yeah.
2007-07-05T07:07:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	yeah, it seems the repo version is so out of date as to be laughable
2007-07-05T07:07:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	kTorrent :)
2007-07-05T07:08:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	sure. sudo apt-get install ktorrent
2007-07-05T07:08:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	doesn't matter
2007-07-05T07:09:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	kTorrent is a most excellent client, too
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	no
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	what torrent client?
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	does your router fully support UPnP?
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	you'll probably have to forward ports that kTorrent uses to the IP your machine has. 6881-6889 are usually the safest bet.
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	MSIGuy	mneptok	I'm double checking my port fowarding, I'll be back in a sec.
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	MSIGuy	mneptok	I've got the port opened on my router, but it says its blacklisted.
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	what says it's blacklisted?
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	that's not Ubuntu, i guarantee
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	MrElendig is right. it could be the ISP denying that port's traffic.
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	won't matter at all
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	for my money, NOTHING beats BitTornado from the command line.
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	mneptok	MSIGuy	i think you're on the right track with kTorrent, then.
