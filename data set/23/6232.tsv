2006-06-05T09:16:00.000Z	b0xen		Hey does anybody know if there is a VMware image of dapper drake around? I've been googling like crazy but I can't find one.
2006-06-05T09:16:00.000Z	b0xen		for VMware player i mean
2006-06-05T09:17:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 just run dapper.  you won't be sorry.  ;)
2006-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 hrm... how come?
2006-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 security blanket?
2006-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 need windows is pretty um...
2006-06-05T09:19:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 for what app?
2006-06-05T09:19:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 oh lord.  another person who fell into the drm trap.
2006-06-05T09:20:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 all the more reason to firebomb apple.
2006-06-05T09:20:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 don't say that.  just eat the pain and buy the cds or something.  mp3 stinks.
2006-06-05T09:21:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 yah awful quality.  go with flac
2006-06-05T09:22:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 um no.  crap quality.  not even close to cd.  not cheaper at all... most cd's these days are 9 bucks canadian and you get all the songs.
2006-06-05T09:22:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 move.  laf.
2006-06-05T09:23:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 well... if you go to www.apple.com i am pretty sure they have all the answers for your lovely problem.  it will probably involve a core duo (tm) (c) g6 and a apple enema though.
2006-06-05T09:23:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 you should be able to vmware any iso
2006-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 last time i checked.
2006-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 ick.
2006-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	umm...
2006-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	b0xen	troy_s	Ick? Yes. Ick, but free.
2006-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 itunes rocks apparently.  i don't know if there is a quick and dirty way to help you.
2006-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	but since you are into keeping those music files, i have some 8tracks for you if you want.  :)
2006-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	b0xen	troy_s	Arrogance only makes you look bad.
2006-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	troy_s	b0xen	 you should see my face, i already look bad.  it isn't arrogance.  just reality.  sometimes you can cut your losses.
