2009-04-29T14:10:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	It depends on the layout of your partition table. Do you have an extended partition with free space in it?
2009-04-29T14:12:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	I have 29 gigs of free space, but 4 active primary partition.  prim ntfs partition,  prim / parititon, prim swap partition, and prim /home.
2009-04-29T14:13:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	btw, thats the sda# they are infact in order. so ntfs to the /home is the numbered of the sda....
2009-04-29T14:13:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	OK, and what do you want to do? Erasing the swap partition won't really free you a partition, because logical partition need to be created in an 'extended partition', which takes up a primary.
2009-04-29T14:17:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	It is relatively simple to make swap reside in a file rather than a partition. Is that something you'll be interested in?
2009-04-29T14:18:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	It sounds liek it would fix my issue. I need to free up a primary partition. SO yea. joaopinto would the UUID be something like sda5 or whatever the numbe may be?
2009-04-29T14:19:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	joaopinto: I've never tested this exact case, but in my opinion, if you have more than two or three times free space in the partition where you're creating the swap file, the performance loss should be negligible.
2009-04-29T14:20:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	joaopinto: Again, this is entirely off the top of my head, but I'd say less than 10% performance hit on a heavily swapping use-case.
2009-04-29T14:26:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	Yes, what you're saying is correct, /but it won't save you a partition according to the layout you just now specified/.
2009-04-29T14:28:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	You got my last sentence?If you have four primary partitions, deleting one and creating a logical partition /will not free up a primary partition/.
2009-04-29T14:29:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	is this true? Can someone confirmed this? Even though I delete the prim swap partition and make a new logical swap partition. it WILL NOT free up a primary partition for an extra OS installation?
2009-04-29T14:30:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	Logical partitions MUST be created inside an "extended partition", which takes up the space of one primary partition.
2009-04-29T14:30:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	If you don't have an extended partition, and from what you wrote, you don't, then deleting a primary will leave you with two choices:
2009-04-29T14:31:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	1. Create an extended partition and create logical partitions within (the extended partition will take the room of a primary). 2. Create a primary partition.
2009-04-29T14:31:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	So you see, deleting just one primary won't help you.
2009-04-29T14:33:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	I told extended partition mainly just contain data. I am sure/was not told that they still require one primary slot? But if what you say is true. I can have many many logical partitions, but those many many logical partition will be stored in the extend3ed partition? which by default have to take up at least one primary patition?
2009-04-29T14:34:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	You can move all your non-boot partitions to be logical partitions inside a single extended partition.
2009-04-29T14:34:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	For some cases, you can move boot partitions to be logical, too.
2009-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	I have to leave now, so sorry I can't help further.
2009-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	I suspect it would be best for you to switch to a swap file, but it's up to you to decide.
2009-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	sugi	teolicy	thank you for your time.
2009-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	teolicy	sugi	Anytime. :)
