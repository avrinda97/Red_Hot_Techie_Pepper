2006-02-21T07:53:00.000Z	BigDaddy		I think I have had an epiphany today
2006-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	BigDaddy		Ubuntu hates me
2006-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	BigDaddy		So far, I have only got one thing to work that I wanted. and it doesn't work right
2006-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	BigDaddy		AP?
2006-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	BigDaddy		oh
2006-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	BigDaddy		The things that I want, nay-need is an internet connection that starts at boot. It will not do that no matter how many times I tell it to. Windows partitions. Why is it so dang hard to have a distro that just automatically does it without me having to? I can't even find them in Ubuntu
2006-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	BigDaddy		And video drivers. WTF! I can't even boot into GNOME after following the guide online
2006-02-21T07:58:00.000Z	BigDaddy		so back I come crawling into XP
2006-02-21T07:59:00.000Z	BigDaddy		I want to like Linux sooo bad. I thought Ubuntu would finally be the answer to it too after all I have heard about it
2006-02-21T08:00:00.000Z	BigDaddy		chris - right now I would be happy to even boot into GNOME
2006-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 networking should be pretty easy - unless wifi :] 
2006-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 that is your console :]   learn to respect it, if not love it
2006-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 ahh dialup
2006-02-21T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 for your pppoe i found a post in the forums that may fix it
2006-02-21T08:06:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  will redo the installer configuration utility for the x server ackage
2006-02-23T11:17:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 what sound server do you use?
2006-02-23T11:17:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 you might also want to make sure your sound card driver is running ok
2006-02-23T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 well, what driver are you using :] 
2006-02-23T11:19:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 hmm.  check /etc/modules ...  also lspci to see your sound card hardware
2006-02-23T11:29:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 did you find your sound card with lspci?
2006-02-23T11:31:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 show us lsmod also
2006-02-23T11:35:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 ok i dunno...   unmute stuff in alsamixer?  reboot?
2006-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	wastrel	BigDaddy	 i think your lspci database is a little g00fy
