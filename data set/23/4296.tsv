2007-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	tragedy	frostburn	now am not seeing the files on the drive,
2007-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	frostburn	tragedy	perhaps.  depends on what the error is.

2007-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	frostburn	tragedy	i'm assuming it's formatted for ntfs?  check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009
2007-09-27T12:16:00.000Z	tragedy	frostburn	if i change the file system to linux  will I lose all my data?

2007-09-27T12:17:00.000Z	tragedy	frostburn	is there any other way to fix the harddrive.. or to get the stuff off it first?
2007-09-27T12:18:00.000Z	frostburn	tragedy	the easiest way is to check it out with windows, and see if you can recover them that way
2007-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	tragedy	frostburn	can i install windows on the same hard drive ubuntu is running on?
2007-09-27T12:20:00.000Z	frostburn	tragedy	yes, but it's tricky installing windows after ubuntu
2007-09-27T12:22:00.000Z	tragedy	frostburn	am gonna try  thanks
