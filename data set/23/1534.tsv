2011-02-19T08:06:00.000Z	ershad		hello, May i know installing which gstreamer package would solve the rhythmbox seek-bar issue?
2011-02-19T08:08:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	what issue?
2011-02-19T08:09:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	the seek-bar in rhythymbox is disabled
2011-02-19T08:09:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	that'd be if the file type you were playing couldn't seek; what type of file is it?
2011-02-19T08:09:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	or a damaged vbr mp3 without xing tags
2011-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	mp3 files
2011-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	try checking the files with oidua, they might be damaged
2011-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	no, the these mp3 files having been playing smoothly in other distros.
2011-02-19T08:11:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	and the gstreamer i installed was -ffmpeg
2011-02-19T08:11:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	doesn't really matter ;] and oidua will answer yes or no definitively
2011-02-19T08:12:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	I'm sure the files are not damaged :)
2011-02-19T08:12:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	unless you check you aren't; but it's pointless to argue
2011-02-19T08:13:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	ok, I will check :)
2011-02-19T08:13:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	thanks, i wanna file a bug if it's a real bug and that's the first step
2011-02-19T08:17:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	checked, there are no issues with songs,
2011-02-19T08:18:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	can you post one of the lines of the output? they're vbr with xing tags?
2011-02-19T08:18:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	ok, please wait a minute
2011-02-19T08:21:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	could you give me the correct argument list?
2011-02-19T08:22:00.000Z	ohsix	ershad	oidua dir/ should work, the default format shows the info
2011-02-19T08:23:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	it's just listing the artist/album name
2011-02-19T08:24:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	and seek bar works well with ogg files
2011-02-19T08:25:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	I read it from web that correct plugin must be installed to get the seekbar working
2011-02-19T08:33:00.000Z	ershad	ohsix	it's ok, i will try to fix, thanks :)
