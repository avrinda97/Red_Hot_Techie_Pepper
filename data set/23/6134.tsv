2006-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles	cherwin	can you be any more insulting?
2006-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	cherwin	ninjaplimsoles	don't get me wrong but this isn't an insult, we can help you much faster if you ask questions the right way.
2006-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles	cherwin	what exactly was wrong with my question?
2006-06-12T07:04:00.000Z	cherwin	ninjaplimsoles	it's not only you, but if you just ask a question like anyone has experience with xgl/compiz the only answer you have to expect is yes or no
2006-06-12T07:05:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles		This was my qestion: ok, I follow the tutorial here -> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=131267 and when i reboot, it hangs at a black and white checkquered screen with the loading cursor, any ideas!!?
2006-06-12T07:05:00.000Z	cherwin		just like Sp4rkY, he just ask, help me with the installation of my webcam period
2006-06-12T07:05:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles		morning edney
2006-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	cherwin		then we have to ask, which cam, what did you tried, what errors did you get etc
2006-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles		I followed the tutorial, got no errors, it simply hangs at the loading screen
2006-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	cherwin	ninjaplimsoles	then you have to look at your dmesg in another console to see some errors
2006-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	cherwin		fsck
2006-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles	cherwin	your advice is ace, instead of directing me to 'how to ask the right questions' you should read about how to answer them
2006-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles		Dude you like look at some stuff with dmesg in another console to see some stuff like errors and stuff
2006-06-12T07:10:00.000Z	cherwin	ninjaplimsoles	what are you talking about, you appearantly didn't read the faq of xgl, didn't searched google well enough and you are posting at the wrong forum
2006-06-12T07:11:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles	cherwin	I've read the FAQ, I searched google and I went to ubuntu-xgl and someone directed me here! Checkmate...
2006-06-12T07:11:00.000Z	cherwin	ninjaplimsoles	then the dude that directed you here is wrong
2006-06-12T07:12:00.000Z	ninjaplimsoles	cherwin	ok, go to #ubuntu-xgl yourself and try a conversation. Nobody talks
