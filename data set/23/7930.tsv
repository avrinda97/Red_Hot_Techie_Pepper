2005-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	Absenth		I don't suppose anyone knows off the top of their head which commands I need to run to reconfigure the nvidia kernel module.
2005-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	Absenth		I just changed to the k7 specific kernel, and currently x won't boot with the "nvidia" driver.
2005-03-30T09:55:00.000Z	Absenth		it's failing on the kernel module.  I know on fedora I just re-ran the .run script, but I have no idea where apt puts such things.
2005-03-30T09:57:00.000Z	Absenth		Ells, I've got Crossover running.
2005-03-30T09:58:00.000Z	Absenth		hoary,
2005-03-30T09:58:00.000Z	Absenth		Ells, I'm also running Transgaming 4.3
2005-03-30T09:58:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	dont they call that cedega now?
2005-03-30T10:00:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	you may have to restart gnome to get apps populating your menu list
2005-03-30T10:12:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	you should sell all your belongings, and send the proceeds to my bank account so I can hire my legions of doom, and take over the world.
2005-03-30T10:12:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	my wife doesnt like that idea very much.
2005-03-30T10:13:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	My wife wouldn't like it if the tables were reversed, but she did laugh.
2005-03-30T10:13:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	maybe we should go in together, and be joint evil overlords?
2005-03-30T10:14:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	that has a nice ring to it, what are you two doing for brunch next tuesday? I'll have my evil horde call your evil horde.
2005-03-30T10:14:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	heh.
2005-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	Mmmm... as evil overlord I could lart them all...
2005-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	where roughly in the world are ya
2005-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	what type of tech's?
2005-03-30T10:18:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	I would guess mostly winders admin types, and desktop support types, but.....
2005-03-30T10:18:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	I was on vacation, so I didn't really ask too many questions.  I know tech types in Calgary make a lot more then those working for same company, in the same job title, in SaskatALFDAJDFLAOVIEHJAOLJKAWE (since I can't spell it anyway)
2005-03-30T10:21:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	yeah, thats pretty typical. I think Linux is much bigger in eastern Canada. Too bad I live in BC though. We are a bit alienated from the rest of our country (too many damn empty provinces full of wheat fields between us and New York!)
2005-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	Im surprised they even know what computers are in Saskachewan.
2005-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	Absenth	sabmoc	I was in Okotoks??  (about 30km south of Calgary) feb 12-20
2005-03-30T11:30:00.000Z	sabmoc	Absenth	I vote for Absenth
