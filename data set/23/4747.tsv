2007-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		when i run rm Music/*/*/.* it gives me a bunch of rm: cannot remove `.' or `..'   errors. The command is supposed to remove any hidden file (.*) in any artist directory (first *) in any album directory (*) in my Music folder, is there a better way to do this?
2007-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	I'd suggest find, but I am illiterate with it ;)  I've used gnome-find, a very old app for that
2007-09-01T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	metacity --replace should work
2007-09-01T09:26:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	thanks, I keep on forgetting that
2007-09-01T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	useless for me, fglrx and all that grief
2007-09-02T12:02:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	you'd edit /etc/network/interfaces ; if you know your ip address, netmask, broadcast address and gateway,  man interfaces will show you how to set it up
2007-09-02T12:03:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	using something like vim?
2007-09-02T12:03:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	exactly
2007-09-02T12:03:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	ok, thanks. I assumed there was some file like that to edit.
2007-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	here's a interfaces stanza I use at work: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36009/
2007-09-02T13:26:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	erm, do I need two dns nameservers?
2007-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	no, it's just a fallback if the first goes down
2007-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	will those dns servers work for me too, or should I use my own?
2007-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	you should use the ones your isp provides
2007-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	or some open ones :)
2007-09-02T13:28:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	q_a_z_steve what are the advantages to using something like openDNS? I just need something that works so that I can still install stuff on my server.
2007-09-02T13:29:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	your isp will have it's nameservers somewhere on it's web pages, it's good form to use them
2007-09-02T13:29:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	might as well use the ones the rest of the comps in my house are using...
2007-09-02T13:30:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	seems wise
2007-09-02T13:30:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	Jordan_U q_a_z_steve thanks for your help.
2007-09-03T12:39:00.000Z	nickrud	d4rkmonkey	you'd edit /etc/motd
2007-09-03T12:40:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	thank you.
2008-02-14T07:31:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	nickrud	whats this I hear about ipod sync?
