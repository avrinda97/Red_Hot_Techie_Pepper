2010-07-26T20:04:00.000Z	Zela		Hello i am having problems, how can I copy and paste things out of my shell to a getedit page
2010-07-26T20:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	highlight the text and ctrl-shift-c to copy from terminal
2010-07-26T20:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	ctrl-shift-v to paste to terminal
2010-07-26T20:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	I haven't learned how to select all in terminal :/
2010-07-26T20:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	what text are you trying to select? is it output from a command you want to send to gedit?
2010-07-26T20:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	gksudo gedit /path/to/file
2010-07-26T20:26:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	nothing came up.
2010-07-26T20:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	what is the path to the file?
2010-07-26T20:26:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	I know.
2010-07-26T20:27:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	Unreal3.2/unrealircd.cpnf
2010-07-26T20:27:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	Unreal3.2/unrealircd.conf
2010-07-26T20:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	gksudo gedit ~/Unreal3.2/unrealircd.conf
2010-07-26T20:28:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	it says starting admin something then it disappears, nothing is popping up.
2010-07-26T20:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	don't know what to tell you. You do have a GUI installation correct?
2010-07-26T20:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	don't use pastebinit on files you don't want to publish. I believe the pastebin will delete the entry in 24 hours unless you selected to save it longer.
2010-07-26T20:46:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	I didn't do anything, it just made a pastebin itself.
2010-07-26T20:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	if you don't tell us what the link is then no
2010-07-26T20:54:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	ok.
2010-07-26T20:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	I mean I could go to pastebin.com and look at the most recent posts but honestly I am not that interested :)
2010-07-26T20:55:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	but I thought you said no one can find it >.>
2010-07-26T20:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	you posted to a public site on the internet it can be found but who is going to go looking for it is the question.
2010-07-26T20:56:00.000Z	Zela	IdleOne	I just want it to delete, and idk how.
2010-07-26T20:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	Zela	go to the link, there may be an option there for you to delete it
