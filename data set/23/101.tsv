2012-07-13T13:50:00.000Z	sham-hack		Does any one have idea how I fix this.
2012-07-13T13:52:00.000Z	sham-hack		please help me!
2012-07-13T13:54:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	Thats the hardware you have, not the driver name.
2012-07-13T13:57:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: but i see that name of back of my laptop!
2012-07-13T13:57:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	It is still the name of the wifi chipset and NOT the driver name.
2012-07-13T13:59:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: do you have any advice, how i find my driver name.
2012-07-13T14:03:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	First, please just read the links you've been given.
2012-07-13T14:05:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: i found on that link that my wifdriver not supported :-- 14e4:4322 no BCM4322
2012-07-13T14:05:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	:  no means not support.
2012-07-13T14:06:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	do you have any idea what should i do now?
2012-07-13T14:06:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	Which link exactly told you that?
2012-07-13T14:06:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: and i found this on this page :- http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Supported_devices
2012-07-13T14:07:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	Then read that link again please, since it clearly states that the BCM4322 is supported.
2012-07-13T14:10:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	And I have no clue why you think your wifi chipset is "BCM4322", because your pastebin of lspci doesnt detect that at all.
2012-07-13T14:11:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: but my acer laptop already include that wifi driver.
2012-07-13T14:12:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: my acer laptop is TRAVEL MATE 4740
2012-07-13T14:13:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	That may be. Still your pastebin doesnt tell anything about BCM4322. Pastebin the output of lspci -k please.
2012-07-13T14:13:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: ok i will .
2012-07-13T14:16:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: here the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/1089589/
2012-07-13T14:17:00.000Z	bekks	sham-hack	As you can see in lines 45-47, you have a BCM4358, which uses the "wl" driver.
2012-07-13T14:17:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	ok .
2012-07-13T14:18:00.000Z	sham-hack	bekks	: but it found wifi point in win-7  but how i manage in ubuntu
