2010-01-17T05:37:00.000Z	Dextronaught		so... Andy14 told me he had the same problem before
2010-01-17T05:37:00.000Z	Dextronaught		and removed pulseaudio
2010-01-17T05:37:00.000Z	Dextronaught		and used just alsa
2010-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	Dextronaught		and it fixed it for him, and it kinda did for me
2010-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I think the mic works, but I don't got sound, I can't even access my sound preferences now
2010-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I doubt it.
2010-01-17T05:40:00.000Z	Dextronaught		like that?

2010-01-17T05:40:00.000Z	Dextronaught		):
2010-01-17T05:41:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	can you do aplay -l
2010-01-17T05:40:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	thats not good
2010-01-17T05:43:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	do you have a voice modem?
2010-01-17T05:46:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	so what was your problem.. cant hear audio?
2010-01-17T05:47:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	ok yea that was silly advice
2010-01-17T05:48:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	he is right but I believe it causes alot more then it solves
2010-01-17T05:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	the problem is that teamspeak is oss I believe
2010-01-17T05:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	have you tried starting teamspeak with padsp?
2010-01-17T05:51:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	its part of pulse
2010-01-17T05:52:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	if you type gstreamer-properties
2010-01-17T05:53:00.000Z	Dextronaught	dotblank	you're a miracle worker :D
2010-01-17T05:55:00.000Z	dotblank	Dextronaught	because alsa locks down the sound card multiple playback streams are not support without the use of dmix. So you may have to close teamspeak in order to fix this
2010-01-17T06:58:00.000Z	Dextronaught	dotblank	since I got my mic working, would it be ok to reinstall pulseaudio?
