2007-09-11T15:10:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	thats crappy
2007-09-11T15:10:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	Well, it's not all that bad with other hardware, it's just that my laptop is so new that it has issues.
2007-09-11T15:11:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	ah... i was suprised that 7.04 worked so well for me on my laptop.
2007-09-11T15:12:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	wow sounds like an expensive laptop
2007-09-11T15:12:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	Nah, Toshiba's aren't that expensive, and they are VERY durable.
2007-09-11T15:12:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	i used to have a toshiba... it lasted 9 days
2007-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	This is my 7th Toshiba, and they have all been through Hall and back for me without skipping a beat. I had one that fell into a cooler of ice water, and after drying for about 24 hours booted right up.
2007-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	lol
2007-09-11T15:14:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	Had another one that I forgot was on top of my Explorer and it flew off of the roof at 35 MPH and skidded into the curb (it was 3 days old). The housing cracked a little, but other than that it worked fine.
2007-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	thats crazy. we just got in some toughbooks at work... those things are nuts
2007-09-11T15:30:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	not when you have big guys like GD and Raytheon in the arena
2007-09-11T15:31:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	That's not really their market. The GD and Ratheons are too expensive for mid-tier companies. Even Business Objects is too expensive, but JasperSoft and Talend have better products in that price range.
2007-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	what do you do for a living right now ?
2007-09-11T15:38:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	I am the Senior Systems Admin for a manufacturing company which has branches ranging from Anchorage Alaska to Jacksonville, FL.
2007-09-11T15:38:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	sweet, thats what im looking to do
2007-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	I used to do Information Assurance for the US Navy back in the day.
2007-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	I've been slowly pushed from SysAdmin into Java development over the last year or so.
2007-09-11T15:43:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	Yeah, I used to feel the same way until I started running into problems that there were no solutions for yet.
2007-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	I got SO frustrated that I just banged my head on an IDE until I got some working code. My boss was so impressed that he handed me more programming projects.
2007-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	DSpair	|brad|	No good deed ever goes unpunished.
2007-09-11T15:45:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	oh how i know that
2007-09-11T16:00:00.000Z	|brad|	DSpair	im right there with ya man
