2011-12-10T01:11:00.000Z	maslen		I'm on Ubuntu 11.04, and running the proprietary nvidia drivers. When I try to resume from 'inactivity', the machine freezes and is completely unresponsive. However, it is fine until I actually move the mouse or the like - until then, everything works properly.
2011-12-10T01:12:00.000Z	maslen		Are there any logs I could examine to attempt to determine the cause of this issue, or does anyone know how to fix it?
2011-12-10T01:14:00.000Z	maslen		The mouse does not move, alt+f1 does not give me a terminal, the caps lock doesn't change the light, and the power button does not shut it down.
2011-12-10T01:16:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	do you have a swap file and is your home directory encrypted?
2011-12-10T01:17:00.000Z	maslen	sskalnik	I do have a swap, and my home is not encrypted.
2011-12-10T01:17:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 Is this a new occurrence or has this always happened?
2011-12-10T01:17:00.000Z	maslen	sskalnik	New
2011-12-10T01:18:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 Which kernel?
2011-12-10T01:18:00.000Z	maslen		2.6.38-13-generic
2011-12-10T01:19:00.000Z	maslen		(x86_64)
2011-12-10T01:20:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 Does it resume from suspend when there are no USB peripherals plugged in?
2011-12-10T01:21:00.000Z	maslen	sskalnik	It's not an issue  of resuming from suspend, rather from inactivity.
2011-12-10T01:22:00.000Z	sskalnik		So from a black screen, not from a suspend to RAM or hibernate due to inactivity?
2011-12-10T01:22:00.000Z	maslen	sskalnik	exactly.
2011-12-10T01:23:00.000Z	maslen		except it's even if the screen is not black.
2011-12-10T01:23:00.000Z	maslen		Just that I was inactive for 10 minutes or so.
2011-12-10T01:23:00.000Z	maslen		(I tried disabling that first)
2011-12-10T01:23:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 Using the official drivers from the 11.04 repo?
2011-12-10T01:23:00.000Z	maslen		I'm using the current nvidia ones.
2011-12-10T01:24:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 The ones from the Ubuntu repo, not from the nvidia site?
2011-12-10T01:26:00.000Z	maslen		I'm using the current nvidia from the nvidia site.
2011-12-10T01:27:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 That could be the issue right there.
2011-12-10T01:27:00.000Z	sskalnik	maslen	 The driver in the Ubuntu repo is probably a safer choice.
