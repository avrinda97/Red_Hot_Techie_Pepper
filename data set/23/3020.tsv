2008-10-07T13:14:00.000Z	moda1		can someone tell me how to change to boot order in my BIOS?  I want to get my computer to boot windows again, and it keeps going straight to GRUB
2008-10-07T13:15:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	try F12
2008-10-07T13:16:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	it is usually different for every computer
2008-10-07T13:19:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	it's F12 on my computer

2008-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Boot into the original Linux system with the external hard drive still installed (or you can boot from a Live Ubuntu CD).
2008-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Open up a terminal and type sudo su
2008-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Type fdisk -l and locate your Linux boot partition from the list Example: sda1 or hda1
2008-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Type grub-install /dev/sdx or grub-install /dev/hdx to reinstall or repair Grub!
2008-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Reboot and test!
2008-10-07T13:24:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Notes: x represents the drive letter a, b, c, d etc. Replace with your actual drive letter.
2008-10-07T13:25:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	sdx= SATA, SCSI or USB devices hdx= IDE devices
2008-10-07T13:27:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	what version of windows are you using again?
2008-10-07T13:28:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	hmm
2008-10-07T13:28:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	no Vista DVD?
2008-10-07T13:29:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	then just restore your grub as I showed you already
2008-10-07T13:29:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	try the grub restore first
2008-10-07T13:29:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	nope you would just be able to dual boot
2008-10-07T13:30:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	Good Welcome
2008-10-07T13:32:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	if not check out this page http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-how-to-uninstall-grub/
2008-10-07T13:32:00.000Z	ravtux	moda1	good luck
2008-10-07T13:39:00.000Z	moda1	ravtux	thanks for the link.  That should tell me what I need to know.
