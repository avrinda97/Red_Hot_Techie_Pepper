2008-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	EdLin		oops
2008-11-02T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	EdLin	looks like your usb ports don't work
2008-11-02T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	EdLin	I don't know much about running ubuntu on a mac, but you might want to try the pci=routeirq boot option
2008-11-02T13:56:00.000Z	EdLin	Gnea	I'm not on a mac
2008-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	Gnea	EdLin	well, either way, it looks like your usb isn't working right. try that boot option and see if anything changes.
2008-11-02T13:57:00.000Z	EdLin		ok
2008-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	EdLin	Gnea	didn't work. This is a dell netbook, not a mac
