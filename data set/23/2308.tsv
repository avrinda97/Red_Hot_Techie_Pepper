2010-02-18T15:52:00.000Z	indus		i need to make changes
2010-02-18T15:53:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	add that to /etc/default/grub and rerun update-grub2
2010-02-18T15:54:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	so copy paste the ubuntu entry from grub.cfg to /etc/default/grub and edit it?
2010-02-18T15:55:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	no, add that to the line that says "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" then 'sudo update-grub2'
2010-02-18T15:56:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	is /et/default/grub a directory?
2010-02-18T15:56:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	it's a text file
2010-02-18T15:56:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	just try and edit it you'll see
2010-02-18T15:58:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	aah ok there i add acpi=off ok nice
2010-02-18T15:58:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	:)
2010-02-18T15:59:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	and to add custom i go to /etc/grub.d/40_custom right?
2010-02-18T16:00:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	right, those will be pasted into grub.cfg as is
2010-02-18T16:00:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	but have to run update grub too always?
2010-02-18T16:01:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	right
2010-02-18T16:01:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	you don't have to if you edit grub.cfg dirrectly though
2010-02-18T16:02:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	ok thanks a lot, i dont use grub2 but many have questions, so iam now ready to sc*ew their systems
2010-02-18T16:02:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	heh
2010-02-18T16:02:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	that file is not meant to be edited it says clearly
2010-02-18T16:02:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	but thats a fake warning i always believed
2010-02-18T16:02:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	well 'not meant to' means different things for different people, hehe
2010-02-18T16:03:00.000Z	indus	stdisease	and the explanation why it should not be edited does not exist :)
2010-02-18T16:03:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	for most cases because of automatic regeneration & overwriting your changes
2010-02-18T16:13:00.000Z	stdisease	indus	s/he probably means mounted the partition
