2006-04-12T11:30:00.000Z	_jason		abdul|linuxnewbi: the reason it isn't working is because it isn't archived properly.  If you really want this one I can walk you through it, want to do that?
2006-04-12T11:31:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	yes

2006-04-12T11:34:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	right click on it and press 'extract here'
2006-04-12T11:34:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	ok i did that
2006-04-12T11:35:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	ok, now open nautilus: places > home
2006-04-12T11:36:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	nautilus? its just a folder directory right?
2006-04-12T11:38:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	yeah, nautilus is the file browser.  Now press ctrl-h and you should see hidden stuff.  If the '.themes' directory does not exist, create it.
2006-04-12T11:39:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	 it does exsist
2006-04-12T11:40:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	great, double click to open it.  Then go back to your desktop and open the .themes folder that is there.  Then copy the folder called 'Ubuntulooks-Orange-smooth' to your .themes in your home directory that you opened before
2006-04-12T11:43:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	when i extracted the tar.gz folder with the theme it showed a folder called user; inside is : share/themes/Ubuntulooks-Orange-smooth  and two other folders, i dont see a .theme folder
2006-04-12T11:43:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	ok, just copy Ubuntulooks-Orange-smooth to your .themes
2006-04-12T11:44:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	ok i did that
2006-04-12T11:44:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	now go to system > prefs > themes and it should be there
2006-04-12T11:45:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	its not there, do i have to restart ?
2006-04-12T11:45:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	go to details and look at controls and window border, it should be there
2006-04-12T11:46:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	thanks alot jason

2006-04-12T11:47:00.000Z	abdul|linuxnewbi	_jason	your the best mon, i really appreciate it
2006-04-12T11:47:00.000Z	_jason	abdul|linuxnewbi	most themes should work jsut by dragging, but this one wasn't put in the tar.gz correctly.  So just open it up and see what you see, usually there is a README of some kind
