2010-05-31T01:01:00.000Z	Chelin		Compiz
2010-05-31T01:01:00.000Z	Chelin		desktop efects
2010-05-31T01:02:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	What seems to be wrong with the effects?
2010-05-31T01:04:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	Can you pastebin the output of 'compiz --replace' from your terminal?
2010-05-31T01:05:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	compiz (core) - Fatal: glXCreateContext failed
2010-05-31T01:05:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	There is your problem. You need to reinstall the nvidia driver
2010-05-31T01:07:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	Which one should I install? I already tried 173 and 185, neither worked with compiz
2010-05-31T01:08:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	Ah, you may need to blacklist the nouveau kernel module
2010-05-31T01:09:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	Did you google how to install the proprietary driver on 10.04?
2010-05-31T01:09:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	I installed through Jockey, and also tried nVidia.com binary installation
2010-05-31T01:10:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	so that's a 'no' to googling then?
2010-05-31T01:10:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	that's a no, sorry
2010-05-31T01:10:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	already have blacklist nuveau
2010-05-31T01:11:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	Pastebin your X log then
2010-05-31T01:11:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	And see if 'lsmod|grep nouveau' has any output
2010-05-31T01:13:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	thanks, I'm gonna give google a try. "pastebin"??
2010-05-31T01:13:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	pastebin service like pastebin.com or .org
2010-05-31T01:14:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	aah, got it. Ok, thanks
2010-05-31T01:14:00.000Z	soreau	Chelin	google can also tell you what pastebin is ;)
2010-05-31T01:30:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	Compiz working, google teached me I need to blacklist some other stuff to properly install propietary nVidia driver :P
2010-05-31T01:31:00.000Z	Chelin	soreau	Thanks for your help
