2007-03-28T07:10:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		Hey people. I could use some help if anyone has the chance.
2007-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		Ok, so I'm working my way through the following link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092
2007-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		and everything workd, execpt for two things.
2007-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		one, I can't get connected to my wireless network even though it scans when I do: "sudo iwlist scanning"
2007-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		two, if I reboot, it forgets that the driver was ever installed and I have to go through the whole thing all over again
2007-03-28T07:14:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		aaand....?
2007-03-28T07:14:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	are you talking to someone in particular?
2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	i responded twice can you not see this?
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	if you're not registered it might not show up
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	please put my name in front of whatever you send to me,  you can use tab to autocomplete
2007-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	what's the problem with your wireless card
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	ok, so I followed the instructions in the link, and as long as I don't restart it recognises my hardware, even though "sudo iwlist scanning" shows more networks than my other laptop can show.
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	if I restart it vanishes entirely and I have to start from scratch.
2007-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	you're not using a livecd i assume?
2007-03-28T07:48:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	You still hangin around?
2007-03-28T07:54:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	lspci -v
2007-03-28T07:54:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	what chipset do you have
2007-03-28T07:55:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	It's a "0b:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Unknown device 4311 (rev 01)"
2007-03-28T07:58:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	Sorta. I had it to the point where I could scan for networks, but I couldn't connect.
2007-03-28T07:58:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	iwlist (interface) scan shows outputs?
2007-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	I;m sorry man, i keep betting booted.
2007-03-28T08:10:00.000Z	Crazytom	LinuxProbie	have you installed fwcutter or ndiswrapper before?
2007-03-28T08:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	Crazytom	not till I was told to in the walkthrough
