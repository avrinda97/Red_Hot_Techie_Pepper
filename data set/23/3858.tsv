2009-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	if you replace aptitude with apt-get it will also work
2009-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	when it comes to installs like you are doing they are synonymous
2009-08-07T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	dpkg -l | grep mutt
2009-08-07T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	if the dpkg command outputs something, its installed
2009-08-07T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get install mutt
2009-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	you can also which any app too ;)
2009-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	you can use that output in commands and scripts using the ` character
2009-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	e.g.   ln -s `type mutt` ~/mutt_symlink
2009-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	for example
2009-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	the ` bit is worked out first and substituted in the command
2009-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	whats cool too is that you can ssh in to your system from anywhere and real the email store on your pc
2009-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	perturbed	it is. i had it working ages ago then i had to set it up and couldnt get it nice
