2006-01-07T11:23:00.000Z	Jnx		Why can't I access my NTFS HDD's from my Linux?
2006-01-07T11:24:00.000Z	Jnx		I've fixed fstab. dough :P
2006-01-07T11:24:00.000Z	Jnx		hehe
2006-01-07T11:25:00.000Z	Jnx		I've got that in my /etc/fstab
2006-01-07T11:25:00.000Z	Jnx		utf8
2006-01-07T11:26:00.000Z	Jnx		Meaning only root can acess it. I think :P
2006-01-07T11:26:00.000Z	Jnx		access *
2006-01-07T10:18:00.000Z	Jnx		How do I get the rights to open my NTFS disks? - I can open them as a root, but not as a user.
2006-01-07T10:18:00.000Z	Jnx		Can I give my regular user root access?
2006-01-07T10:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	sudo -i
2006-01-07T10:20:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	I still get that I don't have the rights to show HDA1, HDB1 etc.
2006-01-07T10:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	did you mount them yet?
2006-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	you enabled a root account?
2006-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	yeah. I use it when I access the harddrives from the root user
2006-01-07T10:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	by root you mean su?
2006-01-07T10:23:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	I mean, I log out, log in with username: root and root password. When I do that I can access my harddrives.
2006-01-07T10:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	than i dont know what to say other than to log in as root "i say that very loosely"
2006-01-07T10:24:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	can't I give this-user root rights?
2006-01-07T10:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	yes but not advisable root/sudo is not something to take lightly
2006-01-07T10:31:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	at least. I have this folder I can't copy from. I copyed some music with my root user from HDA1 to /media/music and when I'm on my regular user I can't use them. Something about rights. How do I fix that?
2006-01-07T10:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Jnx	if you did anything as root you need to have root access to open it
2006-01-07T10:32:00.000Z	Jnx	gnomefreak	so what I have to do is to just start using my root account as my standard account? :P
