2007-02-04T11:36:00.000Z	Brian_		I'm trying to install ubuntu on my computer and it really doesn't like my graphics card/mobo for some reason, any ideas?
2007-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	Can you specify the card type?
2007-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	Brian_		well, I can install it, but the boot screen is extremely glitchy as it loads the live CD
2007-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	Brian_		radeon x800XL
2007-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	Brian_		nVidia Nforce4
2007-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	Brian_		AMD
2007-02-04T11:38:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	At least, it should work with the VESA driver.
2007-02-04T11:38:00.000Z	Brian_		I tried the AMD specific 6.10 installer and vesa was default for some reason
2007-02-04T11:38:00.000Z	Brian_		I had to change it to radeon to get it to work at all
2007-02-04T11:39:00.000Z	Brian_		with what I do have installed it refuses to access the internet through either of my wireless cards (used seperately)
2007-02-04T11:39:00.000Z	Brian_		and the boot agent has a hard time actually getting ubuntu to boot
2007-02-04T11:40:00.000Z	Brian_		if it boots at all
2007-02-04T11:40:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	Please one problem in one time.
2007-02-04T11:40:00.000Z	Brian_		heh, sorry
2007-02-04T11:41:00.000Z	Brian_		I installed the non-AMD specific 6.10, and now it runs, but it is very glitchy while it is booting if it boots
2007-02-04T11:41:00.000Z	Brian_		I have not tried changing the device to radeon or to vesa with the non-AMD specific version on install, but I wasn't sure that it would help
2007-02-04T11:42:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	 and after your window manager starts is the graphics ok?
2007-02-04T11:42:00.000Z	Brian_		yes
2007-02-04T11:42:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	changing the xorg graphics driver does not affect the bootup screen.
2007-02-04T11:43:00.000Z	Brian_		I thought it might keep it from preforming so poorly after the desktop boots though
2007-02-04T11:47:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	there is a discussion about those cards: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2007697
2007-02-04T11:48:00.000Z	zoli2k	Brian_	I am not sure whether you need the nvidia drvires or ATI drivers.
2007-02-04T11:50:00.000Z	Brian_	zoli2k	thanks
