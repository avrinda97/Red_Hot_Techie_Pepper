2007-06-19T08:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	I was just on here as "liveCD"  the ACPI on that machine I'm installing on isn't very friendly to the LiveCD... I'm on my laptop now
2007-06-19T08:27:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	acpi=off, noacpi, etc
2007-06-19T08:28:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	I tried the noacpi option, but it still goes down :-/  I hear the fan on the whole time too
2007-06-19T08:29:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	when does it "go down".all you told me it doesn't install grub
2007-06-19T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	well it stays up long enough for a complete install... just somehow it didn't install grub
2007-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	when I look at the filesystem that it installed, in the /boot folder there is no grub folder
2007-06-19T08:31:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	boot from a livecd and install grub again
2007-06-19T08:31:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	I can install just grub from the liveCD?  because I tried the regular install twice, and each time, no grub
2007-06-19T08:31:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	 lol, I lost that link last time when the liveCD crashed (obviously)  thanks again, i'll give that a go
2007-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	I tried the grub-install command from the site you listed... it didn't work :-(
2007-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	you need to install grub too with apt-get first
2007-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	part of the problem is that there is no /boot/grub
2007-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	hhmmm,  looks like grub is already on the liveCD...
2007-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	the part about "Preparing Your Working Environment" applies to you
2007-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	you need a chroot and then install grub via apt-get there
2007-06-19T09:07:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	install grub into a chroot on the liveCD???
2007-06-19T09:08:00.000Z	wols	hendrixski	no. read the paragraph I told you. chroot into your hdd install
2007-06-19T09:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	oh.. right right... I'm looking at like 5 different manuals and forum posts at once... very confused here...
2007-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	aarrrgg.... when I'm in the chroot it tells me I can't write anything... read-only file system
2007-06-19T09:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	and I did the whole thing as root
2007-06-19T09:46:00.000Z	hendrixski	wols	 I unmounted and remounted the chroot and now it let me write to the file... but now it tells me that the disk is full (even though df -h says otherwise)
