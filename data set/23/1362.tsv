2010-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	zetheroo		how can i know if the Vesa driver is in use or not?
2010-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	look at the output from xvinfo.
2010-05-01T08:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	cannot see any driver info there ...
2010-05-01T08:10:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	Ther is usually a line that says Adapter #0, or higher numbers.  What does it show there?
2010-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	You are using an Intel driver, not Vesa.
2010-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	  What chipset do you have?  I understand there are problems on some Intel Chipsets.
2010-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c)
2010-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	was working great in Karmic and Jaunty
2010-05-01T08:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	and the driver info in Synaptic says its for the 965 chipset ... so it's the right driver ... no!?
2010-05-01T08:15:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	That can happen.  I had some Intel 815 based systems that worked in Jaunty.  When I upgraded to Karmic, they lo longer could start x.  The video driver supplied at that time did not work.  It was fixed a little later,
2010-05-01T08:16:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	so even though I am using the correct driver for this chipset it still not technically "right" ... hehe ... love it ... :P
2010-05-01T08:17:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	It sounds like it is the right driver.  The driver may have a bug, like I saw.  I switched my system to VESA and ran that way for a couple of weeks until the problem was fixed.  Did you find something?
2010-05-01T08:18:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	nothing so far .. pretty disappointed though ...  oh well ..
2010-05-01T08:19:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	maybe i can get the latest drivers straight from Intel
2010-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	That could work.
2010-05-01T11:10:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	That happens sometimes, but I rarely see it.  So, I can't explain something that does not happen regurly.  Bad karma, maybe?
2010-05-01T11:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	I have 4 laptops and 2 desktops all running Ubuntu here ... and with each new release there is at least one machine which will loose some prior function after upgrading ... usually it's more than one computer .... so I don't think "karma" has anything to do with it - ha
2010-05-01T11:14:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	So, 1 out of thousands of packages has a problem during an upgrade on one of a batch of machines.  That sounds like a pretty good record.  I have better luck than that and I manage 30 machines, but one problem does not seem too bad.
2010-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	There is no operating system that has no bugs.  Linux has fewer than any of similar complexity.
2010-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	This is really off topic, so I'll stop responding on this.
2010-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	it's not even about not having any NEW bugs ... but when the same issues continue to arise release after release ... it's not fun anymore
2010-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	PythonPup	zetheroo	if you really need dependable, don't updgrade to a new version a day after it comes out.  Wait a month at least.
2010-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	PythonPup	that is what it seems like .. although I would say wait 3 months ... just to be a little more sure ..
