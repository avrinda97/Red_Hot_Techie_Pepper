2012-06-18T04:28:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Is it controlled by Upstart?
2012-06-18T04:28:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	I believe so
2012-06-18T04:29:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Hold on a minute...
2012-06-18T04:37:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Try running "sudo initctl show-config networkmanager"
2012-06-18T04:40:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	And then?
2012-06-18T04:41:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	It should show you when the job starts and stops.
2012-06-18T04:41:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	 start on ((local-filesystems and started dbus) and static-network-up)  stop on stopping dbus
2012-06-18T04:42:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Yes. It SHOULD be starting automatically, now.
2012-06-18T04:43:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	So..uh, it should start automatically but it doesn't?
2012-06-18T04:46:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Yes. Could it be failing when Upstart tries to start it?
2012-06-18T04:48:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	Probably. When my system starts, it says "Waiting for network configuration", then eventually "Waiting 60 more seconds for network configuration", or something like that
2012-06-18T05:06:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	it starts manually, also, sudo start network-manager
2012-06-18T05:09:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	One thing I'm not sure of: Does the network have to be up before you start networkmanager, or does networkmanager start the network? If it is the former, you could try changing the start on condition to "static-network-up".
2012-06-18T05:10:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	What do you mean
2012-06-18T05:11:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	It sounds like maybe network manager is failing to start properly because it's waiting for the network to be up. But, if that is the problem, you have some other problem too, with your network.
2012-06-18T05:12:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	I use network-manager to connect to our Wi-Fi network...
2012-06-18T05:15:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Ok, just try changing the start on condition in Upstart. But, comment out the old start on code, in case the change doesn't help. So you can go back to the original, if necessary.
2012-06-18T05:16:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	How do I change it?
2012-06-18T05:21:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Still here? What's going on?
2012-06-18T05:45:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	How do I change the start condition?
2012-06-18T05:46:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	It should be by editing a file named /etc/init/networkmanager.conf.
2012-06-19T00:48:00.000Z	ratcheer	Tiktalik	Did you ever get your Network Manager working the way you wanted?
2012-06-19T00:49:00.000Z	Tiktalik	ratcheer	I don't mind having to start it manually, I just want my booting to take less long
