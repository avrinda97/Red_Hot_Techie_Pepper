2010-07-14T22:12:00.000Z	ubuntu-		i got an external hdd via usb, but it says 'readonly filesystem' ... anyone know why it would be readonly?
2010-07-14T22:13:00.000Z	ubuntu-		cant change the permissions, it seems
2010-07-14T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 #1 what filesystem is on it..
2010-07-14T22:18:00.000Z	ubuntu-	Dr_Willis	ubuntu autodetected it. it's an external harddrive on /media/usbdisk
2010-07-14T22:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 NTFS is by default mounted read only, if you want to set it othewise install.run the ntfs-config tool. thats why i asked what 'filesystem' it was using.
2010-07-14T22:20:00.000Z	ubuntu-	Dr_Willis	is there another way to do it? im on a livecd without internet
2010-07-14T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 you can access the files as root if you wanted to.
2010-07-14T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 open a command line. 'sudo -s'   the cd /media/wheever and do whatever you want with the files
2010-07-14T22:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-	Dr_Willis	sudo mkdir didnt work
2010-07-14T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 this is a NTFS drive?
2010-07-14T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 if the drive was seen/detected to not been removed 'cleanly' by windows. it can also get mounted in read only mode as a 'safty' feature
2010-07-14T22:23:00.000Z	ubuntu-	Dr_Willis	it says 'cannot create dir. .. readonly file system"
2010-07-14T22:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 you do see the windows files on the drive?
2010-07-14T22:24:00.000Z	ubuntu-	Dr_Willis	can i mount it manually with sudo mount? what /dev/? wiould it be?
2010-07-14T22:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 you can.. but as i mentiooned IF the drive has some sort of Error. it may be getting forced into a read-only mode
2010-07-14T22:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 you would mount with a ciommand like --> 'sudo ntfs-3g /dev/whatever  /media/MAKEADIRECTORY'
2010-07-14T22:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 try mounting it by hand. and see if it mentions some errors
2010-07-14T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 what was the mount command you used exactly?
2010-07-14T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	  i mentioned using the 'ntfs-3g' command earlier...
2010-07-14T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 you would mount with a command like --> 'sudo ntfs-3g /dev/whatever  /media/MAKEADIRECTORY'
2010-07-14T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 this IS a ntfs filesystem right?
2010-07-14T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 You have used it on windows machines befor?
2010-07-14T22:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu-	 i would plugit into a windows machine and  let windows scandisk it and check it.   If the ntfs-3g tools find the filesystem in a 'bad' state. it will mount it read only.
