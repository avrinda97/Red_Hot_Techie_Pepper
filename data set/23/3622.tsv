2008-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	tomtommy		so many people., so little chatting :P
2008-03-04T02:24:00.000Z	tomtommy		when I delete a file in Ubuntu, does Ubuntu wipe the file 3 times?
2008-03-04T02:25:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	 No.
2008-03-04T02:26:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	so how do I undelete a file I deleted?
2008-03-04T02:26:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	so Ubuntu never securely deletes files?
2008-03-04T02:27:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	depends on what you mean by secure. No simple tool exists to recover a deleted file. But it would take your local police department's it squad all of three minutes to recover files deleted in ubuntu.
2008-03-04T02:27:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	even files deleted using WIPE?
2008-03-04T02:28:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	^
2008-03-04T02:28:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	wipe uses 35 pass wipe.
2008-03-04T02:29:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	i like to see them undelete that :P
2008-03-04T02:33:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	claims the files deleted in Ubuntu are not securely deleted.  but that website says it is
2008-03-04T02:34:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	What are you talking about? I said your local police department can undelete your files. I said it depends on what you mean by secure.
2008-03-04T02:34:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	prove it
2008-03-04T02:34:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	have u seen the police dept do it?
2008-03-04T02:35:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	im glad u admited to giving false information. thanks for your honesty
2008-03-04T02:51:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	ok gotcha
2008-03-04T02:48:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	I gave you the solution. If you want bullet proof certainty melt your harddrive. If you want 99.9% security, erase your entire hard-disk using low-level wipe, followed by a full dban wipe, followed by full disk encryption. Otherwise, just delete it.
2008-03-04T02:48:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	you are trolling!  you are not giving a practible solution. IM NOT GOING TO MELT MY HDD.
2008-03-04T02:51:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	The best way is wipe. Or shred. And as the makers of both those programs will tell you, they can't guarentee they work.
2008-03-18T01:03:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tomtommy	You sound like you're interested in secure deletion. Once you learn a bit more you'll probably come to realize that there are two levels of security. A fully encrypted system, and shift+delete.  Shred is the lazy man's security. Does really add much more than just shift+delete because on journalled file systems it's impossible to be sure you've overwritten all traces of the file. Thus, shredding is false security. So either you system is ha
2008-03-18T01:03:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	I know all that and I use wipe and Shred regularly!  but my question is.... HOW CAN I ADD SHRED TO TRASHCAN?
2008-03-18T01:04:00.000Z	tomtommy	ArthurArchnix	i didnt ask for your opinion about the security of Shred!  I asked....  HOW CAN I ADD SHRED TO TRASHCAN?
