2007-05-05T08:17:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	usb
2007-05-05T08:17:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	usb drives are normally auto detected
2007-05-05T08:18:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	not here.......
2007-05-05T08:18:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	external? how is it powered? <--- you have not answered this
2007-05-05T08:20:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	i am new to this stuff...... what do you mean by how is this powered
2007-05-05T08:20:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	how do you expect an external device to get its power, batteries? solar cells? etc...
2007-05-05T08:21:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	none of the kind
2007-05-05T08:21:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	then perhaps its not powered enuff with juice from usb port, you may need an external power source
2007-05-05T08:22:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	it is what unimatrix9 described
2007-05-05T08:22:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	i did not pay attention to what he said or she said
2007-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	can you tell me how to list info about an external hd...... like its filesystem and so on ?
2007-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	man df and man du
2007-05-05T08:31:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	btw if this helps.......... i this external hd worked on edgy
2007-05-05T08:32:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	but sometimes maybe the usb driver didnt have enuff juice for the port? i am not 100% sure..you follow?
2007-05-05T08:33:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	i do
2007-05-05T08:33:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	would it aid if i rebooted ?
2007-05-05T08:33:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	so make sure it has enuff power to it
2007-05-05T08:34:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	i have googled on how to supply power to it
2007-05-05T08:34:00.000Z	bulmer	shriphani	you can try..
2007-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	it didnt work
2007-05-05T09:33:00.000Z	shriphani	bulmer	if you are there...... i can manually mount it but it wont automount
