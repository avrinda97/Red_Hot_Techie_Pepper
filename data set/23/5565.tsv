2006-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	bthibault		I have sun-java5-plugin and the current JRE  but still can't get java working in FF 2.0
2006-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	bthibault		am i missing something?
2006-11-06T12:26:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	can you see java in about:plugins
2006-11-06T12:26:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	let me check
2006-11-06T12:27:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	nope, i can't see java , only Flash
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	your FF is the one that came with ubuntu or a one you've installed on your own?
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	should i unstall it?
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	no, but you should link the plugin to where you've installed it
2006-11-06T12:33:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	libjavaplugin.so is linked to /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so
2006-11-06T12:35:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	its ok, "ls -l /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so" to make sure its not a dead link, but I don't think it will be
2006-11-06T12:35:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	yes its there
2006-11-06T12:35:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	so its in my plugin dir. but firefox isn't accepting it apparently
2006-11-06T12:36:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	its becasue FF2 is a custom install its probably looking for the plugins elsewhere, where did you install it?
2006-11-06T12:37:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	most howtos I've seen have you install FF2 somehere under /opt etc.
2006-11-06T12:38:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	yes its under opt
2006-11-06T12:38:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	/opt
2006-11-06T12:39:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	something like /opt/firefox ? so you should probably add a link to /opt/firefox/plugins ...
2006-11-06T12:41:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	i owe you a beer
2006-11-06T12:41:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	i was working out of /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2006-11-06T12:41:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	and where in the world should you be, may I decide to collect?
2006-11-06T12:41:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	i'll be in Vegas next week for PubCon
2006-11-06T12:42:00.000Z	bthibault	ifireball	other than that Columbus, OH
2006-11-06T12:43:00.000Z	ifireball	bthibault	cheers
