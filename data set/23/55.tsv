2012-11-01T11:19:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	continue to run in low graphics mode, uninstall the nvidia drivers.
2012-11-01T11:19:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	Which NVIDIA driver are you using? The open source or the proprietary?
2012-11-01T11:20:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	I just tried installing the proprietary with the software called 'additional drivers'
2012-11-01T11:21:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	but I can't get to low graphics mode,  all I got was tty1, a console with no desktop
2012-11-01T11:21:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	I suggest disabling the proprietary and going with the open source ones.
2012-11-01T11:21:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	startx
2012-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	type startx, hit enter.
2012-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	it shows a blank screen
2012-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	no unity
2012-11-01T11:23:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	if you logged in via the terminal where you're at, type startx and is there anything showing?
2012-11-01T11:23:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	also, follow wols's directions
2012-11-01T11:24:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	yes there is, just a blank sscreen
2012-11-01T11:24:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	I mean, I can see the desktop, but no unity
2012-11-01T11:25:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	Alt-F2. Type in unity, hit enter.
2012-11-01T11:25:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	alt f2 doesn't do anything
2012-11-01T11:25:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	Press ctrl-alt-f7 and see if anything shows
2012-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	yes, some random text
2012-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	the last line is 'mountall: Disconnected from Plymouth               [OK]'
2012-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	Since we cannot see what's on the screen, I am going to suggest doing a reinstall.
2012-11-01T11:27:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	a reinstall of what?
2012-11-01T11:27:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	The current version of ubuntu you're running.
2012-11-01T11:28:00.000Z	kristenbb	rootbrian	that's nott convenient, I just lost a lot of time setting up my new system
2012-11-01T11:28:00.000Z	rootbrian	kristenbb	This is out of my reach. Sorry.
