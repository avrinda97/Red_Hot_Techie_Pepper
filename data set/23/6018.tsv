2006-07-25T12:29:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - I guess not, I'll try to figure out how to mount it
2006-07-25T12:30:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - I seem to have mounted it, but apt still isn't paying any attention to it
2006-07-25T12:31:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - I did mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 and it seemed to work. I can ls the contents of the CD now
2006-07-25T12:32:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - actually the cdrom listed in sources.list is Ubuntu-Server, I probably need to list Ubuntu-Desktop
2006-07-25T12:33:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - yeah, just reports failures to get the Internet servers, doesn't look at the CD
2006-07-25T12:34:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper = Okay, i tired editing Ubuntu-Server to Ubuntu-Desktop in sources.list, but apt-get update is now telling me to use apt-cdrom, so we'll see how that goes
2006-07-25T12:36:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - well, apt-cdrom seemed to work, it added an entry to sources.list for the Desktop CD, but apt-get still fails
2006-07-25T12:37:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - yeah, same thing, it doesn't seem to look at the CD
2006-07-25T12:38:00.000Z	seanh		gatekeeper - it looks like apt-cdrom unmounted the CD, but I remounted and tried apt-get update again and still nothing
2006-07-25T12:39:00.000Z	seanh		Anyone know how to upgrade a server install to a Desktop install using a Desktop CD?
2006-07-25T12:39:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	not without reformatting
2006-07-25T12:40:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- really? I should be able to just add the Desktop CD as a repos and install the packages from it, no?
2006-07-25T12:40:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	the Desktop CD doesn't really work that way
2006-07-25T12:41:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	now if you had the DVD or the alternate that would work
2006-07-25T12:41:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- so it can't be done? The Desktop install doesn't work on this laptop, will I have to burn an alternative install CD?
2006-07-25T12:41:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	unless you have the internet - you could just apt-get the ubuntu-desktop if you do
2006-07-25T12:42:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- unfortunately not, the wireless card is problematic, I'll have to fight that later. Well, I'll have to go home and get another blank. My own fault.
2006-07-25T12:42:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	sorry about that
2006-07-25T12:43:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- is it easier to wipe and install with the alternate CD, or to use it to upgrade the server to Desktop?
2006-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	you mean vice versa?
2006-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- ?
2006-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	narfmaster	seanh	oh it's definitely easier to wipe and clean install
2006-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	seanh	narfmaster	- okay thanks
