2007-11-22T17:59:00.000Z	sybariten		how much a danger is a dist-upgrade on a headless machine?
2007-11-22T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	no more / less than one without
2007-11-22T18:00:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	ok...  should i bother about doing lots of backups of dotfiles?
2007-11-22T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	up to you, how important it is, how confident you are recovering etc
2008-01-16T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	looks like the permissions are wrong, I'd gues it's a failing in the install to USB process
2008-01-16T02:01:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	wonderful....  would you guess that i could correct this if booting from some other live distro and mounting the USB stick?
2008-01-16T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	I think I may have miss-understood, I thought you where booting from usb
2008-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	i am
2008-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	so why would booting from another livecd and mounting the usb stick change anything ?
2008-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	what i mean is, if theres something fcuked up with a sudo file or so, i could maybe boot up Damn Small Linux from CD, mount the Ubuntu USB stick, and correct the file.....
2008-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	I don't need to see that sort of language
2008-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	s/fcuked/screwed, sorry
2008-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	if you want help, don't use offensive language, it's totally uncalled ofr
2008-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	and you've just done it again - there is no need for it
2008-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	sudoers is one file
2008-01-16T02:04:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	ok thanks. are you a bot?
2008-01-16T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	no, not at all
2008-02-01T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	yup on it now
2008-02-01T17:15:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	OK, i guess we're not so lucky as you being from some exotic european or even scandinavian country?
2008-02-01T17:16:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	no, sorry. UK
2008-02-01T17:17:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	OK, well, i even have curses problems and that has nothing to do with countries ofcourse....  i have two servers, one old and one new, am migrating to the new. The old one has a working relationship with putty... i get swedish characters in both the normal shell and under screen, and centerICQ looks allright
2008-02-01T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	sybariten	UTF8 = hassle
2008-02-01T17:18:00.000Z	sybariten	ikonia	so i've heard....  (except from every *nix guy who praises it...) but i actually dont think i am using UTF in any steps. Putty for instance is set for ISO8859 Latin-1, in both sessions
