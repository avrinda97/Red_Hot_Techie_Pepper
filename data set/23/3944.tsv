2008-04-04T17:55:00.000Z	ndlovu	e_r_c_e	I think it works for two different computers. you would use vncserver on your computer and vncviewer on the other computer
2008-04-04T17:56:00.000Z	e_r_c_e	ndlovu	sudo apt-get install vnc-server?

2008-04-04T17:56:00.000Z	ndlovu	e_r_c_e	I think it would be sudo apt-get install vncserver
2008-04-04T17:57:00.000Z	e_r_c_e	ndlovu	i saw vnc4server????
2008-04-04T17:57:00.000Z	ndlovu	e_r_c_e	but maybe sudo apt-get install vnc does the whole lot
2008-04-04T17:57:00.000Z	ndlovu	e_r_c_e	no idea I'm afraid. I've used it a couple of times, but I'm no expert on the packages
