2011-11-15T08:02:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock		http://paste.ubuntu.com/738880/ dovecot ssl error. Can anyone help?
2011-11-15T08:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	Seems pretty straightforward.  Set ssl_cert.
2011-11-15T08:04:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	What value?
2011-11-15T08:04:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	What should I be pointing it at.
2011-11-15T08:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	The certificate.
2011-11-15T08:05:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	Which is where... I noticed that during the upgrade a number of certificates failed to generate for some reason.
2011-11-15T08:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	Upgrade of what?  It would be whereever you put it when you created it.
2011-11-15T08:07:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	Performed the in-place upgrade of 11.04 -> 11.10. During that process I saw a number of messages on the console about ssl certificates failing to generate.
2011-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	odd.  Anyway, where is the certificate you made for dovecot?
2011-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	What certificate... Before it just worked...
2011-11-15T08:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	I highly doubt that.  You would have had to make a certificate when you first set it up, unless you weren't using SSL, in which case you should turn off that option.
2011-11-15T08:10:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	OK will take a quick look in the conf file.
2011-11-15T08:10:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	Hang on there.
2011-11-15T08:16:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	http://paste.ubuntu.com/738887/ I can't see any mention of SSL in there...
2011-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	Check /etc/dovecot/conf.d/01-dovecot-postfix.conf
2011-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	http://paste.ubuntu.com/738887/ I can't see any mention of SSL in there...
2011-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	Ignore... Will do
2011-11-15T08:21:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	No such file or directory... It doesn't exist
2011-11-15T08:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	well, then check whatever other files are under /etc/dovecot/ then.
2011-11-15T08:23:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	etc/dovecot/conf.d or just etc/dovecot?
2011-11-15T08:26:00.000Z	Gareth_Lock	tonyyarusso	Thanks for the help... I've got as far as it being SSL related, just need to find out what. Will log back in here later once I've had some sleep.
2011-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gareth_Lock	all of it
