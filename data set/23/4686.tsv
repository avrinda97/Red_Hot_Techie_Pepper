2007-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	malkir		Hey, is anyone around that can give me any adice with xserver?
2007-05-30T08:28:00.000Z	malkir		When setting up xserver - I get an error saying that it failed, looking through my logs it seems to me that its not reading my PCI Express card
2007-05-30T08:29:00.000Z	malkir		i used lspci | grep PCI to find if my card was even on the list
2007-05-30T08:31:00.000Z	malkir		(WW) ATI: PCI in slot 1:0:0 could not be detected!
2007-05-30T08:31:00.000Z	malkir		(WW) ATI: PCI in slot 1:0:1 could not be detected!
2007-05-30T08:32:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	give it a couple of minutes for the network to settle down
2007-05-30T08:33:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	that's ok , go ahead now , what is the issue
2007-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	reboot with the previous kernel see if it works
2007-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	 it will be subject to netsplit as well
2007-05-30T08:41:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	reboot did nothing - same error
2007-05-30T08:41:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	 did you reboot the previous kernel ? or the new one ?
2007-05-30T08:41:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	I'm not sure how to reboot to a prev. kernel
2007-05-30T08:42:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	 you have this problem since the last kernel update ?   when you boot enter the grub menu and select the previous version of the kernel from the list provided,  should be the 3rd item down
2007-05-30T08:47:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	there was no option to select my kernel - text pops up immediately and very quickly, then the Ubuntu loading screen comes on, then shell
2007-05-30T08:48:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	 can you boot recovery mode ?
2007-05-30T08:48:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	how do I do that?
2007-05-30T08:49:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	boot thelive cd and come back here
2007-05-30T08:57:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	xserver didn't work on live cd either - it freaked out and threw words all over the screen
2007-05-30T08:58:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	have you ever had ubuntu working onthis computer ?
2007-05-30T08:58:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	I'm running an ATI Radeon x850 Platinum Edition
2007-05-30T08:58:00.000Z	Pelo	malkir	maybe one ofthe others can help you on this,  ati / nvidia cards realy harenT' my thing
2007-05-30T08:59:00.000Z	malkir	Pelo	thanks for the help :)
