2005-10-06T06:36:00.000Z	Ofe		How could I make downloads to be faster under Ubuntu? I have 56k modem but the downloadspeed for example at synaptic is something like 400-800 bytes per second.
2005-10-06T06:37:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 use the repositories that are best for you (often nearest geographic location)
2005-10-06T06:38:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	sorry, I don't understand what you mean. you mean I should download from the nearest location?
2005-10-06T06:39:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 yeah, that would most likely be the fastest
2005-10-06T06:40:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	it's always max 0.8kbps. even when downloading from finland (where I'm from) with firefox. Is there some settings I should change with the modem?
2005-10-06T06:41:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 hmm. i dunno.. so many years since i used a modem .... but if it's always 0.8 it seem to be a config error somewhere
2005-10-06T06:42:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	very possible, I'm new to linux and I have to guess most of the options. :)
2005-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 i think it works w/ cedega
2005-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 solved you speed-problmes?
2005-10-06T09:32:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	nope, still downloading stuff with synaptic. they time out when I surf the ubuntuforums at the same time, so now I only IRC and wait the downloads finish themselves.
2005-10-06T09:32:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 aouch :<
2005-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 ubuntu w/ gnome is no 'lighter' than windows xp
2005-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	well, atleast this is lighter than Mandrake on defaultsettings. It was installed at this computer (500mhz celeron with 128sdr-ram) and it kept swapping.
2005-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 well, lighter than mandrake could be, but you compared it with windows xp :)
2005-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 anyways, if you want even faster loading, less swapping etc i'd recommend you to use XFCE or icewm as windowmanagers instead of gnome
2005-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	I've got to admit that I didn't even try to install XP to this. :) I just though that XP = ~mandrake when it comes to "heavyness".
2005-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 ubuntu w/ gnome = xp in 'heaviness'
2005-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 but as i said, if you wanna quicken up stuff, use icewm or xfce
2005-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	I got 2 x 64mb of sdr more to this so there's no more swapping now. Are XFCE and icewm as easy (and this is important, this computer is going to be with my parents "alone" for half an year") and windows-like?
2005-10-07T06:43:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 i think they're easy.. but you could have trouble connecting usb devices perhaps...
2005-10-07T06:44:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 just apt-get them and try them out ;) i'd recommend xfce firsthand.. think it's more noob-friendly for you parents =)
2005-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	Ofe	kemik	uh oh. this has to have digital camera support (usb). I haven't even tried to get that working yet.
2005-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	kemik	Ofe	 that's no-pain in gnome at least.. i had to struggle abit with it in xfce, but i had done the serverinstall for that system so maybe you wont hae to tweak around at all
