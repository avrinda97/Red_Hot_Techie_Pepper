2008-09-09T22:58:00.000Z	turk		shout1: synaptic package manager
2008-09-09T22:59:00.000Z	turk		shout1: system > administration > synaptic package manager
2008-09-09T23:00:00.000Z	turk		hey guys i really need to build a local database I can issue queries to.  I have my .sql start script...what else do i need to build the database?
2008-09-09T23:00:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	do you have an sql database client/server installed?
2008-09-09T23:01:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	i am using mysql-server
2008-09-09T23:02:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	alright, get mysql-gui tools, that will give you user/database and query administration
2008-09-09T23:02:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	setup a user (if you haven't already
2008-09-09T23:03:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	ok i'll try that now
2008-09-09T23:06:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	i installed mysql-gui-common.  how do i bring up the gui?
2008-09-09T23:07:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	you're in a gui already correct? it should be in the main menu
2008-09-09T23:08:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	i can't find it under applications
2008-09-09T23:08:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	otherwise, if its not there, you can alt+f2 mysql-admin
2008-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	the other is exactly that 'mysql-query-browser.
2008-09-09T23:11:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	i tried alt+f2 mysql-admin and i got location or could not be found
2008-09-09T23:11:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	mysqladmin maybe?
2008-09-09T23:13:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	try '/usr/bin/mysql-admin' and '/usr/bin/mysql-query-browser'
2008-09-09T23:13:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	hmm..i still can't get a gui.  I can type mysql in the terminal and it brings me to mysql> prompt
2008-09-09T23:13:00.000Z	turk	gaintsura	i'll try that real quick
2008-09-09T23:14:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	ok, that will work
2008-09-09T23:14:00.000Z	gaintsura	turk	however this is going offtopic... so hang on
