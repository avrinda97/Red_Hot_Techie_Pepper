2008-11-09T10:20:00.000Z	seaoftea		Yeah, I was just wondering how safe it is for me to have no encryption over my wireless network.  I instead us mac address filters.  I know that someone could easily spoof their mac address, but how like is that really?  Also is there a way for them to scan for my mac address?
2008-11-09T10:21:00.000Z	seaoftea		crap
2008-11-09T10:22:00.000Z	seaoftea		the problem is I have so many devices, and some of them only accept certain encryption like wep, which is pointless because wep can be crack just as easy as having no encryption
2008-11-09T10:23:00.000Z	seaoftea		yeah
2008-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	seaoftea		I should probably encrypt, though I literally don't have anything to hide.  And when ever I send anything like credit card numbers I only go through 128 bit ssl.
2008-11-09T10:26:00.000Z	seaoftea		or do other illegal activities
2008-11-09T10:27:00.000Z	seaoftea		hmmm
2008-11-09T10:27:00.000Z	seaoftea		not good
2008-11-09T10:28:00.000Z	seaoftea		yeah, ok I'm definately going to encrypt
2008-11-09T10:28:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	I use wep on my wireless, then openvpn on my clients so everything is really encrypted on wireless, even if they break the wep key they won't break openvpn
2008-11-09T10:33:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	300k/sec or better usually with openvpn and wep
2008-11-09T10:35:00.000Z	seaoftea	dulak	 thats not bad, but I can pull down 800-850kb/s if I'm near the router
2008-11-09T10:36:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	I can pull that anywhere in my house if I turn openvpn off
2008-11-09T10:36:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	I'm just saying with openvpn and wep, I get 300k/sec, which isn't horrible for a fully encrypted wireless link
2008-11-09T10:37:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	it would be a lot better if I moved openvpn off my linksys router and onto an actual computer
2008-11-09T10:37:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	but my linksys router with the 16mhz cpu gives me 300k, which is fine for anything I care to encrypt
2008-11-09T10:38:00.000Z	seaoftea	dulak	 yeah but who wants a big ol box for a router
2008-11-09T10:38:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	I have a linux workstation I could put openvpn on for this, but meh, 300k is fine for hitting a bank site or whatever I need to do with full encryption
2008-11-09T10:40:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	openvpn can work on windows and mac too, I have it on my g/f mac and my roommate's windows lappy
2008-11-09T10:40:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	it's quite nifty imo
2008-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	do you have a linux workstation?  You can endpoint openvpn into any linux and just nat the tunnel interface out through the wire
2008-11-09T10:43:00.000Z	seaoftea	dulak	I'm soley a laptop guy, though I do have a qnap ts101 NAS that runs busybox.  I might be able to go through that some how.
2008-11-09T10:45:00.000Z	dulak	seaoftea	busybox probably won't have the stuff you'd need for openvpn, you need openssl and zlib libs
