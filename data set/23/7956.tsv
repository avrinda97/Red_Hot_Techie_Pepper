2005-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	plex0r		i cant get on xchat or google or gaim or nothing
2005-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	are you connected to the network?
2005-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	can you ping other computers?
2005-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	ping <ip address>
2005-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	quick thought.. maybe your dns is wrong
2005-03-16T06:11:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	then chances is that your gateway & dns are wrong
2005-03-16T06:12:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	then you can't ping. it's unsuccessful
2005-03-16T06:12:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	maybe your ip address & subnet mask are wrong?
2005-03-16T06:13:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	 go to system -> administration -> network
2005-03-16T06:14:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	(if you are using hoary) :P ... try to find something similar up there in the manu
2005-03-16T06:14:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	menu
2005-03-16T06:14:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	we all started as newbie :)
2005-03-16T06:16:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	can you ping other computers now?
2005-03-16T06:17:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	umm..... that's beyond my expertise...
2005-03-16T06:17:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	what if you type ifconfig?
2005-03-16T06:18:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	you are connected on local network to connect to internet, right? (using router or similar thing)
2005-03-16T06:19:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	type ifconfig on command line.. see if your network card & ip configuration there are correct
2005-03-16T06:20:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	umm. samba does not have to do with being able to connect to the network... it's only for the linux & windows connectivity
2005-03-16T06:21:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	but you can't even ping to other computers.. samba doesn't have to do with that.. i reckon
2005-03-16T06:24:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	hmm.... wait... not being able to ping to other computers does not necessarily mean your computer is not connected to the network.. i remember that i can't ping to my win xp computer coz it has some weird configuration that comes with it when i bought the computer
2005-03-16T06:24:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	do you have non-windows machine?
2005-03-16T06:24:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	or have you tried pinging www.yahoo.com or something like that?
2005-03-16T06:34:00.000Z	NeoCicak	plex0r	so everything is ok now?
