2008-02-14T10:02:00.000Z	mark4		oh. that sounds evein fishier lol
2008-02-14T10:03:00.000Z	mark4		and have each one on their own repository
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	mark4		and they really do need to stop making me download PPC sources for my x86 box
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	mark4		my boss has a saying.  "it is what it is"
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	mark4		and for linux sources... its git :P
2008-02-14T10:05:00.000Z	mark4		ok well i think kde is bloatware but i recently switched to using it simply so i could have compiz (you couldnt PAY me to run gnome :)
2008-02-14T10:05:00.000Z	mark4		kde is liveable even with its bloat
2008-02-14T10:06:00.000Z	mark4		i tried e17 but someone asked me to help them install compiz and i was soooo blown away i broke down and installed kde lol
2008-02-14T10:08:00.000Z	mark4		if the site hosting it still existed you could check it out. i compile over 2 megs of source code per second
2008-02-14T10:08:00.000Z	mark4		i just developed an 8051 assembler, disassembler, and SIMULATOR all in 100% PURE forth
2008-02-14T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	forth? my gosh, I haven't heard about anyone using that in ... decades!
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	my only question: can anyone else read it? rflol
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	you might hear more about it. chuck moore is developing 21 or is it 24 core cpus that are ultra low power and execute BILLIONS of opcodes per second
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	i wish the hosting site were still online, i have had numerous non asm / non forthers tell me they CAN read my code
2008-02-14T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	I'm impressed. Write once read never was coined to describe forth
2008-02-14T10:13:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	and it was coined by c coders and i have extreme difficulty wading thru 20 page switch statemetns nested to the umpteenth level with NO comments lol... c coders are some of the worst ive ever had to deal with (yes sorry... there ARE exceptions)
2008-02-14T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	I'm interested because forth was my first language. If you ever do put it up somewhere I'd like to see how much I remember
2008-02-14T10:14:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	hang on
2008-02-14T10:14:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	can you accept dcc?
2008-02-14T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	don't know, give it a try :)
2008-02-14T10:16:00.000Z	mark4	nickrud	what forth did you learn?
2008-02-14T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	figforth
2008-02-14T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	mark4	not really, I get much bigger ones at my work email, a sec I'll pm
