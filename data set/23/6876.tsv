2006-05-05T11:39:00.000Z	cius		how would I go about setting the monitor refresh rate when in gdm?
2006-05-05T11:40:00.000Z	dli	cius	I think you can set them in gnome after login, or in "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-05-05T11:41:00.000Z	cius	dli	I changed it in my screen resolution dialogue and made sure to check the "make these the default settings" box, my desktop is now fine, but gdm is still messed up
2006-05-05T11:42:00.000Z	dli	cius	gdm, okay, do that in "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	cius	dli	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg fixed my problem, thanks
2006-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	dli	cius	it's a magic command you should remember for good
2006-07-01T12:56:00.000Z	dli	cius	lcd or crt?
2006-07-01T12:56:00.000Z	cius	dli	its a laptop
2006-07-01T12:57:00.000Z	dli	cius	run gnome-display-properties to double check the resolution is correct, but still hard to imagine a shift :(
2006-07-01T12:58:00.000Z	cius	dli	its only slight, a few pixels, it does not hinder my using the OS at all really, its just slightly annoying
2006-07-01T12:59:00.000Z	dli	cius	still, is the resolution correct? VertRefresh ?
2006-07-01T12:59:00.000Z	cius	dli	that is the correct res for the panel, and the vert refresh is 60
2006-07-01T13:00:00.000Z	dli	cius	might be a hardware problem, I don't understand how can you shift on a LCD :(
2006-07-01T13:01:00.000Z	cius	dli	yea, I was afraid of that at first, but it works fine under windows... :-(
2006-07-01T13:03:00.000Z	dli	cius	anything in bios?
2006-07-01T13:04:00.000Z	cius	dli	there is an option for autoscaling of non-native resolutions in teh bios, I have that set so that if I go down in res it fills the screen.
2006-07-01T13:05:00.000Z	dli	cius	yes, but you are at the default resolution, that has no effect now
2006-07-01T13:06:00.000Z	cius	dli	yea, thats what I figured, but there are no other options for video in there, so I don't think its a bios issue
2006-07-01T13:07:00.000Z	dli	cius	try another video driver, different version, or different driver, like vesa
2006-07-01T13:07:00.000Z	cius	dli	I'll do that
2006-07-01T13:12:00.000Z	cius	dli	ah-hah!  vesa fixed it!  :-)  thanks!
2006-07-01T13:12:00.000Z	dli	cius	file a bug to xorg :(
2006-07-01T13:13:00.000Z	cius	dli	will do, its a problem with the trident driver
