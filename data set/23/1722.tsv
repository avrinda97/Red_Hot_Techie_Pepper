2009-11-14T06:52:00.000Z	Eloff		I installed nginx from src, how can I remove it and install it from aptitude?
2009-11-14T06:54:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	did you add the prefix option on configuring the nginx
2009-11-14T06:54:00.000Z	Eloff	nicle__	it was a year ago, I haven't the foggiest
2009-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	Eloff		it seems to follow the linux style of putting pieces of itself all over the place, so not confident I can just delete it
2009-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	Eloff		going to try make uninstall
2009-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	does it mean you don't have the orginal source code  ?
2009-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	Eloff		I do
2009-11-14T06:58:00.000Z	Eloff		ls
2009-11-14T06:59:00.000Z	Eloff		hmm
2009-11-14T07:02:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	if you don't have the source pakage, it's difficult to remove the compiled nginx
2009-11-14T07:03:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	just try install the nginx from repos, and it maybe overwirte the compiled version
2009-11-14T07:04:00.000Z	Eloff	nicle__	I just did that, it works, but the one from repos doesn't seem to have ssl, which is the whole reason I wanted it, :(
2009-11-14T07:05:00.000Z	Eloff		think I have to remove it and then reinstall from src with ssl enabled
2009-11-14T07:05:00.000Z	Eloff		good luck to me...
2009-11-14T07:05:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	what's the result of "apt-cache search nginx"?
2009-11-14T07:06:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	maybe the ssl has been provided in other packages
2009-11-14T07:06:00.000Z	Eloff		nope, guess not
2009-11-14T07:06:00.000Z	Eloff		still have the source here, just going to try that now
2009-11-14T07:08:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	so why don't you build the nginx from source again?
2009-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	Eloff	nicle__	building as we speak, so far, so good :)
2009-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	good :)
2009-11-14T07:11:00.000Z	Eloff	nicle__	worked! thanks for your help
2009-11-14T07:11:00.000Z	nicle__	Eloff	u r welcome :)
