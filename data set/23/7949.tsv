2005-03-22T06:00:00.000Z	cwillu		synaptic, mozilla, nautilus, to name a few
2005-03-22T06:01:00.000Z	cwillu		I'm running hoary right now, but warty had the same problem;  I've already tried reinstalling
2005-03-22T06:02:00.000Z	cwillu		and I have another (much different) machine which is running fine
2005-03-22T06:04:00.000Z	cwillu		:(
2005-03-22T06:05:00.000Z	cwillu		my turn?
2005-03-22T06:06:00.000Z	cwillu		because I could just stick with winxp if I didn't mind random application errors :p
2005-03-22T06:07:00.000Z	cwillu		sudo apt-get install MakeSynapticEtAlStopCrashing
2005-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	cwillu		On my other machine (a laptop), synaptic, mozilla, etc randomly close (one program complained of a seg fault don't know if it was related)
2005-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	cwillu		I've had this issue on warty and hoary, even after a reinstall
2005-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	cwillu		off a pressed cd or downloaded image
2005-03-22T06:09:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	possible you have bad ram/disk
2005-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	you ran memtest86?
2005-03-22T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	I'd strongly suspect bad ram unless you ran memtest86 for a day
2005-03-22T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	is the kernel oopsing?
2005-03-22T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	paste the output of dmesg to #flood
2005-03-22T06:48:00.000Z	bob2	cwillu	you pasted five lines
2005-03-22T06:52:00.000Z	cwillu	bob2	 you got that?
