2008-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	then look at orphaner
2008-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	it's curses based, if I recall.  Doesn't require X anyway, whatever it uses.
2008-02-17T08:46:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Yeah.. I just checked it out again.. it's curses based.  No X requirements, but still nice and easy to use.
2008-02-17T08:46:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	how and for what use is it about?
2008-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Once it's installed you run 'sudo orphaner' and it gives you a curses based view of what packages are orphaned.  You select which ones to remove and hit 'ok'
2008-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	is there a way to do is via ssh?
2008-02-17T08:48:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Yes.  Just ssh into the box, and do 'sudo orphaner'  (once it's installed of course) 'sudo apt-get update && apt-get install orphaner'
2008-02-17T08:49:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	I've been trying to ssh the box but it gives this error already after I messed up the box: network connection refused
2008-02-17T08:50:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Ahh.. Well then that will have to be fixed at the console of the remote computer.
2008-02-17T08:51:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	is that something that we really have to reinstall and reconfigure the ssh server?
2008-02-17T08:52:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	I don't know.. I don't know what the problem is with the server.. It may simply need to be started (perhaps it isn't set to start on boot, and the system was rebooted?)  it's hard to say what the problem could be without checking out the server
2008-02-17T08:54:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	okay..I just forget what command I used..I read it in one of the forums...as I tried reinstalling the apache2 server.. but it gives me the message that something all packages installed is being removed
2008-02-17T08:54:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	You'll have to be more specific
2008-02-17T08:58:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Is this a new install that you were just trying to configure?
2008-02-17T08:58:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Or do you have data on it?
2008-02-17T08:59:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	I have data on it.. I installed webmin already to it... but if there is a command that I could erase everything..like in a clean install..I am willing to lose everything there
2008-02-17T09:00:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	It sounds like the best option to me.. Format and reinstall.  Will be quicker than trying to sort out what was removed and what wasn't
2008-02-17T09:00:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	BUT of course that's only an option if you have a very recent backup or if you don't have any data to worry about losing
2008-02-17T09:02:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	thanks for the advice.. I am decided to do the reformat thing then.. (m sure this won't happen--just for curiosity sake) Is there a way to reinstall the ubuntu server without a cd?
2008-02-17T09:10:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Yes, if that other computer has an ftp server running on it, you could do an ftp install that way.
2008-02-17T09:11:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	FourX4Luvn	Can I use filezilla server?
2008-02-17T09:11:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Should be able to.  Shouldn't matter what the server is, so long as you configure the server to allow access to the cdrom drive.
2008-02-17T09:12:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	rhineheart_m	Then, on the computer you're installing the OS onto, select ftp install and point it to the ftp server
