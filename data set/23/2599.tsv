2009-04-06T14:45:00.000Z	vikrant		whts the release date for  ubuntu 9.X
2009-04-06T14:47:00.000Z	vikrant		is a fresh upgrade recomment over an apt-get upgrade
2009-04-06T14:47:00.000Z	vikrant		recommended*
2009-04-06T14:47:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	it depends
2009-04-06T14:48:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	and you upgrading to a new version or just upgrading packages?
2009-04-06T14:48:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	fresh install is recommended
2009-04-06T14:48:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	many people upgrade successfully though
2009-04-06T14:49:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	but this is why I push the idea of a /home partition
2009-04-06T14:50:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	they can, I would highly advise against it
2009-04-06T14:51:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	no, it can be chainloaded to an extended partition
2009-04-06T14:51:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	it saves some hassle
2009-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	you only need 1 boot partition
2009-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	for as many linux distros as you want
2009-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	that something that it is very recommended to share....
2009-04-06T14:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	it wouldn't break the kernels
2009-04-06T14:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	it may incorrectly write your menu.lst though
2009-04-06T15:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	vikrant	don't know, everyone should have backups anyways
