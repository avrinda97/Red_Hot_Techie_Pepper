2007-12-10T10:30:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	device is busy    either there is something still accessing it.   or...    something is still accessing it...

2007-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	is there files in it ?
2007-12-10T10:38:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	in the first place rmdir is not the app of choice for dirs with files     rm -r   is   in the second place if something is mounted on a dir then you can't rm the dir
2007-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	heh kewl !    :)
2007-12-10T10:43:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	why did you reverse the list ?      not that it matters...

2007-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	j2daosh	intelikey	the '-'s are in the filenames
2007-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	yes and   -- should make rm ignore them
2007-12-10T10:46:00.000Z	intelikey	j2daosh	the one that will soon ban you from the channel.  not that you really want to know.
