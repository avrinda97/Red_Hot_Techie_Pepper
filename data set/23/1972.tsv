2009-08-14T08:44:00.000Z	ethicx		I have 3 NIC cards how do I find out which one is eth1 or eth2 etc etc??
2009-08-14T08:45:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	If they are different peices of harware, just run ifconfig
2009-08-14T08:46:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	It tells you info on each of your cards
2009-08-14T08:46:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	yes they are, but they have static ip's
2009-08-14T08:47:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	and it wasn't me who set them up so I need a way of telling which one is which..
2009-08-14T08:48:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Do you only need to know which one is active?
2009-08-14T08:49:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	no, I need to know which one belongs to the ip given inside /etc/network/interfaces
2009-08-14T08:49:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Run ifconfig. It lists what the IP
2009-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	I know! but my question is how can I find out what eth1 is on the back of the server!
2009-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Oh! You mean which one is which physically!
2009-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	yes sir, sorry if I was misleading.
2009-08-14T08:53:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Well, assuming only one is plugged into a network, the one with the IP is the one plugged in in the case.
2009-08-14T08:54:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	I imagine there's a way to find out which PCI slot each one is in. I don't know it off hand, so I'll try looking around.
2009-08-14T08:54:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	yeah that's more less what I wanted. I'm looking around too...
2009-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	I found lspci, but that seems hard to decipher at a glace.
2009-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	yup you are on the right track cause someone else suggested that too
2009-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	i'll just have to decipher it somehow =D
2009-08-14T08:59:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	It doesn't list which PCIe slot my network card is in for me. If it's the same for you, it's useless.
2009-08-14T09:00:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	If you want to do it in less elegant manner, just pull them all out one at a time.
2009-08-14T09:01:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	yup, that's what I'm doing now. Thanks guys.
2009-08-14T09:02:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Too bad it came to that. Oh well.
2009-08-14T09:07:00.000Z	ethicx	mardoct	some things don't come as easy as other don't they!? =D
2009-08-14T09:08:00.000Z	mardoct	ethicx	Unfortunatly
