2005-10-03T14:23:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm reading good things in general, but I hadn't found that one.
2005-10-03T14:25:00.000Z	Hfuy		When we close the lid on this Toshiba laptop, it doesn't even try to suspend.
2005-10-03T14:25:00.000Z	Hfuy		Instead, when we open it back up, it asks for a password.
2005-10-03T14:25:00.000Z	Hfuy		Can anyone shed light on why this might be?
2005-10-03T14:27:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	because the Toshiba kernel module doensnt load with all Toshiba laptops
2005-10-03T14:27:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	i have the same problem
2005-10-03T14:28:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	i think it is fixable, if you want to mess with the code in the kernel module
2005-10-03T14:28:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	Shriek!
2005-10-03T14:30:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	well mine does nothing, but in windows it goes in standby mode
2005-10-03T14:30:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	That's what I'd expect.
2005-10-03T14:31:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	try to modprobe something like toshiba-acpi
2005-10-03T14:31:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	What would that do
2005-10-03T14:32:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	with fnfx it an app especially for toshiba hardware
2005-10-03T14:33:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	fnfx?
2005-10-03T14:33:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	you have to get it
2005-10-03T14:33:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	OK, how?
2005-10-03T14:34:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	sudo apt-get install fnfxd
2005-10-03T14:35:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	its a daemon running in the background
2005-10-03T14:35:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	yeah it should do that
2005-10-03T14:38:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	"modprobe toshiba-acpi" responds with "fatal error: could not open /proc/acpi/toshiba/keys"
2005-10-03T14:42:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	Big scary error I don't understand when modprobeing toshiba-acpi
2005-10-03T14:42:00.000Z	dpro\	Hfuy	yeah i know, the same thing here, that is because it doesnt work with all Toshiba laptops
2005-10-03T14:43:00.000Z	Hfuy	dpro\	So what's happened here, just to be clear, is that we've tried to insert a special toshiba kernel module for ACPI, and it's failed for some reason
