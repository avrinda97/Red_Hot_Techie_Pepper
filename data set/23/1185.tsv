2010-10-06T16:11:00.000Z	dogmatic69		hi all
2010-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	dogmatic69		i was just about to dl 10.04 x64 but it says "Not recommended for daily desktop usage"
2010-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	dogmatic69		why is that?
2010-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	dogmatic69		im running 8gigs ram and intel core 2 quad Q6800 iirc
2010-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	Flash doesn't work very well in x64, as well as some other pieces of proprietary software
2010-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	ill be using it mainly as a server for web dev, + dual boot windows for games
2010-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	If it's just a server, there is not a huge deal either way.
2010-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	i dont dev flash anyhow :P
2010-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	there used to be a 4GB limit on RAM with 32-bit operating systems, but PAE subverts it
2010-10-06T16:16:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	PAE allows you to use all of it. It's some kind of special memory addressing system, I don't know the specifics, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension would be where to look
2010-10-09T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	for file in ./*.zip; unzip $file; done
2010-10-09T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	something to that effect
2010-10-09T22:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	sorry, should be for file in ./*.zip; do unzip $file; done
2010-10-09T22:39:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	thanks ill try that
2010-10-09T22:41:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	get "unexpected token done" with that
2010-10-09T22:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	that command i gave might not be entirely valid
2010-10-09T22:43:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	:(
2010-10-09T22:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	depending on whether the files have spaces in the names
2010-10-09T22:43:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	nope
2010-10-09T22:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	also it assumes that you are inside the directory with the files, and that they are zipped using zip, and that you have the program unzip installed
2010-10-09T22:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	if they're gzipped instead, you'd replace the .zip with .gz and the unzip with gunzip
2010-10-09T22:44:00.000Z	dogmatic69	tensorpudding	ye they are *.gz
2010-10-09T22:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dogmatic69	zip and gzip are two different formats
