2011-08-17T08:24:00.000Z	mASOUD_42		hi, http://paste.ubuntu.com/667839/   this is a scrip using "zenity" to show a GUI message. it works when invoked form a terminal but when crontab calls it, it doesn't work.what's wrong?here's the crontab line i use http://paste.ubuntu.com/667844/
2011-08-17T08:26:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	you dont have the full path to the script.. and are you running it as your user (the cron). and does it have $DISPLAY set?
2011-08-17T08:27:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	i placed the script in ~/bin . yea i run as user like i type crontab -e for editing it. dont know about $display
2011-08-17T08:28:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	but ~/bin isnt in the $PATH
2011-08-17T08:28:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	you could add to the $PATH in your script.. or just use the full path in the crontab
2011-08-17T08:29:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	i can run it only by typing its name. does it mean its in $PATH?
2011-08-17T08:30:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	ah ok.. well I would look at $DISPLAY while running in cron
2011-08-17T08:31:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	ok ty. I'm gonna google the $DISPLAY
2011-08-17T08:31:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	you can "echo $DISPLAY" in a terminal.. then get your script to write it out to a file to compare
2011-08-17T08:34:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	in your script so as escott said
2011-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	escott , ok,let me try it
2011-08-17T08:50:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	I dont think that one is so important as it's running as your user
2011-08-17T08:55:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	I would start with "export DISPLAY=:0" in yur script and using full paths when calling your script
2011-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	my try worked
2011-08-17T09:12:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	escott , i changed the script to this http://paste.ubuntu.com/667922/        also i changed the cron tab to absolute path but it didn't work
2011-08-17T09:15:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	this worked for me but I have a ~/.Xauthority

2011-08-17T09:19:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	not sure on that.. I dont use gdm
2011-08-17T09:20:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	probably in you r gdm.conf
2011-08-17T09:21:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	UserAuthDir=
2011-08-17T09:21:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	The directory where user's .Xauthority file should be saved. When nothing is specfied the user's home directory is used.
2011-08-17T09:25:00.000Z	mASOUD_42	SIFTU	where is the gdm.conf ?
2011-08-17T09:29:00.000Z	SIFTU	mASOUD_42	try in /etc/gdm or something
