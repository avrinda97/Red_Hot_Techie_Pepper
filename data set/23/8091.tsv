2005-02-27T08:08:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	why are you asking on #ubuntu? read some kernel books and goto #linux-kernel
2005-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	because my first question was "how much ram I need to make my swap clean"
2005-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	and because I ask in "ubuntu desktop" context
2005-02-27T08:11:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	a gig
2005-02-27T08:11:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	_minimum_
2005-02-27T08:12:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	512
2005-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	my system is up for about 10 days
2005-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	just get 512
2005-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	it's not for me - 256 should be enough
2005-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	256 is barely enough
2005-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	after browsing with firefox for a while, they'll be swapping hard
2005-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	I got 768 on my system and it works really nice
2005-02-27T08:17:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	what is SPE and evince?
2005-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	I think that this SPE is broken or something
2005-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	even Eclipse doesn't use that much ram
2005-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	-/+ buffers/cache:     243720     402420
2005-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	SPE is using only 63.3 meg. now that's not bad at all for a pretty feature-filled python IDE
2005-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	with amule, xchat, gnome-system-monitor, firefox and eclipse
2005-02-27T08:22:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	some applets, and firestarter and apache2
2005-02-27T08:22:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	there is something wrong with your system - maybe wrong/broken kernel?
2005-02-27T08:23:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	my gnome-panel 29MB
2005-02-27T08:23:00.000Z	fsc	marcin_ant	just stock warty kernel. there is nothing wrong with my system. gnome and company is greedy
2005-02-27T08:24:00.000Z	marcin_ant	fsc	are you sure that you got kernel optimized for your cpu?
