2008-03-05T01:28:00.000Z	zer0bit		Please understand that I am an utter newbie in the field of linux, so rather than disturbing the whole channel with totally newbie Qs, can someone please pm me?
2008-03-05T01:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	just ask in the channel
2008-03-05T01:29:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	sir, firstly, is it a good idea to change over to linux from windows =/
2008-03-05T01:30:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	unless you do a lot of gaming or multimedia editing, linux is usually better.
2008-03-05T01:31:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	.. I usually just browse the web, and I am into lot of authering on web etc but not into grafix and multimedia, though I do download a lot of data from torrent networks and emule networks
2008-03-05T01:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	that's pretty much what I do
2008-03-05T01:33:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	so linux supports torrents ?
2008-03-05T01:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	yes
2008-03-05T01:33:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	and emule network ?
2008-03-05T01:34:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	now, i got stumped at the ubuntu website .. 4 versions are there.. as a newbie, how do i decide which one i want ? there is no comparison chart of each version there
2008-03-05T01:35:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	which editions are there?
2008-03-05T01:36:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	ubuntu, xuubntu, kubuntu, and edubuntu?
2008-03-05T01:36:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	ku, edu, xu, go  .. all suffixed ubuntu sir  ( i still say some one please pm me, i am too new for linux and would not want to distrub serious channel of geeks with my n00b Qs )
2008-03-05T01:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	regular ubuntu is probably best
2008-03-05T01:37:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	.. i know that u would say ubuntu .. i would like to know WHY .. or whats the difference between them .. that has not been given on the website ( very first ditterant to a windows user trying to convert to linux )
2008-03-05T01:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	it's the main one of those four, it's the most used, most of the work is done to it, and its GUI is easy to use
2008-03-05T01:39:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	, my geek friend said there is a type of linux called "KNOPPIX" which doesnt install on hard drive but runs through CD when bios option is 'boot from CD' .. is there a ubuntu version like that ?
2008-03-05T01:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	the main ubuntu CDs can do that
2008-03-05T01:41:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	.. ok, how do i decide which are "main ubuntu CDs"  .. ( Frankly, all this info should be there on the website but it is not )
2008-03-05T01:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	zer0bit	the ubuntu desktop CDs that aren't alternates
2008-03-05T02:24:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	.. i am frustrated but i still want to give linux a try .. can u guide me to a good linux guide ? google turns up way too much of stuff
2008-03-05T02:25:00.000Z	zer0bit	Starnestommy	take into account that i am a very pro-windows user trying to convert to linux .. and send me to some site accordingly .. thank you
