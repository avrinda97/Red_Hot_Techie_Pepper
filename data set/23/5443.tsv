2009-03-17T04:27:00.000Z	Frijolie		does LAMP stand for Linux Apache MySQL and Python?
2009-03-17T04:28:00.000Z	Frijolie		huh?
2009-03-17T04:29:00.000Z	Frijolie		I've heard that PHP was inferior to Python
2009-03-17T04:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	ha ha,  hardly anyone programs  back ends of sites in Python
2009-03-17T04:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	Python is a good first programming language
2009-03-17T04:30:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	then move on to, C#?
2009-03-17T04:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	I don't program anything yet, but know stuff,  and  have attempted learning Python and PHP before
2009-04-05T09:13:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	I did
2009-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	ok I missed it, nevermind tehn
2009-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	you seem to be a guru, can you help me with permissions problems?
2009-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	problems/strategies
2009-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	I know what they are and how they can be manipulated but I need some help from a sys admin point-of-view
2009-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	what are you trying to do?
2009-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	per se
2009-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	ok, I've recently set up an ftp server which is allowing connections via a user account 'userftp'
2009-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	userftp's primary group is userftp
2009-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	ok  I haven't done my own ftpserver before,  anyway  I guess your issue isn't really distro specific and so you can try this general  channel #linux
2009-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	uh, ok I guess that's right...
2009-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	plus people there will probably know what to do with Ubuntu anyway
2009-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	:( alright
2009-04-05T09:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Frijolie	or wait here,  or look at say http://www.ubuntuforums.org and you can Google
2009-04-05T09:18:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	all of the above already done
2009-04-05T09:36:00.000Z	Frijolie	sebsebseb	any idea on that one?
