2006-12-28T14:30:00.000Z	genius314		I have a Wacom tablet, and when I scroll, the window scrolls the wrong direction.
2006-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	Turn it upside down :0
2006-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Hahahahaha... no.
2006-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	 Sorry couldn't resist
2006-12-28T14:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	do you have wacom-tools installed?  My install was effortless.  Worked after making changes to xorg
2006-12-28T14:33:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Yeah, I installed it. But afterwards, the scroll was reversed
2006-12-28T14:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	is it that way everywhere in the system or just in Gimp or something else?
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Everywhere. Even media players turn the volume up when i scroll down and down when I scroll up.
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	did you uncomment out the line in xorg dealing with "ForceDevice" - Table PC Only?  Mine didn't work right until I did that.
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	No, I got rid of those lines completely.
2006-12-28T14:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	put them back in.  You might want to sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg to get it done automatically.
2006-12-28T14:39:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Well I have a backup copy. I'll just copy them from there.
2006-12-28T14:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	Try that, uncomment out those lines in the three Wacom sections then CTRL/ALT/Backspace to restart X then let me know what happened.
2006-12-28T14:41:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	What does Ctrl-Alt-Backspace do, exactly? I know it restarts X, but it doesn't seem to do anything when I do it.
2006-12-28T14:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	 It mearly restarts the X server which is your graphical display.  It doesn't restart the whole machine.  Not quite like CTRL-ALT-Delete
2006-12-28T14:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	 Does it work now?
2006-12-28T14:48:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Nope. Oh, and I found out why Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace wasn't working - it was the wrong Ctrl and Alt.
2006-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	 accept the invite and we'll be able to share the xorg config files.
2006-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	I don't think I can... I'm using Gaim.
2006-12-28T14:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	 ok.. xchat has that feature..  Do you know the address to Pastebin?
2006-12-28T14:52:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Yeah.
2006-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	genius314	if I have the address I'll post me wacom section there so you can compair it to yours.  I'm running Dapper LTS
2006-12-28T15:23:00.000Z	genius314	Scunizi	Still there?
