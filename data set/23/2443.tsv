2009-04-09T13:25:00.000Z	swayed		Will it be possible to do an Internet upgrade from Hardy (skip Intrepid) to Jaunty after Final release of Jaunty ? ?
2009-04-09T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	you will have to upgrade to intrepid first afaik
2009-04-09T13:27:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Thanks - Was afraid of that being the case - kinda figured that but wanted to make sure.
2009-04-09T13:28:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Probably just start over with a new bigger Hard Drive anyways - be best in long run.......
2009-04-16T12:50:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2009-04-16T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	the desktop iso has the option for custom partitioning
2009-04-16T12:55:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	On last 2 installs have just did the easy no brainner installs
2009-04-16T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	then pick manual when it comes to disk partitioning
2009-04-16T12:56:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Ok - but not sure how big to make swap, ext4, etc etc.
2009-04-16T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	ext4 is not advised right now, i would make your swap double the size of your ram
2009-04-16T12:57:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Running 4gigs - that would be quite the swap wouldn't it?
2009-04-16T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	do you anticipate using 4Gb of ram in your ubuntu system?
2009-04-16T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	what is the ubuntu boot going to be doing?
2009-04-16T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	if its standard web browsing and chat then you can get way with a very small or no swap, for system intensive stuff having a larger swap will help
2009-04-16T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	there is no black and white answer
2009-04-16T13:00:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	Mostly downloading movies, files, burning CD's - I do like to use it for everything - listening to sounds - surf'n the web etc etc you name it. Burn some DVD's too.....
2009-04-16T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	1Gb will do yu fine then
2009-04-16T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	you wont hit 4gb ever but its nice to have a little one, set your swappiness to 1 or 2 and you'll be fine
2009-04-16T13:01:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	cool - Not sure how my last "no brainner" install did it but ended up using 9gigs for my swap - way way to much....
2009-04-16T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	yep, 2 x ram
2009-04-16T13:02:00.000Z	swayed	ActionParsnip	But that sounds way over kill correct?
2009-04-16T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	depends, if you are performing full 3d rendering then i'd have that much swap, it just covers all areas if it goes OTT
2009-04-16T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swayed	remember, ubuntu is trying to be a 1 glove fits all
