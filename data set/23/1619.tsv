2010-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	What can we help you with?
2010-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	You may need to set boot options on your PC... but it is hard for us to tell why you are unable to boot to the install disk...
2010-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	That is the problem you are having, right?
2010-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	If you have a question, please ask it.
2010-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	We will do our best to answer.
2010-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	Here is how it works.  You ask questions.  We try our best to give you answers.
2010-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	JMONEY	usr13	I did
2010-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	Are you having trouble booting to the install CD?  (I do not know what you are asking)
2010-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	So you boot the computer with the Ubuntu install CD in the CDROM?  Right?  Tell us what you see on the screen  first?  And what ISO is it you have burnned to the CD?
2010-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	JMONEY	usr13	It boots the cd I get to the BOOT menu with the options to install, try, etc.. I hit install and get the message
2010-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	I'd say there is a problem with the CD or the CDROM.
2010-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	JMONEY	usr13	I even tried to install from USB stick, Hard Dick
2010-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	usr13	JMONEY	What is your hardware?  (What type of PC are you booting?)
2010-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	JMONEY	usr13	dell demesion 3000
