2006-10-06T14:09:00.000Z	anon32		stupid question: I have a 65GB ext3 partition. How come it only has 25GB free even though the total off all the contents is only 35.7GB?
2006-10-06T14:11:00.000Z	anon32		it says size 64G, used 36G, free 25G - somehow that doesn't add up
2006-10-06T14:13:00.000Z	anon32		no, my problem is that there's 3GB of unaccounted for data
2006-10-06T14:13:00.000Z	anon32		64-36!=25
