2008-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	wow you are really helpful, ty
2008-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	i do what i can.
2008-08-13T02:56:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	How do i FIX flash, not install it
2008-08-13T02:57:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	oh, sorry, you didn't mention how it was broken.. how is it broken?
2008-08-13T02:58:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	i'm unsure how its broken, but it is now for some reason, i logged in, and nothing flash related works
2008-08-13T02:59:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	yes, well 'nothing flash related works' can be defined in many ways. is it even trying to show anything or is it actually providing some sort of error?
2008-08-13T03:00:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	 i keep getting this error in firefox when trying to upload to Photobucket:  invalid function name:SelectFiles;  I use the SUN JRE, if that matters
2008-08-13T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	SUN makes JAVA, Adobe makes Flash.
2008-08-13T03:02:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	i know, i thought that might help tho, it may be java or flash that is having issues
2008-08-13T03:02:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	then you need to figure out which one is really the issue - try running firefox from the terminal so you can see any errors that it might be producing
2008-08-13T03:03:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	how do i do that?
2008-08-13T03:03:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	1) quit FF. 2) start a terminal. 3) type firefox and press enter in the terminal.

2008-08-13T03:10:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	let me guess: you're running 64-bit ubuntu?
2008-08-13T03:10:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	yes i am
2008-08-13T03:10:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	it also returned a widget error
2008-08-13T03:11:00.000Z	Gnea	BigBuddha	okay, sounds like you need a decent 32-bit compatibility layer
2008-08-13T03:12:00.000Z	BigBuddha	Gnea	ok, sounds simple enough
