2005-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Does anyone have USB flash drives working in Breezy?
2005-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Guys - Breezy + Flash Drives? Anyone using one?
2005-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	nope
2005-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Oh, great. :p
2005-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	mustard5		!anyone
2005-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Question: how do I change the owner of a device?
2005-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	is it a device in your fstab?
2005-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro	mustard5	yup
2005-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro	mustard5	- actually, it just randomly vanished from my dev list. I'm going to reboot it so hotplug restarts and redetects it...hopefully.
2005-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		actually wait...1 sec.
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		SCORE
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		fixed it
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	I wonder whether you could use suid or uid to set it...I don't really totally understand them
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	you worked it out?
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	well done :D
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro	mustard5	yeah, I just changed the ownership of the damn device.
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro	mustard5	it's messy, but hey - it worked.
2005-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	mustard5		:)
2005-11-02T09:36:00.000Z	mustard5		whatever works ;)
2005-11-02T09:36:00.000Z	mustard5		without breakin' stuff :P
2005-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro	mustard5	- yeah, well, next steps are video card drivers (stupid ATI) and Windows network integration, and WINE. That should be interesting. ;)
2005-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	mustard5	Aron_Figaro	I hate wine. NOthing but grief trying to make it work
