2006-12-12T12:24:00.000Z	yoshig3		Well Pie
2006-12-12T12:24:00.000Z	yoshig3		I got a GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCI for $50
2006-12-12T12:24:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	you could get a geforce 6800 for that much easy now
2006-12-12T12:24:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	but all I have is PCI T.T
2006-12-12T12:25:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	and a walmart lol
2006-12-13T15:06:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	Well, windows actually works most of the time....
2006-12-13T15:07:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	exactly, why shouldn't ubuntu just work? and why is it "wrong" to expect it to just work?
2006-12-13T15:08:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	it's not, and it should work. They shouldn't have released it claiming it works if it doesn't. I don't consider ubuntu stable, but it is definately much much cooler than windows.
2006-12-13T15:11:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	Although if I can't get my graphics working I'm definately switching back, no questions asked.
2006-12-13T15:13:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	yeah that's all nice but ubuntu just plain doesn't work correctly for me, I have installed just about every driver possible for my card and it will still not work right.
2006-12-13T15:21:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	what graphics card do you have?
2006-12-13T15:21:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	nvidia drivers perform perfectly for me, just as good as they did on windows
2006-12-13T15:23:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	I've tried every driver for nVidia cards possible, besides 9631
2006-12-13T15:26:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	imagining someone asking for help with windows has always made me part queasy, part "LMAO", and part homicidal
2006-12-13T15:26:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	lol
2006-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	have you considered upgrading your GPU? geforce 4 is pretty old
2006-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	a geforce 6600 would be fairly cheap and would work perfectly, i'm sure
2006-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	I only have PCI lol
2006-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	well no wonder.
2006-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	Yes I know I shouldn't expect much out of the card but it did better in windows than it is in ubuntu, that's why I've been trying to get it fixed for the past 3 days.
2006-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	Pie-rate	yoshig3	stick around for a while, i'm doing some research
2006-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	I tried but I can't find ANYONE with the same problems as me
2006-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	yoshig3	Pie-rate	I've even found people with my same card that aren't experiencing the problems
