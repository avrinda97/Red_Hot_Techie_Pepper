2007-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		this really sucks ass
2007-05-25T07:23:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	what's the matter
2007-05-25T07:25:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	I had ubuntu 6.06.1 installed as a lamp server.  no gui, then I decide for some dumb ass reason to upgrade to 6.1 edgy, and after I ran the apt-get update, and the apt-get upgrade, everything seemed to pull down and install, although I didn't get a "upgrade complete, reboot now" message, it just left me at the prompt.  so I rebooted, and now I can't connect to the network... My ethernet card is stuck with t
2007-05-25T07:25:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	does dmesg recognize your eth0?
2007-05-25T07:26:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	I don't know.  how do I check it to find it that line?   I get a red FAIL message now when it reboots but it goes by so fast, that I can't wwrite it down.  and I don't know what I"m looking for in dmesg
2007-05-25T07:27:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	open a terminal.
2007-05-25T07:27:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	 I only have a terminal.  it has no gui on it
2007-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	ok hang on
2007-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	I typed that and it just went back to the prompt.  was it supposed to return something?
2007-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	.. yes. Apparently your kernel doesn't see your ethernet controller.
2007-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	you probably SHOULD boot off the livecd
2007-05-25T07:30:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	well that sort of sucks.  but check this out.... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22368/...
2007-05-25T07:32:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	 where do I get a livecd?
2007-05-25T07:32:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	download.ubuntu.com
2007-05-25T07:33:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	 will the cd have some way of upgrading it to version 7 and maybe fixing this, or would that make matter worse?
2007-05-25T07:33:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	i'm not honestly sure :\
2007-05-25T07:37:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	I can't see how to download a liveCD of ubuntu....
2007-05-25T07:38:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download  I'm looking here, and I don't see it
2007-05-25T07:38:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	you want the 'desktop' cd
2007-05-25T07:39:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	why are the older versions supported longer than the newer ones????  the 7.04 says it's supported to 2008, while the 6.06 says 2009...what's up?
2007-05-25T07:39:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Clarrisa_2008	blame the ubuntu highers-up
2007-05-25T07:44:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	hyperactivecrond	is there a way I can back out the update????  or am I just screwed here?   I'm not sure what loading the live cd is going to do for me if I can't boot up normally
