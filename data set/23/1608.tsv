2010-01-20T03:55:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	running it in wine any good?
2010-01-20T03:56:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	dunno.. however Jagged alliance 2 was released for linux
2010-01-20T03:56:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	hmm
2010-01-20T03:57:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/RTS/Jagged-Alliance-2-Stracciatella-24306.shtml
2010-01-20T03:57:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	 yep..  i found that :) .. its only 1 or 2 megs ...  no data.. i think
2010-01-20T03:58:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	odd...
2010-01-20T03:59:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	i though there was a special server/site.. for linux games.. :S
2010-01-20T03:59:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	I believe you need to purchase the game, and use the data files from the windows version into the linux version...
2010-01-20T04:00:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	ok.. however i bought it already
2010-01-20T04:00:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	then use that link, combined with the data files in your bought copy and together, they can play the game ;D
2010-01-20T04:01:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	so the stracialtela is to USe... the Data files ? from the CD ? .. like.. if it will adapt the game data file into linux ?
2010-01-20T04:02:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	no idea, look for a tutorial on making it work from linux, but yes, thats what i understand, although it may be from an already installed one
2010-01-20T04:02:00.000Z	_dreamy	kyle6513	 ok ty for helping
2010-01-20T04:03:00.000Z	kyle6513	_dreamy	no problems
