2010-03-27T02:35:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 when did it start happening, anything new installed?    what was the last major thing you recall  you did?
2010-03-27T02:35:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	it all started when i updated my system
2010-03-27T02:36:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 from   9.04 to 9.1?
2010-03-27T02:37:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	no updated 9.10 through update manager
2010-03-27T02:37:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	i can't remember all the packages , there was about 100 MB
2010-03-27T02:38:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 it updated from... 9.1 to 9.1?
2010-03-27T02:39:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	i didn't upgrade the system , only updated it ,installed latest packages
2010-03-27T02:40:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 heh, as suggested, ohh no you're driving a 1999 car, you must update to 2010, anything wrong it? no really is running fine, but you must update, for.... X reason heh
2010-03-27T02:41:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 if it ain't broken don't fix it :P, but anyhow, you may want to try a dpkg-reconfigure on the gnome GDM and the window manager
2010-03-27T02:42:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	so how do i do that ?
2010-03-27T02:42:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	just the command dpkg-reconfigure?
2010-03-27T02:43:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 well,   sudo dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGENAME;
2010-03-27T02:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 not sure on gnome's GDM package name or the window manager though, you may want to check for it under -> apt-cache pkgnames
2010-03-27T02:44:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	ok , thanks
2010-03-27T02:45:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	 or check in -> dpkg -l
2010-03-27T02:51:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	: well i did manage to find gdm , i am not sure about the windows manager ,I tried dpkg -l | grep windows and got http://pastebin.com/aKQTqXmk which one shoudl i  select??
2010-03-27T02:52:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	   you can try -> dpkg -l | grep -i manager
2010-03-27T02:54:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	http://pastebin.com/a8UQauac
2010-03-27T03:00:00.000Z	Typos_King	pranay_09	  I'd think they're gdm and gnome-session packages
2010-03-27T03:01:00.000Z	pranay_09	Typos_King	ok i'll try to reconfigure those
