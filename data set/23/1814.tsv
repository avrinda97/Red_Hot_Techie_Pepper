2009-10-20T02:52:00.000Z	n8tuser		embrik->  they can have mix, but you have to know what youare doing.. anyhow, what is the result of  route -n for your dhcp client ?
2009-10-20T02:53:00.000Z	n8tuser		rodriLD-> look at its gateway,  see   route -n
2009-10-20T02:54:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	what about route -n?
2009-10-20T02:54:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	windows firewall is disabled
2009-10-20T02:55:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	the windows box's IP doesn't appear in route -n, if that's what you mean
2009-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	same on windows, the ubuntu pc's ip doesn't appear
2009-10-20T03:06:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/297167
2009-10-20T03:09:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	they are both connected to a router but I assigned the static IPs myself (windows box = 192.168.0.133, ubuntu = 192.168.0.144)
2009-10-20T03:10:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	here it is: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/297171/
2009-10-20T03:14:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	wow, huge fail on my behalf, forgot to assign static IP for the windows box after formatting...I assigned it and now it works
2009-10-20T03:14:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	thanks for the help dude
2009-10-20T03:16:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	I guess the problem wasn't that simple...i can ping now, but no luck setting up the windows shares in ubuntu
2009-10-20T03:18:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	i've already tried the connect to server dialog from ubuntu as well as trying to access the workgroup from nautilus directly, no luck with both
2009-10-20T03:21:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	i recall having used windows shares from ubuntu before (not from this netbook) with no problem, could it be by any chance an smb.conf problem?
2009-10-20T03:22:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	i've tried sharing my home folder both manually from smb.conf as well as the share folder dialog in nautilus, and both ways were recognized by windows
2009-10-20T03:23:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	well, yes :D but I can't access any windows shares from ubuntu
2009-10-20T03:25:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	well, i wouldn't know where to start, honestly
2009-10-20T03:26:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	all the tutorials i've seen assume that if you can ping a windows box you can share files with it, which is not my case. guess i'll have to look harder
2009-10-20T03:37:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	well, still no luck...if it helps, I can't even see windows from findsmb
2009-10-20T03:43:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	actually, yes... I'm going through this thread right now, which seems to have pretty much the same problem as I: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1082148
2009-10-20T03:44:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	I found out that if I just type in smb://192.168.0.133 in nautilus I can see the windows shares perfectly...
2009-10-20T03:45:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	but still no luck from the network "folder" in nautilus
2009-10-20T03:46:00.000Z	rodriLD	n8tuser	hehe, it's going to places -> network
