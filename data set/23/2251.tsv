2010-03-19T00:26:00.000Z	mintux		how to get list of my hard drives I have 3 HDD but one hdd doesn't has any partitions but in fdisk -l doesn't show it
2010-03-19T00:27:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	"sudo lshw". That'll list all hardware connected to the motherboard
2010-03-19T00:29:00.000Z	mintux		Flare183:I found it what does it mean ? > *-disk UNCLAIMED  description: ATA Disk   product: Maxtor 6V160E0
2010-03-19T00:29:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	That's the HD's
2010-03-19T00:30:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	*-disk UNCLAIMED  ?  can add partition on this HDD ?
2010-03-19T00:30:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	You should be able too, that is if its not already filled up with them.
2010-03-19T00:31:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	means I should have /dev/sd* ? for it ? I can not see in fdisk or cfdisk
2010-03-19T00:31:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	Yes you should have a /dev/sd*
2010-03-19T00:31:00.000Z	mintux		 Flare183: wow . I open gparted and this hard doesn't show in this app
2010-03-19T00:32:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	ok, run dmesg, and look for it
2010-03-19T00:33:00.000Z	mintux		Flare183:it's my output http://codepad.org/oOMsy8iY
2010-03-19T00:33:00.000Z	mintux		I think its sdc
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	Your third HD is failing
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	It needs to be replaced or something.
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	when I connected this hard while boot I've got a lot of ata3.00: status: { DRDY ERR } [ 1245.737332] ata3.00: error: { UNC }
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	means I can't use it ? and it damaged ?
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	That's the kernel telling you that the HD is dying/die.
2010-03-19T00:34:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	Yes, exactly.
2010-03-19T00:35:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	can I low format my HDD
2010-03-19T00:35:00.000Z	mintux		?
2010-03-19T00:35:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	I don't know about that, but you can try.
2010-03-19T00:35:00.000Z	mintux	Flare183	low level format
2010-03-19T00:35:00.000Z	Flare183	mintux	I don't know how to do that in Linux either.
