2009-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	yeah nopaste the dmesg output
2009-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	thanks!
2009-01-11T11:04:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	dmesg http://www.nopaste.com/p/acEJa9OHT
2009-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	I have a lot of these error -71 I think that is the device
2009-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	maybe its a problem with the usb controler or its driver(s), do other thumbdrives work?
2009-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	or external usb disks or something
2009-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	yes a usb drive works,
2009-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	the only driver for windows is unsigned
2009-01-11T11:14:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	i had a similar problem on one my laptops and solved it by removing the usb 2.0 driver using modprobe -r ehci_hcd, when it pluged it back in it worked
2009-01-11T11:15:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	what do you mean by plugged in back in? physically or did you reboot?
2009-01-11T11:15:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	i just pluged the thumbdrive back in after running that command
2009-01-11T11:16:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	oh got ya, is ehci_hcd specific for your needs or should I run that command as well ?
2009-01-11T11:17:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	its the usb 2.0 driver module
2009-01-11T11:17:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	thanks I'm still a newbie to linux
2009-01-11T11:19:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	thank you so much!!
2009-01-11T11:19:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	does that work?
2009-01-11T11:20:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	yeah, it poped up immedatly I minimized it trying to see if it worked or not took me a few seconds to realise
2009-01-11T11:21:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	did it load that module again? if not it will be running usb 1.1 now but still that would be better than not working at all
2009-01-11T11:22:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	does lsmod|grep ehci_hcd gives anything back?
2009-01-11T11:23:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	no nothing is returned,, which means it's a usb 1.1 .. right?
2009-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	mgolisch	user1_	yeah
2009-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	user1_	mgolisch	thanks a lot!
