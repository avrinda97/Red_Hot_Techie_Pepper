2010-04-27T02:19:00.000Z	jeromel		ok so it does not work
2010-04-27T02:19:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	can, but uses current username
2010-04-27T02:11:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	: is the mount-dir of the cd-drive owned by regualr user ?
2010-04-27T02:12:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	I don't think I have two users, the one which was created on the ubuntu installation and another one which is the one I use now
2010-04-27T02:13:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	you have default and superuser least, by default
2010-04-27T02:13:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	open a terminal ..
2010-04-27T02:14:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	mount             <<where is the cd mounted ?
2010-04-27T02:17:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	try k3b again
2010-04-27T02:18:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	do i need to replace $USER by my username?
2010-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	sry, my mistake..
2010-04-27T02:23:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 same problem
2010-04-27T02:23:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	start k3b from trminal and paste the lines following then in a pastebin
2010-04-27T02:25:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/423015/
2010-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	two things, first a permission issue with wodim, but, more suspected : write medium - incompatible format
2010-04-27T02:28:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 for the medium I do not understand because the iso is for a cd and i use a verbatim 700MB CD-R
2010-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	is your user in the group for cd ?
2010-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 yes
2010-04-27T02:33:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	system > admin > user&groups, unlock it, check your regular user
2010-04-27T02:35:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	though this can't be the solution, if you start k3b  as root, does this go alright ?
2010-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	tried that already ?
2010-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	DasEi	jeromel	sudo apt-get remove --purge k3b && sudo apt-get install k3b
2010-04-27T02:39:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 same error
2010-04-27T02:43:00.000Z	jeromel	DasEi	 i have the same problem with the other user
