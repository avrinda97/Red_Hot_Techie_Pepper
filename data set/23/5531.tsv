2008-11-02T08:02:00.000Z	n8tuser		yowshi-> may i suggest creating a cheatsheet too...helps immensely
2008-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	n8tuser		yowshi-> its up to you, a cheatsheet of commands and procedures helps
2008-11-02T08:05:00.000Z	n8tuser		yowshi-> create one your own, customized to your needs
2008-11-02T08:06:00.000Z	n8tuser		tab1293-> my fav resource on grub   http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
2008-11-02T08:08:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	heh i tried a grub install on /dev/sda1 to fix my last grub problem and the grub wound up on sda2 somehow
2008-11-02T08:10:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	the bios used to look at sda1 as the hard drive to boot from but trying that after the grub install got me a grub error 17. i tried sda2 next and it booted
2008-11-02T08:11:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	before that my grub had mysteroously migrated off the sata drives and onto the ide hard drive i have
2008-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	see i dont completly understand what your talking about with grub and bios priority
2008-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	i get bios priority. as in the spot bios looksfor the boot loader
2008-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	but i dont get grub priority
2008-11-02T08:21:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	when you use the grub install --recheck thing do you have to count your partitions the way grub would or the way ubuntu would?
2008-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	then the first partition would be sda0 blargle no wonder it buggered
2008-11-02T08:26:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	Editing GRUB's device.map not in this section it doesnt and i DONT feel like reading an entire article on grub to fix a very very specific problem which up until now has never occured and will probably never occur ever again
2008-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	i happen to be rather susceptible to i formation overload and finding the bloody information i need in amongst the other stuff i would have to read to find it would cause my brain to fuzz out
2008-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	at which point when i come across the solution i wouldnt be able to remember it later anyway
2008-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	but this wouldnt go ona cheat sheet. in 2 years of using ubuntu i have never had this problem. like ever
2008-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	this is one of those fluke [problems whose cause i have no buggering clue but probably inclused something to do with planetary alignment :)
2008-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	grrr tab completion isnt working when i load gtrub from a terminal
2008-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	it is supposed to
2008-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	your guide says it will
2008-11-02T08:37:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	according to what i see on kgrub it looks right
2008-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	well i was actually just wary. i want the grub to boot off /dev/sda1 which is where i put the boot partition on my install. i am worried that when i upgrade my grub will be all screwed and wont boot
2008-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	Yoshi	n8tuser	meh i prefer upgrading. spend 6 months setting up my desktop programmes installing everything and getting all the settings perfect only to lose most if not all them and or have to reinstall all that stuff is not apealing. not to mention i no of no way to recover the desktop right. still ont convinced i wont lose my entire desktop on a fresh install while keeping my old home directory
