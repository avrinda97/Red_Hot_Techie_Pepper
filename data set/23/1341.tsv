2010-05-26T06:07:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	wubi let's you install ubuntu as a fake windows application.  dual boot means you installed ubuntu side by side to windows
2010-05-26T06:06:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	wubi install or dual boot
2010-05-26T06:10:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	ok, let's first make sure windows is still there

2010-05-26T06:17:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	sudo os-prober

2010-05-26T06:34:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	hello
2010-05-26T06:37:00.000Z	acerimmer_	sanjay	ok.  assuming your installations were done right, this is a grub issue.  the fix I suggested came directly from the link I'll send you.  Sorry to say, I don't know what else to try
2010-05-26T06:41:00.000Z	sanjay	acerimmer_	thank you so much
