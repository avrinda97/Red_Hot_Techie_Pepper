2005-05-15T07:12:00.000Z	robertj		Runraiser: don't you have to pay for cedega/
2005-05-15T07:12:00.000Z	robertj		rr Funraiser
2005-05-15T07:13:00.000Z	Funraiser	robertj	cedega is non-free but it's based on wine, so it's GPL so they have to give back the code, that means u can find the source on sourceforge
2005-05-15T07:14:00.000Z	Funraiser	robertj	so if u are *really* short on money, compile the source, if u want to help so devs pay for it
2005-05-15T07:14:00.000Z	Funraiser		some
2005-05-15T07:15:00.000Z	robertj	Funraiser	is there anything preventing anyone from rolling unofficial debs?
2005-05-15T07:15:00.000Z	robertj		or even official devs?
2005-05-15T07:15:00.000Z	Funraiser	robertj	I don't know
2005-05-15T07:16:00.000Z	Funraiser	robertj	u can find cedega *somewhere* if u are desperate
