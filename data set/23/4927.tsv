2011-10-02T03:37:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	mess with something in /sys or /proc
2011-10-02T03:37:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	it will depend on your hardware.
2011-10-02T03:37:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	type find /sys | grep brightness
2011-10-02T03:39:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	Can you enter this directory? /sys/devices/virtual/backlight/acpi_video0
2011-10-02T03:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	find output: https://privatepaste.com/4e9fecc640
2011-10-02T03:40:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	sudo cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
2011-10-02T03:40:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	that should tell you your current value
2011-10-02T03:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	thanks
2011-10-02T03:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	I can 'echo 7 > brightness' to fix it
2011-10-02T03:41:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	yup
2011-10-02T03:42:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	you can find your max brightness here /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness
2011-10-02T03:42:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	the alt+tab thing makes no sense. Probably a coincidence or a power management app is doing something funny
2011-10-02T03:42:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	yeah, it's not repeatable
2011-10-02T03:43:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	I set it back to 7 (the max) and it's still there for now - but it defintely went dark again just now
2011-10-02T03:44:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	I dunno, something else is setting it.
2011-10-02T03:44:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	make sure there isn't a /proc entry for brightness, see if that works
2011-10-02T03:46:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	I don't see anything in /proc/ about brightness
2011-10-02T03:48:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	the dimming definitely seems to be triggered by a keypress
2011-10-02T03:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	I think a keypress after a short period of idle time makes the screen dim back to the dark setting I had last night
2011-10-02T03:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	more specifically, if I write '7' to that file, wait 9 seconds, and hit return, the screen stays bright.  if I write '7' to that file, wait 11 seconds and hit return, it dims
2011-10-02T03:52:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	it's probably conflicting with a setting by some daemon
2011-10-02T03:52:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	dooglus	you can also simulate key presses using xmonadmap, perhaps it will work better if you simulate brightnessup
2011-10-02T03:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Shirakawasuna	in fact, if I "sleep 11; bright 7" and then hit return as soon as it has finished, the screen dims
