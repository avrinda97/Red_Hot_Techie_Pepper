2007-06-07T08:01:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	I'll take a stab at it, but promise nothing
2007-06-07T08:39:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	I guess the tutorial was no good?
2007-06-07T08:41:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	yep
2007-06-07T08:42:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	i send a print command, it appears in the queue as printing, but nothing comes out
2007-06-07T08:42:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	then it disappears from the queue
2007-06-07T08:42:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	what's the printer?
2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	I had to run cat /usr/share/foo2zjs/firmware/sihp1020.dl > /dev/usblp0
2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	it works now :) thanks
2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	what the... I'd have never thought of that
2007-06-07T08:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	there's a little tutorial on linuxprinting.org what that very command
2007-06-07T08:47:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	hey there's more there you might want to read if you haven't already.  Try this link http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-LaserJet_1020
2007-06-07T08:47:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	thanks a lot :)
2007-06-07T08:48:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	I saw something (and a fix) about having to restart the printer after each job.
2007-06-07T08:48:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	i tried that before, it's just that on my computer it was /dev/usblp0 instead of /dev/usb/lp0
2007-06-07T08:48:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	let me try to print 2 jobs then
2007-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	you can also administer your print server in a browser.  Localhost:631 is cups admin
2007-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	no, i printed 2 jobs fine
2007-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	cool
2007-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	cached	craigbass1976	you're awesome
2007-06-07T08:50:00.000Z	craigbass1976	cached	sometimes.  Don't ask my wife though. :)
