2010-10-02T08:45:00.000Z	Kheops		hi
2010-10-02T08:46:00.000Z	Kheops		I want to resize a partition and I have some data on It, It's safe to do the resizing process ?
2010-10-02T08:47:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	yes, but I'd backup first.  always have a path back to the way it was, before you mess it up.
2010-10-02T08:47:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	I can't back up 1000 GB :)
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	then do so at your own risk
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	how I must resizing ?
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	To keep the data safe..
2010-10-02T08:48:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	you can use a livecd an gparted - but I'd backup the data first, but then that's me.
2010-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	I know that..
2010-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	But..I asked you what is the size..that he will let me resize
2010-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	All and only free memory ?
2010-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	what ever you want --
2010-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	I want to take the free memory and make a new partition.
2010-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	livecd and gparted will let you resize a partition
2010-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	I already know that..
2010-10-02T08:51:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	sorry I am not understanding your question then.
2010-10-02T08:51:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	how Gpartet will act ?
2010-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	That's my question..
2010-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	it will resize the partition, and move data.  resizing is  VERY time consuming - can take hours....
2010-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	I don't want to move data.
2010-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	it will move what needs moving, no way to avoid it...
2010-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	Blue1	Kheops	asked and answered.
2010-10-02T09:38:00.000Z	Kheops	Blue1	you're rude ? :)
