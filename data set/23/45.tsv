2012-10-03T01:55:00.000Z	L3mce	Kheo	stop using that acronym. Stop with the capitals. Stop being rude. Stop insisting you are entitled to help. We are trying to help you, and you are making it difficult, and removing our motivation to do so.

2012-10-03T02:06:00.000Z	L3mce	Kheo	try hashing out that listen=yes (put # in front) and rcvsftpd stop and rcxinetd restart and try another ftp start

2012-10-03T02:07:00.000Z	L3mce	Kheo	If you continue to act as if nobody is trying to help you, I will stop. Your original question was how to add users.
