2007-10-19T17:56:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	  so reading the doc it looks like there is only a server version of the shell upgrade .. or will the server upgrade method work for desktop as well ?
2007-10-19T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	I assume it will work
2007-10-19T17:58:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	... problem being my machine is already running the 7.10 kernel so it wont detect an upgrade is needed
2007-10-19T18:01:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 is it possible to force that upgrade since i am already running 7.10 ?
2007-10-19T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	no idea, can't you boot the old kernel and upgrade from there?
2007-10-19T18:03:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 nope all the kernels listed on my boot screen are now 7.10 the 7.04 ones are all gone
2007-10-19T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	dist-upgrade, expect breakage and fix it
2007-10-19T19:04:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade reports back with nothing to do
2007-10-19T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	don't take this personallf but why did you grab a new kernel if you do not know how to do these things?
2007-10-19T19:06:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	umm .. maybe you havent seem my last 20 posts but the upgrade process did this to me ... i wasnt trying to compile the kernel on my own
2007-10-19T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	that's a different story, I got the impression you only had the kernel on there
2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 nah ... the upgrade hosed 2 of my machines badly
2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	pastebin your sources
2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 sure 1 min
2007-10-19T19:10:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 but if the question is whether the fiesty ones are commented out and the gutsy ones are listed .. then yes
2007-10-19T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	just want to check you have the repos you need
2007-10-19T19:13:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 yeah give me one min to get this usb key to mount
2007-10-19T19:16:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 well this is annoying, the usb key will not mount even if i specify the fs type
2007-10-19T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	Fant	I have to go in a bit, but assume you have main, restricted, universe and multiverse pointing at gutsy.  Just apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade, if no errors, then you are on gutsy.  You can run apt-get install -f to try to resolve broken packages.  dpkg --configure -a to check for packages not configured
2007-10-19T19:20:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	yeah thanks for your help, i tryed all those already
2007-10-19T19:21:00.000Z	Fant	jrib	 no broken packages are found
