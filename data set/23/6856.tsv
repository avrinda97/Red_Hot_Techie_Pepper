2006-01-08T09:22:00.000Z	zool2005		quick question, should I use a hub or switch to connect additional computers to my adsl router?
2006-01-08T09:22:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	both will work
2006-01-08T09:22:00.000Z	zool2005		what is the difference?
2006-01-08T09:23:00.000Z	zool2005		ah
2006-01-08T09:23:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	the switch will only send the packets to the destination computer
2006-01-08T09:24:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	the hub will send the packets to all hosts
2006-01-08T09:24:00.000Z	zool2005		how do I go about connecting peripherals to a network?
2006-01-08T09:25:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	you mean devices with an ethernet conection or sharing devices connected to a computer?
2006-01-08T09:25:00.000Z	zool2005		ethernet
2006-01-08T09:25:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	if you have a dhcp server, just plug
2006-01-08T09:26:00.000Z	zool2005	GenghisKhan	just an appropriate cable required then?
2006-01-08T09:27:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	straight ethernet cable will work always
2006-01-08T09:27:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	also, some switches support crossed ethernet
2006-01-08T09:27:00.000Z	zool2005		surely the peripheral requires an ethernet port
2006-01-08T09:29:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	of course, you need an ethernet port in the switch for each peripheral
2006-01-08T09:30:00.000Z	zool2005	GenghisKhan	my printer has a usb port, what do I need to connect it to a hub/switch,
2006-01-08T09:30:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	you can't connect it. you connect it the printer to a computer and then share it through networking
2006-01-08T09:31:00.000Z	zool2005		I want to be able to share peripherals without the host computer being on, is it poss?
2006-01-08T09:32:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	i don't think so. if your printer hasn't got ethernet, you'll need a computer (or another device working as a computer)
2006-01-08T09:33:00.000Z	zool2005	GenghisKhan	: or a switch with usb port
2006-01-08T09:34:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	don't think that it exists, and if it does it would be for ethernet over usb, not managing a printer over usb
2006-01-08T09:34:00.000Z	GenghisKhan	zool2005	printers without ethernet lack a printer server and most also lack postscript interpretation, so they need a computer managing them
2006-01-08T09:35:00.000Z	zool2005	GenghisKhan	: nevermind, I'll have to make do then
