2006-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	Fizzeh		is there a default username
2006-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	Fizzeh		i wasnt promted to enter one on install
2006-06-26T10:36:00.000Z	Fizzeh		does anyone know the default username for ubuntu; my install didnt ask me for one, and now im stuck
2006-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	there is no default user, the installer shoult have asked you. You could try booting into the recovery mode and running adduser, but you'll need to put the user into a bunch of groups too
2006-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	which I think would be: adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
2006-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	just before ubuntu starts booting it will either display a menu or tell you to press Esc for a menu. it's in that menu
2006-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	thanks, I'll try that
2006-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	when in setup would it have prompted for my username, it just had me do a password, and early on it had me do the computer name
2006-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	oh, did you do a server install?
2006-06-26T10:40:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	no
2006-06-26T10:40:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	very strange, it should have asked for a username right before it asked for a password
2006-06-26T10:41:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	recovery mode is loading
2006-06-26T10:43:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	no, you'll need to use the usermod tool to add your user to those groups, e.g. usermod -g username group1,group2,group3,etc username
2006-06-26T10:43:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	just type group1, or add it to every one of those groups
2006-06-26T10:44:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	is there a way to view all users
2006-06-26T10:44:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	replace "username" with the username you set up and "group1,group2,group3" with the "adm,dialout,cdrom," etc groups
2006-06-26T10:44:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	because I think there must be one user beside root, because a passowrd got asinged
2006-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	possibly. "cat /etc/passwd" and look at the end
2006-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	how do I just create a user
2006-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	adduser username
2006-06-26T10:49:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	thanks, I think it worked
2006-06-26T10:49:00.000Z	Fizzeh	Ng	confirmation, it worked!  you rock!
2006-06-26T10:50:00.000Z	Ng	Fizzeh	cool :)
