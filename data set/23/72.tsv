2012-10-08T16:41:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__		dir_willis:i have got stucted while using dd command in my ubuntu 12.04 i have got a lot bigger size hdd that the original one .then how can i manage that extra space
2012-10-08T16:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivek-tomar__	 use gparted to rezise and expand
2012-10-08T16:42:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__	dr_willis	i mean before executing command i want to know where this place be get adjusted by dd command
2012-10-08T16:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivek-tomar__	 dd dosent adjust. it images the whole thine unless you tell it to only do part of a hd/specific size.
2012-10-08T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivek-tomar__	 you may want to use clonezilla to move  a smaller hd to a bigger one
2012-10-08T16:46:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__		dr_wilis: ok got the point dd images the whole thine ... now i restore that image to other hdd which is lot bigger... now what about the extra space ... last question please
2012-10-08T16:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivek-tomar__	 dd to the new hd. use gparted from a live cd to resize
2012-10-08T16:47:00.000Z	dr_willis		either expand the partition, or just make new one to use as some data partitions.
2012-10-08T16:48:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__	dr_willis	: ok that extra space will remain there as unformatted.
2012-10-08T16:48:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__	dr_willis	that's the point right ?
2012-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivek-tomar__	 err.. not if you tell gparted to put it in the  other filesystem
2012-10-08T16:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		example ussage case. i have a 8gb install on a usb flash. i clone it to a 500gb hd.  i have 400+ gb at the end of the hd...  i use gparted to partition that and use it as /home/
2012-10-08T16:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		OR i could have gparted expand the 8gb on the hd. into the 400gb.. and have the whole hd used for /
2012-10-08T16:51:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__		ok great thanks a lot
2012-10-08T16:51:00.000Z	vivek-tomar__	dr_willis	: thanks
