2009-02-21T04:21:00.000Z	raven_		32 vs 64 bit ubuntu: if my comp (c2d) supports 64-bit, any reason not to use it?
2009-02-21T04:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	there might be a few issues, with say Java Firefox Flash plugin, but otherwise should be alright
2009-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	64bit is better than 32bit
2009-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	sure, and you can even run 32bit programs on it
2009-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	ah then there's no good reason for me not to use it... wine works too i assume?
2009-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	yes
2009-02-21T04:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	how much RAM?
2009-02-21T04:24:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	3GB
2009-02-21T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	that's good
2009-02-21T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	,but I think you might not really get any 64bit advantages unless you got 4GB RAM at least
2009-02-21T04:25:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	im hoping to get faster compile speeds and possibly performance out of x86 emus via 64-bit
2009-02-21T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	  also there's  a Adobe Flash for 64bit Linux that is meant to be better than the others, that you can get from site
2009-02-21T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	if you want more speed well
2009-02-21T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	Ext4 is an option in the next Ubuntu  in April
2009-02-21T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	and you would have to do the partitions again for that so  yeah
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	maybe just keep 32bit Intrepid Ibex for now?  you are on Intrepid?  and then  start over  with Jaunty and use Ext4
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	i have no linux install atm
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	gonna need one to work with in the meantime anyway
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	oh  so your on Windows?
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	yeah, but not new to linux or anything
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	been using it for years
2009-02-21T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	raven_	well you could try a few distros out inside WIndows in virtualbox
2009-02-21T04:27:00.000Z	raven_	sebsebseb	not rly necessary :D
