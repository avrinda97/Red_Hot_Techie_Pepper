2005-05-16T15:01:00.000Z	anethema		im not really a programmer
2005-05-16T15:01:00.000Z	anethema		heh
2005-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	anethema		77 percent isnt a good max?
2005-05-16T15:03:00.000Z	anethema		i dunno, i just want no distortion
2005-05-16T15:03:00.000Z	anethema		you accidentially turn something up too high and all the sudden everything sounds like crap
2005-05-16T15:03:00.000Z	anethema		ideally use software mixers like in xmms
2005-05-16T15:04:00.000Z	anethema		is there a way to get a tree view on the left of nautilus file explorer thing
2005-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	anethema		similar to windows explorer
2005-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	anethema		can you suggest a file manager that does have a tree view on the left?
2005-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	anethema		similar to windows explorer?
2005-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	right click on a folder, choose "browse"
2005-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	sure there is, choose "tree" instead of "information" or "notes" for the left pane
2005-05-16T15:07:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	i have a launcher on the panel with the command "nautilus --no-desktop --browser %U"
2005-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	otherwise, spatial is the default
2005-05-16T15:10:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	system menu - preferences - keyboard - layout options
2005-05-16T15:25:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	not lately. the nice gnome keyboard configuration took that away from me :(
2005-05-16T15:27:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	you could try xbindkeys like i used to. it lets you bind anything to anything
2005-05-16T15:28:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	basically its a daemon that waits for keypresses and executes stuff accordingly
2005-05-16T15:28:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	there was even xbindkeys-config for click-and-drool configuration
2005-05-16T15:32:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	i doubt you've configured it yet :)
2005-05-16T15:33:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	oh, the gnome keyboard shortcuts are probably getting in the way
2005-05-16T15:33:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	disable them for the keys you want to custom configure
2005-05-16T16:17:00.000Z	topyli	anethema	you could file a bug in the key shortcut capplet and see if someone agrees
