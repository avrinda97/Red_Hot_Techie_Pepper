2008-01-08T07:34:00.000Z	fallore		how can i get my linux computer to sync up with the workgroup the rest of the (windows) computers are using in the house?
2008-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	look at fusesmb
2008-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	i'm sorry, i dont understand :/
2008-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	install fusesmb from synaptic. It is real easy to use....type 'man fusesmb' after install and it will explain what to do
2008-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	it will put your workgroups in a folder of your choice..the shared folders on the network should just be part of your folder
2008-01-08T07:37:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	i'm not seeing it when i search fusemb on synaptic with all available apps shown
2008-01-08T07:37:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	just a sec
2008-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	it is there...but now that I think about it I downloaded the source and compiled it as there was a problem, but I don't recall if the problem was in ubuntu (my server) or suse (my laptop)
2008-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	I can pastebin my sources.list if you like.
2008-01-09T01:54:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	fusesmb is available in synaptic
2008-01-09T01:54:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	is it fusesmb? not fusemb?
2008-01-09T01:54:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	fusesmb - two s's
2008-01-09T01:55:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	when i search nothing comes up. do i need an additional source?
2008-01-09T01:55:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	not sure...give me a sec and I will pastebin my apt sources
2008-01-09T01:56:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51258/    make a backup of your file before using this one!
2008-01-09T01:59:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	the file in /etc/apt called sources.list is the list of repositories that synaptic uses to find packages. The pastebin url I sent contains a copy of my sources.list, which includes a repo that has fusesmb. You would need to make a backup copy of your /etc/apt/sources.list and then create a new one with the contents I sent.
2008-01-09T02:01:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	it wont let me save the file, said something about insufficient permission
2008-01-09T02:02:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	you need to use 'sudo' to edit system files.
2008-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	open a terminal and type 'gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'
2008-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	just for education's sake, what does the gk part do/mean?
2008-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	or does ubuntu use gnomesu? the gksu is a gui frontend to su....opens a nice little window for the passwd
2008-01-09T02:04:00.000Z	fallore	th0r	i dont know, whenever i do sudo it asks for the password before doing whatever it is supposed to do in the terminal
2008-01-09T02:05:00.000Z	th0r	fallore	right....entering that password gives you system access
