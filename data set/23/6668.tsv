2006-12-15T14:38:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	does anybody EVER remember to reinstall it ? :)
2006-12-15T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	i know i didn't. but then if you have update-manager, you can just use that
2006-12-15T14:39:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	i'm not entirely sure, i thought it reinstalled it by itself. but i use kubuntu anyway so i never really used update-manager
2006-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	:)
2007-01-08T16:09:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	not sure he should unzip there - his desktop is about to look like my wife's
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	if the archive doesn't create a directory, guess so
2007-01-13T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	fgeller: i'm pretty sure the channel that was meant was #ubuntu-xgl rather than #ubuntu-glx
2007-01-13T11:45:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	there is a set of std scripts for the edges of gdm - perhaps that is the correct place
2007-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	get an OS that supports full filesystem versioning, and voila, you have seamless downgrading and rollback..
2007-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	thats more a backup restore, wouldn't you say :)
2007-01-19T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	if it's not a totally stupid filesystem, then no, not really. a non-stupid filesystem will let you do things like *not* rolling back /home, while rolling back the rest, for instance
2007-01-19T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	aside from that, how does the concept of a downgrade actually differ from that you said anyway?
2007-01-19T07:17:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	most important - it is not tested and known to produce no subtle problems.  not that unix has no subtle problems though :)
2007-01-19T07:17:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	right, but then the package system really has no means to downgrade while *not* wiping your customized config files, unless you build some strong AI into it =)
2007-01-19T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	no, most important - there is no such filesystem available
2007-01-19T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	though there *is* a specification (for feisty or later, dunno) to put /etc under a revision control system
2007-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	true.  too bad there is no true versioning fs - that would truly allow a reliable restoration of a point in time/state.  Provided of course you could identify the correct point :)
2007-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	mnoir	LjL	that would be kinda nice
2007-01-19T07:24:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	there is the Wayback filesystem, which has quite a few feature (though it's not really oh-look-how-many-neat-features), but it's a FUSE thing, so it really couldn't conceivably be used for root, or for anything performance-sensitive
2007-01-19T07:25:00.000Z	LjL	mnoir	what i just said to livingtm, it was to you. sorry livingtm
