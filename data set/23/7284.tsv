2008-11-29T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	Are you connected to the internet?  have you done `sudo apt-get update` since installing?
2008-11-29T08:22:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	pastebin it, and we'll take a look.
2008-11-29T08:32:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	Alright, what version of Ubuntu are you on now?  Breezy still?
2008-11-29T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	you can find out with `lsb_release -a`
2008-11-29T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	alright.  Breezy hasn't been supported for a while now.  You should upgrade (obviously).  Once you upgrade to 6.06, you can upgrade straight to 8.04.
2008-11-29T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	It can be upgraded, it's not too old.  Would you like to upgrade?
2008-11-29T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	No, from 5.10 to 6.06, and then from 6.06 to 8.04, and then you can upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 if you'd like.
2008-11-29T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	Alright, change your sources.list to the following: (alt-f2, `gksudo "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"`)
2008-11-29T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	http://paste.ubuntu.com/77929/
2008-11-29T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	Replace your sources.list with that, save it, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-11-29T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	Also, whats the output to 'uname -a'?
2008-11-29T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	alright.  Once your dist-upgrade is done, do this: sudo apt-get install linux-image-686 ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-standard ubuntu-minimal, and let me know when you've finished that.
2008-11-29T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	glusce	I know for that fact that that isn't true.  But installing fresh will work, and will be faster anyway.
