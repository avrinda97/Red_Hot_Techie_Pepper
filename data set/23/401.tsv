2011-10-08T10:16:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	most ide controllers use scsi-emulation, and get /dev/sd designations
2011-10-08T10:17:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	can you explain that just a little bit more?  I would like to understand :)
2011-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	what is "scsi-emulation", I mean?
2011-10-08T10:19:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	I understand the /dev/sd designations.  That was my problem ... and for some reason when I did not remove it properly ... it seemed like the boot order got all screwed up in BIOS ...
2011-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	ok. the driver part I get.  what are "scsi controllers", though?
2011-10-08T10:21:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	forgive me for still being a little ignorant with actual computer / OS components ...
2011-10-08T10:23:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	I see.  so let me see if I understand what you are saying.  so the system was reading the driver for my USB to emulate the scsi controllers on my system?
2011-10-08T10:24:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	why the heck did the system automatically think it needed to boot from the USB ... after I improperly removed it?  that is so strange!
2011-10-08T10:24:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	that has nothing to do with ubuntu/linux you are mixing things up
2011-10-08T10:25:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	ok.  sorry for my misunderstanding.  you are talking about hardware, then?
2011-10-08T10:26:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	I was talking about hardware and how linux manages it, your problem is not linux/unix related but rather bios related
2011-10-08T10:27:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	I see.  So it has to do with automatic configurations for my BIOS and how it operates in various situations ...
2011-10-08T10:28:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	if your system keeps on trying to boot of usb devices enter the bios and change the boot order, or disconnect all usb disks at boot
2011-10-08T10:28:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	I just know to make sure to remove this "ext4-formatted" USB drive properly from now on so as to not run into anymore problems with it.  I think I'm actually going to reformat it to the file system that allows me to use it on both a Windows PC and in Linux ...
2011-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	that is unless you installed the ubuntu on a usb stick.
2011-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	or maybe you setup grub to boot via usb
2011-10-08T10:30:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	yeah, I've already reorderd the boot order ... and that took care of the startup problem.  If I tell the BIOS to disconnect all USB disks at boot ... will I still be able to use the flash drive after it boots up into Ubuntu?
2011-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	how do I setup grub to boot via USB?  I think this is a wise idea ...
2011-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	lapion	mtnman80	I was just teling you in case you dud so..
2011-10-08T10:34:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	no but like ... do I put grub on my ext4-formatted USB ... as a backup?
2011-10-08T10:35:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	I think you can save an image of the OS to an USB, if I am not mistaken ...
2011-10-08T10:36:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	or can't you back up your current system on a USB?
2011-10-08T10:39:00.000Z	mtnman80	lapion	anyway, thanks for your input :)
