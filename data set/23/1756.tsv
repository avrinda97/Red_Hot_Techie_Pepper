2009-11-04T06:02:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	one is pre-dominantly for one-to-one conversations, one is for large group chats.
2009-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	Depends when people start releasing them for Linux. A lot work in !wine, and some have native ports, such as Quake 4 and Doom 3.

2009-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	razertek	MenZa	i need mumble then right for mutli groups like vent for games?
2009-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	It would be your best call, yes.
2009-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	Remember you need to setup a server.
2009-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	Mumble also works with Windows and Mac.

2009-11-04T06:04:00.000Z	razertek	MenZa	just like vent then? =)
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	basically, yeah.
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	It uses the same voice codec (Speex) as Ventrilo (Ventrilo supports a number of other ones as well)
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	So it won't be that much of a difference.
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	razertek	MenZa	so do you play nexuiz?
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	Negative.
2009-11-04T06:05:00.000Z	MenZa	razertek	My gaming is on Windows.
