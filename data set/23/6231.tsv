2007-05-26T05:49:00.000Z	crabgrass		one day, my usb devices just stopped mounting. any idea what's up?
2007-05-26T05:49:00.000Z	crabgrass		!pmount
2007-05-26T05:50:00.000Z	crabgrass		!mount
2007-05-26T05:51:00.000Z	crabgrass		how do i mount usb devices?
2007-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	crabgrass		and that's all i need
2007-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	mount?
2007-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	not the one i was thinking of... it listed usb devices
2007-05-26T05:54:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	that's the one, awesome
2007-05-26T05:54:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	didn't see it before, ty
2007-05-26T06:02:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	have you updated a library recently?
2007-05-26T06:02:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	change any configuration?
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	some configs, downloaded a lot of libs for compiling
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	well :P
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	well, thing is, this happens on every single ubuntu install i've ever had, regardless of what i do to it
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	hm
2007-05-26T06:04:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	on different hardware?
2007-05-26T06:04:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	and would a few new libs really remove usb support?
2007-05-26T06:04:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	yes
2007-05-26T06:04:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	i don't know exactly, but bugs happen...
2007-05-26T06:04:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	if a certain library that usb hardware depended on had a bug in it or changed its configuration it could make it stop working
2007-05-26T06:05:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	shit... and idea on how to reverse that?
2007-05-26T06:05:00.000Z	crabgrass	lufis	'cause i've tried pmount'ing everything in /dev, and nothing worked
2007-05-26T06:05:00.000Z	lufis	crabgrass	so it happens. but i don't know what's up, if it's happening on different hardware sounds like a ubuntu-specific issue. try ubuntuforums.org
