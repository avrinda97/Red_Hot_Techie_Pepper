2009-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	skibiliano		I mean, firefox just crashes
2009-07-20T04:49:00.000Z	skibiliano		But it works on my Windows XP computers using firefox
2009-07-20T04:50:00.000Z	skibiliano		How can you update firefox on ubuntu?
2009-07-20T04:50:00.000Z	skibiliano		the button for checking for updates in firefox is grayed out
2009-07-20T04:51:00.000Z	skibiliano		and I am not so familiar with the gnome-terminal commands
2009-07-20T04:51:00.000Z	skibiliano		as I previously mentioned
2009-07-20T04:51:00.000Z	skibiliano		I have Hardy 8.04
2009-07-20T04:52:00.000Z	skibiliano		Checking for updates.... While it's doing that, I have an another problem with ubuntu's firefox
2009-07-20T04:53:00.000Z	skibiliano		No updates visible according to this, anyway, the problem is that my flash can't be updated from 9.0.4 to 10
2009-07-20T04:53:00.000Z	skibiliano		I downloaded the .deb from official site so it could update to 10, it installed properly
2009-07-20T04:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	why haven't you upgraded in general?
2009-07-20T04:54:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	well, you are running 8.04, why don't upgrade to 9.04?
2009-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	whats the error?
2009-07-20T05:15:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	can you describe the error in more detaul?
2009-07-20T05:18:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	erm, you are trying to grab from an archive from a wrong repository
2009-07-20T05:18:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	whats lsb_release -a say?
2009-07-20T05:19:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	ok, thats enough
2009-07-20T05:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	well, I don't understand why its trying edgy files, but I can take a look at your sources if you like.
2009-07-20T05:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	just pastebin your whole /etc/apt/sources.list file
2009-07-20T05:34:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	can you: sudo apt-get install pastebinit   ?
2009-07-20T05:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	comment out 51 and delete 50, then give it a try
2009-07-20T05:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	how are you editing it?  you could use: gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-07-20T05:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	skibiliano	great! take care
