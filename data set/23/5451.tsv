2007-01-14T09:24:00.000Z	Math^		hello, someone know how to search for text in files using the terminal?
2007-01-14T09:25:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	grep
2007-01-14T09:25:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	oh ofcourse
2007-01-14T09:26:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	not exactly but you really want to search / for text?  That will take a long time:  grep -R foobar /
2007-01-14T09:28:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	here's the problem: I've installed something called like 'aquamarine', and have uninstalled it... but now, there's a new option in beryl, an option to switch in KDE mode, but I'm just using Beryl/Gnome... So Im searching for a config file to remove this extra option in Beryl
2007-01-14T09:30:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	I would search ~/.beryl first.  Then whatever the system directory for beryl plugins is
2007-01-14T09:30:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	ok
2007-01-14T09:30:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	all local user settings should be
2007-01-14T09:31:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	but I switched to another user, and there it was also, the new option
2007-01-14T09:31:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	so I thought... maybe its not in the home folder
2007-01-14T09:31:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	yeah you're probably right, but search inside the beryl folders, not all of /
2007-01-14T09:31:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	or if you ask #beryl, they might know exactly where you need to go
2007-01-14T09:31:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	thnx, I'll do that :)
2007-01-14T09:41:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	problem dissolved :) I had to un-install kwin... ;)
2007-01-26T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	did you try resetting your password?
2007-01-26T07:26:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	yes I tried it
2007-01-26T07:26:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	I even made it a password like 12345
2007-01-26T07:28:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	I did sudo passwrd to change, I have to do passwrd, lets try again :)
2007-01-26T07:30:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	yes, i can login again :)
2007-02-07T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	fc-cache
2007-02-07T07:13:00.000Z	Math^	jrib	doesnt work
2007-02-07T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	did you restart the application?
2007-02-07T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	Math^	how are you installing the fonts?
