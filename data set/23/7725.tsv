2005-05-27T08:12:00.000Z	mindspore		I'm having trouble accessing my proftpd server from a remote pc.. i can connect fine locally, does ubuntu have a firewall by default that could be blocking remote accees to port 21?
2005-05-27T08:12:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	no, it doesn't
2005-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	if you're behind a "router", that would be why
2005-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	yeah but i've forwarded the ports
2005-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	yes, but that doesn't work for ftp
2005-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	enabled dmz, and disabled its' firewall
2005-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	what do you mean forwarding ports doesn't work for ftp?
2005-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	do you know how ftp works?  it uses two connections, one for control and one for data.
2005-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	the server connects out to the client to send the data, which doesn't work if the client is behind a firewall
2005-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	well from what i read it uses port 20 for data, and 21 for control.. so why wouldn't forwarding those two ports, plus a range for passive work?
2005-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	anyway, do you have a solution?
2005-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	don't use ftp
2005-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	or get a better router
2005-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	it's a linksys wrt54g
2005-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	or forward the ports and accept that the clients won't be able to connect if they're behind a firewall
2005-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	i cannot connect from a remote pc even if there is no firewall
2005-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	the other pc is on the internet with no router or anything in front of it?
2005-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	yes
2005-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	are you connecting in passive mode?
2005-05-27T08:17:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	i've tried both active and passive
2005-05-27T08:17:00.000Z	bob2_	mindspore	ok
2005-05-27T08:18:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	i get no route to host either way
2005-05-27T08:18:00.000Z	mindspore	bob2_	and even behind a firewall i can connect to ftp servers running on linux, behing routers
