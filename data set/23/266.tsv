2012-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BUbo_	  depending on your Hard drive layout. you may want to set up several parttions
2012-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	BUbo_	Dr_willis	several partitions? what for ?
2012-02-11T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BUbo_	 / for /home and swap = are commonly used.
2012-02-11T19:24:00.000Z	BUbo_		for /home ill put ~200GB and for swap how much ?
2012-02-11T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis		swap depends on your needs. and if you want to use hibernate/suspend.
2012-02-11T19:24:00.000Z	BUbo_		isnt the swap partition default with the ubuntu installation? or you have to set it up yourself ?
2012-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis		it makes one by default. You can tweak its size.
2012-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	BUbo_		Oh
2012-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	BUbo_		so ill make it 8 GB
2012-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	BUbo_		it should be fine i guess
2012-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	BUbo_		swap
2012-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	BUbo_		so, first backup everything to external hdd, format whoel drive, isntall ubuntu 11.10, install win7, install drivers, apps, updates, etc.. long long day :|

2012-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	BUbo_		Is there a way to backup setting or files for ubuntu ?
2012-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BUbo_	 your users home dir - has all your user settings.
2012-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	BUbo_		Yes i know that Chipzzz, i made that mistake once..
2012-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	BUbo_		So I can copy and paste the /home dir ? that will overwrite all the setting with these that i am using atm, and will it install apps? or i have to install them again from start ?
2012-02-11T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BUbo_	 installed apps are NOT normally in your home.
