2007-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	dager	riqz	did you set up xgl/aiglx accordingly?
2007-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	riqz		btw guys i cant get a list of users on xchat here... anyone care
2007-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	riqz	dager	yes xgl and aiglx
2007-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	riqz	dager	at least i think...it took me a whole night
2007-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	dager	riqz	you only need to run one or the other.. having both set up might be causing the problem
2007-03-04T16:37:00.000Z	riqz	dager	yeh i think that might be the problem
2007-03-04T16:37:00.000Z	riqz	dager	i have xgl
2007-03-04T16:38:00.000Z	riqz	dager	and when i run it it doesnt recognize my xgl
2007-03-04T16:38:00.000Z	riqz	dager	but linux confirms that im running xgl
2007-03-04T16:38:00.000Z	dager	riqz	try to switch to aiglx and run the open-source drivers with it, thats how i got mine working
2007-03-04T16:38:00.000Z	riqz	dager	yeh i'll try that
2007-03-04T16:39:00.000Z	riqz	dager	but to switch to aiglx do i have to disable xgl?if so how?
2007-03-04T16:39:00.000Z	dager	riqz	xgl needs to be disabled.. no idea how, i assume it would be just undo whatever you did to enable it
