2009-12-01T13:35:00.000Z	APERSON	Balsaq	glad I could help.  You cleared lots of logs and caches
2009-12-01T13:44:00.000Z	APERSON	Balsaq	you can run it either as your user or as the admin
2009-12-01T13:44:00.000Z	APERSON	Balsaq	tjhe admin user can remove more things, but is all more dangerous
2009-12-01T13:44:00.000Z	APERSON	Balsaq	I run it as user first, then the admin
2009-12-01T13:45:00.000Z	APERSON	Balsaq	right on :)
