2012-06-10T02:33:00.000Z	wdp_		is it normal, that some menubar's are gone in ubuntu (dunno how else to name that) i just installed pidgin, xchat and sylpheed - none of these has a menu bar at the top and I have no clue how to enable that one.
2012-06-10T02:33:00.000Z	wdp_		(like file edit open etc)
2012-06-10T02:33:00.000Z	wdp_		s/has/have
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	unity uses globalmenu. Whichever app is focused their menubar will be on the top panel
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wdp_	wylde	so removing unity will do the job?
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	you can just remove globalmenu :)
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wdp_		ah
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wdp_		how do i remove that?
2012-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	wylde_		moment
2012-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	wdp_		gotcha. i see, the menu is at the top..
2012-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	wdp_		thats not very useful there.. ^^
2012-06-10T02:36:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	I don't recall the actual packagename. Search apt or the software center for appmenu or globalmenu.
2012-06-10T02:36:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	I'm on kubuntu atm .
2012-06-10T02:38:00.000Z	wdp_	wylde	hm i don't find it
2012-06-10T02:39:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	moment, I'll look for it on http://packages.ubuntu.com
2012-06-10T02:39:00.000Z	wdp_		there's appmenu-gtk -gtk3 and -qt, but i don't think that's it.
2012-06-10T02:41:00.000Z	wylde_	wdp_	 It's been a while, I know it globalmenu for thunderbird/firefox. But something like appmenu for unity. I have to run for a few, sorry.

2012-06-10T02:48:00.000Z	wdp_	wylde	thanks a lot, found it.
2012-06-10T02:49:00.000Z	wdp_	wylde	just in case you want to know it was "apt-get remove appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt indicator-appmenu"
2012-06-10T02:49:00.000Z	wdp_		ty.
