2005-04-08T08:52:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla		vlc does not pop onto my gnome menu
2005-04-08T08:52:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla		why?
2005-04-08T08:52:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla		and how do I put it there?
2005-04-08T08:53:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	hoary?
2005-04-08T08:54:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	yes
2005-04-08T08:54:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	which vlc-related packages do you have installed, just vlc, or wxvlc, too?
2005-04-08T08:55:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	yeah both
2005-04-08T08:56:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	ok, I'll fix that.  Thanks for reporting.
2005-04-08T08:57:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	no problem. I found a "bug"?
2005-04-08T08:57:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	a goof-up on my part, yes.
2005-04-08T08:59:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	in general one can't manually edit menus in Gnome 2.10?
2005-04-08T08:59:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	correct, though hopefully there will be one for Breezy.
2005-04-08T09:00:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	the next Ubuntu stable release following Hoary.
2005-04-08T09:02:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	wait that long until one is able to edit the menus? What have to wai tfor the next Gnome release? Don't they know this is a problem to leave out this feature?
2005-04-08T09:03:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	or are all packagers expected to make their apps automagically appear in the menu, unlike yours did?;)
2005-04-08T09:03:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	it's up to the packagers.
2005-04-08T09:40:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	I'm test-building.
2005-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	fixed & uploaded.  New packages should be available in 65 minutes.  Thanks for reporting.
2005-04-08T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	the standard /etc/apt/sources.list should suffice
2005-04-08T12:24:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	I fried it
2005-04-08T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	how?
2005-04-08T12:25:00.000Z	GhostFaceKilla	crimsun	adding and removing repos
2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	GhostFaceKilla	btw, vlc's desktop entry is fixed.
