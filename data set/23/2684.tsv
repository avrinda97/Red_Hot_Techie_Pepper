2008-12-14T23:50:00.000Z	toader_		Hi, Since i upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10,  my keyboard input always r frozen in the application like eclipse, and Konsole. I almost cannot continue my work. But previous Ubuntu 8.04, there is no this problem. Could anybody know why?
2008-12-14T23:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	i might know how to fix it. however, it's only a guess and it's kind of drastic, and it might not help at all

2008-12-14T23:56:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	could u tell me
2008-12-14T23:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	ok, sure. it seems that you are using the kde environment. is that correct?
2008-12-14T23:58:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	no, it is gnome
2008-12-14T23:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	oh.. i see.. but you are usingsome kde stuff? you mentioned Konsole, which is a kde thing
2008-12-14T23:59:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	yes, i have install konsole
2008-12-15T00:00:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	but my eclipse is alwyas frozen also
2008-12-15T00:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	first, you will probably want to shut down X before doing this.. ok? anyway, after shutting down gdm with invoke-rc.d gdm stop  ...in your home directory... delete all your .gnome and .kde dirs
2008-12-15T00:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	and delete dirs like....  .gvfs and .qt
2008-12-15T00:02:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	what does mean "after shutting down gdm with invoke-rc.d gdm stop"
2008-12-15T00:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	again, kind of drastic, but it might fix your problem
2008-12-15T00:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	it means shutting down your window manager AND your display manager
2008-12-15T00:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	if you do it... delete the following..  .config .dbus .gconf .gconfd .gnome2 .gnome2_private .gvfs .qt and .kde and .mcop stuff
2008-12-15T00:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	and anything else that looks to be gnome or kde related that starts with a  .
2008-12-15T00:08:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	ok, thx
2008-12-15T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	ok, all i can is good luck. again, i don't even know if that'll fix it
2008-12-15T00:08:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	how to restart to console without starting up the X-window?
2008-12-15T00:08:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	i will come back and tell u a moment
2008-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier		toader... exit your window manager(log out). go to a console only terminal(ctrl+alt+f1 for example)... then  invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2008-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	toader_	to start it up again... invoke-rc.d gdm start
2008-12-15T00:10:00.000Z	toader_	onetinsoldier	ok, see u later
