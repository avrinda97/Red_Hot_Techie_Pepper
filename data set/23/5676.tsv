2006-10-15T06:30:00.000Z	rpc		guys do you have a clue how to disable caching in w3m? i do POST often and files are being cached for no reason
2006-10-15T06:32:00.000Z	rpc		ftp = evil
2006-10-15T06:32:00.000Z	rpc		i would rather send files via https :)
2006-10-15T06:33:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	https?
2006-10-15T06:33:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	what's on the other side that stops you from untaring files?
2006-10-15T06:34:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	a shared web server from mediatemple.
2006-10-15T06:36:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	do you do that often? alot of files?
2006-10-15T06:36:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	i would be able to find a solution then...
2006-10-15T06:37:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	yeah. i usually develop locally and then mass upload everything...
2006-10-15T06:38:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	do you need gui?
2006-10-15T06:38:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	no. as far as i can tell "upload everything in this folder into that folder" it's ok
2006-10-15T06:38:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	i hear you
2006-10-15T06:41:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	it would be possible to create a solution that would allow you to transfer stuff easily with a single command
2006-10-15T06:41:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	would it really?
2006-10-15T06:42:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	or you could do that without custom solution even... using rsync
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	I don't know what rsync is all about.
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	please read up, it's a great tool for what you need and more
2006-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	rpc	chrishoeppner	basically if you had a directory structure with files locally... you could mirror it to a remote box with rsync
2006-10-15T09:21:00.000Z	chrishoeppner	rpc	know what? I asked my hosting provider and they enabled restricted ssh access for me. mediatemple are really top notch for customer support. and thank you for your help before.
