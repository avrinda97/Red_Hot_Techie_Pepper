2009-06-22T05:20:00.000Z	churl		xorg is taking up way too much resources when in use.  Does anyone want to point me in a direction?
2009-06-22T05:22:00.000Z	churl		hello!
2009-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	churl		anyone familiar with how xorg works?
2009-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	coleys	churl	Just ask your question =)
2009-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	coleys	churl	whats your video card? And are you using the proprietary driver?
2009-06-22T05:25:00.000Z	churl	coleys	I'm not sure.  do you know what i can run to see what i'm using?
2009-06-22T05:26:00.000Z	coleys	churl	Do you know if it is specifically ati or nvidia?
2009-06-22T05:29:00.000Z	coleys	churl	sudo lspci |grep -i nvidia && sudo lspci |grep -i ati
2009-06-22T05:29:00.000Z	churl	coleys	thanks
2009-06-22T05:30:00.000Z	coleys	churl	It should display which you have, and the model # (Only if you have ati or nvidia)
2009-06-22T05:32:00.000Z	churl	coleys	yeah, it looks like i have neither
2009-06-22T05:32:00.000Z	coleys	churl	lspci |grep -i intel
2009-06-22T05:33:00.000Z	churl	coleys	there we go, intel
2009-06-22T05:33:00.000Z	coleys	churl	Do you see anything that could possibly be an intel graphics card?
2009-06-22T05:36:00.000Z	churl	coleys	both had what look to be the same output
2009-06-22T05:36:00.000Z	coleys	churl	sudo lspci |grep -i ati
2009-06-22T05:36:00.000Z	churl	coleys	i see a graphics controller
2009-06-22T05:38:00.000Z	coleys	churl	So you have an ati driver?
2009-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	churl	coleys	i got another similar output when i $lspci |grep -i ati
2009-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	coleys	churl	And what is the output?
2009-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	churl	coleys	want me to make a paste bin for you?
2009-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	coleys	churl	Sure
