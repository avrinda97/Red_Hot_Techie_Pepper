2006-11-04T14:55:00.000Z	alkali	squidly	yea but it seems like it's not gonna be.  I got to play with it in vectorlinux and it was BEAUTIFUL
2006-11-04T14:56:00.000Z	squidly	alkali	i played with it a bit.. i didnt like it all that much
2006-11-04T14:56:00.000Z	alkali	squidly	it was so much less processor and memory intensive than anything else out right now and it was nice looking too
2006-11-04T14:56:00.000Z	squidly	alkali	try fluxbox
2006-11-04T14:57:00.000Z	alkali	squidly	I'm a fan of me clicking on something and it running.  Gnome programs run in gnome.  KDE in KDE.  Some in fluxbox some not.
2006-11-04T14:58:00.000Z	squidly	alkali	really? ive never had any problems with fluxbox
2006-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	alkali	squidly	It's just that unless you have the library files for fluxbox for the program you want to run, it won't run
2006-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	squidly	alkali	that is an install issues
