2010-11-25T22:35:00.000Z	MagicJ		how do I change the screens that show while Ubuntu is booting?
2010-11-25T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	there are plymouth themes in the repo, theres a deb for the ubuntu sunrise theme on gnome-loog.org

2010-11-25T22:40:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	I am missing something here - on the URL that you sent me I do not see how to set my own at all
2010-11-25T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	there is a link to gnome-look where there is a deb to install the splash
2010-11-25T23:48:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	- ty so much the link that you gave me did give me how to make my own screens, or at least guided me enough that I worked it out
2010-11-25T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	sweet :0
2011-02-09T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	it'd have been smarter to test the ISO first. a bad ISO will make a bad CD
2011-02-11T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	what speed do you burn at?
2011-08-14T01:34:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	earlier today you asked me to do a pasetbin on the problem with the apt-get fialing - then u were gone - here is the URL http://pastebin.com/0gzKkdN9
2011-08-14T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	wow you got a lot of spare kernels dude
2011-08-14T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/589356
2011-08-14T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	seems to be an issue with that kernel
2011-08-14T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	I recommend you remove some of the old kernels too, taking up unecessary space
2011-08-14T01:40:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	how do I remove them?
2011-08-14T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	use software centre, same as any other package. Just do NOT remove the current kernel. If you run:  uname -r    you can see the kernel you are running. You can remove the older kernels and get ~120Mb per kernel in free space :)
2011-08-14T01:47:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	sorry to be so dense but I do not see how to do that with the software center - is there anyway to do it at the shell anyway
2011-08-14T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	gimme a sec I'll make you a command. What is the output of: uname -r
2011-08-14T01:49:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	uname -r made 2.6.32-33-generic
2011-08-14T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	http://pastebin.com/YcqAwzc7
2011-08-14T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MagicJ	the text file shown is the before and after space usage
2011-08-14T01:57:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	I ran your command - it ran beautifully did not seem to help though - 42% useage - what now
2011-08-14T02:05:00.000Z	MagicJ	ActionParsnip	I should add that the file shows same 42% both before and after
