2008-05-09T08:45:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z		Hey i need help please :)
2008-05-09T08:45:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z		I cant login to Ubuntu
2008-05-09T08:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	what happens when you try to log in?
2008-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	are you typing the right password?
2008-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	it won't show it, but you can still enter it
2008-05-09T08:51:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-05-09T08:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	what happens when you type Ctrl+Alt+F7 ?
2008-05-09T08:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	is this the desktop or server version of ubuntu?
2008-05-09T08:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	it's all lowercase
2008-05-09T09:00:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	it might be possible that you accidentally installed the server version
2008-05-20T06:36:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	how is it not working?
2008-05-20T06:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	try starting it from the terminal
2008-05-20T06:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	cd "~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/mIRC" && wine mirc.exe
2008-05-20T06:39:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	I think you forgot a " somewhere or accidentally added an extra one
2008-05-20T06:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	is mIRC installed in wine's program files?
2008-05-20T06:42:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	Starnestommy	i dont see it
2008-05-20T06:45:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	Starnestommy	i dont see it
2008-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	you might need to reinstall mirc
2008-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	the reason why it's not working is probably because it somehow got uninstalled
2008-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	you can compile unrealircd and run it natively on linux without wine or unreal's windows version
2008-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	Starnestommy	i dont know how XD thats why i want to run it with wine
2008-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Nissan_350Z	there are instructions in the readme and install files of the source archive
2008-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	Starnestommy	okay thanks :D
