2009-05-23T20:42:00.000Z	Baen		Hey hey
2009-05-23T20:43:00.000Z	Baen		anyone have a moment to help me out of graphics driver hell?
2009-05-23T20:44:00.000Z	Baen		Seb: I've got ati and decided to give the catalyst 9.5 a shot. didn't work out so hot so I removed it and went back to the proprietary driver that came with 9.04 and now its all scrambled and I cant log in. :/
2009-05-23T20:45:00.000Z	Baen		Which is confusing since it worked fine yesterday.
2009-05-23T20:45:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	you got to reconfigure xorg
2009-05-23T20:46:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	if you can't log in because of a scrambled screen, you can fix it from a live cd or from recovery mode. don't use the propetiary drivers in 9.04
2009-05-23T20:46:00.000Z	Baen		Ah, that sounds familiar. What specifically do I need to change?
2009-05-23T20:46:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	if you want 3d affects with your card, either go back to 8.10 and wait for better open source drivers or live with unfancy effects. it happened to me. its a bummer but oh well :(
2009-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	Baen		8.10 was hell for me. I've used 9.04 since beta and played wow with perfect graphics using the driver that came with jaunty. I just dont get why it suddenly doesnt work again.
2009-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	hmmm what video card?
2009-05-23T20:48:00.000Z	Baen		radeon 2600 something.
2009-05-23T20:49:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	hmm I was never able to get 3d effects working on my ati radeon x1600 in 9.04 so i just gave up
2009-05-23T20:49:00.000Z	Baen		Burowski: Im just guessing here but isnt 1600 older? I don't think the new drivers support them any more
2009-05-23T20:50:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	yep, even though it's still a decent card :( check ATI's site to make sure your card isn't on legacy support
2009-05-23T20:50:00.000Z	burvowski		so is there an easy way to see whether bluetooth is on or off? in OS X, the menu bar icon was either solid black if on or greyed out if off. anything similar in ubuntu?
2009-05-23T20:51:00.000Z	Baen		legacy support?
2009-05-23T20:52:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	yes, companies sometimes move hardware to legacy support, which means they no longer release new features for it in drivers
2009-05-23T20:52:00.000Z	Baen		I'm pretty sure mine is supported. If i had some patience i might have gotten it to work well with wow as well, i just couldn't be bothered.
2009-05-23T20:53:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	I'd search around to see if your card is mentioned on any of these http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&hs=zrt&q=ati+legacy+cards&btnG=Search
2009-05-23T20:54:00.000Z	Baen	burvowski	I dunno. Like I said, the drivers that came with 9.04 have worked fine for a few months now, I dunno why it suddenly went wonky on me. I thought I removed the catalyst 9.5 completely, but maybe I didn't. :/
2009-05-23T20:54:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	that's probably it. recovery mode is your best bet
2009-05-23T20:54:00.000Z	burvowski	Baen	you can reconfigure xorg from there
2009-05-23T20:55:00.000Z	Baen	burvowski	I'll give that a shot.
