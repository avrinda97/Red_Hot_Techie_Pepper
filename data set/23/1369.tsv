2010-07-09T07:59:00.000Z	mdel_		trying to connect from my mac to my ubuntu box at work, i get stuck at "expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP"
2010-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	mdel_		well, not the error
2010-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	mdel_		but where its getting stuck
2010-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	mdel_		on the mac, 5.2p1
2010-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	mdel_		(server)
2010-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	mdel_		just all of a sudden, im hanging at expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP
2010-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	mdel_		also, i only get this sporadically
2010-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	mdel_		i can connect, use it for 5 minutes, then it lags out
2010-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	mdel_		i try to reconnect, i get that message'
2010-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	mdel_		this is over VPN, the VPN mtu is 1444
2010-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	'lags out'? What exactly does that mean?
2010-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	mdel_	Loshki	gets slow to respond, keystrokes are behind
2010-07-09T08:07:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	can't hurt to try Compiling's suggestion...
2010-07-09T08:08:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	could be network constipation I suppose, but you'd expect that not to fail consistently at SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP...
2010-07-09T08:09:00.000Z	mdel_	Loshki	i agree
2010-07-09T08:13:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	if the load on the office machine is unreasonably high, I would expect lag, and delay around the SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP since that's where all the heavy math starts to execute...
2010-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	mdel_	Loshki	it's just my workstation, there is no load
2010-07-09T08:17:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	I can't explain it. Can you ssh into your workstation while it's bogged down and see what's going on that way?
2010-07-09T08:18:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	When you're at work, can you e.g. ssh from work to home, then vpn back in, so you can see what the workstation is doing?
2010-07-09T08:19:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	for all you know, someone is running a huge torrent at work, after hours, and clogging the net...
2010-07-09T08:20:00.000Z	mdel_	Loshki	the lag isn't the bad part, its the fact that I can't connect
2010-07-09T08:21:00.000Z	Loshki	mdel_	do you know if it's just your workstation? Can you reach anyone else's desktop?
2010-07-09T08:21:00.000Z	mdel_	Loshki	no same problem
