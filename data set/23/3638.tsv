2008-02-27T10:12:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	maybe you can just install the 64bit kernel and itll all switch?
2008-02-27T10:13:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	if you have a /home directory at least that stuff wont have to be redone during a fresh install
2008-02-27T10:33:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	"core duo" is 32.  "core 2 duo" is 64
2008-03-11T08:47:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	stop
2008-03-11T08:51:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	if you have like 10 fedora kernels just sitting around, uninstall some old ones to make room
2008-03-11T08:52:00.000Z	Luderacer	macogw	 that may of been me trying to install fedora right now
2008-03-11T08:52:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	oh wait which do you have first?  does the one that was there first have a bunch of old kernels? if so, remove the old kernels so you have room in /boot. otherwise, make /boot bigger
2008-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	Luderacer	macogw	 how do i make /boot bigger?
2008-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	partitioner
2008-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	might require wiggling things all around though
2008-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	Luderacer	macogw	 would it be easier to just install Fedora then ubuntu?
2008-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	dunno
2008-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	macogw	Luderacer	i tend to not use a /boot partition
