2006-09-18T09:19:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	you do know that he didn't right lol
2006-09-18T09:20:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	i'm just at that point
2006-10-01T14:43:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	well gnome has a resolution app
2006-10-01T14:44:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	thats not what i'm talking about, it doesn't let you tell x what monitor make/model/refresh rates you have, thus x a lot of times simply gives you generic resolution options instead of monitor specific ones
2006-10-01T14:45:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	well xorg 7.1 does auto detection
2006-10-01T14:45:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	oh for f's sake just shutup already and tell that to all the people in this channel asking about how to setup refresh rates
2006-10-01T14:47:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	i should probably appologize for being rude
2006-10-01T14:48:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	well it seems like ubuntu is set to one way instead of other ways sounds like how ##linux and other channels are
2006-10-01T14:49:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	*nod*
2006-11-23T06:00:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	most people just use AC97 drivers for them
2006-11-23T06:00:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	allrightty
2006-12-22T10:41:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	don't know why you call beryl pre alpha when it's not compzi is more pre alpha then beryl is
2006-12-22T10:42:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	because it is, because it is buggy and basically sucky.  its a great experiment and should be treated as such
2006-12-22T10:42:00.000Z	holycow	kitche	that way we can make sure that newbies don't end up expecting a finished s upported product, they go into the experience expecting to haveto deal with bugs
2006-12-22T10:45:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	but it does work just that ubuntu doesn't have it in it's repos and such at least on an nvidia it works out of the box if you use the 9xxx drivers
2007-09-04T16:25:00.000Z	kitche	holycow	bet your about to be banned in a second
