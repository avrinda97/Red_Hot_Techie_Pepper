2011-12-03T18:22:00.000Z	jehoshua02		Can I please get some troublehooting tips for problems setting acl rules for a symlink? Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS. Keep getting "Permission denied": https://gist.github.com/1427103
2011-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	you're actually trying to set acl rules on the symlink's target, correct?
2011-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	Good catch. Yes. The target.
2011-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	pastebin the output of « mount »
2011-12-03T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	why are you setting mask like that?
2011-12-03T18:25:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	https://gist.github.com/1427103#file_mount.md
2011-12-03T18:26:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	because . . . http://xdissent.com/2010/05/04/github-clone-with-redmine/#redmine-the-key-master
2011-12-03T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	what's the output of « getfacl whatever_that_file_is » now?
2011-12-03T18:31:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	getfacl output: https://gist.github.com/1427103#file_getfacl_output.md
2011-12-03T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	you're on ubuntu?
2011-12-03T18:33:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS.
2011-12-03T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	check parents all the way up to / are accessible to redmine.  i.e. can redmine get to /, /opt, /opt/gitosis
2011-12-03T18:37:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	I'm not totally sure what it's supposed to look like: https://gist.github.com/1427103#file_ls__la_output.md
2011-12-03T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	it will be easier to read if you do ls -lad :)
2011-12-03T18:37:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	I'm guessing the point is to have git own all the git stuff, and only allow redmine to use the private key to connect to git repositories.
2011-12-03T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	but yes I see the problem is /opt/gitosis/, you need to let redmine execute that
2011-12-03T18:38:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	https://gist.github.com/1427103#file_ls__lad_output.md
2011-12-03T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	yep, did you see my last?
2011-12-03T18:40:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	I'm checking that right now.
2011-12-03T18:43:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	https://gist.github.com/1427103#file_chmod_opt_gitosis.md --> Thanks. I'm sure that `chmod 777` ain't the best solution. What would you recommend?
2011-12-03T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	jehoshua02	just use ACLs like you did on /opt/gitosis/.ssh
2011-12-03T18:44:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	drrr. Thanks. You got lightningy troubleshooting skill!
2011-12-03T18:58:00.000Z	jehoshua02	jrib	That fixed my prob. I can create repos in Redmine. Nice.
