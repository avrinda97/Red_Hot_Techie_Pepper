2011-05-08T22:02:00.000Z	Seamless		coz: I have two 512GB hard drives set up as a RAID0, I have Windows 7 installed and try to install Ubuntu 11.04 alongside with Windows 7
2011-05-08T22:04:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	real raid or fakeraid?
2011-05-08T22:06:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	I guess it's a fake raid, set up through the BIOS
2011-05-08T22:06:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	then afaik you can't grub can only handle raid1.
2011-05-08T22:07:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	Ubuntu 10.10 Worked perfectly with the same configuration
2011-05-08T22:07:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	is the ubuntu partition on raid0 too?
2011-05-08T22:08:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	Yes.  I tried upgrading 10.10 to 11.04 : Same error.  Clean install over 10.10 : Same error.  Clean install alongside Windows 7 after having deleted Ubuntu 10.10 : Same error
2011-05-08T22:09:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	ok, anything else than raid1+grub is new to me :) -- sorry
2011-05-08T22:09:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	When I've made the RAID, I made it as a RAID0
2011-05-08T22:10:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	I can't understand why Ubuntu 10.10 works PERFECTLY and not Ubuntu 11.04...
2011-05-08T22:12:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	can't help you there. I can't understand why/how and since when grub does other stuff than raid1 especially if that is a fakeraid where the disks are exposed. I usually have either real raid where I can't even get to the disks or do raid1 (to be honest I'm afraid of raid0)
2011-05-08T22:12:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	: I know almost nothing about RAIDs, is it possible for me to make a real RAID ?
2011-05-08T22:13:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	sure if you are willing to spend the money (usuall that starts at a few hundred bucks)
2011-05-08T22:13:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	as for raid0: 0 is for the amount of data you can restore if any single one of the involved disks fail
2011-05-08T22:14:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	Hm... Well, I guess I'll have either to stay on Ubuntu 10.10, find what's wrong with Ubuntu 11.04, or clean up my computer and use one of my 512GB hard drives for Windows 7 and the other one for Ubuntu...  But my Windows stuff needs at leat 750GB =/
2011-05-08T22:15:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	would be an option. Personally I don't quite get why I always need the latest version. I think back at home there's still some box running 9.something :)
2011-05-08T22:16:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	what is the actual error you are seeing? (I don't have it in my backlog)
2011-05-08T22:17:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	The actual error is "Executing grub-install/dev/sda failed       This is a fatal error"
2011-05-08T22:18:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	I tried to install the bootloader on the RAID itself like I did with Ubuntu 10.10, but Ubuntu 11.04 ALWAYS tries to install it on /dev/sda, what ever I tell it to do.
2011-05-08T22:18:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	I think that is what 10.10 did too. may be a new bug in grub. behind the scenes IIRC grub just installs to each disk involved in a raid even if you give it the raid device
2011-05-08T22:20:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	If I let the bootloader install itself on /dev/sda with Ubuntu 10.10 my computer doesn't boot on anything, but if I tell it to go on isw_something, it boots GRUB
2011-05-08T22:24:00.000Z	Seamless	serverhorror_	Is there a possibility to upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to Ubuntu 11.04 WITHOUT touching GRUB ?
2011-05-08T22:24:00.000Z	serverhorror_	Seamless	you could pin the package, but I don't know it offhand. just google for apt-pinning
