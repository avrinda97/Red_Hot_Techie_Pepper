2009-09-07T06:13:00.000Z	jalonso		hey guys, this book I'm reading is saying that an operating system cannot boot properly if the boot info is kept "above the hard drive's 1023rd cylinder". Anyone knows what that means?
2009-09-07T06:15:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	some older computers require the kernel to be placed toward the beginning of the HDD  (fyi drive space is broken up into cylinders)
2009-09-07T06:16:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	so that would not really apply to a machine that can support SLI right?
2009-09-07T06:16:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	probably not.  The proof is whether your system boots
2009-09-07T06:18:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	the reason I ask is because I was trying to install ubuntu using two harddrives, one was a 20gb drive while the other was a 200GB sata drive. mounted the 20G drive as the root partition and the rest on the sata drive and when I was done it didnt boot
2009-09-07T06:19:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	was I being realistic in setting it up this way?
2009-09-07T06:20:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	I would think so.  you should post what errors you ran into
2009-09-07T06:20:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	error 15
2009-09-07T06:22:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	does it say file not found?
2009-09-07T06:23:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	yes, I think so, it would get up to GRUB stage 1.5 and then the error showed up
2009-09-07T06:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	well, sounds like you may have a bad device.map
2009-09-07T06:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	are you running a livecd atm?
2009-09-07T06:24:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	yes I was
2009-09-07T06:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	what does /boot/grub/device.map say?
2009-09-07T06:26:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	honestly I should tell you that I ultimately gave up and just installed ubuntu entirely on the Sata drive
2009-09-07T06:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	well, that's probably for the best
2009-09-07T06:27:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	so at this point I need to redo the installation again before I can get back at you
2009-09-07T06:28:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	I suggest you wait till 9.10, when grub2 is the default.  Grub2 should detect your drives better
2009-09-07T06:28:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	oh ok, but for the time being, should I just reconnect that second drive and look at the device.map file?
2009-09-07T06:29:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	either way thanks for the information, much appreciated :)
2009-09-07T06:29:00.000Z	danbhfive	jalonso	if you want to hassle yourself, sure.  But grub2 will replace  grub, so it may not be worth it.
2009-09-07T06:30:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	gotcha, I read up on GRUB 2 instead, didnt even know they were doing it
2009-09-07T06:30:00.000Z	jalonso	danbhfive	thanks again
