2010-05-10T14:51:00.000Z	obscurant1st		somebody pls tell me!!1
2010-05-10T14:51:00.000Z	obscurant1st		in the 10.04 it is supposed to show the update available icon in the notification area right?
2010-05-10T14:52:00.000Z	obscurant1st		some blank screen stays for some time
2010-05-10T14:52:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	Yes. There must be package updates..
2010-05-10T14:52:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	well then the notifier icon never comes up.
2010-05-10T14:53:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	But there are updates?
2010-05-10T14:54:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	So the icon isn't coming up but there are updated available you mean?
2010-05-10T14:54:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	yeah, when i open the update manager update will be there, even now updates were there
2010-05-10T14:54:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	yes the icon is not coming!
2010-05-10T14:54:00.000Z	obscurant1st		but updates are there
2010-05-10T14:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	Have you checked the settings or preferences of update-manager? There may be a way to enable or disable it?
2010-05-10T14:56:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	ok i havent changed anything over there, anyway let me check it.
2010-05-10T14:57:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	but when i upgraded to lucid from karmic, for the first few times that icon came
2010-05-10T14:58:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	You haven't changed anything since then?. i.e. it stopped for no reason??
2010-05-10T14:58:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	i havent changed anything since then, atleast for something like this, cos i liked the way it looked!
2010-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	That's odd.. I take it you've done updates if it's appeared before?
2010-05-10T15:01:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	i dont know. :(
2010-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	So update-manager has alerted you of updates before? the icon has appeared in the systray?
2010-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	only a few times, like 2 or 3 times, i think. and that too appeard just after i upgraded to lucid.
2010-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	obscurant1st		and yes it was on systray
2010-05-10T15:04:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	Did you upgrade to the beta/RC or just the main release?
2010-05-10T15:04:00.000Z	obscurant1st	bushbaby	main release!
2010-05-10T15:05:00.000Z	bushbaby	obscurant1st	Prehaps some of the package updates interfered with the update-manager icon appearing? or there was an update to update manager that removed the feature?
