2008-01-10T09:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	/me thinks he is just looking to get around keyring
2008-01-10T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	lets see :}
2008-03-13T09:22:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	you stuck with out X?
2008-03-13T09:24:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-03-13T09:27:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	indeed would be worth an upgrade
2008-03-13T09:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	Like I said, it would be something I'd consider....if feisty was working...atm I have CLI...
2008-03-13T09:29:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	get the alternate cd that will do the trick; www.ubuntu.com
2008-03-13T09:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	While I appreciate the advice I would hope that the fix for the problem isn't, upgrade, that will fix it for sure.
2008-03-13T09:39:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	that can be fixed as well most likely; just need to setup grub again
2008-03-13T09:41:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	never reinstall when you can spend hours in here ;]
2008-03-13T09:42:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	No, I'm serious....I am asking a real question....I built literally scrapped my entire machine except for my hard-drives....Now also Ubuntu isn't recognizing my network card....Is a new install a better way to go?
2008-03-13T09:43:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	I am serious too (except for the length of time); that should be fixable; one problem at a time though
2008-03-13T09:45:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	if it is a rather fresh install then just reinstalling would be a good choice, but if you have tons of data you want to save then you might want to try fixing it; just something to consider
2008-03-13T09:45:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	I was under the impression that if I reinstalled without reformatting I wouldn't lose data.
2008-03-13T09:45:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	seperate /home partition?
2008-03-13T09:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	That the only way....Otherwise if I install over I'm out of it?
2008-03-13T09:47:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	if you explicitly created a seperate home partition then a reinstall will leave your data alone; if not then no
2008-03-13T09:47:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	I did not.
2008-03-13T09:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	I have one crucial partition that is NTFS that I would NEED to save. Otherwise, I'd be OK.
2008-03-13T09:59:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	fixable in several ways that we have outlined here
2008-03-13T10:00:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	Realistically it seems like the Ubuntu fix is to reinstall, and I am OK with that...I don't think anything else is going to work...I see my boot screens...Ubuntu is looking for all sorts of hardware and failing to find it. That'd be the best fix.
2008-03-13T10:01:00.000Z	bazhang	PurpZeY	that is more the windows way; really this can be worked on but not all of them at one go
2008-03-13T10:01:00.000Z	PurpZeY	bazhang	I mean this in a non-degrading way. But so far, none of them can be worked on.
