2010-10-16T08:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		Hi. I installed Linux Mint and then removed all packages from Linux Mint and removed the repository, but now my GRUB and Plymouth themes are the same. How do I revert them?
2010-10-16T08:18:00.000Z	MindVirus1		Use each one and see which you like.
2010-10-16T08:19:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	hasn't Mint upgraded to Debian?
2010-10-16T08:19:00.000Z	MindVirus1	leo_rockway	No, that's LMDE -- Linux Mint Debian Edition. It's rolling release.
2010-10-16T08:20:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	oh, okay. Rolling release sounds good.

2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	swap can only be swap
2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	MindVirus1	leo_rockway	What do you mean?
2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	MindVirus1	leo_rockway	Swap is RAM, just on your hard drive. RAM holds a lot of sensitive information.
2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	no, nevermind, icarus-c's answer showed me I'm ignorant.
2010-10-16T09:20:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	because bazhang will tell you off for talking about other distros in #ubuntu

2010-10-16T09:43:00.000Z	MindVirus1	leo_rockway	It's a residential gateway. Highly doubtful it's a proxy.

2010-10-16T09:46:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	lol
2010-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	in packages.ubuntu.com you can search which packages have which files.
2010-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	MindVirus1	leo_rockway	You could just do dpkg -S.
2010-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	leo_rockway	MindVirus1	that too.
