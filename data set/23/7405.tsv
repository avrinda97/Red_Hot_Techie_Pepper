2005-08-30T07:06:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	Mine throttles to 1004.903 MHz ;-)
2005-08-30T07:07:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	shut up :)
2005-08-30T07:08:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	If it helps: "cpu MHz: 300.729"
2005-08-30T07:08:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	thanks, i thought i was the only one that acutally has use for old hardware
2005-08-30T07:09:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	yeah mine is dual too. the good old celeron A 300
2005-08-30T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	Just pretend you didn't see that
2005-08-30T07:09:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	see what ;)
2005-08-30T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	The 300 is a Dual P2 (Klamath)
2005-09-01T07:42:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	it's for ubotu
2005-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	No, why?
2005-09-06T13:53:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	yes
2005-09-06T13:54:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	it even has payware pantone support
2007-06-27T06:44:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	does flash run on 64bit (out of the box)
2007-06-27T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	no.
2007-06-27T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	But with nspluginwrapper it works fine
2007-06-27T06:45:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	so that's graphics, flash, a bunch of wifi cards (to my knowledge and what i see in different forums)
2007-06-27T06:45:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	I run my desktop box as 64bit systm and don't have issues
2007-06-27T06:47:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	grats, but if you follow the discussions on the web 64bit causes trouble for desktops just about everywhere (regardless of OS)
2007-06-27T06:48:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	i'm not absolutely denying 64bit just saying that there are some poor people out there that think that 64bit will make everything faster better and more sexy while software sellers aren't really supporting it
2007-06-27T07:00:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	pam-ldap and libnss-ldap are working fine for me
2007-06-27T07:01:00.000Z	cafuego	ekimus	Only thing to keep in mind is that you make sure you tell libnss-ldap to *fail* at bootup when udev tries to retrieve group names before networking is up.
2007-06-27T07:04:00.000Z	ekimus	cafuego	yes but still it is unsupported (plus FC, SuSE and debian managed to make it work out of the box)
