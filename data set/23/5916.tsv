2009-09-16T04:17:00.000Z	Cainus		hey all... any screen users in here?  Does anyone know why screen -ls might list a bunch of screens I'm attached to, but I can't actually switch to any of them?
2009-09-16T04:19:00.000Z	Cainus		ctrl-a n to switch to the next
2009-09-16T04:19:00.000Z	Cainus		screen -wipe doesn't change the list
2009-09-16T04:20:00.000Z	Cainus		Ah.. how do I change the screen instance then?
2009-09-16T04:20:00.000Z	Cainus		is that my problem?
2009-09-16T04:21:00.000Z	Cainus		Boon: you mean screen -r ?  it lists a bunch of attached screens and says there is no screen to be resumed
2009-09-16T04:22:00.000Z	Cainus		here's what I see: http://pastebin.com/m36d0c3a7
2009-09-16T04:23:00.000Z	Cainus		ctrl-a + " gives me a list of, but there's only one thing in it
2009-09-16T04:23:00.000Z	Cainus		how do I specify what screen I want then?
2009-09-16T04:23:00.000Z	Sedated	Cainus	.. ^A + " is just like ^A n, it only switches windiws within a screen, it doesn't switch screen sessions
2009-09-16T04:24:00.000Z	Sedated		Cainus... like jrib stated,  <jrib> Cainus: screen -d -r NAME_OF_SCREEN_INSTANCE
2009-09-16T04:24:00.000Z	Cainus	Sedated	where NAME_OF_SCREEN_INSTANCE is what?
2009-09-16T04:24:00.000Z	Cainus		how do I see tyhe availabel names
2009-09-16T04:25:00.000Z	Cainus		?
2009-09-16T04:25:00.000Z	Cainus		screen -R appears to do nothing
2009-09-16T04:25:00.000Z	Sedated		Cainus... just like you posted in pastebin
2009-09-16T04:25:00.000Z	Sedated		Cainus... the "5650.pts-2.ubuntu" parts
2009-09-16T04:26:00.000Z	Sedated		Cainus... so "screen -d -r 5650.pts-2.ubuntu" would detach scren from whoever is using it and attached it to your terminal session, but you have to do it from a regular shell, not a screen session
2009-09-16T04:26:00.000Z	Cainus	Sedated	how do I know if I'm in a screen session?  how do I get out?
2009-09-16T04:27:00.000Z	Sedated		Cainus... keep "exit"ing until you get a message saying something like "[screen terminated]"
2009-09-16T04:29:00.000Z	Cainus		there's really no reason for me to run more than one screen is there?
2009-09-16T04:30:00.000Z	Cainus		I should be fine with just multiple windows in one screen, right?
2009-09-16T04:30:00.000Z	Sedated	Cainus	... the point is screen is so you don't have to run it more than once
