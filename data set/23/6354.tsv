2006-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani	Then unzip that file to your desktop and run `sudo mv ~/Desktop/firmware/*.fw /lib/firmware`
2006-09-08T09:02:00.000Z	shriphani		hmm and how do i know which fw i need in that list ?
2006-09-08T09:02:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani	I think you need all of them but I am not sure.
2006-09-08T09:03:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani	Having extras can't hurt
2006-09-08T09:05:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani	Are you having any problems?
