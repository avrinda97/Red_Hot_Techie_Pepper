2012-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	Josh		 So, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on VirtualBox first gave me terrible performance
2012-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	Josh		tried mint on virtualbox
2012-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	Josh		same
2012-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	Josh		Then I installed Ubuntu 12.04 using Wubi
2012-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	Josh		Despite from the replies I heard about wubi
2012-10-10T10:00:00.000Z	Josh		so any idea bazhang ?
2012-10-10T10:00:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	How much ram have you given it?
2012-10-10T10:00:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	And what CPU have you got?
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Josh	Baralabite	I've got 2GB ram so I gave it half
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	How much CPU have you got?
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	What's your CPU
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Josh	Baralabite	Intel Duel Core
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	And what is your host OS, and what programs are you running on the host
2012-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	GHz?
2012-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	What is the GHz of the CPU?
2012-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	Josh	Baralabite	Let me show you screen shot of CPUz
2012-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	Don't bother
2012-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	Just type in "dxdiag" into the "Run" menu on windows 7
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	When VirtualBox is hosting an OS, it is sending the commands to the CPU
2012-10-10T10:05:00.000Z	Josh	Baralabite	I see.
2012-10-10T10:07:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	So, anyway, summary: 2 OS's running at once slows down the CPU for both, but since Wubi (AFAIK) is only running Ubuntu, it's much faster, because it's only running one OS. Solution: Install Ubuntu seperately, and not virtualize it
2012-10-10T10:08:00.000Z	Josh	Baralabite	Can I format part of one of my (existing) NTFS partitions  to ext4? and when I don't want it, remove it and join it back to main partition? as NTFS
2012-10-10T10:10:00.000Z	Baralabite	Josh	I installed Windows Along side Ubuntu, and then rather than, when I wanted to run Windows inside, installing a Windows in VirtualBox, I rather ran the Virtualization from the partioned space
