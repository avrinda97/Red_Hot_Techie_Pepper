2005-10-24T12:31:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	please
2005-10-24T12:32:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	you're welcome
2005-10-24T12:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	just dl the breezy cd
2005-10-24T12:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	mount it
2005-10-24T12:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	the cd iso HAS initrd on it, i can assure you
2005-10-24T12:32:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	doesnt help me if i cant do a net install once i get into the initrd
2005-10-24T12:33:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	i mean copy it
2005-10-24T12:33:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	ok, so i reboot into the copied initrd.. now what
2005-10-24T12:34:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	of course i would have to copy the initrd.. my point is that if the installer on the initrd can't do a netinstall, that helps me not at all
2005-10-24T12:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	you probably can
2005-10-24T12:35:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	do a net install?
2005-10-24T12:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	Use the sources.list
2005-10-24T12:35:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	that's what i was asking, and got told there was no net install
2005-10-24T12:35:00.000Z	daved	kbrooks	so roll a custom initrd?
2005-10-24T12:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	no.
2005-10-24T12:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	hang on
2005-10-24T12:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	daved	http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html
