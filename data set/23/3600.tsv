2010-02-06T11:30:00.000Z	thechris		Does anyone know how to get fdisk /mbr to work from linux?
2010-02-06T11:31:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	linux does things differently. try "fdisk -l"
2010-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	what happened before windows started not being able to boot?
2010-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	so you select windows from grub, then what happens?
2010-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	the screen displays a blinking _.  it does not boot
2010-02-06T11:37:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	you're sure the windows is listed properly in grub.cfg?
2010-02-06T11:38:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	grub.cfg is autogenerated but update-grub/2
2010-02-06T11:41:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	verify the grub.cfg yourself, or you could pastebin it
2010-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	it seems pretty basic.  it does the root - map - chainload.
2010-02-06T11:44:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	pastebin "fdisk -l" output and your grub.cfg
2010-02-06T11:57:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	you could boot a windows install disc and do a 'repair install', then reinstall grub2

2010-02-06T11:55:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	fdisk mbr installs the NT bootloader, we use grub so
2010-02-06T11:56:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	either grub doesn't work, or grub does work and the NT bootloader doesn't work.
2010-02-06T11:56:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	grub isn't hard to install from linux
2010-02-06T11:57:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	you could try uninstalling grub 2 and installing the older grub
2010-02-06T11:58:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	i'm pretty sure grub is wrong is that it has hd(0,1) while windows is on hd(0,0)
2010-02-06T11:59:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	grub2 changed partitions to 1 indexed.
2010-02-06T11:59:00.000Z	thechris	chelz	I just don't want to have to search my house for my winxp cd.
2010-02-06T12:01:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	well could try older grub then
2010-02-06T12:21:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	if your cpu supports it you could just access windows through virt-manager and never boot to it
2010-02-06T12:21:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	optionally, the latest vmware supports up to dx9 for any effects
2010-02-06T12:25:00.000Z	chelz	thechris	switching to older grub is trivial. seriously. chill brah.
