2012-01-02T18:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	the win-machine must allow access to it
2012-01-02T18:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	should, yes
2012-01-02T18:40:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	how come i can connect to it with Filezilla?
2012-01-02T18:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	it?
2012-01-02T18:40:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	the window server
2012-01-02T18:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	the win machine would need to be set to accept ftp requests, you got win issues
2012-01-02T18:43:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	well how come it doesnt work with nautilaus, but it does work in Filezilla
2012-01-02T18:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	because filezilla is a ftp client, and nautilus can be but you don't have it setup that way
2012-01-02T18:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	if you have a ftp server you want to treat as a virtual folder on a ubuntu I can help
2012-01-02T18:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	there may be a lot of different approaches but mine is simple enough for me, what is your version of ubuntu?
2012-01-02T18:47:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	Well i'm running Xubuntu, with nautilueus
2012-01-02T18:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	11.10?
2012-01-02T18:48:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	yes its 11.10
2012-01-02T18:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	I installed 'gigolo' to keep the ftp server open on my end and placing the ftp server contents on ~/gvfs at all times, the rest was just point nautilus to that folder
2012-01-02T18:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	no idea what that is about
2012-01-02T18:52:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	How do I open the ftp item in gedit (trough gedit)
2012-01-02T18:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	do you have a /gvfs folder in your home folder?
2012-01-02T18:54:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	no
2012-01-02T18:54:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	.gvfs i have
2012-01-02T18:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	anything it?
2012-01-02T18:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	raoul	anything in it?
2012-01-02T18:59:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	it has some FTP folders in it
2012-01-02T19:05:00.000Z	raoul	almoxarife	so there are only a few folders of my previous FTP connections from my Windows server. (that didnt work)
