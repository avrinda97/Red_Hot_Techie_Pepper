2010-07-06T22:32:00.000Z	Baelgrer		but, when i attempt to install Ubuntu i get an error that 'no root filesystem's defined', and I  can't define one because there is nothing to select.
2010-07-06T22:32:00.000Z	Baelgrer		Mark-I  so yeah, I  think I''ve really messed up the partitions
2010-07-06T22:33:00.000Z	Baelgrer		s'installed.
2010-07-06T22:34:00.000Z	Baelgrer		Mark-I when i run gparted, everything's greyed out, and refreshing devices brings nothing.
2010-07-06T22:34:00.000Z	Baelgrer		Mark-I none :/
2010-07-06T22:35:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i so, what'd you think?
2010-07-06T22:36:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i, yeah, i know. then i used testdisk and everything changed.
2010-07-06T22:36:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i, so i'm not quite sure what i did, but somehow i've messed it up >_>
2010-07-06T22:37:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i followed the guide someone sent, it said about copying files using testdisk.
2010-07-06T22:38:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i not going to lie, i have no idea what's happened. all i know is that earlier on, i could change the partitions to bootable, primary, etc., and now after using testdisk they've disappeared.
2010-07-06T22:38:00.000Z	iflema	Baelgrer	yeah, lie you say. Its p.robably fried from what Q-Tipped said.
2010-07-06T22:39:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i i have restarted the live cd, yeah.
2010-07-06T22:39:00.000Z	Baelgrer	iflema	fried? awh mannnn.
2010-07-06T22:40:00.000Z	iflema	Baelgrer	you want to tell us what really happened?
2010-07-06T22:42:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i iflema that is what really happened D: i was trying to recover files from a broken windows install, someone suggested testdisk/photorec so i downloaded/installed that. after that, i booted up testdisk and followed the guide as closely as possible (the version had change, and so had its layout) so i had to guess a few things, i got to the same end as the guide, though. after that, it told me to restart for changes to take effect 
2010-07-06T22:42:00.000Z	iflema	Baelgrer	you are/where Q-Tipped
2010-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i iflema wouldn't boot and still gave the same error ('no bootable partition detected') and so i tried to install ubuntu 9.04 via the live cd, when GParted couldn't detect anything i thought 'WHOOPS' and rejoined this channel
2010-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	Baelgrer	iflema	not q-tipped, just ash____ from earlier.
2010-07-06T22:44:00.000Z	Baelgrer		so yeah, Mike-I/Iflema, any idea what i can do? :/
2010-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	Baelgrer		Mark-I I'm going to reboot again, just double check it. I imagine all the partiton's have been deleted/messed up somehow, though.
2010-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	Baelgrer		... which would explain gparted being unable to find anything, and the HDD being unable to boot
2010-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	Baelgrer		mark-i, iflema i'll be back in around 10 minutes.
2010-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	iflema	Baelgrer	under what name with what preoblem?
