2006-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	TheMonoTone		all I need to do is edit a video file, is there anything else besides cinelerra or kino that can do this?
2006-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	TheMonoTone		since it seems impossible to get cinelerra working in any short amount of time
2006-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	You are sure you followed all those repositories the walkthrough suggests.
2006-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	post the errors to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-04-20T15:50:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	any ideas?
2006-04-20T15:51:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	I will look now.
2006-04-20T15:51:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	post your sources.list too, please.
2006-04-20T15:54:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	OK. a few secs.
2006-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	is your computer a pentium?
2006-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	/exec -o uname -r
2006-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	but yeah, amd chip :-)
2006-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	you have a 386 kernel installed.
2006-04-20T15:59:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	OK, we need those packages then.
2006-04-20T15:59:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	I will get you a sources.list as best as I can. I am at work, though, so it will take a few.
2006-04-21T16:02:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12344 . Back up your _current_ version of sources.list, make what is there your new sources.list, and then sudo aptitude update. Report any errors on the pastebin, please.
2006-04-21T16:06:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	this is aggravating :-/
2006-04-21T16:07:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	I just said update. Does The update give you errors?
2006-04-21T16:10:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	no errors from update
2006-04-21T16:10:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	well, 2 errors less:)
2006-04-21T16:11:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	true
2006-04-21T16:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	But, that cinelerra is on crack. libavc1394-0: (control IEEE 1394 audio/video devices), section libs, is extra. Version: 0.5.1-1 (dapper),
2006-04-21T16:13:00.000Z	TheMonoTone	dbernar1	thats what I'm saying
2006-04-21T16:17:00.000Z	dbernar1	TheMonoTone	no ideas. Make sure you remove the cinelerra related lines from sources.list.
