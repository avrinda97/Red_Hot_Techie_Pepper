2008-03-10T07:37:00.000Z	jimmygoon_		sounds like a grub problem, reboot on live disc and reinstall grub?
2008-03-10T07:38:00.000Z	jimmygoon_		!grub > HaZaRd
2008-03-10T07:38:00.000Z	jimmygoon_		!grub | HaZaRd
2008-03-10T07:39:00.000Z	jimmygoon_		!grub | sCOTTo
2008-03-10T07:39:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	Thanks, trying that now
2008-03-10T07:38:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	do the recovery one from the live disc and hopefully it will at least pick up the ubuntu install. after that we can get vista on the list
2008-03-10T07:39:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	let us know how it goes, most likely your solution will come from something in/on/within the live disc
2008-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	I've gotta choose the root file system now... I don't know which one it is... I've got 8 bloody options o.O
2008-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	it would be w/e the ubuntu install it
2008-03-10T07:41:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	"If you do not know your boot partition, use find /boot/grub/stage1"
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	I'm actually using the altCD not the liveCD :S
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	thats fine
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	run "find /boot/grub/stage1" from the grub prompt
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	So where do I enter that command?
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	after you "run" grub from the command line
2008-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	er, do you have a command line right now? or are you on the first step of the installer?
2008-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	I honestly don't know... it just started going by itself... I'm trying a full re-install now
2008-03-10T07:44:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	nooooo
2008-03-10T07:44:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	its easy enough to drop to cmd line to try recovering grub
2008-03-10T07:44:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	and will take a fraction of the time
2008-03-10T07:48:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	Alright I'm now at the liveCD main menu... where do I go? :S
2008-03-10T07:48:00.000Z	jimmygoon_	HaZaRd	hit CTRL+ALT+F2 should take you to a black/white screen w/ cmd prompt?
2008-03-10T07:49:00.000Z	HaZaRd	jimmygoon_	Nope...
