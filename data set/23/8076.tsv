2005-04-07T14:08:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	The extension is set at .css, is it not?
2005-04-07T14:09:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	Locally, does it crash the page that it's being used on?
2005-04-07T14:09:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	give me a moment...
2005-04-07T14:10:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	no, doesn't crash firefox
2005-04-07T14:10:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	That very well narrows it down I suppose? The problem may not by with the file, but something else . . .
2005-04-07T14:13:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	I got critical errors when apt-getting leafpad :(
2005-04-07T14:14:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	try apt-get update first and then that
2005-04-07T14:16:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	256k
2005-04-07T14:18:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	If you had critical errors with that . . . a bit more than that might be messed up . . . :x
2005-04-07T14:23:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	does it matter that I don't have apache installed?
2005-04-07T14:23:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	Shouldn't really . . .
2005-04-07T14:24:00.000Z	Br34ch	kakalto	you should have that installed if you plan to work with php, mysql, etc.
2005-04-07T14:28:00.000Z	kakalto	Br34ch	nah, I'm simply adapting an oswd template to my likings, changing bits here and there in the xhtml & css files
