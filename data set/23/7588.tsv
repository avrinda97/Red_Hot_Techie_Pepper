2005-06-29T06:17:00.000Z	vinux	GNULinuxer_	lol well I don't think it was stupid but ubuntu has apt-get and seems to be stable from what I can see. So why build form source when you can apt-get :)
2005-06-29T06:21:00.000Z	vinux	GNULinuxer_	the main reason why I like slackware is because the distros that were out thier pkgs just did work on my system. Slackware at the time was stable, fast and just worked! But now that ubuntu is around. Slackware well is just basically a Dinosaur!
