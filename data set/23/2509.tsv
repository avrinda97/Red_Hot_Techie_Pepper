2009-02-14T00:00:00.000Z	Saiyeek		guys, my network card is not supported by kubuntu
2009-02-14T00:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	which one
2009-02-14T00:02:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	its Realtek RTL8168C that comes with gigabyte motherboard
2009-02-14T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	that car is usually supported via the r8169 module ...
2009-02-14T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	try « sudo modprobe r8169 »
2009-02-14T00:03:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	what is r8169 module
2009-02-14T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	a device driver
2009-02-14T00:05:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	and while booting, it says apeture too less 32Mb of 64MB
2009-02-14T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	that's harmless afaik
2009-02-14T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	does the card works if you do « sudo modprobe r8169 » ??
2009-02-14T00:06:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	i have to boot back from kubuntu, i am on windows now, i have no acess to internet through kubuntu
2009-02-14T00:06:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	thanks, i will try that
2009-02-14T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	welll writte the command dwon and try it
2009-02-14T00:21:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	that didn't work
2009-02-14T00:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	:|
2009-02-14T00:21:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	I have a manual connectino, when all the settings are right, it shows disconnected still
2009-02-14T00:21:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	anyway out?
2009-02-14T00:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	dunno really
2009-02-14T00:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	is it hard to debug from windows...
2009-02-14T00:24:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	what debug? u told me to try sudo modprobe r8169 rite, but my card is RTL8168
2009-02-14T00:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	is it hard to know why the connection fails... it may not be a problem of the nic driver it may be something else...
2009-02-14T00:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Saiyeek	if you have a card to configure that means it is recogniced and the driver loaded for it
2009-02-14T00:27:00.000Z	Saiyeek	erUSUL	i don't knw either it is loaded or not, i need to make manal ip configuration in windows to connect to internet, but in kubuntu the same didn't work
