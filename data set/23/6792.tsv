2007-02-15T17:13:00.000Z	dooglus		can someone help me to get my middle speaker to work in ubuntu please?  it works in Windows, but not ubuntu
2007-02-15T07:11:00.000Z	dooglus		 xstasi: you can install ubuntu from inside debian using apt-get
2007-02-15T07:11:00.000Z	xstasi	dooglus	from inside debian?
2007-02-15T07:11:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	from inside debian
2007-02-15T07:12:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	see 'debootstrap'
2007-02-15T07:12:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	I use debian now instead of ubuntu, and I installed debian from inside ubuntu using debootstrap
2007-02-15T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	so what's the problem?
2007-02-15T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	install 'ubuntu-desktop'
2007-02-15T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	that's the stock install
2007-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package that installs everything else.  you'll need a kernel too, of course
2007-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	install 'linux-686' or some such to get the kernel
2007-02-15T07:16:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	since you need to download so much, it might be worth going the alternate-cd route
2007-02-15T07:16:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	that way you won't have to manually install a kernel, set up /etc/fstab, grub, etc.
2007-02-15T07:17:00.000Z	xstasi	dooglus	well, i need to download less MBs, and i don't have to waste a cd..
2007-02-15T07:17:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	that's fine, so long as you're able to get the debootstrapped install to be bootable.
2007-02-15T07:17:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	there's a bit of fiddling around required
2007-02-15T07:18:00.000Z	xstasi	dooglus	fiddling?
2007-02-15T07:18:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	like setting up /etc/fstab, grub, and a few other little things
2007-02-15T07:18:00.000Z	xstasi	dooglus	yeah, everything seems to be documented on the former link
2007-02-15T07:19:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	see http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/426
2007-02-15T07:20:00.000Z	xstasi	dooglus	yeah, i am desktopping :)
2007-02-15T07:20:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	you what?
2007-02-15T07:21:00.000Z	dooglus	xstasi	I see
