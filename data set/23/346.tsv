2011-11-29T19:00:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup		does anyone know how to include network locations in cases like say you are uploading an image through a website, you click upload and you get the file browser... network locations do not appear, not even bookmarked ones... how to fix this?
2011-11-29T19:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 look in your .gvfs directory?
2011-11-29T19:04:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	the .gvfs directory shows nothing, changes the backround of the dialog to pink
2011-11-29T19:05:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	/home/cprint
2011-11-29T19:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 the location of the file you are trying to access..
2011-11-29T19:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	/home/cprint is just your 'home' directory.
2011-11-29T19:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	. yes.. so browse to the location of the file. and look at the address..
2011-11-29T19:07:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	smb://cpserv01/server/Website%20Files
2011-11-29T19:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 when i access a smb:// place here its showing up in .gvfs for me
2011-11-29T19:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 just uploaded a image via firefox using .gvfs
2011-11-29T19:16:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	that's unfortunate. I really hate having to copy entire directories to upload things to my webdev
2011-11-29T19:17:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	I tried to even make link and it returned an error saying it can't
2011-11-29T19:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 mount the share by hand to some static location of your choice.
2011-11-29T19:18:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	thanks for your help I will try out a few things
2011-11-29T19:23:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	aparantly I just needed to install SAMBA
2011-11-29T19:23:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	it's all fully working now
2011-11-30T18:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 if its possible. it would be in the ccsm/compiz settings
2011-11-30T18:32:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	yes I've tried there but don't see an option that would relate to middle mouse. I thought in a previous version it just waited for a keystroke... I can't see where to get that anymore
2011-11-30T18:35:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	yes in ccsm/expo it has a keystroke bind and under says button and shows a graphic of a mouse. when I enable it I get the popup with a dropdown of button 1 - 15. I can't find any relating to the mouse. Is mouse 3 not button 3 or mouse 3 in linux>?
2012-02-02T22:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 you mean as a windows network neighborhood type share?
2012-02-02T22:08:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	in the past when I would connect it would automount a drive that linked to my ubuntu home folder in windows
2012-02-02T22:17:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup	dr_willis	remmina is using RDP to connect to my windows
2012-02-02T22:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiNuX`sup	 never really used RDP. but i thought RDP was for remote Desktp access, not accessing a 'share' like thing.
