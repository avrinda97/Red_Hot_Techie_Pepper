2009-10-24T20:36:00.000Z	aperson		I just updated my eeepc 701 last night and now my video drivers are messed up
2009-10-24T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	straight ubuntu? eeebuntu? easy-peasy?
2009-10-24T20:37:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	straight ubuntu
2009-10-24T20:37:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/300654/ is my x log
2009-10-24T20:43:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	relevant lines seem to be around 100 in the log, not finding the driver
2009-10-24T20:44:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	yep
2009-10-24T20:44:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	any ideas?  or am I sol on this?
2009-10-24T20:45:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	should be fixable
2009-10-24T20:46:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	let me check the forums on this one; what was the update that you went through by the way
2009-10-24T20:48:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/300663/
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	chromium from ppa or svn? just trying to hone forums search terms here
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	ppa
2009-10-24T20:51:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	I did a aptitude remove ~nvidia because I noticed I had nvidia stuff installed, which I assumed I didn't need
2009-10-24T21:12:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	any luck? any other info I can give you?
2009-10-24T21:13:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	this is using the ubuntu kernel or some other
2009-10-24T21:34:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	no luck on my end, I think I may just wait for 9.10 to drop and start fresh
2009-10-24T21:57:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	speaking of, where does that install the theme to?
2009-10-24T21:58:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	/usr/share/themes perhaps?
2009-10-24T21:59:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	I installed a theme not too long ago, and it wasn't there
2009-10-24T21:59:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	not sure then
2009-10-24T21:59:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	I mean, the theme is installed and works fine, but I can't find the icons for it
2009-10-24T22:00:00.000Z	bazhang	aperson	which theme? some have specific instructions on the gnome-look page for example
2009-10-24T22:01:00.000Z	aperson	bazhang	elementary, I was looking for the icons specifically, it's installed to the normal place normally
