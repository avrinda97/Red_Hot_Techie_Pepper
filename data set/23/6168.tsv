2007-01-20T09:09:00.000Z	Mikelo	IdleOne	the thing is that i just upgraded MB, RAM & processor.
2007-01-20T09:09:00.000Z	Mikelo	IdleOne	but i used the old HD's which already had ubuntu on
2007-01-20T09:10:00.000Z	Mikelo	IdleOne	and i just ran ubuntu from there
2007-01-20T09:11:00.000Z	Mikelo	IdleOne	everything works except the video card because i was using an old agp ati card before and now i have no choice but to use the onboard card
2007-01-20T09:57:00.000Z	Mikelo	IdleOne	ok i switched to vesa in the xorg configuration, gdm login starts but it crashes when uname & pass are typed
