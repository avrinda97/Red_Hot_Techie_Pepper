2012-07-18T19:06:00.000Z	Ziber		How much of a pita will it be to extend the HD space of my ubuntu install? I currently am dual-booting win7 and 12.04 but i want to move to ubuntu as my primary OS.
2012-07-18T19:08:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	please backup before any partition growing/shrinking
2012-07-18T19:08:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	of course.
2012-07-18T19:10:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	^
2012-07-18T19:13:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	installing windows after linux will overwrite the MBR, and you will need to reinstall grub and update it
2012-07-18T19:14:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	so install windows, go back into livecd for linux and update-grub?
2012-07-18T19:14:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	correct sir. You will need to bind /dev and chroot into the install partition I believe.
2012-07-18T19:16:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	and how would i do that?
2012-07-18T19:26:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	mount your install first (eg sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt)     then sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev; sudo chroot /mnt; grub-install /dev/sda; update-grub           reboot and remove cd.
2012-07-18T19:29:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	By mount the install, you mean where it puts windows?
2012-07-18T19:29:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	The two do not exactly play together, save that linux will allow you to boot into either, and linux can manipulate your windows partition, however windows will not see linux. By mount the install, I mean, if you have already installed linux, and you are about to install windows, chances are your linux install is on /dev/sda1. you can check this by typing sudo fdisk -l   or typing mount.
2012-07-18T19:30:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	let me give you some other things to mount... just in case...
2012-07-18T19:31:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	i'm pretty sure it was on the first parition, but being two HD's (ssd and one not), i forget which one ubuntu decided was a and which was called b. i dont' have the laptop in front of me atm.
2012-07-18T19:31:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	not doing this right now, i'll be doing this later this afternoon. it's my friend's laptop.
2012-07-18T19:31:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	what OS are you using right now.
2012-07-18T19:32:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	when you are ready to do this, with the equipment you want to do this on in front of you... drop back in.
2012-07-18T19:32:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	my laptop is win7 and ubuntu (soon im going to move just to ubuntu and virtualize windows) and on my friend's laptop it's currently just ubuntu 12.04 and i want to install win7 along side of that.
2012-07-18T19:32:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	yeah, i was just asking to prepare for it.
2012-07-18T19:39:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	it means something is wrongish. I would delete everything in the /tmp directory.
2012-07-18T23:17:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	I use kde, but if I am not mistaken if you hold down Ctrl in Nautilis, it will give you a list of hotkeys.
2012-07-18T23:18:00.000Z	Ziber	L3top	hm, alright
2012-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	You should not rather iTunes. The best option would be figuring out rythtmbox. For a gazillion reasons it would be offtopic to explore.
2012-07-18T23:23:00.000Z	L3top	Ziber	to check such things in the future, you can type apt-cache search playonlinux  in a terminal. Very useful. Also check apt-cache policy and apt-cache show.
