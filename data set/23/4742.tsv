2007-11-17T06:30:00.000Z	ztomic		I like gnome betta than kde
2007-11-17T06:32:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	dooglus, DerangedDingo: its all just what your used to and how you like it
2007-11-17T06:56:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	probarbly yes, it does afect upgrading from 6.10 to newer so..
2007-11-17T07:00:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	yes
2007-11-17T07:07:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	well, had problems with my 9200 radeon, since then i have only used nvidia
2007-11-17T07:09:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	I got a 9550 that will not work with fglrx worth a darn. cant get compiz to work on xorg-ati drivers. But when I put a 7200 in the machine, it works like a charm.
2007-11-17T07:10:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	same here, thats why ive switched to nvidia for life (untill open source ati drivers are done, then ill switch back)
2007-11-17T07:10:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	but i ran a single 7600GT, now 2x 8500GT in sli (A)
2007-11-17T07:11:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	sli is overkill for me
2007-11-17T07:11:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	i love overkill, have SLI, dual core 4400+ @ 2.7 ghz, and 2.5 tB, if you do something, you might aswell do it right
2007-11-17T07:11:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	I just want the dang thing to work. But you're right. It swings back and forth between NV and ATI.
2007-11-17T07:12:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	ati will reign superior soon, with open sourced driver
2007-11-17T07:13:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	it looks like I'll have to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to remove the commented sections/
2007-11-17T07:15:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	ye but its nice that they put them in there standard with a comment in front, instead of adding em all
2007-11-17T07:15:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	yeah
2007-11-17T07:16:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	back to the radeon thing... it's funny that my slow-ass 7200 runs better than may 9550... hehe.
2007-11-17T07:17:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	simple cards require simple drivers ;)
2007-11-17T07:18:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	I use that older one for vid capture in windows but I can't get capture to work in linux.
2007-11-17T07:19:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	capturing video needs some advanced tweaking, wich the ati control panel gives u in windows standard:P
2007-11-17T07:21:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	been looking for an alternative. v4l seems best but choosing a card/usb-device is difficult.
2007-11-17T07:22:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	ye thats true, i only have a webcam working so im no expert with capturing from a 3d card
2007-11-17T07:24:00.000Z	ztomic	mosibfu	yeah, I hear ya. it gets even more difficult when HDTV hits in 09 and you have to deal with encrypted video over dvi source.
2007-11-17T07:25:00.000Z	mosibfu	ztomic	true, but by that time the community will fix it hopefully
