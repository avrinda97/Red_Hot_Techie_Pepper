2007-12-19T06:33:00.000Z	ProN00b		can ubuntu feisty (64bit) write to hfs+ ?
2007-12-19T06:35:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	yes, if you don't use journaling
2007-12-19T06:36:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	how do i turn that off ?
2007-12-19T06:36:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	just mount the fs as hfs and not hfs+
2007-12-19T06:36:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	-t hfs ?
2007-12-19T06:37:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	yes. actually, it looks like 'hfsplus' is supported, so give that a try
2007-12-19T06:38:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	nope. it's full fledged
2007-12-19T06:38:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	well, if hfsplus is supported, why didn't it work when i tried
2007-12-19T06:38:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	what did you try?
2007-12-19T06:39:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	well, that's you're problem. why are you trying to create a device?
2007-12-19T06:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	i even tried with -w, and mtab showed "rw"
2007-12-19T06:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	trying to create a device ?
2007-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	mkdir /dev/sda1?
2007-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	read again
2007-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	any idea what else could be wrong ?
2007-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	you're sure that the hfs+ device is /dev/sda1?
2007-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	mount -t hfs /dev/sda1 /mnt
2007-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	^^ work?
2007-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	yeah, going to try this when i reboot, anything else i could try in case this fails ?
2007-12-19T06:42:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	specify the type. hfs for no journaling, hfsplus for journaling: mount -t hfsplus /dev/sda1 /mnt
2007-12-19T06:42:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	/mnt is a great tmp point for mounting devices
2007-12-19T07:13:00.000Z	ProN00b	atoponce	hfs mounting doesn't work
2007-12-19T07:14:00.000Z	atoponce	ProN00b	have you tried hfsplus?
