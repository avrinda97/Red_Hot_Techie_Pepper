2008-08-09T15:08:00.000Z	Dazed42		I'm newish to ubuntu.
2008-08-09T15:08:00.000Z	Dazed42		I installed it yesterday...
2008-08-09T15:09:00.000Z	Dazed42		... and spent 5 hours just getting ventrillo to work in it.
2008-08-09T15:10:00.000Z	Dazed42		Eh, I dunno.
2008-08-09T15:10:00.000Z	Dazed42		Not really, I'm just tryign to learn more.
2008-08-09T15:10:00.000Z	Dazed42		Like... see some really cool stuff you can't do in windows.
2008-08-09T15:10:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	this is a support channel, it's intended for support requests. you probably won't learn much here
2008-08-09T15:11:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	if you like tweaking, install ccsm and tune the effects yourself
2008-08-09T15:12:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	compiz configuration utility
2008-08-09T15:12:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-08-09T15:13:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	then you'll find "Advanced desktop effects settings" in system -> preferences
2008-08-09T15:15:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	you might want to enable universe in software sources
2008-08-09T15:16:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	that'll get you a LOT of packages
2008-08-09T15:29:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	install compizconfig-settings-manager and you can enable anything you like in it
2008-08-09T15:29:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	no. beryl is deprecated
2008-08-09T15:29:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	compiz fusion is what comes with ubuntu and it's the latest one
2008-08-09T15:30:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	it might be enabled by default, but system-administration-software sources
2008-08-09T15:31:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	ok, good
2008-08-09T15:34:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	they go alphabetically, except the first two or three ones
2008-08-09T15:34:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	so h is newer than g
2008-08-09T15:35:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	also, the version NUMBER is something like x.yy, where x is the year and yy is the month. example: 8.04 = 2008/04, 7.10 = 2007/10
2008-08-09T15:37:00.000Z	kenkku	Dazed42	might be /ignore JOINS PARTS
