2010-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	cough, cough, you can use wine possibly, but i wouldnt do that
2010-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	then no need to change the os either, just setup those virus renderfarms then
2010-04-04T16:50:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	sorry, i meant : why do they need linux in the 1st place?
2010-04-04T16:52:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	browser is very similar to another browser, they'll love firefox imho
2010-04-04T16:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	usually there is a 'light' access version
2010-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	jeiam	brontosaurusrex	yes, but, but this is rather unsuitable for the purpoes
2010-04-04T17:03:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	cost-effective replacement is probably google aps, http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html (althought as with exchange, i would think seven times all over before diving in.....)
2010-04-04T17:05:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	jeiam	to kinda replace exchange i meant
