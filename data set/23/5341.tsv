2007-07-25T09:15:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		VoX, Sort of
2007-07-25T09:15:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		VoX, I am offering a bounty
2007-07-25T09:16:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	any news with VIA drivers?
2007-07-25T09:22:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	I believe there is bug page in the ubuntu wiki, they supposedly hold meetings also on irc.
2007-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	Anlar Thanks.
2007-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	Anlar I believe I am using the open source Nvidia driver. "nv" in xorg.conf. How can I make sure?
2007-07-25T09:30:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	I don't use nvidia so I can't be sure. If it is in xorg.conf I say you are using it. Also try "sudo lshw" and look for your card.
2007-07-25T09:58:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	I don't think I remember your original problem. What was not working?
2007-07-25T09:58:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	Suspend to ram not completing on Nvidia 6100 chipset based mobo.
2007-07-25T10:00:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	oh, right. That is a pain. My hibernation (it is a great feature!) worked some time ago, then came the updates and it doesn't work anymore so I live with it. Take out all modules and then tell me if you find something.
2007-07-27T16:51:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	our suggestion of a diver issue preventing a 6100 chipset going to suspend was correct.
2007-07-27T16:51:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	...yesterday
2007-07-27T16:51:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	what did you do? which did you remove?
2007-07-27T16:52:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	I disabled all on-board hardware. Re-enabled until problem came back. Then disabled problem device, enabled everythign else.
2007-07-27T16:52:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	Found OHCI-HCD blocked system going to suspend.
2007-07-27T16:53:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	(USB host driver)
2007-07-27T16:53:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	that's USB!
2007-07-27T16:54:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	tried hibernate also?
2007-07-27T16:54:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	However, neither on-board or add-in Nvidious video chipset would recover properly from STR. (Suspend To Ram).
2007-07-27T16:55:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	That is, when using free driver. I have no intention of using non-free drivers.
2007-07-27T16:56:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	Apparently, according to Matthew Garrett on bug 121801, Nvidious don't give information necessary to re-initialise chipset. Done in card's BIOS which is disabled after booting.
2007-07-27T16:57:00.000Z	vox754	Nick_Hill	getting the video back is like the most important thing of coming back from a suspended state. So what now?
2007-07-27T16:59:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	vox754	I found that by using an add-in non-nvidia chipset, and removing OHCI-HCD, the machine will go into, and recover from STR. Where now? I have filed bugs. I don't know what else to do, apart from warn people off NVidia Chipsets, at least, until they start being more open.
