2011-06-29T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	little	there are some download managers available.. but I don't think any of them will magically increase your download speed
2011-06-29T14:50:00.000Z	Slart	little	they offer other functionality.. such as resuming downloads, scheduling and such
2011-06-29T14:50:00.000Z	little		ok Slart  let me know some download managers for ubuntu

2011-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	little		hello
2011-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	little		there ?
2011-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	Slart	little	there used to be a factoid about download managers.. but I can't find it now
2011-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	Slart	little	try using synaptic to search for "download manager", that should get you some hits
2011-06-29T14:54:00.000Z	little	Slart	good
2011-06-29T14:54:00.000Z	little		thanks :)
2011-06-29T14:54:00.000Z	Slart	little	here's an outdated list.. might be a good starting point though http://www.ubuntugeek.com/list-of-download-managers-available-in-ubuntu.html
