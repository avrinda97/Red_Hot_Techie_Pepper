2006-03-15T08:42:00.000Z	rukuartic		Can anyone reccomend a fairly easy to use and configure firewall?
2006-03-15T08:43:00.000Z	rukuartic		xenguy, know when drake'll be out?
2006-03-15T08:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	april isn't it?
2006-03-15T08:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Great b/day present :D
2006-03-15T08:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	:-)
2006-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Fine, steal the only thing I can help people with. T_T
2006-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	heheh
2006-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	are you root?
2006-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Don't think so
2006-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	nope
2006-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	hrm
2006-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	I have a program running as a different user
2006-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	that sounds likely
2006-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Its like this, logged in as rukuartic, run gnome-terminal and then screen ontop of that.
2006-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	as the same user?  That should not be a problem
2006-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	So we have gnome-term>screen>(user hldsadmin) and (user rukuartic)... I go run something like gedit and it doesn't want to work.
2006-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	yeah, yer into X permissions there (xauth?) -- I don't know anything else
2006-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Hmm
2006-03-22T09:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	man xauth  ?
2006-03-22T09:43:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	What's G+s do?
2006-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	rukuartic	set guid (memory circuits are failing at the moment; permissions are inherited to some extent)
2006-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	Xenguy	Sweet.
