2004-10-06T05:19:00.000Z	polok		if ubuntu has sound enabled, do I need to create a symlink to /dev/dsp to get these programs to work properly?
2004-10-06T05:20:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	symlink from where?
2004-10-06T05:21:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	from whichever device is sound to /dev/dsp
2004-10-06T05:22:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	i think /dev/dsp is created when the alsa oss-compat mixer module is loaded
2004-10-06T05:23:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	how would I do that? if you don't mind :)
2004-10-06T05:23:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	try sudo modprobe snd-mixer-oss
2004-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	it's running but I still can't get sound
2004-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	do you also have snd-pcm-oss?
2004-10-06T05:33:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	but you don't have a /dev/dsp?
2004-10-06T05:36:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	I don't have a /dev/dsp
2004-10-06T05:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	anything in dmesg or /var/log/syslog about dsp?
2004-10-06T05:38:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	it says nothing about dsp
2004-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	that's about as much as I thought I knew about alsa, i'm afraid
2004-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	hey, do you have a printer port?
2004-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	yep
2004-10-06T05:40:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	:|
2004-10-06T05:41:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	were there solutions?
2004-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	well I have /dev/dsp
2004-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	it's just not letting me use it
2004-10-06T05:56:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	i think esd grabs it. which app are you trying to use
2004-10-06T05:56:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	just the media player that comes with gnome
2004-10-06T06:48:00.000Z	sabdfl	polok	we deliberately chose not to install build-essential (my call)
2004-10-06T06:49:00.000Z	polok	sabdfl	I don't like that for now
