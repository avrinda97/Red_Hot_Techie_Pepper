2011-03-17T20:46:00.000Z	Liam		Anyone? I'm trying to register a new driver and I can't find a .inf file in the driver so I can't follow the ubuntu site's help

2011-03-17T20:48:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	If its a windows driver installer, the driver files will be packed inside the installer. Use something like UniExtract to get ithem out of it. That's a windows tool, and I don't know of a linux equivalent. I have no idea why linux would be able to use a windows driver...
2011-03-17T20:48:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Don't know if it would be able to use it. .... .
2011-03-17T20:50:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	use "Shoryu:" at the beginning... it'll notify me that you messaged me.
2011-03-17T20:52:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	Righto, will do. Anyway of doing it then, I know what the driver is I need, I just don't know how to get it into ubuntu.
2011-03-17T20:55:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Um... well if you're d/ling a windows driver... an exe. That will not work afaik. You need to get the linux version of the driver.
2011-03-17T20:55:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	What "ubuntu" tutorial are you following anyways?
2011-03-17T20:56:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	Wireless troubleshooting section on the help section for the latest version. I don't think I'll be able to find a linux version :L
2011-03-17T20:58:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Paste a URL
2011-03-17T20:58:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	https://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/internet/C/troubleshooting-wireless.html
2011-03-17T21:01:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Ah... I see ... NDISWrapper .... Well.. Like I said, there WILL be an INF file. Windows must have that. What is in the folder the installer extracts? And are you able to use UniExtract on a windows computer?
2011-03-17T21:01:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Also make sure you haven't simply downloaded a utility rather than a wireless driver.
2011-03-17T21:04:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	I'm fairly sure it's a driver, in the folder I got when I ran the .exe I found a variety of .dlls and .exes. I don't know if that software works but I don't know it's necessary. Is there any way I can find the drivers windows has a take the .inf from there?
2011-03-17T21:06:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	If there's another setup.exe, it would be in there. Run UniExtract on it so that it doesn't put it whereever it pleases.
2011-03-17T21:06:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	its tough picking out the driver from the windows/system32/drivers folder after it installs it. That's why I use UniExtract.
2011-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	I tried UniExtract on the exe, and I got exactly the same as when I ran it on its own. I used the setup.exe too, and that looks like it's going to put the drivers in System32 and to a restart :L
2011-03-17T21:11:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	There will be an inf file in there somewhere.
2011-03-17T21:12:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Tell me what driver you got... link me to it.
2011-03-17T21:13:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	Ack. *facepalm* There is a .inf file there. It was stuck between a .ini and a .inx, is why I didn't see it D:
2011-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	INX?? ... ppl using crazy file exts ... well glad you found it. Good luck with that.
2011-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	Shoryu	Liam	Thank you for using the live help system.
2011-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	Liam	Shoryu	XD Thanks, don't worry, I'll be back if something else goes wrong :P
