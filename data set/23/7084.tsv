2005-10-19T10:15:00.000Z	florah		ok killing esd did the trick (thanks modzero), but how can i get both game-sounds and desktop/totem sounds to work?
2005-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	florah		!tell limguohong91 restricted formats
2005-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	florah		start esd <--- command not found
2005-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	florah		ok thanks
2005-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	florah		i guess i need to learn more about this sound business cuz that is confusing!
2005-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	florah		(turn off the sound daemon so sound in games will work)

2005-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	no, it isn't. Read /msg ubotu relationship for what it actually is
2005-10-19T10:22:00.000Z	florah	apokryphos	thanks for the hair-splitting ;)
2005-10-19T10:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	use /msg for investigating with ubotu
2005-10-19T10:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	what?
2005-10-19T10:24:00.000Z	florah	apokryphos	msg ubotu relationship ?
2005-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	is there a reason for why you're not using /msg ?
2005-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	and being annoying
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	florah	apokryphos	i could've sworn yesterday i just used !tell
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	so what? Please don't use it; use /msg when telling yourself factoids
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	florah	apokryphos	wrong side of the bed this morning?
2005-10-19T10:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	no; maybe, just maybe, the problem is with you and not me? ;-)
2005-10-19T10:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	florah	yeah, sure. Well, I'm not gonna tell you again :)
2005-10-19T10:31:00.000Z	florah	apokryphos	thanks for being so sweet about it :)
