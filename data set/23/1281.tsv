2010-06-01T09:45:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Is it because of your location?
2010-06-01T09:46:00.000Z	Semperfi40		You're located in Sweden sooo maybe that has something to do with it
2010-06-01T09:46:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Idk :P
2010-06-01T09:47:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Is there another Support Channel for Ubuntu ?

2010-06-01T09:52:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	add 'apm power_off=1' to /etc/modules then reboot
2010-06-01T09:53:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	what is this in refrence to ?
2010-06-01T09:53:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	problem shutting down and with sound?  I might be mistaken, maybe got the wrong handle
2010-06-01T09:54:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	My system will sometimes freeze on the ubuntu logo, and sometimes when I restart I won't have any sound, and sometimes when I shutdown or restart via the GUI nothing will happen OR it will boot me back to a login screen.
2010-06-01T09:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	so try what i said up there ^^
2010-06-01T09:56:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	Can you tell me specifically what that will do. So I can learn. So if this fixes my problem and I find someone else that has the same issue I will know what I'm talking about .
2010-06-01T09:59:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	adding it to yada yada directory
2010-06-01T10:04:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	then reboot.  if it doesn't fixit then remove that line from that file
2010-06-01T10:04:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	it gives sets an option to the apm kernel module for when it gets loaded, to turn it off, or power it off or whatever
2010-06-01T10:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	here is the source code if you need more info :)  http://enpc3240.eas.asu.edu/lxr/linux/http/source/arch/i386/kernel/apm.c?v=2.6.17.10
2010-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	Someone asked me what kernel I was running earlier. Why would this be a possible issue? Also they asked if I was positive I had erased my previous installation of Ubuntu.
2010-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	In relation to my current problem
2010-06-01T10:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	because each kernel version would have different code managing the power stuff possibly, so it might be fixed in a newer one.  they probably though you were using your old kernel
2010-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	codebrainz	Semperfi40	at the console type 'uname -r' to see what version is currently running
2010-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	Semperfi40	codebrainz	When I installed Lucid Lynx I told Gparted to format the old partition. However when I boot, I have the ability to pick from two different Ubuntu's effectively though the wording and version numbers are exactly the same...
