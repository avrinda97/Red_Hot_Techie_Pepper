2005-05-15T13:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	aladdin_	have you tried installing libx11-dev ? i think djm62's command will install needed dependencies
2005-05-15T13:36:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	checkin'
2005-05-15T13:37:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	libx11-dev is not installed.
2005-05-15T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	aladdin_	use synaptic or apt-get to install it
2005-05-15T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool		a colleague of mine has, with warty
2005-05-15T13:40:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	k. but just to understand: do you mean that configure couldn't find the "includes" and "librairies" because there not installed?
2005-05-15T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool		oh, sorry, i meant dual processor
2005-05-15T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool		aladdin: yeah. usually you need to install a "-dev" package to get include files
2005-05-15T13:41:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	... cause I thought it was because that particular installer is looking for XFree86's by default.
2005-05-15T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool		well, try installing libx11-dev and see what happens
2005-05-15T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool		sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
2005-05-15T13:42:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	k
2005-05-15T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool		the thrill of finding dependencies for compiling wears thin before long ;)
2005-05-15T13:43:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	it's installed. I'll retry configure... bbl
2005-05-15T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool		good luck
2005-05-15T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool		looks like it's a kde app - you'll probably need other packages
2005-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool		can't you just install gwenview from apt?
2005-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool		ah
2005-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool		well, the comment re other -dev packages stands
2005-05-15T13:46:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	actually I am running under K (Kubuntu) and all packages work well includinf gwenview. This is a external addon to it, not Ubuntu prepared, but debian compatible.
2005-05-15T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	aladdin_	ok, but it's quite likely you'll needed kde-type -dev packages. ./configure should give you a clue
2005-05-15T13:50:00.000Z	aladdin_	HappyFool	... k now configure goes further (so our thing worked). I get a new error: can't find zlib. Gues I try to install it from synaptic too....
2005-05-15T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	aladdin_	get djm62 to help you with that "apt-get build-dep" thing
