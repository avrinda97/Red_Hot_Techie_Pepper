2007-05-09T14:53:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica		Hi everyone, I'm in rural Costa Rica helping with a new internet cafe -- got a few questions on edgy
2007-05-09T14:53:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica		Why would the bootable CD drop me down to BusyBox?  It doesn't make it to the graphical part
2007-05-09T14:55:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	maybe it doesn't like your disk-controller. have you tried to boot without 'quiet splash' to see at which point it fails?
2007-05-09T14:57:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	so it loads the main menu and i go to the "more options" side?
2007-05-09T14:58:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	ok cool doing it now.  This is awesome, these kids in Costa Rica are gonna learn ubuntu
2007-05-09T14:59:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	press F6 and delete teh quiet splash options... you need to read what gets on screen
2007-05-09T14:59:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	ok it looks like a a ton of I/O errors on fd0 -- no clue why the floppy drive matters so much.  I'm going to disconnect/disable it
2007-05-09T15:00:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	after a bunch of I/O errors on floppy, it bombs to busybox
2007-05-09T15:00:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	do a CD selftest..
2007-05-09T15:01:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	ok thanks.  will report back (i'm sure internet will get disconnected once or twice)
2007-05-09T15:01:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	mucho appreciado!
2007-05-09T15:01:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	what kind of hardware do you have there?
2007-05-09T15:02:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	its a celeron 500 with 256mb ram
2007-05-09T15:02:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	kinda sad, they had a bunch of windows boxes working, then the crappy power company had a surge when a transformer blew up
2007-05-09T15:02:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	i'm with one of my best buddies, he's the peace corps volunteer setting this up
2007-05-09T15:02:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	and you are trying to install which ubuntu-version?
2007-05-09T15:03:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	edgy.  should i step it down to 6.06?
2007-05-09T15:04:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	edgy is ... errmmm, i'm glad it's obsolete now... Yeah, i'd recommend 6.06 LTS for your case
2007-05-09T15:05:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	yeah i'm getting lots of "ATA2:  port failed to respond" errors.  hasn't yet dropped to busybox yet since killing the floppy drive
2007-05-09T15:06:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	in edgy there are a lot of experiments, like upstart and libata... take Dapper... less trouble
2007-05-09T15:07:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	i see.  well i think the hard drive controller could be the issue.  i'll hack away with some of these other drives.  I'm here to help see what got blown up and what is good
2007-05-09T15:07:00.000Z	stefg	BertoInCostaRica	see !install and click your way through to the boot-options listing
2007-05-09T15:07:00.000Z	BertoInCostaRica	stefg	thanks!  that's what i need
