2009-03-22T22:38:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	hey! i dropped. do you know where the advanced tab in k3b is?
2009-03-22T22:39:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: what cd/dvd burning software do you use?
2009-03-22T22:40:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: ok, i actually want to keep using brasero since its default in ubuntu, but since i cant find a similar by pass to brasero that i found in k3b, then ill just try k3b.
2009-03-22T22:41:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: w00t! where? :-P
2009-03-22T22:43:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	wow! :-P i couldn't find it. :-P thanks, will try to burn a data dvd with that setting on now.
2009-03-22T22:43:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	i must be blind. :-P will tell you if it works...
2009-03-22T23:38:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	sorry about the slow response, yes, it worked. :-) burn, then verify, without ejecting tray! :-D
2009-03-23T01:37:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	can you please post a link again. :-) anyways ive tried many things so far. :-/ im about to give up! :-O
2009-03-23T01:42:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: yes, i tried that. and then it would burn and verify without ejecting disc. it worked for the first disc i was going to burn, but then when i tried 2,3,4,5 then it failed at verifying and k3b actually crashed. :-/
2009-03-23T01:44:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: yes, i did one, then i closed k3b, and reopened it. wont that work?
2009-03-23T01:45:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: ok, hmmm, will have to try tommorow. time for bed, going to work early tommorow. see you around, hopefully tommorow. :-P
2009-03-23T20:09:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	hey! around?
2009-03-23T20:12:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: just got back from work. will try to get k3b/brasero to work now. so i have selected the setting, skip eject tray after burn in k3b, and the first time i burn a data dvd, it burns it, verifies it and completes. then when i decided to burn another data cd with some other data on, the verifying fails. :-/ any thoughts?
2009-03-25T01:21:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	yes! ;-) just came home, been at work all day and then went to my girlfriends place. 10:20 pm now, so not much time left for trying to solve this today. :-/ have to wake up at 6:30 tommorow.
2009-03-25T01:21:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	huh?
2009-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: only k3b/brasero. all are based on the same things, so all will fail?
2009-03-25T01:32:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	my problem seems to be related to all programs, because of what all dvd burning programs are based on...
2009-03-25T01:34:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	yes, a lot. :-/
2009-03-28T19:32:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: hello! :-)
2009-03-28T19:34:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: nope, im just going to skip verification in brasero, ill do manual verification.
2009-03-28T21:36:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: yes, the problem has been fixed in newer versions of brasero, but ubuntu repos are not updated yet with a newer version. so meantime i will manually check/verify my burnt disc. i found the brasero author on irc.gimp.org and asked him, and he helped. he is on #brasero on this network as well now. :-)
2009-03-28T21:38:00.000Z	kristian_	HammerHead66	: so if you have any question about brasero, he can help. :-)
