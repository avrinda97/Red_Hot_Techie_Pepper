2006-11-30T13:40:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		my hd is already ntfs
2006-11-30T13:40:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		any free software i could use
2006-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		gparted is an ubuntu app or windows?
2006-11-30T13:42:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		im sorry im new at this, what is the hybrid cd
2006-11-30T13:42:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		yeah, i just downloaded and burned it
2006-11-30T13:43:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		6.10
2006-11-30T13:43:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		i think thats the latest
2006-11-30T13:44:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		lemme check
2006-11-30T13:44:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
2006-11-30T13:45:00.000Z	imsickurdcure		is that the right version?
2006-11-30T13:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	that'd be fine. just burn it, and reboot with the cd in your drive
2006-11-30T13:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	make sure you burn it as an image, and not just put the file on a cd
2006-11-30T13:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	no, 6.10 would be the best choice for a normal user, imho
2006-11-30T13:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	no, its a stable release. just not a lts release
2006-11-30T13:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	yes
2006-11-30T13:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	after booting you will be in a live environment. clicking the install icon on the desktop will give you a wizard, helping you to perform the installation
2006-11-30T13:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	yes it will
2006-11-30T13:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	defragmentation is a must if you are planning on resizeing
2006-11-30T13:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	you will be looking as severe data loss if you dont, and having a full backup is always a good idea
2006-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	that depends on how much you need. ;)
2006-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	minimum 5gb, id say, for / and /home
2006-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	10-15gb will be fine
2006-11-30T13:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	imsickurdcure	if you format with the standard ext3 file system, you can use ext2ifs to access it from windows
