2010-09-04T08:38:00.000Z	ElementalDragon		*sigh*
2010-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	ElementalDragon		So..... i'm thinking about trying 10.10 beta.... but get the feeling i'll have the same issue as when i tried Lucid
2010-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	#ubuntu+1 for that
2010-09-04T08:41:00.000Z	ElementalDragon	bazhang	 well.... i'm pretty sure that any issue i'd have with 10.10 would be the same issue i had with Lucid.... so i'm pretty sure either channel would work
2010-09-04T08:42:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	then you would think wrong; #ubuntu+1 is for 10.10 discussion Only
2010-09-04T08:44:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	then fix the issue with 10.04
2010-09-04T08:44:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	so ask a question then
2010-09-04T08:45:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	so you don't have Ubuntu now?
2010-09-04T08:46:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	so what was the support issue? this is not a complaints channel
2010-09-04T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	and you never even tried the alternate cd? nor any bootoptions?
2010-09-04T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	you didn't md5 the iso, burn slowly and do the disk integrity check?
2010-09-04T08:48:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	as you are not even running ubuntu nor trying to, nothing can be done.
2010-09-04T08:52:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	correct
2010-09-04T08:56:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	download and try it then. we'll still be here to troubleshoot
2010-09-04T08:57:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	this is not a chat channel. please keep chat to #ubuntu-offtopic , thanks
2010-09-04T10:26:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	there is no wallpaper on the alternate cd
2010-09-04T10:27:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	no there is not. you downloaded the wrong cd then
2010-09-04T10:28:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	thats not supported here
2010-09-04T10:28:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	#ubuntu+1 as I said before
2010-09-04T10:29:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	this is not up for debate. thats the correct channel. be patient
2010-09-04T10:30:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	get the alternate 10.04 cd and we can troubleshoot
2010-09-04T10:34:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	please stop asking for assistance with the beta here.
2010-09-04T10:35:00.000Z	bazhang	ElementalDragon	you just installed 10.10
