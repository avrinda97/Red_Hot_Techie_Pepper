2008-08-30T19:53:00.000Z	Threethan		So, I just discovered that my router might not be compatible with Ubuntu. Has anyone else had this problem?
2008-08-30T19:54:00.000Z	Threethan		Hmm. Let me look at the page I was looking at, to see if I can explain it better.
2008-08-30T19:55:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	how is your router connected? usb or ethernet?
2008-08-30T20:13:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	what is your local IP? check with /sbin/ifconfig
2008-08-30T20:14:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	ipconfig.
2008-08-30T20:16:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	it's a windows command, so yes it will
2008-08-30T20:18:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	ipconfig | more
2008-08-30T20:19:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	#ubuntu+1. youre OT here
2008-08-30T20:20:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	off topic
2008-08-30T20:20:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	don't bother about other people, bother about your own problem and do what I told you
2008-08-30T20:21:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	I asked you something
2008-08-30T20:21:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	and I told you how to slow it down
2008-08-30T20:23:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	then do what I asked you
2008-08-30T20:23:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	you use intrepid?
2008-08-30T20:24:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	what are you running? right now?
2008-08-30T20:24:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	last chance. run the command I told you about
2008-08-30T20:31:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	in ubuntu: ifconfig -a
2008-08-30T20:45:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	what ethernet chip?
2008-08-30T20:45:00.000Z	Threethan	wols_	That's a new one. Let me look into that. Lol.
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	I asked you lots of things which you all ignored
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	Threethan	wols_	I didn't ignore it. I replied, you confused me with someone else.
2008-08-30T20:49:00.000Z	wols_	Threethan	it's nice how you ignored my question again. I think I will ignore you too frm now on. HAND
2008-08-30T20:50:00.000Z	Threethan	wols_	: again, I wasn't ignoring you. Take it as a personal insult if you want, but it's not. I'm trying to answer the questions that I'm asked from people that are trying to help me, just like you are. I appreciate the effort, but I can't answer fifty people at once, and still try to answer the questions fully.
