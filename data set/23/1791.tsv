2010-04-04T04:02:00.000Z	julio		well paste the config then
2010-04-04T04:02:00.000Z	julio		you're right might save some time
2010-04-04T04:04:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	yes I think so, let me see if I can find the tutorial I used.
2010-04-04T03:56:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	if you connect one up and not the other and you have conky installed, then I can.
2010-04-04T03:57:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	I know what you mean. I can pastebin my config file if you want.
2010-04-04T03:58:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	maybe first wanna see how it looks
2010-04-04T03:59:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	is that asking for a screenshot?
2010-04-04T03:59:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	we're understanding each other hehe, iá¸¿ lil picky on the arrangement of meters :p
2010-04-04T04:00:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	you could always edit mine to suit your needs (that how I developed it).
2010-04-04T04:00:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	so where can i see it?
2010-04-04T04:01:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	mine shows tempurature sensors, which you would have to set up on your machine, and the setup would have to change a little for each machine, so the temps might not display properly.
2010-04-04T04:01:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	I could try pastebin a screenshot. I was kinda hoping of pastebining the config and then you open your conky with it and see what it looks like. it also makes it easier for you to edit to your tastes.
2010-04-04T04:02:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	i've installed lmsensors some time ago but i think there's some setup missing...
2010-04-04T04:02:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	yea, that and hddtemp. I couldnt get lmsensors working properly on my one machine, but it works find on the other, the funny thing is, hardware wise the machines are almost identicle.
2010-04-04T04:03:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	is there some steps to follow after installing lm?
2010-04-04T04:05:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	Im having trouble finding the config file, do you know where its kept by default?
2010-04-04T04:05:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	let me check
2010-04-04T04:05:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	found it.
2010-04-04T04:06:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	http://paste.ubuntu.com/408812/
2010-04-04T04:07:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	there should be links in there for the tutorials, I hope they are the right links.
2010-04-04T04:08:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	it says lm-monitor I think it meant to say lm-sensors
2010-04-04T04:10:00.000Z	julio	knoppies	thanks but i can't do it right now... dinner call :D, thanks anyway, i guess i'll be back on a couple of hours
2010-04-04T04:10:00.000Z	knoppies	julio	take your time. You might want to save the config file before its removed off pastebin though.
