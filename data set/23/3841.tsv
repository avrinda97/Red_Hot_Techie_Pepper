2010-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	that wont work, the drivers are 32bit. you will need to download the 64bit drivers
2010-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	harish	ActionParsnip	thanks
2010-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	you dont have to download gparted, its on the repo
2010-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	sudo apt-get install gparted
2010-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	if you have an install CD you can add it as a repo and install that way
2010-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	or even boot to the liveCD and use gparted there
2010-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	harish	ActionParsnip	many thanks, it got installed through terminal
2010-03-22T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	in ubuntu its rare to actually download apps, most stuff is installed vi the official repos or by adding extra repos
2010-03-22T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	same with java and flash etc
2010-03-22T10:20:00.000Z	harish	ActionParsnip	i am actually trying to install ubtuntu 64bit, i am currently using 32bit
2010-03-22T10:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	then boot to the install cd, wipe out the 32bit install (after backing up your stuff) and install a clean 64bit OS
2010-03-22T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	did you MD5 test the ISO you used to make the USB bootable with?
2010-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	harish	ActionParsnip	i guess, the amd64 bit will work for intel also....it says "core" in the brackets
2010-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	yes, amd64 wil will on intel64 too

2010-03-22T10:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	nope, clean install only i'm afraid
2010-03-22T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	as long as the image you dowloaded tested as ok and you mae it right it will work
2010-03-22T10:48:00.000Z	harish	ActionParsnip	i downloaded the image through direct download
2010-03-22T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harish	doesnt matter, it still neds md5 testing
