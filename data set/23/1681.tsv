2010-02-18T13:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	Are you sure you need ndiswrapper, have you tried just grabbing the firmware for your card?
2010-02-18T13:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	ndiswrapper is usually *not* the best way to go for bradcom cards, and to use the broadcom drivers ( that are already on the CD ) you would just need to add /lib/firmware/b43/ to the squashfs image on the iso, which while somewhat involved is less so than ndiswrapper and also will take less space AND is likely to be more stable.
2010-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	You could also just put take the /lib/firmware/b43 from your hard drive and copy it into /lib/firmware in the live environment and run "sudo rmmod b43 && sudo modprobe b43"
2010-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	I follow that. But I thought the live environment couldn't be written to.  I have always used ndiswrapper and such, because I followed the networking/wlan sticky
2010-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	And I couldn't get wireless to work any other way
2010-02-18T13:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	The Live environment keeps changes to the file system in RAM, so it's just like a normal system except the changes will be lost when you reboot ( and you are limited in how much you can write by your available RAM )
2010-02-18T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	Did you try installing b43-fwcutter while connected via ethernet ( it needs to download the firmware for legal reasons ) or downloading the firmware directly and just moving it to /lib/firmware/b43 ?
2010-02-18T13:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	If you weren't connected to the internet when you installed b43-fwcutter it wouldn't have worked ( I know that sounds stupid, but broadcom won't allow Ubuntu to distribute their firmware so it has to be downloaded from broadcom's site )
2010-02-18T13:40:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	Actually fwcutter is in the ubuntu repo. My drivers are bcmwl5 though.
2010-02-18T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	Yes, the package is in the repos and that package contains a script that downloads the firmware from broadcom's website when you install it, the firmware is not contained in the package itself
2010-02-18T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	If you are not connected to the internet when you install the package it will not work.
2010-02-18T13:44:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	I see, but would it work on drivers that weren't 43xx series?
2010-02-18T13:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	Can you pastebin the output from "lspci" ?
2010-02-18T13:47:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	One minute
2010-02-18T13:51:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	 here it is....http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m19d680fd
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	I see. it IS 43xx
2010-02-18T14:00:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	So if I d/l it from Broadcom and replace the B43-fwcutter in the ISO with the d/l one then burn, it should work?
2010-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	The easiest way to do it is to install b43-fwcutter on your main machine, when it downloads and extracts the firmware from broadcom's site it will create two directories, /lib/firmware/b43 and /lib/firmware/b43-legacy, you can just copy those in the live Session or remaster the CD to add those directories.
2010-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	Sounds good.  I assume there is a lib section in the ISO to put those files in?
2010-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	Yes
2010-02-18T14:08:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	Thank you.  I truly appreciate the help.  I am about 6 months into ubuntu now, and trying to learn everything at once :)
2010-02-18T14:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lostinspace_46	np :)
2010-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	And you don't even come with a disclaimer..LOL
