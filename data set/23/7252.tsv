2006-12-27T08:55:00.000Z	Riyonuk		How do I remove flash or shockwave from my firefox? Its not listed in Add-Ons
2006-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	Riyonuk		yeah
2006-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	Riyonuk		thanks
2006-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	Riyonuk		Seem to be having "issues". I run, in a terminal, nm-applet, and it starts the little thing in my notification area. The moment I quit the terminal, so does the little thing. Why is this?
2006-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	Whenever you run an applet in the terminal, it dies out with the terminal.
2006-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	You can get around this by putting the process in the background...
2006-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	how?
2006-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	Try pressing Ctrl + z, (puts process in suspended state) and then typing "bg"
2006-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	I have a simple shell script to do that though, when I want to start a program like that I make a script in /usr/bin that goes something along the lines of "/usr/bin/programtorun &" where the & puts it in the background
2006-12-27T09:00:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	so what exactly do I type? nm-applet bg?
2006-12-27T09:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	No, more like "nm-applet &", or "nm-applet", then "ctrl+z" and then type "bg"
2006-12-27T09:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	I remember seeing something about the Alacarte Menu Editor...
2006-12-27T09:20:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	it says "Alacarte is now only available as a part of the GNOME desktop, beginning with GNOME 2.16."
2006-12-27T09:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	Are you on KDE?
2006-12-27T09:22:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	Im on gnome
2006-12-27T09:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	So you don't have the menu editor installed?
2006-12-27T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	You should just be able to press "Alt-F2" and type in "alacarte"
2006-12-27T09:23:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	well I do, but I dont want to edit the menus, I want to make it so where Appplications, Places, and Systems arent there, just the ubuntu logo
2006-12-27T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	Right click the ubuntu thing, click remove. Then right click, hit "Add", and sellect "Main Menu"
2006-12-27T09:24:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	thanks :)
2006-12-27T09:25:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	No problem :D
2006-12-27T09:25:00.000Z	Riyonuk	rukuartic	I bet you get a kick out of helping noobs :p
2006-12-27T09:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	Riyonuk	Haha. You could say that. I just like Ubuntu so much :D
