2007-06-27T09:20:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		hi, i am facing a problem when booting up on ubuntu
2007-06-27T09:21:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		when gnome starts to load, it some how hangs
2007-06-27T09:21:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		is anyone facing the same problem?
2007-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	mat1980	UrbanMystic	never. Have you enough free space?
2007-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	UrbanMystic	mat1980	in my home partition? yes i do
2007-06-27T09:24:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		even in my root partition i have enough
2007-06-27T09:24:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		infact, even my brother's laptop with ubuntu was giving the same problem mat1980
2007-06-27T09:26:00.000Z	mat1980	UrbanMystic	does it give you some message?
2007-06-27T09:26:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		nope no messages come up
2007-06-27T09:27:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		actually it doesnt hang always, but it takes just too long to load
2007-06-27T09:28:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		maybe half hour or so, i dont know coz i restart the GUI and login again and again until it works
2007-06-27T09:29:00.000Z	mat1980	UrbanMystic	/var/log/messages or /var/log/user.log do contain something about this?
2007-06-27T09:30:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		let me see
2007-06-27T09:33:00.000Z	UrbanMystic	mat1980	i have pasted the log here: http://pastebin.com/937574
2007-06-27T09:33:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		see if u can see any important msg
2007-06-27T09:34:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		i also tried to delete the .gnome* directories from my home folder
2007-06-27T09:34:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		i believe that resets the setting. correct me if i am wrong
2007-06-27T09:35:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		but even that doesn't work every time
2007-06-27T09:39:00.000Z	mat1980	UrbanMystic	please paste ~/.xsession-errors
2007-06-27T09:44:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		http://cpp.sourceforge.net/?show=37712
2007-06-27T09:44:00.000Z	UrbanMystic	mat1980	pastebin seems to be giving prob
2007-06-27T09:44:00.000Z	UrbanMystic		so i pasted here: http://cpp.sourceforge.net/?show=37712
2007-06-27T09:56:00.000Z	mat1980	UrbanMystic	can't find something useful. filemp3-c.c:line518(III_huffman_decode):assertionfailed:(i<=SSLIMIT*SBLIMIT) could be the problem, but I'm not sure at all. Could be that gnome tries to start rhythmbox and then stops after its crash? Does rhythmbox start automatically on startup?
