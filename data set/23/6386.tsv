2006-10-26T11:52:00.000Z	kupesoft		when the eft isos be available?
2006-10-26T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	sometime within the next 26 hours, probably.
2007-01-18T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	yes, you can use PAM
2007-01-18T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	--purge flag (apt-get remove --purge [package] )
2007-01-18T13:16:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	I don't know the names of the packages that have already been removed, but there are quite a few and I need to get rid of their config files,
2007-01-28T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	you'll be fine with generic
2007-01-28T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	of course, youd be fine with -server too.  So, whatever you currently have, just... stick with it ;)
2007-01-28T08:19:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	I just installed generic in place of server for module/driver support, in case you missed that
2007-01-28T08:19:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	make sure you remove the ubuntu-server (and linux-image-server, and uh, linux-restricted-server, or watever) after you've swapped kernels
2007-01-28T08:19:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	or you'll keep getting updates for both -generic and -esrver kernels
2007-01-28T08:19:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	I'll keep it in case I need it,
2007-01-28T08:20:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	Does it matter?
2007-01-28T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	keep the kernel, don't keep the meta packages.
2007-01-28T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	let me check
2007-01-28T08:23:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	thanks,
2007-01-28T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	linux-server and linux-image-server (but not the linux-[version] -server if you want to keep the kernel itself)
2007-01-28T08:28:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	What will uninstalling them do?
2007-03-16T05:50:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	hsimah, there's absolutely no reason to set a root password.
2007-03-16T05:50:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	There's plenty of reason, to have a root account.
2007-03-16T05:50:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	no, there isn't.
2007-03-16T05:51:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	Having a root account is a reason. Therefore, there is a reason.
2007-03-16T05:52:00.000Z	Flannel	kupesoft	Don't recommend in #ubuntu that people set a root password, it only creates headaches later on.  For the user, and support.
2007-03-16T05:52:00.000Z	kupesoft	Flannel	Fair enough.
