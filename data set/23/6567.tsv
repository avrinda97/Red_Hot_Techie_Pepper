2006-03-15T10:21:00.000Z	tristanmike		!automatix
2006-03-15T10:23:00.000Z	tristanmike		"for people who know to care" ? what does that mean?
2006-03-15T10:24:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	people new to Ubuntu (or Linux, or anything for that matter) are generally not ready to worry about things like configuration files
2006-03-15T10:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	what :?
2006-03-15T10:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	all the more reason not to put them in a position that will send them here saying "I used automatix, now my box is borked"
2006-03-15T10:26:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	I've yet to see automatix break anything.  Sure it's a kludge, and it does some ugly things, it certainly won't break a new system
2006-03-15T10:27:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	well, if you haven't seen anything then I can't say anything, my experience here has been quite different
2006-03-15T10:27:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	which version(s) of automatix?  which Ubuntu?  never heard of this before
2006-03-15T10:28:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	breezy, alot of java problems
2006-03-15T10:29:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	odd.  I've used it on a few systems and it never gave me trouble.
2006-03-15T10:30:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	it's not absolutely horrible, great idea, and in the right direction. check out this comparison http://nalioth.hostdestroyer.com/comparison.html
2006-03-15T10:33:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	thanks, never even heard of EasyUbuntu... I'll check out more
2006-03-15T10:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	no problem :)
2006-03-15T11:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	;)
2006-03-15T11:19:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	haha... Let's use learning for evil!
2006-03-15T11:42:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	not if he got the svn
2006-03-15T11:42:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	sorry, didn't realize you had him get the subversion.  I'll let you take it from here
2006-03-15T11:42:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	I think we'll be needing your advice my friend
2006-03-15T11:43:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	ok
2006-03-15T11:45:00.000Z	ithicine	tristanmike	I think we've got him trying to do the subversion and the latest snapshot at the same time
2006-03-15T11:45:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	I'm following the readme
2006-03-15T12:31:00.000Z	tristanmike	ithicine	i'm in #ubuntu-offtopic ready to rock and rant :P
