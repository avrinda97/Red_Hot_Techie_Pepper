2008-09-10T17:48:00.000Z	uffo		currently there is ntfs and if you think it is fine and safe to use ntfs for file storage then it is fine by me but do i have to know something that causes problems or some hint that i do not know. i even download all files there
2008-09-10T17:48:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	why is ntfs there and where is it?
2008-09-10T17:50:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	it is on same hdd where ubuntu is installed, ubuntu is 7gb+swap 1gb and 112gb ntfs for files
2008-09-10T17:50:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	yeah im guessing you put ntfs there by habit? or is it required for access when you reboot into windows?
2008-09-10T17:51:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	ok you can remove it and reformat it to ext3. if you know you wont need to access that drive/partition when you bott that machione into windows(which it sounds like you dont have setup as dual boot)
2008-09-10T17:51:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	of cource back up your files first.
2008-09-10T17:53:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	infact i personally dont trust these crossbreeding drivers that step across halfarsed legal terrirtory..ntfs-g has narfed some of my files before so i see no point in dedicating a drive on my machine to a system that doesnt run on it.
2008-09-10T17:55:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	my normal setup for a machione is to partition the main drive like thus : 1: swap=1g, 2: ext3=10g system mounted on "/", 3: ext3(rest of drive space) mounted on "/home"
2008-09-10T17:57:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	the last partition i mention is where you keep your files
2008-09-10T17:57:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	it's also the place you would normally call your 'my documents' folder
2008-09-10T17:59:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	and windows programs can write still to ext3
2008-09-10T17:59:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	no. but if your not running windows on that machine it wont matter
2008-09-10T18:00:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	if other windows machine need to access it you would use networking or a usb drive like an ipod
2008-09-10T18:00:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	which is the normal course of action between two windows machines.
2008-09-10T18:01:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	wait do you tell that when i use utorrent in ubuntu then it cannot write data anymore for example
2008-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	through wine? no you wont need ntfs. your base system underneath the wine translation layer is still unix, not windows
2008-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	oh thanks, i asked because i use windows games and software in ubuntu alot
2008-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	so do i
2008-09-10T18:04:00.000Z	airtonix	uffo	i actually prefer to use transmission instead of utorrent
2008-09-10T18:09:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	but transmission cannot change client header and some trackers do not allow it and utorrent has some needed features like udp tracker and udp port changing etc
2008-09-10T18:25:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	i created ext3 drive but i cannot write it changes owner is root, do i have to revert back to ntfs then ubuntu restrictions cannot apply
2008-09-10T18:27:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	when i created ntfs and mounted it then it was writeable. how i can set permissions with GUI
2008-09-10T18:32:00.000Z	uffo	airtonix	tryed to remove permissions without sucess, only hope is to revert to ntfs then it is writeable
