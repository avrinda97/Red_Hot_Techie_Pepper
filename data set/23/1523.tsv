2010-02-12T19:54:00.000Z	lucas71		hello everyone
2010-02-12T19:55:00.000Z	lucas71		could you tell me how can I connect 2 comp with Ubu for share folders...?
2010-02-12T19:55:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	Samba
2010-02-12T19:57:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	then all you need to do is share a directory / folder on one of them
2010-02-12T20:00:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	unfortunately I can't see my computers each other in network... I have shared one folder but I cant see it on another comp...
2010-02-12T20:02:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	how did you create the shared folders?
2010-02-12T20:03:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	right click and share
2010-02-12T20:05:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2010-02-12T20:07:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	this may be better for you to follow:  http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/SAMBA_Filesharing
2010-02-12T20:12:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	thanks, I can see another comp from my own but there is ask for password... I'm trying to write all my passwords but all are odd..
2010-02-12T20:13:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	the pwd should be the pwd you set when you created the samba user, not your username password.
2010-02-12T20:14:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	unless of course you made the samba user your username and pwd.
2010-02-12T20:14:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	I did't create any passwords :(((
2010-02-12T20:15:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	thats' the problem then, you need to add a Samba user and pwd.
2010-02-12T20:16:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	 is that very difficult for newbie in Ubuntu?
2010-02-12T20:18:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	 in a terminal type: [ sudo smbpasswd -a $USER   ] then enter a easy to remember password.
2010-02-12T20:18:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	then I always restart samba: [ sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart ]
2010-02-12T20:21:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	I've done it, but my new password still is odd
2010-02-12T20:22:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	what do you men "odd" it's not allowing you to browse to the folder ?
2010-02-12T20:24:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	 - my english, sorry... odd=wrong.... when the windows appears I write my new password but the windows (with asking password) still is "on"
2010-02-12T20:24:00.000Z	ke1ha	lucas71	send me a PM pse
2010-02-12T20:25:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	sorry, but what does it mean "PM" ?
2010-02-12T20:26:00.000Z	lucas71	ke1ha	PM=private message ??
