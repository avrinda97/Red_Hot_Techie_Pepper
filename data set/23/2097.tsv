2009-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	jilbert		what is the best partition sizes for ubuntu 9.04 if you will be installing it on 1 TB hardrive?
2009-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	jilbert		hmm...
2009-07-04T13:20:00.000Z	jilbert		i think i made a mistake when i installed mine last night
2009-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	jilbert		i made / 250 GB, swap 20 GB, /usr 690+ GB
2009-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	xpd259	jilbert	i use 200mb /boot  12gig /  swap set to ram size for hibernet and rest /home
2009-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	xpd259		Psychoholic:  no worries
2009-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	jilbert	xpd259	i see.. ill just reformat my hardrive then.
2009-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	jilbert		i hope it will not affect my windows seven hardrive
2009-07-04T13:25:00.000Z	xpd259	jilbert	that is just my personal use as i like lots of home and never use for then 8gb root
2009-07-04T13:26:00.000Z	jilbert	xpd259	i see..
2009-07-04T13:27:00.000Z	jilbert	xpd259	i would like to try this one.. : /boot 8GB, / 32 GB,  /swap 4GB /home 840 GB
2009-07-04T13:27:00.000Z	jilbert		is this a good partition?
2009-07-04T13:28:00.000Z	xpd259		jilbert:8 gig is over killl for boot  but the rest is fine 32gig for  root is quite large but depends how much you install software
2009-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	jilbert		i have.. i have two 1TB hardrive
2009-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	jilbert		1 for the windows seven and 1 for ubuntu
2009-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	jilbert		on a dual boot
2009-07-04T13:31:00.000Z	jilbert	xpd259	i see. okay then. i think i know what to do now..
2009-07-04T13:31:00.000Z	jilbert		jcornwall: yup i am..
2009-07-04T13:31:00.000Z	jilbert		but soon.. ill remove the windows seven..
2009-07-04T13:31:00.000Z	jilbert		once i've installed the crossover
2009-07-04T13:31:00.000Z	xpd259		best bet is to do an auto partition and then go back and reedit manually then you get the idea what is "needed" by a standard ubuntu
2009-07-04T13:33:00.000Z	jilbert		be right back :)
2009-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	jilbert	xpd259	i think i know what my partitions would be: 256 MB for /boot, 2GB for /swap, 80 GB for /(root), 160 GB for /home, and the rest will be NTFS.. what do you think?
