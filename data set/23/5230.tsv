2007-01-15T12:17:00.000Z	steel_lady		ok, is it really imposible or you are ignoring all the questions with 'forbidden' words?
2007-01-15T12:18:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	: eh?
2007-01-19T12:29:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	: any file or directory that is prefixed by a dot (.) is hidden
2007-02-23T08:36:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	also `chmod 777 -R` will chmod recursively
2007-10-04T07:15:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	Whats up?
2007-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	since I was long term win user, I was used to mark some text and copy and I have it in temporal memory until rewritten with something else so I am able to paste it anywhere without any conditions
2007-10-04T07:17:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	That sounds like the typical function of the clipboard...
2007-10-04T07:17:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	because of that habbit, I am constantly annoyed in Ubuntu when I copy something, weather is text or link and I close the window and open the other program and I can not paste it
2007-10-04T07:18:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	or kipper if you use KDE
2007-10-04T07:19:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	soundray: er. I meant klipper ;)
2007-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	Is there a question there?
2007-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	yes, do you have any idea how to log in to the page?
2007-10-11T07:58:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	You could try that, its internet explorer in wine
2007-10-11T08:00:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	but it is not IE, I need shockwave
2007-10-11T08:00:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	There is no version of shockwave for linux.  You also could try installing firefox in wine and installing shockwave on that firefox.
2007-10-11T08:01:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	can you somehow chech is it the shockwave I need for displaying the second part of this page: http://www.terra.es/chat/salas/sala_6_72.htm
2007-10-11T08:02:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	sure, hold on.
2007-10-11T08:05:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	I dont get any chat window on mine, and I'm running firefox on Windows right now.  The FAQ (I guess, I dont speak/read spanish) http://www.terra.es/chat/aprende.htm says Flash 9.
2007-10-11T08:07:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	I have flash player 9 installed
2007-10-11T08:08:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	As do I.  Its not working for me on Windows either. I can't check IE here though.
2007-10-11T08:08:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	I doubt it.
2007-10-11T08:10:00.000Z	steel_lady	Pici	but I have problems with other pages also. For eg. infojobs.net
2007-10-11T08:11:00.000Z	Pici	steel_lady	Perhaps its a firefox incompatibility, you could try in wine.
