2005-07-10T14:57:00.000Z	siorfin		question regarding a bootup issue
2005-07-10T14:57:00.000Z	siorfin		failsafe check failed please repair manually and reboot & unattached inode, root partition
2005-07-10T14:58:00.000Z	siorfin		anyone know how to fix this,
2005-07-10T14:59:00.000Z	siorfin		i have seen fsck /target as solution but i have no clue how to login as root and use it since root use is disabled
2005-07-10T15:01:00.000Z	siorfin		so anyone know how to fix bootup issues involving the root partition, says problems basically then does a forced check then cant complete it and says to manual repair as root but i cant login as root since root is disabled, how do i fix this?
2005-07-10T15:02:00.000Z	siorfin		ok how do i reboot in single user mode?
2005-07-10T15:02:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	if you use the 'rescue' boot option you will end up in single user mode where you can fsck -y the partitions that are not mounted
2005-07-10T15:03:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	I usually reboot after I do a fsck - you can mount -a but to be honest I always like to check that it is all okay
2005-07-10T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	in the file  /boot/grub/menu.lst there is a value set  for 'timeout' it is the gap at the start when you need to hit a key to stop grub from the usual to get rescue values - Serious question - have you a live cd?
2005-07-10T15:12:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	no i dont unfortunately and it wouldnt do me any good either way as my cdrom is trashed and my replacement form newegg hasnt arrived yet
2005-07-10T15:13:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	getting to the bootup menu is not the problem, it is set to the default of 2seconds which is plenty of time to hit esc but last time i tried editing the kernel line adding single to the end of the line it didnt save the value, how do i save the value is the question
2005-07-10T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	let me test that with a quick reboot to be 100% certain I think you just type rescue at that point
2005-07-10T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	what happens is you press escape, you are then provided with a menu, you choose recovery from that
2005-07-10T15:20:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	ok NOT single user mode?
2005-07-10T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	it is single user mode that is returned to you
2005-07-10T15:20:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	we chose recovery but it gives the same errors then says enter root or hit control-d
2005-07-10T15:20:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	but there is no root password in ubuntu so im stuck
2005-07-10T15:22:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	I have no way of helping you with that one
2005-07-10T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	yes, but you said that the CDrom was not working or at least that was my take on it
2005-07-10T15:23:00.000Z	siorfin	ompaul	the replacement is on its way from newegg, it is in indiana currently
2005-07-10T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	what is its eta?
2005-07-10T15:25:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	do you know anyone with the same machine in your locale?
2005-07-10T15:26:00.000Z	ompaul	siorfin	well that should be okay when you get the new one
