2009-03-17T00:06:00.000Z	geoaxis		i hope for the coming release Ubuntu does some thing about bad performance of firefox
2009-03-17T00:07:00.000Z	geoaxis		current version of firefox is really crappy on my system
2009-03-17T00:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	yep it's pretty crappy on mine as well,  that  unoffical Ubuntu version of Firefox
2009-03-17T00:08:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 i am not running any thing out of the repository ...
2009-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	Flash 10 64bit?
2009-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 i think it uses npviewer.bin
2009-03-21T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	Flash  is closed source, so  if you get issues with it, not much that can be done.  also Ubuntu's version of Firefox is unoffical
2009-03-21T23:29:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 agreed, but i just wonder what happened to a sane browser from 8.4, it's unbearable in 8.10
2009-03-21T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	go use another browser?  loads of good ones to choose from
2009-03-21T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	or try the latest 3.1 beta from Mozilla?
2009-03-21T23:30:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 tried that too ...no love..it keeps crashing
2009-03-21T23:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	ok on 32bit  Flash  crashed a lot on 8.10.  ,but now I am on 9.04 alpha6, and well I had interesting crash last night to do with FLash and Firefox I thought, but it was differnet  this time round.  but anyway.   Flash 10  was there and working nicely today.   I had run 8.10  without FLash since last year
2009-03-21T23:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	 Firefox and Flash  =  Firefox crash, for some of us
2009-03-21T23:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	every other app would be fine for me
2009-03-21T23:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	you should try other browsers, loads of good ones to choose from
2009-03-21T23:33:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 i always come crawling back to FF due to extensions :)
2009-03-21T23:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	ok I have an idea
2009-03-21T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	put Flash block on in  Firefox the add on yeah.  and then you can  run  Mozilla's  Flash plugin no problem in other browsers that  use it such as, Epiphany, Galeon, and Seamonkey
2009-03-21T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	and then you can use Firefox for other stuff
2009-03-21T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	basically make it so you can use that FLash, but  not in Firefox only other browsers
2009-03-21T23:35:00.000Z	geoaxis	sebsebseb	 let me try
2009-03-21T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	I think the add on is called Flash block or something like that.  you will find one I expect
2009-03-21T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geoaxis	then  do this :)   sudo apt-get install  epiphany-browser  galeon seamonkey
