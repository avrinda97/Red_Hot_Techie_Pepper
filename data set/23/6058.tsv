2006-07-29T10:21:00.000Z	ernz		Hi again peeps
2006-07-29T10:22:00.000Z	ernz		I am in customising over-drive at the moment. Is there any way to change the Ubuntu stock boot screen?
2006-07-29T10:23:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	the orange-on-black one?
2006-07-29T10:23:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	Correct.
2006-07-29T10:24:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	Yes, but it might take a little work
2006-07-29T10:24:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	- Please, go on...
2006-07-29T10:25:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	I've never done it before, I just know it's possible.  I think I can find out how....
2006-07-29T10:26:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	Any help would be appreciated bud. I have looked myself and game up dry.
2006-07-29T10:27:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	keep in mind it might be restricted to 256 colors
2006-07-29T10:28:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	That means 155 colours OTHER than brown. I'm happy :)
2006-07-29T10:29:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	Yes. "Mistakes". Hmmm....
2006-07-29T10:29:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	I did NOT have relations with that woman....
2006-07-29T10:30:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	<< lol - I love the American government
2006-07-29T10:30:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	requirements for splash images (probably)
2006-07-29T10:33:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	there's apparently some splash images that can be used here: http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/~mcgrof/grub-images/images/
2006-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	the people who like the brown
2006-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	> What people would this be?
2006-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	the blanpem you quoted, apparently
2006-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	anyway, did you get that link?  The easy directions are down about halfway down the page, Instructions->1.1
2006-07-29T10:38:00.000Z	ernz	Asc	you say you modded b4, or not?
2006-07-29T10:38:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	I haven't, but I'm going to now that I know how
2006-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	I've messed about with the *lst file it mentions a bit, it looks like it should be easy
2006-07-29T10:46:00.000Z	Asc	ernz	I'm off to test if it works.  If you have problems, I'll be back in a few minutes.
