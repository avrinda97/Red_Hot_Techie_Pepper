2009-09-09T21:18:00.000Z	nirvette		Ok: another problem: tested on youtube.com. can see visuals now. but no sound!! what is the problem?
2009-09-09T21:19:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	turn on the sound or increase it. use the alsamixer to do that.
2009-09-09T21:20:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	sound is usually low in ubuntu after install (atleast happens so for me). just type in alsamixer in the commandline and try changing the volume there
2009-09-09T21:20:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	dont change it in the volume properties in the top bar on the desktop.
2009-09-09T21:20:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	use the alsamixer
2009-09-09T21:21:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	oh ya. also try what RHorse said. (but i doubt thats a problem. coz you have video working already)
2009-09-09T21:21:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	libflashplayer.so. drop that file in the firefox plugins dir
2009-09-09T21:22:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	which version is your ubuntu? also is it 64bit or 32bit?
2009-09-09T21:23:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	64bit versions have a seperate flash plugin. 32bit flash stuff dont work on that.
2009-09-09T21:23:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	ah ah! same as mine. i'm just partitioning my netbook remix :)
2009-09-09T21:23:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	Acer Aspire One?
2009-09-09T21:24:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	which netbook is that?
2009-09-09T21:24:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	?
2009-09-09T21:24:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	which netbook?
2009-09-09T21:25:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	you should have kept your win drive and installed ubuntu by the side. you could later resize the partitions. thats what I'm doing right now.
2009-09-09T21:25:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	:
2009-09-09T21:32:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	dont blame ubuntu. you should have been careful while installing it.
2009-09-09T21:33:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	i do almost 2-3 OS installs a week (not just ubuntu). i check my settings atleast 5-6 times before clicking "ok" :)
2009-09-09T21:33:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	just check the UNR help page. some netbooks have problems.
2009-09-09T21:34:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	like my AAO's pulseaudio goes wrong while recording etc. check that page.
2009-09-09T21:34:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	whats the file system now? what was the file system before?
2009-09-09T21:35:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	ntfs, fat32, ext2,3,4 etc
2009-09-09T21:35:00.000Z	SingAlong	nirvette	you didnt change the file system while installing ubuntu?
