2005-10-07T13:02:00.000Z	hondje	yapyccky	run it from a terminal, or edit the menu entry to have it use gksudo instead of gksu

2005-10-07T13:05:00.000Z	hondje	yapyccky	do a dist-upgrade, and if that doesn't fix it I'd recommend filing a bug in malone
2005-10-07T13:05:00.000Z	yapyccky	hondje	: ok thx so much.
2005-10-07T13:06:00.000Z	hondje		 /etc/issue tells version, too

2005-10-07T13:10:00.000Z	hondje		I use beep media player, more, but rhythmbox is also nice, totem, banshee, amarok...
2005-10-07T13:10:00.000Z	yapyccky	hondje	: should i reboot machine after dist-upgrade?
2005-10-07T13:11:00.000Z	hondje	yapyccky	if it upgraded your kernel (or says to), I would
