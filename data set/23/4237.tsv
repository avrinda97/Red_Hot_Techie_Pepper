2007-10-04T08:15:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Have you used Automatix or anything like that?
2007-10-04T08:15:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Or 3rd party repos?
2007-10-04T08:15:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	a few multimedia ones
2007-10-04T08:16:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	That may be your problem.
2007-10-04T08:16:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	true, the package that broke the upgrade is nvidia-glx
2007-10-04T08:17:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	ah.
2007-10-04T08:17:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	I don't see why it didn't keep upgrading the other files instead of just stopping
2007-10-04T08:17:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Yeah, not sure...
2007-10-04T08:19:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Well, you should be in #ubuntu+1 then.
2007-10-04T08:20:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	it was more of a general upgrading question then a gutsy-related one, I've had the same problem with each upgrade
2007-10-04T08:20:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Well, if you don't use Automatix or Envy, you should by fine.
2007-10-04T08:21:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	na I stopped using those scripts a long time ago
2007-10-04T08:34:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	one thing.
2007-10-04T08:35:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	Could you run < aptitude show linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` | grep State > ?
2007-10-04T08:35:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	State: installed
2007-10-04T08:35:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	ok.
2007-10-04T08:35:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	I assume that's a good thing?
2007-10-04T08:36:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	yup.
2007-10-04T08:39:00.000Z	Tony--	cdm10	silent, thanks for the help guys/girls (whichever fits you ;P ), it's the first time I actually come to IRC and get an answer other then 'RTFM' ;)
2007-10-04T08:39:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	rtfm, noob
2007-10-04T08:40:00.000Z	cdm10	Tony--	hh
