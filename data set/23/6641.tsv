2006-02-25T17:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	You're talking to wisie
2006-02-25T17:33:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	How do you drink it?
2006-02-25T17:34:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	I always have espresso.
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	lol, i don't mind expresso, it tastes good, just instant, or plunged is best if your in a hurry.  Expresso takes to long if you want to leave quick and the machine isn;t on
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	What machine?
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	I use a moka pot!
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	duh?!?  The expresso machine!  Mr. moka pot :p
2006-02-25T17:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Only if you're addicted to the caffiene.
2006-02-25T17:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	I'm addicted to the flavour.
2006-02-25T17:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	I can giveup coffee, and I'll barely even get a headache.
2006-02-25T17:45:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Most clients highlight lines that contain their nick. Do'h Agent_bob!
2006-02-25T17:58:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	You'll be looking into X Dualview stuff.  It's somewhat hardware dependant, i think as well)
2006-02-25T06:02:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	Just found this for Gentoo, might help for ubuntu though - http://gentoo-wiki.com/index.php?title=HOWTO_Dual_Monitors
2006-02-25T06:03:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	np :)
2006-02-25T06:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Hmm, looks like I can't use that.
2006-02-25T06:06:00.000Z	sando	Arafangion	it might be different with a laptop, but esentially, to X.Org, you're still a computer with standard /dev inputs and outputs ,cept for maybe power management
2006-02-25T06:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	And in the sense that it's far more dynamic.
2006-02-25T06:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Wow, that was *simple*
2006-02-25T06:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	sudo aticonfig --dtop=clone
2006-02-25T06:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Just about.
2006-02-25T06:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Not explicitly.
2006-02-25T06:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	sando	Now, all that needs to be done is to allow the changes to be realised without restarting xorg - possible?
