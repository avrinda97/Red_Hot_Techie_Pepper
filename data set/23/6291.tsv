2008-09-04T21:08:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard		Anyone in the mood for helping me with a command that works fine from commandline but not from a crontab?
2008-09-04T21:09:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard		it works from commandline but not from within crontab for somereason
2008-09-04T21:10:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	can you pastebin your crontab?
2008-09-04T21:10:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	that's basically it, well - the time obviously
2008-09-04T21:10:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	also, did you add the line via crontab -e?
2008-09-04T21:10:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	can you pastebin your crontab?
2008-09-04T21:11:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	yup
2008-09-04T21:11:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	it does the output of the date in to the file, but nothing else
2008-09-04T21:12:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	but it works from the commandline :P
2008-09-04T21:13:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	any idea mate?
2008-09-04T21:14:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	you're not going to pastebin your crontab, are you?
2008-09-04T21:14:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	sure gimme a sec then
2008-09-04T21:15:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	http://pastebin.com/m5002f6c1
2008-09-04T21:18:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	you might try specifying the SHELL and PATH variables in the crontab. also, set MAIL to your address, you might get some more information for debugging purposes.
2008-09-04T21:19:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	that long stretch is all one line, right? your editor didn't sneak a newline in anywhere?
2008-09-04T21:19:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	that doesn't seem to be the issue... I've been through that as well :)
2008-09-04T21:19:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	nope...
2008-09-04T21:19:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	vim and crontab -e
2008-09-04T21:21:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	actually, MAILTO was the variable i was thinking of. if you set that, do you get any errors mailed to you?
2008-09-04T21:23:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	does anything get put on std error by any of these commands? can you try redirecting that to /dev/null?
2008-09-04T21:24:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	nope, no stderr at all
2008-09-04T21:24:00.000Z	Captain_Redbeard	sipior	what happens is that, when put in to crontab, it just doesn't seem to get past the pasting of the date
2008-09-04T21:25:00.000Z	sipior	Captain_Redbeard	try setting MAILTO and see what shows up
