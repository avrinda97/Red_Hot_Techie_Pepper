2010-05-23T22:52:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, I can get ot my Windows 7 partition fine, nothings broken. I would never use it as the home directory of linux or anything
2010-05-23T22:52:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, but it works for basic stuff
2010-05-23T22:53:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Depends on sampling rate and bit depth Black_Phantom
2010-05-23T22:54:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TheGrammarFreak	I didnt touch any of them, I edited an audio and am exporting it as .wav so that I can burn it
2010-05-23T22:54:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, I don't think an ubuntu installer will even let you use ntfs as a home drive.
2010-05-23T22:55:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	Black_Phantom	if you can;t hear a difference then it's fine.
2010-05-23T22:55:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Mathematically something will be lost, but that's life, Black_Phantom
2010-05-23T22:57:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, so install linux to that drive. The read/write stuff in linux for ntfs have been fine for me. Backups of really important data might be an idea. But I'd recommend that anyway :D
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, I don;t actually know, sorry. I use EXT4, but I have no more than 640 GB of data, most of which is on ntfs anyway
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		<Guest33152>, google?
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, No problem
2010-05-23T22:59:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, A quick google should get you some stuff on various linux filesystems btw
2010-05-23T22:59:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		:D
2010-05-23T23:00:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		sorry TheGrammarFreak did you say something after that ? I was d/c
2010-05-23T23:00:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	Black_Phantom	what was the last thing you saw me say?
2010-05-23T23:00:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TheGrammarFreak	about the bitrate
2010-05-23T23:00:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TheGrammarFreak	the 1st thing u said
2010-05-23T23:01:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	Black_Phantom	I said that mathmatically you will probably loose something. The chances are you won't hear it as long as it's encoded at more than 44.2KHz and
2010-05-23T23:01:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		I can;t remember the bit depth, Black_Phantom.
2010-05-23T23:01:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Sorry
2010-05-23T23:02:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TheGrammarFreak	thanks, its ok
2010-05-23T23:02:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Does anyone know how to improve the battery life of my laptop when it runs ubuntu?
2010-05-23T23:02:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	Black_Phantom	no worries
