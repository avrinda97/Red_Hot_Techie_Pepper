2005-01-22T09:01:00.000Z	tritium	froust	don't edit your menu.lst.  uninstall the kernel packages, and update-grub will be run to change your menu
2005-01-22T09:02:00.000Z	froust	tritium	rather
2005-01-22T09:02:00.000Z	froust	tritium	i know that - he'd have to remove the kernels another way
2005-02-02T12:26:00.000Z	tritium	froust	I may be wrong, but I think if you read the very top of /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you can run md5sum and then dpkg-reconfigure.
2005-02-02T12:28:00.000Z	tritium	froust	did you see my last message?
2005-02-02T12:36:00.000Z	tritium	froust	did that not work?
2005-02-02T12:38:00.000Z	tritium	froust	sure enough.  Even though its Xorg, the directory for that is /var/lib/xfree86
2005-02-02T12:38:00.000Z	froust	tritium	the syntax of that line is messed "//"
2005-02-02T12:39:00.000Z	tritium	froust	yes, but it's more than just the double //
2005-02-02T12:39:00.000Z	tritium	froust	the directory listed is wrong
2005-02-02T12:40:00.000Z	tritium	froust	my xorg.conf.md5sum is in /var/lib/xfree86
2005-02-02T12:46:00.000Z	tritium	froust	that worked?
2005-02-02T12:48:00.000Z	tritium	froust	if that worked, maybe you should file a bug against xserver-xorg
2005-02-02T12:51:00.000Z	tritium	froust	- what you discovered should be filed in a bug against xserver-xorg
2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	froust	tritium	how do i file a bug report?
2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	tritium	froust	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	tritium	froust	thank you for doing that
2005-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	tritium	froust	is your xorg.conf newly configured?
2005-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	tritium	froust	maybe you need to look at the "Modes" line and add more resolutions
2005-02-02T12:58:00.000Z	froust	tritium	they're all there. i added them in the setup, and they're listed in the xorg.conf
2005-02-02T13:01:00.000Z	froust	tritium	bug report filed.
2005-02-04T10:22:00.000Z	tritium	froust	win32codecs
2005-02-22T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	froust	it's probably not really all that worth it.
