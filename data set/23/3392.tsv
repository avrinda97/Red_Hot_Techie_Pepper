2008-05-26T23:06:00.000Z	cypha		how do i get my laptop's backlight to turn off?
2008-05-26T23:06:00.000Z	cypha		it always stays on
2008-05-26T23:07:00.000Z	cypha		through the night, and everything
2008-05-26T23:07:00.000Z	fde	cypha	take the bulb out?  :P
2008-05-27T01:35:00.000Z	fde	cypha	ahh... that's a lot easier, didn't even occur to me to try that in the past, heh
2008-05-27T01:35:00.000Z	cypha	fde	what was your suggestion?
2008-05-27T01:36:00.000Z	fde	cypha	System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects tab --- the long way
2008-05-27T01:38:00.000Z	cypha	fde	well, it's the same amount of time to type for the instructor though =)
2008-11-20T15:55:00.000Z	fde	cypha	there is a firefox plugin for that... search the add-ons thing for 'activex' ...
2008-11-20T15:56:00.000Z	fde	cypha	is that what I said?
2008-11-20T15:57:00.000Z	fde	cypha	Firefox > Tools > Add-ons ... just search that
2008-11-20T15:57:00.000Z	fde	cypha	going via the web interface directly is tedious
2008-11-20T15:59:00.000Z	cypha	fde	i now have a screen in the video that says "(no video)"
2008-11-20T15:59:00.000Z	fde	cypha	do you have codecs installed?
2008-11-20T16:00:00.000Z	cypha	fde	i believe so
2008-11-20T16:00:00.000Z	fde	cypha	I would bet you don't... what is listed in 'about:plugins' for firefox?
2008-11-20T16:01:00.000Z	cypha	fde	how can i concisely show you that?
2008-11-20T16:02:00.000Z	fde	cypha	just look down the list and see if you see the correct codecs for things like wmv etc
2008-11-20T16:03:00.000Z	fde	cypha	then ime it should just work... hmm
2008-11-20T16:04:00.000Z	cypha	fde	how can i run my windows from within ubuntu?
2008-11-20T16:05:00.000Z	fde	cypha	only thing I can think of that might be wrong... try using the User Agent Switcher addon and tell it you're using a IE too... that is the only difference to my setup, and I haven't come across any issues
2008-11-20T16:06:00.000Z	cypha	fde	what's the User Agent Switcher?
2008-11-20T16:06:00.000Z	fde	cypha	search for it in the same place I told you to search for activex
