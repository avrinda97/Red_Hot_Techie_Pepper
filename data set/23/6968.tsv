2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	Liket		what's the best place to get various packages for a fresh ubuntu install? i don't even have "make" currently, and I have no idea where to find it
2005-11-15T10:28:00.000Z	Liket		hey, what's a good place to get packages for ubuntu? (looking for equivalent of rpmfind for redhat)
2005-11-15T10:28:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	you get them from the ubuntu repositories (/msg ubotu repositories).  For "make" and other such tools install the build-essential package'
2005-11-15T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	you might only need the headers - sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-11-15T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	aptitude :)
2005-11-15T17:46:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	np :)
2005-11-15T17:48:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	 probably with back-quotes (which also work)
2005-11-15T06:17:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	probably /etc/modules
2005-11-15T06:18:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	insmod is the command to insert modules into the kernel but the preferred way is to use modprobe (which will insert dependant modules as well)
2005-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	ahh, i gotcha. i'm trying to upgrade the raid controller driver that is used for my boot drive.. it can't be as easy as putting modprobe in rc.local right? don't i have to update the ram disk image or similar?
2005-11-15T06:20:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	sorry i don't know about the "ram disk image", but if you want modules loaded at boot time you can add them to /etc/modules.
2005-11-15T06:21:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	the thing is, i know the module is getting loaded already somehow (or the system couldn't boot).. but i'm not sure where
2005-11-15T06:21:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	and there's no rc.local in ubuntu either :) - /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh is probably the most equivalent
2005-11-15T06:21:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	ah
2005-11-15T06:30:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	sudo grep -r <modulename> /etc/*     <- might show some clues
2005-11-15T06:32:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	now that's an excellent idea - running
2005-11-15T06:33:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	not found!
2005-11-15T06:34:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	:/
2005-11-15T06:36:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	i wonder if it's compiled into the kernel
2005-11-15T06:38:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	yes, i guess so, although i really don't know much about it
2005-11-15T06:39:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	alright.. i guess i'll live with it for now.. it does work, but i'm worried the raid manager daemon won't be able to run with the old driver that's included in ubuntu
2005-11-15T06:39:00.000Z	Liket	bimberi	thanks for your help!
2005-11-15T06:40:00.000Z	bimberi	Liket	np :) wish i could have helped more
