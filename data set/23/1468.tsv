2010-07-10T20:13:00.000Z	josue		I dont know how to configure my microphone to use skype in ubuntu 9.10
2010-07-10T20:14:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	click on the speaker in the top right of your screen and go to 'sound preferences'
2010-07-10T20:14:00.000Z	josue		ok
2010-07-10T20:15:00.000Z	fridgerator		and make sure you have the right input selected in the input tab
2010-07-10T20:15:00.000Z	josue		done
2010-07-10T20:16:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	did you have to make any changes?
2010-07-10T20:16:00.000Z	josue		no
2010-07-10T20:17:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	go back to the input tab in the sound preferences and see if the input level graph moves when you talk into the mic... also make sure its not muted at the top
2010-07-10T20:17:00.000Z	josue	fridgerator	it doesnt move while I talk
2010-07-10T20:17:00.000Z	josue		and its not mutted
2010-07-10T20:18:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	is it just a mic plugged into the mic port on your sound card?
2010-07-10T20:18:00.000Z	josue		I'm using a laptop inspiron
2010-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	is it a built in mic then?
2010-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	josue		yeap
2010-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	josue		its built in
2010-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	josue		I've been using it in windows
2010-07-10T20:20:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	go into the hardware tab in the sound preferences, does it show "interntal audio", "analog stereo duplex" ?
2010-07-10T20:20:00.000Z	fridgerator		internal*
2010-07-10T20:21:00.000Z	josue	fridgerator	yes, it show that
2010-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	hmm, im not sure then, maybe try running 'hardware drivers' to see if you need a 3rd party driver
2010-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	josue		ok, What shoud I do and how?
2010-07-10T20:23:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	go to the gnome menu, then under administration go to 'hardware drivers'
2010-07-10T20:24:00.000Z	fridgerator	josue	install any drivers it comes up with related to audio or multimedia, if this doesnt work restate your question in the channel and maybe someone else can help you
