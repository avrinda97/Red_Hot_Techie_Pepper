2010-04-30T15:47:00.000Z	testso		Hi, I think I've found a bug. Can someone verify?
2010-04-30T15:48:00.000Z	obscurant1st	testso	spit it out!! :)
2010-04-30T15:48:00.000Z	testso		try right-click in an application, e.g. firefox. Then hit a multimedia button, e.g. mute
2010-04-30T15:49:00.000Z	testso		if firefox is showing a menu, the multimedia button stops functioning, at least for me
2010-04-30T15:49:00.000Z	testso		obscurants1st: do you laptop with multimedia button?
2010-04-30T15:50:00.000Z	testso	obscurant1st	try right-click in an application, e.g. firefox. Then hit a multimedia button, e.g. mute
