2008-09-27T09:09:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	he knows. he's being a jerk.
2008-09-27T09:10:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	he's gone
2008-09-27T09:10:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	or maybe not?
2008-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	:) i saw it late :)
2010-01-16T22:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	exactly :)
2010-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	ekiga was removed from the default install when we got an IM client that could do video (besides...ekiga didn't work so well if there were NATs involved, a very common usecase)
2010-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	any other sip client, which is there and supports ekiga accounts ?
2010-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	ekiga is still available in the repos. qutecom also should work
2010-05-03T20:43:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	empathy is the default messaging client. im not sure if it does sip or not. i know it does jingle
2010-05-03T20:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	and what happened to the support of compiz-fusion, why was it stopped ?
2010-05-03T20:48:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	it wasnt
2010-05-03T20:48:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	compiz is still the default wm if you have the hardware & drivers to do it. otherwise, metacity
2010-05-03T20:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	when i do an upgrade , it says that canonical has stopped the support for it, maybe ccsm, some compiz related package
2010-05-03T20:50:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	compiz is still included in a default install. but yeah ccsm is gone. try simple-ccsm
2010-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	er no its not
2010-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	i searched the wrong package name. ccsm is still there
2010-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	perhaps some plugin pack moved out of main and into universe?
2010-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	:) i forgot the name, anyways thats ok...ekiga really kinda is tough, crashes almost all the time
2010-05-03T20:52:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	oh. but ccsm is in universe.... ok yeah. just means the MOTU are supporting it now instead of just the core devs
2010-05-03T20:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	oh ok
2010-05-03T20:53:00.000Z	maco	arvind_khadri	i think technically everything thats not part of a default install on ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, ubuntu studio, mythbuntu, etc. is now supposed to move to universe
2010-05-03T20:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	maco	thats good, less work for the core devs
