2011-10-15T16:16:00.000Z	kozlov8		The Ubuntu CD in this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows  what is that?
2011-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	kozlov8		I need to do that, but what is the CD? vivid
2011-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	ubuntu desktop
2011-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	sure can be
2011-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	but when I boot from that CD, there are only 2 options: Try Ubuntu and Install it, I need the repair option.
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	click try ubuntu, boot it up then install boot-repair
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	How do I do that? Sorry I'm not very experienced...
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	looks like you have to add a ppa first
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
2011-10-15T16:20:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	go try ubuntu then when it's loaded, open up a terminal and then paste in the commands from the 2nd option of that link I pasted
2011-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	you need to be connected to the internet for that to work
2011-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	Okay thanks! :) One more question... would https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows fix the problem I have described https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/174411
2011-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	that could be more complex
2011-10-15T16:22:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	Oh, any ideas how it could be solved?
2011-10-15T16:22:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	honestly, unless you've got something on your ubuntu install that you really need, you might be off better to just reinstall ubuntu
2011-10-15T16:23:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	since it's almost always better/easier/less hassle to install windows then ubuntu, not viceversea
2011-10-15T16:24:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	Okay, fair enough, but the previous version took a partition, so now I have less space on my Windows 7. If I were to reinstall it could I use the partition that the previous installation took?
2011-10-15T16:24:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	yeah should be able to, just need to manually partition and use that free space/ext4 partition and allocate it to / and format it
2011-10-15T16:25:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	Okay I'll try reinstalling it. Thanks a bunch! :)
2011-10-15T16:25:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	did you have any data/critical files on your first ubuntu  install?
2011-10-15T16:25:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	Nope. I never even got to use it.
2011-10-15T16:26:00.000Z	sagaci	kozlov8	ok good since an install (depending on your hardware) can take <10mins so it's easier to reinstall than to troubleshoot a potential broken install/grub
2011-10-15T16:27:00.000Z	kozlov8	sagaci	okay, here goes nothing...
