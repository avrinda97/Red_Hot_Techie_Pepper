2005-04-02T11:31:00.000Z	ian		it seems that ubuntu defaults to 24 bit color.  just FYI, I changed to 16 bit and GDK drawing is significantly faster
2005-04-02T11:33:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 change to two bits
2005-04-02T11:36:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 i you had a 25 inch monitor you would
2005-04-02T11:36:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	what does color depth have to do with resolution / dpi ?
2005-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 auto login
2005-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 have you ever seen mandrake control center
2005-04-02T11:58:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 yes
2005-04-02T11:59:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	you think this is usable?  http://www.kde.org/screenshots/images/3.1/fullsize/94.png
2005-04-02T12:00:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 for what
2005-04-02T12:00:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	for 99% of the world
2005-04-02T12:03:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	I agree.  I think that's an argument against that beast of a KDE control center :)
2005-04-02T12:03:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 at least its more than gnome has
2005-04-02T12:04:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	think so?  I don't
2005-04-02T12:04:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	I mean, sure, it's MORE.  Lots MORE.  and that's worse! :)
2005-04-02T12:05:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	having it all in one place is good, but KDE has some real trouble with preferences-overload.  I was talking to the KDE guys at LinuxWorldExpo about it (and they agree).  But it's going to be a serious problem for them to "fix", since so many KDE users are "hardcore" and like it that way
2005-04-02T12:06:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 thats the problem thats whats coming
2005-04-04T05:26:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 how much easyer can synaotic
2005-04-04T05:26:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	a lot
2005-04-04T05:27:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 synaptic is very simple
2005-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	saying the same thing over and over doesn't help :)
2005-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 if you cant use synaptic u should n't use computer
2005-04-04T05:30:00.000Z	ian	geneo93	you're always rude, I'm done talking to you
2005-04-04T05:57:00.000Z	geneo93	ian	 try mandrake it uses gurpmi and it gets all depends you need for apps to run
