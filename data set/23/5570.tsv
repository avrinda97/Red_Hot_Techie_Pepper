2009-01-26T10:05:00.000Z	Firefishe		Asking again as I got booted:  What does quiet mean in this line in menu.lst?:  # defoptions=quiet splash
2009-01-26T10:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	how much output it dumps to the screen (which you won't see if splash is on anyway :p)
2009-01-26T10:06:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	 So if I just remove the splash, and leave the quiet part, save the file, then do -- sudo grub-update --  I should have my splash screen turned off?
2009-01-26T10:07:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	if you want to see the 'normal' linux bootup, get rid of quiet as well
2009-01-26T10:09:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	 Thank you.  That answers it.
2009-01-26T10:09:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	 I appreciate it.
2011-10-17T06:03:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	what kind of computer are you using?
2011-10-17T06:03:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	 It's an HP Mini 110 netbook.
2011-10-17T06:03:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	but the hard disk is a mechanical one
2011-10-17T06:03:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	internal recovery drive or something?
2011-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	palimpsest is showing it as swap space
2011-10-17T06:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	sorry, I didn't notice the device name
2011-10-17T06:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	^
2011-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	meaning?
2011-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	it doesn't actually exist
2011-10-17T06:07:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	So palimpsest is, basically, not 'seeing' it correctly?
2011-10-17T06:07:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	not exactly; the device in /dev exists, but it's not a piece of hardware
2011-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	Hmm.  My /swap partition is only 199MB.  I'm just wondering what /dev/zram0 is referencing on my disk.
2011-10-17T06:09:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	it's _not_ referencing your disk
2011-10-17T06:10:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	unless it's part of the netbook's RAM utilisation, or some proprietary win-swap thing HP has in this thing.  I have no clue.
2011-10-17T06:10:00.000Z	cwillu	Firefishe	and you'll remain to have no clue so long as you completely ignore what I already said :p
2011-10-17T06:11:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	I'm not ignoring you
2011-10-17T06:12:00.000Z	Firefishe	cwillu	 I'm just *not understanding*.  I follow that it's not a physical device.
