2012-07-10T20:49:00.000Z	Odra		Guys, how do I close a window?
2012-07-10T20:50:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 type /part
2012-08-05T08:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 backup and fresh install may be te most efficient way
2012-08-08T19:41:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 create a PPA and hope your app is picked and makes it to the repos
2012-08-08T19:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 you cannot make it to the repos, canonical and the community decide on that -- first create a ppa
2012-08-08T19:42:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	But shouldnt I first send it for review?
2012-08-08T19:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 no, a ppa is personal, if someone likes it, they will most certainly review it
2012-08-08T19:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 no
2012-08-08T19:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 in short: what you want is simply not possible
2012-08-08T19:44:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	But there is pacman in there
2012-08-08T19:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 make it available somewhere, so people can test it
2012-08-08T19:45:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	Its avaiable on google code
2012-08-08T19:45:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	But regardless of that I want to know how complete must be it be to... you know what. Nevermind.
2012-08-08T19:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 i'm not familiar with google code, but now you can hope someone picks it up and likes it -- maybe it will be accepted in the repos
2012-08-08T19:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 security
2012-08-08T19:47:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 maybe you are a criminal who wants to put a vicious app in the repos
2012-08-08T19:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 what i'm saying is: if you can do, vicious criminal can do it, too
2012-08-08T19:50:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	So, given that my stopwatch app is still far from what I want it to be, however it is still functional as a stopwatch, I should be able to get it on the repositories?
2012-08-08T19:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 no, because you may have put some vicious pieces of code in it
2012-08-08T19:53:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	But isnt that why there is a review process in the software center?
2012-08-08T19:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 would you eat just anything, without knowing what it is?
2012-08-08T19:54:00.000Z	Odra	MonkeyDust	Well, I wouldnt eat a stopwatch, that is for sure. No matter how deliscious it might have been.
2012-10-06T02:58:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Odra	 ask in #ubuntu-br
