2011-10-13T20:41:00.000Z	heoa_		how to kill freezed commands? ...as even "sudo su" is frozen...
2011-10-13T20:41:00.000Z	heoa_		pkill thatDamnInfiniteLoop...
2011-10-13T20:42:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	depends, tried to ctrl-c it ? else by killall <appName> or kill <PID>
2011-10-13T20:44:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	for sure and many times!
2011-10-13T20:44:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	even ^C ^Z, not working...
2011-10-13T20:45:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	did you find the process causing the freeze ? (via htop .f.e., or syslog) ?
2011-10-13T20:46:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	I will if you tell more
2011-10-13T20:46:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	I did just in /proc, $grep -r temperature *
2011-10-13T20:47:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	if you got unresponsibness, there will me a reason, aka something hangs
2011-10-13T20:48:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	the reason is probably that /proc is a virtual somethnig and it regenerates apparently things all the time...so it will never end...or
2011-10-13T20:48:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	very well amount of fs and dirs is finite ... but not sure about the content...
2011-10-13T20:49:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	because "files" are not really files there everytime (although they look like that)
2011-10-13T20:50:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	they get filled at everrytime again, right
2011-10-13T20:52:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	what's the r in grep for ? did you want to find files containing temperature ?
2011-10-13T20:52:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	recursion, goes into every subdir...
2011-10-13T20:52:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	quite resourcfull command...
2011-10-13T20:53:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	ls -lr /proc/temperature
2011-10-13T20:54:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	no not like that temperature is not a file
2011-10-13T20:54:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	temperature is a keyword to look for...
2011-10-13T20:54:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	grep goes every file through to check for the word "temperature"
2011-10-13T20:55:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	if the "file" is not a file it may create some special odd things...
2011-10-13T20:55:00.000Z	heoa_	DasEi	practially meaning that I am running my comp now on ice path...
2011-10-13T20:56:00.000Z	DasEi	heoa_	cat file | grep expression ? I still don't understand
