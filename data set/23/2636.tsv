2009-01-04T07:41:00.000Z	ebaby		how can I make the settings stick after install - as graphics are fine during install but after they do not work
2009-01-04T07:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	What happens when you d
2009-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	... When you first boot after install?
2009-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	no graphics just some grey matter afer a while a dialog box saying Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode due to inability to configure settings - I get options but no matter what I input the same things re-occur - grey matter dark screen
2009-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	What version of Ubuntu?
2009-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	the strange thing is that graphics run fine (beautiful) during install  - 8.10
2009-01-04T07:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Not sure what the problem is but try removing your xorg.conf so X configures itself
2009-01-04T07:47:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	driver info says vesa is being used. switched Gedit file to openchrome but no real improvement. Trying to figure how to  make the settings that were used during install to stick afterwards
2009-01-04T07:48:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	May I ask how to accomplish removing the xorg.conf
2009-01-04T07:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	The thing is that they should stick, IIRC the xorg.conf configured for the live session is copied to the installed system
2009-01-04T07:52:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	they dont seem to be. This page seems to be describing that: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/54867 - but typing the sudo command gets me "cannot open display"
2009-01-04T07:53:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	should there be a space between "gedit" and "/boot..."
2009-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Can you boot the machine while staying on IRC?
2009-01-04T12:04:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	I'm on this IRC via a Mac G4 tower on the desk next to the machine I'm trying to get Ubuntu on
2009-01-04T12:05:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	although to be correct Ubuntu is on it. it just wont display correctly outside of the installer
2009-01-04T12:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Try going to a console and running "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop" then "startx"
2009-01-04T12:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Try it from a normal boot though, not from recovery mode ( or at least not as root )
2009-01-04T12:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Are you booted normally right now or in recovery mode?
2009-01-04T12:11:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	I'm at the recovery Menu right now
2009-01-04T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	OK, choose to continue booting normally and when X fails to start correctly go to a console with ctrl+alt+f7
2009-01-04T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ebaby	Make that ctrl+alt+f1 :)
2009-01-04T12:16:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	ok  when I press those keys nothing happens immediatlely except more intermittent white noise on screen finally after holding for a while I get the "Ubuntu is running in low-graphics" window/box
2009-01-04T12:20:00.000Z	ebaby	Jordan_U	all three will only start a repetitious back and forth of dialog windows
