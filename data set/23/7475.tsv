2005-08-10T06:24:00.000Z	Jomdom	BeatYou	it really hurts when you are working for someone who has "designers" spitting out ugly dreamweaver table based layouts that you have to build web apps in
2005-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	BeatYou	Jomdom	you into a lot of PHP? Yea I will never go back to tables now man, everything is just way to easy without them
2005-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	Jomdom	BeatYou	i'm a Ruby on Rails man now... PHP is like the tables of programming after using Rails :)

2005-08-10T06:26:00.000Z	BeatYou		its a programming language similar to pHP though?
2005-08-10T06:26:00.000Z	Jomdom		Rails is a framework built on Ruby (Ruby is the language)
