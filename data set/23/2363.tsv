2009-06-17T08:01:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		is there a way to get the 9.10 kernel on 9.04? and would it be unstable?
2009-06-17T08:02:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Nobody?
2009-06-17T08:02:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	yes, you can do it - download the files with wget and install with dpkg
2009-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	yes, 2.6.30 was just released - quite stable... the karmic kernel should be even more stable due to better testing etc
2009-06-17T08:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	k, but do you know that was a kernel error? (and fwiw, the breakage may well have been ubuntu devs' fault)
2009-06-17T08:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	that could be many things... for example a broken GRUB or something
2009-06-17T08:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	karmic itself isn't released yet
2009-06-17T08:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	but you can get the kernel from... somewhere (not sure offhand)
2009-06-17T08:09:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	so probably upgrading your kernel will help -- .30 is stable for me and fixes a lot of bugs... should be safe to use
2009-06-17T08:10:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	no reason not to, IMO (it's safe) .. just a matter of finding the files... I forget where to get them, but !kernel will probably point you in the right direction
2009-06-17T08:10:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	(don't compile your own unless you /really/ know what you're doing... there are compiled ones somewhere)
2009-06-17T08:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	upgrading to .30 kernel is part of the workaround for that bug
2009-06-17T08:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	look in the bleeding-edge section of the guide
2009-06-17T08:31:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	if you need help, poke me
2009-06-17T08:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	no, you /only/ want the new kernel
2009-06-17T08:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	(unless you happen to have intel graphics issues you didn't mention)
2009-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	yes, it can
2009-06-17T08:39:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	the other stuff involves installing possibly-unstable mostly-untested xorg code etc and can result in total system borkage (but it probably won't)
2009-06-17T08:40:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	no, you need to add it to /boot/grub/menu.lst if not already done, then choose it from grub's boot menu
2009-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	...not really, no :)
2009-06-17T08:50:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst (might be worth backing that file up before editing)
2009-06-17T08:50:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	and then create a new entry modelled upon the normal one you use currently -- but point it at the .30 kernel you just installed
2009-06-17T08:50:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	PROject-Emerald	I'll PM you my entry, hold on
