2007-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	SystemOverload		How can I run tightvnc after I installed it
2007-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	SystemOverload		I need to start a server.
2007-08-25T11:22:00.000Z	SystemOverload		Well, I need a friend who is using Windows to be able to connect
2007-08-25T11:22:00.000Z	SystemOverload		And I think I need tightVNC for that
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	SystemOverload		Did it work for windows?
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	yep. i have done it with my parents' PC (winxp)
2007-08-25T11:24:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	RDP works also if it is winxp pro
2007-08-25T11:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	just IP addie (leave port as it is)
2007-08-25T11:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	you'll have to tweak a little bit with your friend (depends on how s/he set it up :)
2007-08-25T11:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	have fun and good luck
2007-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	RDP? it'll won't show on his monitor; only on yours - it's a drawback
2007-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	VNC is better if your friend wants to see what you are doing
2007-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	i would do, too. ;)
2007-08-25T11:33:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	tightvnc-viewer (use tab key to complete typing)
2007-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	no, on your friend's
2007-08-25T11:35:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	oh! okay. another way around then. YES.
2007-08-25T11:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	use tab key to complete typing .. tightvn (tab) ... it should complete the whole thing (get server instead of viewer)
2007-08-25T11:38:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	it works in the terminal
2007-08-25T11:43:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	vncserver is it? i just found it in the search. systemoverload-desktop:1 sounds right. way to go! :)
2007-08-25T11:44:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	ah. just scrolled up the search. yep. i see tightvncserver. that should do it.
2007-08-25T11:45:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	yeah. it should pop up the message if you want to allow or reject his connection
2007-08-25T11:55:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	terrific!
2007-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	IcemanV9	SystemOverload	pkill tightvncserver
