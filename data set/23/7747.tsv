2006-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre ? it doesn't work?
2006-10-13T09:52:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	hm. i don't know if there is a problem with the package or not. i installed java long ago.
2006-10-13T09:55:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	apt-cache policy sun-java5-jre -- what does it tell ya?
2006-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	well. i don't think multiverse is enabled since it cannot find its package
2006-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	if it is enabled, then did you update to re-sync the package list? sudo apt-get update
2006-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	apt-cache policy sun-java5-jre (again to see if it is present or not)
2006-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	IcemanV9	gandolfthewizard	close the app (synaptic)
