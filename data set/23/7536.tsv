2005-07-03T06:34:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	apt-get remove --purge <package>
2005-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	once purged i can do an apt-get install <package> as if i never did it before right?
2005-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	yes
2005-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	I'd like to help more but mysql isn't my area :(
2005-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	it is not a mysql problem though, apt-get is not removing everything it is suppose to, even with an apt-get --purge
2005-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	I just checked on packages.ubuntu.com and my.cnf is part of the mysql-common-4.1 package.  Perhaps try reinstalling that.
2005-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	i have tried reinstalling it more then once
2005-07-03T06:48:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	-comon or -server ?
2005-07-03T06:48:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	-server
2005-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	that is the only one i had install prviously
2005-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	i guess I tried to manualy delete /etc/mysql, i know that is the problem (stupid me) that is why I am trying to completly remove the package and reinstall
2005-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	-server depends on -common so it would be installed when you installed it.  Try deinstalling both
2005-07-03T06:50:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	it = -server
2005-07-03T06:51:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	when removing -common i get this http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/273
2005-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	hmm - do you get the same error if you try deinstalling again?
2005-07-03T06:54:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	i mkdir /etc/mysql and then re ran the apt-get remove --purge and it ran with out a problem
2005-07-03T06:54:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	i just did 'apt-get install libmysqlclient14-dev mysql-server-4.1' and it installed with out a hitch
2005-07-03T06:54:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	smart work!! - now try reinstalling
2005-07-03T06:55:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	too quick for me
2005-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	ok it looks like it is a mysql problem now
2005-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	kishkumen	djs	i'll ask #mysql, thanks though ;-)
2005-07-03T06:57:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	you feel you have a clean install now?
2005-07-03T06:57:00.000Z	djs	kishkumen	ok - good luck.
