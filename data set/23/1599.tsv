2010-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	how did you prepare your usb stick?
2010-01-12T00:58:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	I used bootmyISO. It installed grub on the stick and then I just copied my ISO over, and edited the menu.lst settings
2010-01-12T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	I don't now about bootmyiso but I've been told, that yicannot "copy" an iso to a usb stick
2010-01-12T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	I don't now about bootmyiso but I've been told, that you cannot "copy" an iso to a usb stick
2010-01-12T01:00:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	well thats what bootmyISO is there to do
2010-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	sorry - as I never used either I cannot help
2010-01-19T00:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	install iptraf - that tells you more/easier
2010-01-19T00:44:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	iptraf, ok thanks
2010-01-19T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	you're welcome :-)
2010-02-13T02:07:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	try <ctrl><alt>F2
2010-02-13T02:07:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	that just restarts X... not trying it again lol
2010-02-13T02:09:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	no - <ctrl><alt><backspace> used to do that - with <ctrl><alt>F2 (or 3,4,5) you get another virtual terminal
2010-02-13T02:09:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	I swear I don't
2010-02-13T02:10:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	I believe you - although I never saw that .  do you really need a terminal or will applications/accessories/terminal do as well?
2010-02-13T02:11:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	well, it would be nice if I forget to launch something from an x terminal, so I can see what errors its producing
2010-02-13T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	you get the stdout in every terminal
2010-03-29T01:04:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	grep -i "phrase" <logfile> | wc
2010-03-29T01:04:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	thanks
2010-04-04T02:39:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	what is your shell?
2010-04-04T02:39:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	bash
2010-04-04T02:41:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	strange - try grep -i kent /var/log/syslog
2010-04-04T02:42:00.000Z	Kentrel	guntbert	it doesn't give an error in that case
2010-04-04T02:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Kentrel	as I said before: the * is expanded by the shell - so grep doesn't see it at all
