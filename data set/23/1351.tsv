2010-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	seema_ic		I've pidgin and empathy and their plugin..they don't support webcam..I'm specifically looking for Yahoo Messenger to be running with its features..
2010-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	seema_ic		Pidgin, amsn
2010-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	seema_ic		empathy
2010-06-10T14:54:00.000Z	seema_ic		some people have manage to run Yahoo Messenger with all its features using Wine
2010-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	seema_ic		Tell me the native one..who can communicate with other yahoo contacts with webcam and voice chat?
2010-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	seema_ic		r u sure? can Empathy connect with other yahoo contacts and do webcam and voice chat?
2010-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Maybe try gyachi... http://www.webupd8.org/2009/05/howto-linux-ubuntu-gyachi-yahoo.html
2010-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Let me look it over
2010-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Not sure if it works in 10.04 anymore
2010-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Np.
2010-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Not gyachi after all. Search google a bit for alternatives
2010-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	I know what ya mean. Sometimes takes a lot of googling. I may have found an option or two. Just give me a bit to look them over, k?
2010-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	http://gyachi.sourceforge.net/ <---- Try that. It seems like the only option besides kopete, pidgin, and empathy. Best I can do for you without ever trying one for yahoo
2010-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Ya, it looks like it's going to be quite the challenge indeed. Just try not to give up!
2010-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	It seems there were a couple different variations of that client, but the link I gave you is the most recent I could find of the variations. I really hope it works for you
2010-06-10T15:22:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	I guess you do have to install that
2010-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	I remember seeing that person's name before and I believe they're the one that manages gyachi
2010-06-10T15:24:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Take your time. I'm trying to help, but I can't be much since I've never used that program before so can't vouch for it
2010-06-10T15:33:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	How's that coming along?
2010-06-10T15:38:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	Alright. I'm sorry if that doesn't work for you. I was having trouble sleeping and so figured I'd hop on here to try and help, but my brain is about ready for bed. I'll try and stay up a little longer to try and help :)
2010-06-10T15:44:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	No need to thank me. Just trying to help where I can even if I'll be learning at the same time as you haha
2010-06-10T15:48:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	That's the beauty of going from Windows to Ubuntu and just life in general. We need to take the opportunities to learn when given the chance. :P
2010-06-10T16:20:00.000Z	greenjon	seema_ic	how's that coming along? haven't heard from you in a little while
