2009-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks
2009-02-05T05:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	the alternate is a text based installer. NOT a livecd
2009-02-05T05:24:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	So I can't use it to make a LiveUSB? Or at least, I'd have to install it somewhere first and then use the installation to make one?
2009-02-05T05:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	I dont think the alternate has that feature.  I thought that was only on livecd
2009-02-05T05:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	But you wiull have grub errors or other booting issues
2009-02-05T05:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	You could do it with a bootable cd but then you could not use that cd drive during the session
2009-02-05T05:36:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	I can live with that
2009-02-05T05:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	I can give you the basic instructions but you may need to work out details based on your hardware
2009-02-05T05:37:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	That's OK. I'll probably just go with a SuperGrub disc or something. I'm fielding a few ideas at the moment so the details can wait.
2009-02-05T05:38:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	I haven't even got to the full-partition encryption yet...
2009-02-05T05:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	Bad idea
2009-02-05T05:38:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	How so?
2009-02-05T05:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	Just encrypt your data
2009-02-05T05:41:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	I understand ubuntu leaves several usage tracks throughout the filesystem rather than just in /home. Installed programs are also stored outside /home. There is a rationale for doing the filesystem as well
2009-02-05T05:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	I know what I need to protect, how to protect it and where it is.. Just no need to do more
2009-02-05T05:42:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	I can't be so sure
2009-02-05T05:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	NOt a problem, just no crying in here when it goes boom..
2009-02-05T05:43:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	This is an experiment. So long as it doesn't do it all over my laptop's Vista install there's no milk spilt
2009-02-05T05:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	Look at my notes at how I did it for my installed system and you should be able to get it to do your external
2009-02-05T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wemdowemd	look in your PM from me
2009-02-05T05:49:00.000Z	wemdowemd	Jack_Sparrow	jken146: Thanks for all the advice, I'll go do some thinking...
