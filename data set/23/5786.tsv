2006-09-05T16:21:00.000Z	Trephine		4 hours of searching and nothing
2006-09-05T16:23:00.000Z	Trephine		icgek: I have it running on a 1999 iMac with 233 mHz processor
2006-09-05T16:24:00.000Z	Trephine		4gb
2006-09-05T16:24:00.000Z	Trephine		hd total
2006-09-05T16:25:00.000Z	Trephine		Yes
2006-09-05T16:25:00.000Z	Trephine		I originally thought I had to run Xubuntu on it because of the age
2006-09-05T16:25:00.000Z	Trephine		wb Hobbsee
2006-09-05T16:25:00.000Z	Trephine		o158mb
2006-09-05T16:26:00.000Z	Trephine		Apparently. When it had OS 8 on it it said it had 54mb
2006-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	Trephine		The alternate install cd is great if you think you don't have enough ram
2006-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	could be a matter of not starting the power management processes...
2006-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	Trephine	Lynoure	you mean the hibernate problem?
2006-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	yes
2006-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	Trephine	Lynoure	I will see if I can find out how to access that, thank you
2006-09-05T16:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	I can try to help you further once I have had some food
2006-09-05T16:37:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	some people use sysv-rc-conf for it, but you can also do it manually. Have you fiddled with starting/stopping of processes for a runlevel before? The process in question could be acpid and possibly acpi-support
2006-09-05T16:39:00.000Z	Trephine	Lynoure	No I have not
2006-09-05T16:41:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	not yet... I'm just having foodboredom
2006-09-05T16:42:00.000Z	Trephine	Lynoure	I was told that it might be a bios thing. Is that possible?
2006-09-05T16:45:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	I guess it could, but then I'd expect it to restart or shutdown instead of hibernation, but I can be wrong
2006-09-05T16:48:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	if you have an entry for power management in bios, you could turn it off there too, easier
2006-09-05T05:05:00.000Z	Trephine	Lynoure	I am dead tired and cross-eyed at this point. I will come back tomorrow whether or not I nead help. Thank you so much. =) Bye Hobbsee!
2006-09-05T05:06:00.000Z	Lynoure	Trephine	sleep well
