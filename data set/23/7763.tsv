2005-05-12T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 no idea.. when in doubt read the docs. that are proberly there.
2005-05-12T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 or check the things home page.
2005-05-12T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 in the doc dir - theres a readme.pdf
2005-05-12T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 one of those downloads had the N64 emu allready compiled - just run the thing ./whatever
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	ok, ive extracted the file, now i have a folder with some files, what to do next?
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 try LOOKING at the files
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 you do have some N64 roms downloaded?
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	ive tryed, but i never installed anything before
2005-05-12T11:42:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	yes i have
2005-05-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 the package i downloaded.. you just cd to that dir and run ./mupen64
2005-05-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 no installing needed.
2005-05-12T11:43:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	but the . is that the rom file?
2005-05-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 ./command is how you run things when they are in the current dir. Bash FUNdamentals.
2005-05-12T11:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 if you look. thers only one executable in the arvhicve.  ./mupen64 will run it...
2005-05-12T11:46:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	./mupen64: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-05-12T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 then you are out of luck. they compiled it with a different version of the libaraies on your system.
2005-05-12T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ringmauer	 next bet would be to get the source archive and recompile for your own system.
2005-05-12T11:47:00.000Z	ringmauer	Dr_Willis	ok, i think i need som irl help for this, tnx anyway
