2010-08-08T01:38:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	of course - GUI or CLI?
2010-08-08T01:41:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	I don't know.
2010-08-08T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	just do like ActionParsnip and mrman208 already said :-)
2010-08-08T01:43:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	ActionParsnip, mrman208: The main server also fails me.
2010-08-08T01:46:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	please !pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-08-08T01:48:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	http://paste.ubuntu.com/474659/
2010-08-08T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	are you really on feisty (7.04)?
2010-08-08T01:50:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	Guess so. I mentioned earlier that I had a very old version of Ubuntu here.
2010-08-08T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	that version has reached its "end of life" (support wise) 2 years ago
2010-08-08T01:52:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	So you are basically telling me there is nothing to be done?
2010-08-08T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	you could upgrade - better to reinstall a fresh version
2010-08-08T01:55:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	then forget that old installation, download a current iso and install
2010-08-08T01:55:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	Where can I get a current ISO? Is the file big?
2010-08-08T01:57:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	Thank you!
2010-08-08T01:57:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	no problem :) and Good luck :-)
2010-08-08T02:07:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	I am downloading the PC intel, the first version available... Is that the right one? I have an intel and it was originally a PC...
2010-08-08T02:07:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	Meaning Windows, by PC... I suppose.
2010-08-08T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	yes, the desktop version is what you want, be sure to md5sum check the iso before burning it
2010-08-08T02:08:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	How do I do that?
2010-08-08T02:09:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	see what ubottu said above
2010-08-08T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	you check the iso, burn it then boot from it
2010-08-08T02:13:00.000Z	ubunt1	guntbert	SimoSayez, Dr_Willis: OK. Does this build of Ubuntu comes with the CD/DVD creator shown in BurningIsoHowto?
2010-08-08T02:15:00.000Z	guntbert	ubunt1	yes, the current iso brings that (and Dr_Willis is not paying attention :-))
