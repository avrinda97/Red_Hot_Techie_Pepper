2008-09-03T17:05:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	you got any ideas?
2008-09-03T17:05:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	im assuming you tried rm, right? what happens?
2008-09-03T17:06:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	it's a directory so rmdir gives me this: rmdir: failed to remove `Backup': Device or resource busy
2008-09-03T17:06:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	what exactly is this folder? a mount point for something?
2008-09-03T17:07:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	yeah it's a mount point for a samba share that somehow got messed up when I changed my password in the domain
2008-09-03T17:07:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	try killing samba, then rm'ing it
2008-09-03T17:09:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	/etc/init.d/samba restart <-- says file not found
2008-09-03T17:09:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	pkill samba && pkill smb
2008-09-03T17:10:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	and how do I start it now?
2008-09-03T17:10:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	dont, delete the mount point now
2008-09-03T17:10:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	still not working
2008-09-03T17:10:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	I realized that I can't start samba 'cause it's not installed, I just have samba-common installed so I can mount shares
2008-09-03T17:12:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	is this share still mounted?
2008-09-03T17:12:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	nope, umount /media/Backup seems to work (doesn't output anything atleast)
2008-09-03T17:12:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	type 'mount' just to make sure
2008-09-03T17:13:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	if you ever run into a situation where you cant umount something because its busy, but you really need to, you can do a umount -l <mount point>
2008-09-03T17:13:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	thanks, I'll write that down
2008-09-03T17:13:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	the -l is sort of a cheat, but it works fine for most purposes
2008-09-03T17:14:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	alright
2008-09-03T17:15:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	I changed the credentials now so that Ubuntu uses the admin account to mount the share instead of my own. The admin's password never expires/changes so I hope that prevents this
2008-09-03T17:17:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	that should work if thats what caused the problem in the first place. i dont really have the whole story
2008-09-03T17:18:00.000Z	negge	dougsko	I'm not absolutely sure but that's the only thing I could think of. It seemed to have started on Monday although I noticed it today. I recall changing my password on Monday as well so... Let's hope that was it, if not I don't see what could be causing it.
2008-09-03T17:18:00.000Z	dougsko	negge	that situation really shouldnt come up often. ive only ever seen it with usb sticks
