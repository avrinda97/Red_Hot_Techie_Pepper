2007-02-18T09:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	do you get an error when you try to boot?  do you see it in the bootloader?  elucidate please :)
2007-02-18T09:04:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	can you see the partition at all?
2007-02-18T09:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	preface my name to your comments.  makes it easier to track.  just type sil<tab><tab> and it'll fill in :)
2007-02-18T09:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	ok, if you see the partition, what is it?  HDxx or SDxx?
2007-02-18T09:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	if the partition with windows is all the way over on /dev/hdd6... it'll take a bit of poking to get it to work right in grub.  check the howto, I THINK it has the info you need.
2007-02-18T09:11:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	what entry did you put in, and where?
2007-02-18T09:12:00.000Z	rave	SilentDis	i am pasting my windows entries below
2007-02-18T09:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	next time, use the pastebin please
2007-02-18T09:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	it looks like you'll need to 'trick' windows into thinking it's the primary drive, I believe it's called mapping, give me a moment please...
2007-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	rave	SilentDis	ok
2007-02-18T09:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	you'll need to add 2 lines to your config, to map the partition to the primary for windows to boot.  see this page from the grub manual: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/DOS_002fWindows.html#DOS_002fWindows
2007-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	rave	SilentDis	ok
2007-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	rave	SilentDis	 makeactive  is saying Error 12: Invalid device requested
2007-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	please pastebin your current grub config, and a quick note about what you're looking to do, I think i'll have to actually 'see' it to help :)
2007-02-18T09:33:00.000Z	rave	SilentDis	i have pasted it
2007-02-18T09:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	rave	url?
