2009-01-27T03:19:00.000Z	calliope		hello I have not upgraded in some time,  probably more than a year, and now when I run the update manager, there is a New distribution relase '7.10' is available with a button for upgrade. .. .. it then tries to down load a bunch of files which ends with a notice that several downloads did not succeed and then exits.
2009-01-27T03:19:00.000Z	calliope		how do I get past this ?
2009-01-27T03:20:00.000Z	calliope		i tried several times
2009-01-27T03:20:00.000Z	calliope		k
2009-01-27T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	That is because 7.04 is no longer supported, you can upgrade if you need to but you will need to add the archived ( no longer maintained ) repositories to your sources.lst ( but you need to upgrade somehow, 7.04 is not secure )
2009-01-27T03:28:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	ok so where can I learn what other sources still contain the upgrade to version 7.10
2009-01-27T03:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	looking now
2009-01-27T03:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/
2009-01-27T03:31:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	ok so substitiute old-releases.ubuntu onto each line then
2009-01-27T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	yes
2009-01-27T03:57:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	the upgrade tool said it wanted to change the feisty entries to be gutsy entries and so I surmise that the sources.list should have a set of both entries for feisty and for gutsy. what do you think about that?
2009-01-27T03:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	It should only have entries for one release at a time ( you can probably trust the upgrade tool )
2009-01-27T04:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	What does it do exactly?
2009-01-27T04:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	Ahh, I think the safest ( if a bit cludged ) thing to do would be to stop the upgrade, put duplicate entries for *feisty*, one set for archive.ubuntu.com, one for old-releases so one of them will be valid both before and after your sources.list is modified by the upgrader. That or just do a manual apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-01-27T04:06:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	so gutsy entries need to be archive.ubuntu.com is that correct
2009-01-27T04:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	Yes
2009-01-27T04:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	Yes
2009-01-27T04:18:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	as soon as the upgrade tool reports that it failed to get archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/feisty the program exits and doesnt try the change to gutsy
2009-01-27T04:19:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	I see a few typos so ill try it again
2009-01-27T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	If it doesn't work after fixing the typos you may need to change the sources.list and do a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" which doesn't have as many sanity checks as update-manager
2009-01-27T04:26:00.000Z	calliope	Jordan_U	OK so Im running the sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is this going to change the feisty entries to gutsy or should I do that manually
2009-01-27T04:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	You do that manually
2009-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	calliope	Yes, you may run into some general upgrade problems of course
