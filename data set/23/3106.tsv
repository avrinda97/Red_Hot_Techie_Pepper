2009-04-18T19:50:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	Thanks.
2009-04-18T20:05:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	looks like the video card isn't configured correctly.. what kind of card.?
2009-04-18T20:05:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	Not sure. How do I find out?
2009-04-18T20:06:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	lspci or sudo lshw
2009-04-18T20:06:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	lspci | grep VGA ?
2009-04-18T20:06:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	that might work too

2009-04-18T20:10:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	looks like and older card.. should be supported well. Have you checked in System/Admin/Hardware drivers for a driver that needs activating?
2009-04-18T20:11:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	He says there's nothing available.

2009-04-18T20:12:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	No one ever helped him... :(
2009-04-18T20:16:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	there is an older driver for that card.. a 96.x.x.x something.. hang on.
2009-04-18T20:16:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	Thanks.
2009-04-18T20:17:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	he might need to install nvidia-glx-legacy and then look in the hardware section of System/Admin again.. other than that, there is a driver on nvidia's site for that card that can be installed.. however with every kernel upgrade he'll need to reinstall it.
2009-04-18T20:18:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	or he can use the generic nv driver but it won't give him the special effects
2009-04-18T20:19:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	Lmao. I got him to send me a screenshot. It's there but his screen resolution is too low to install it!
2009-04-18T20:19:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	The button at the bottom of the window isn't visible! Lol
2009-04-18T20:19:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	:)
2009-04-18T20:20:00.000Z	scunizi	tphilosopher	gotta runn.. have fun with that!
2009-04-18T20:20:00.000Z	tphilosopher	scunizi	Okay. Thanks. See ya
