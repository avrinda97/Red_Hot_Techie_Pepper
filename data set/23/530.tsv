2011-08-30T23:21:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	and it happens if i just browse to the drive and try to open it
2011-08-30T23:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	use sudo
2011-08-30T23:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	that's because you're authenticating with gksudo
2011-08-30T23:19:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	yeah but i don't wanna execute a command every time i want to mount a drive
2011-08-30T23:20:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	it started to give me those messages since i installed a "ntfs-manager" software
2011-08-30T23:21:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	i have removed it but it's still the same
2011-08-30T23:22:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	a pastebin http://pastebin.com/M1PcbzTw
2011-08-30T23:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	what are you mounting with?
2011-08-30T23:24:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	new problem: i can't even mount it with  sudo mount /media/Backup
2011-08-30T23:24:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	it tells me that there's no such directory
2011-08-30T23:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	there isn't you specify the /devblahblah first then tyhe target as /media
2011-08-30T23:25:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	/media/Backup
2011-08-30T23:25:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	i've mounted my backup but i can't mount my storage drive (which is the one i need)
2011-08-30T23:25:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	it still tells me it can't find it
2011-08-30T23:26:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	and i typed /dev/sdb1 and then /media/Files
2011-08-30T23:26:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/Filer
2011-08-30T23:26:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	is it plugged in? if so what /dev/ is it? go to /dev find it
2011-08-30T23:27:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	yes it's obviously plugged in as i see it in the file manager
2011-08-30T23:28:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	it says "failed to access mountpoint /media/Files: The file or directory doesn't exist (translated, might not say exactly that in english)
2011-08-30T23:28:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan	unplug and try again
2011-08-31T00:15:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	i'm actually logged in as root now
2011-08-31T00:15:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	can't change the owner of my NTFS drive
2011-08-31T00:15:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	aeon-ltd	not on any of them actually
