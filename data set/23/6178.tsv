2006-06-03T11:35:00.000Z	_jpierre		Hi.. Is there a way to install KDE on Ubunto Gnome. I tried using the Kubuntu CD and running the Classical sudo apt-get install kubuntu desktop and it didn't work
2006-06-03T11:35:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	It's 'kubuntu-desktop'. You might prefer to use aptitude ...
2006-06-03T11:36:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Well I did kubuntu-desktop it didn't work. What is aptitude
2006-06-03T11:37:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	It's a package installation program. Why couldn't it complete? Can you pastebin the error?
2006-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Will get you the error. Please wait as it's on another machine
2006-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	I might leave in a while. If I'm not here, maybe try asking in #kubuntu ...
2006-06-03T11:39:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	It will only take a minute
2006-06-03T11:39:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	just a sec
2006-06-03T11:39:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	Ok ...
2006-06-03T11:41:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Heere it is ;       E: Couldn't find package kubuntu-desktop
2006-06-03T11:43:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	Weird...on dapper?
2006-06-03T11:43:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Yes. Well it's a dapper upgraded from breezy
2006-06-03T11:45:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	It's probably something really simple, but I don't know what it is. Is your sources.list OK ?
2006-06-03T11:45:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	How can I know if it's OK. Please give me a guideline and I will check
2006-06-03T11:46:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	I'm feeling there is something wrong with My sources.list
2006-06-03T11:46:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	But can't figure out what it is
2006-06-03T11:47:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	Check that out.
2006-06-03T11:47:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Where can I get source-o-matic from?
2006-06-03T11:48:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_jpierre	It's a website. Check what ubotu said right after my source-o-matic comment...
2006-06-03T11:49:00.000Z	_jpierre	neutrinomass	Will give that a try mate :O) THanks
