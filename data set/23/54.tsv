2012-09-15T21:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	The channel is better for help, my suggestion of a understandable description does not mean I know the fix, and I don't pm. ;)
2012-09-18T21:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	There is a out of the bios boot from menu mine is triggered with f12 at powering on yours may be the same or different.
2012-09-18T21:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	I don't PM the channel is your best help, and I would not just PM without asking in the future. ;)
2012-09-18T21:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Did you understand my reference to the out of the bios bot menu? Some do not realize this option, it allows you to not change the bios to boot another HD or usb or cd....etc.
2012-09-18T21:57:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: Yes, F9 is for boot menu, and i've press ESC for select device for boot
2012-09-18T21:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Hmm that worked?
2012-09-18T21:59:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: no...
2012-09-18T21:59:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	I use the arrow keys to move to the device to boot then enter.
2012-09-18T22:02:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: yes yes, After there is a hyphen that appears top left of the screen flashes. And then the CD should start. But it does not work and the pc boot to HD
2012-09-18T22:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	THis cd has worked on this computer?
2012-09-18T22:03:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: no it's an other CD, but same configuration and same brand
2012-09-18T22:04:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: and with an other computer I've check files, all are present
2012-09-18T22:04:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Could it be a burned to fast or md5sum problem, or just a bad burn in general?
2012-09-18T22:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	I would use a usb myself, but cd's are cheap if you have empty ones check the md5sum of the ISO and burn it slow as an image.
2012-09-18T22:06:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: I left to choose the burning speed by software. And the image was already burned to another CD and ran.
2012-09-18T22:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Sometimes using a what seems a good cause and effect is not really the answer to success, I would md5sum check the ISO, tell us if you do not know what that means and try another slowest burn possible or a usb.
2012-09-18T22:11:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: md5sum is good, I go burn slowly
2012-09-18T22:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Cool good luck, ;)
2012-09-18T22:12:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	Thanks, but wich speed is good for burn it ?
2012-09-18T22:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	Most burners go pretty fast these days I would just choose the slowest option.
2012-09-18T22:13:00.000Z	ougogo	wilee-nilee	: 1x ? o_O
2012-09-18T22:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ougogo	I doubt you have a 1x it used to be 4x
