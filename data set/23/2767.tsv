2009-04-27T08:52:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		bah
2009-04-27T08:52:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		failed to load nvidia kernel module
2009-04-27T08:52:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		great, tell me WHY
2009-04-27T08:52:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		:P
2009-04-27T08:54:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		http://viking.austin.tx.us/Xorg.0.log <-- can anyone see anything obvious in here that's preventing the proprietary nvidia drivers from loading?
2009-04-27T08:55:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		the only thing I see is an initial failure to detect keyboard/mouse (because they're legacy devices), but they work fine
2009-04-27T08:55:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		and then the error that the nvidia module can't load
2009-04-27T08:55:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	what driver did you load?
2009-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	The nvidia 180 one
2009-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	the one in the repos and in the restricted driver manager?
2009-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	Restricted driver manager.
2009-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	you might try rebooting into the recovery kernel and using the "fix x" option on the menu
2009-04-27T08:57:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	I did already, it completes but does not actually fix the problem
2009-04-27T08:57:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	also have you installed nvidia-settings?
2009-04-27T08:58:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	check what SoulNothing mentioned above.
2009-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	swap, not /swap
2009-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	tue
2009-04-27T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	having a seperate /home is typically a good idea
2009-04-27T09:02:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	Not a big issue on modern systems, although I'll agree it's still a good habit.
2009-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	now you mention 64 bit.. there's a bug I remember reading about nvidia and 64 bit.. you might find it on nvidia's site
2009-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	Still current in forceware 180.51 ?
2009-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	scunizi	CuriosTiger	not sure.. there is  a work a round.. but I forgot what it was
2009-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	scunizi	I'll take a look. Thanks.
