2008-08-21T22:45:00.000Z	tzd		what's equivalent to Amarok in a gnome environment please?
2008-08-21T22:46:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	amarok can run under gnome
2008-08-21T22:46:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	yeah but it doesn't work that well... at least not when i used to run gnome
2008-08-21T22:47:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	I use it and it works just fine
2008-08-21T22:47:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	under xfce also
2008-08-21T22:47:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	but try exail if you like, apperently its good
2008-08-21T22:47:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	lucky you :) Actually under xfce is more interesting since I'm planning to use xubuntu
2008-08-21T22:47:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	yea I use xfce amarok runs great
2008-08-21T22:48:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	although you still need a few kde packets to make it work right?
2008-08-21T22:48:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	yea but if you apt-get amarok they install
2008-08-21T22:49:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	ok, will try it out on my xubuntu install... trying to prepare for a future eee pc with xubuntu and hopefully a smooth working amarok/exaile version :)
2008-08-21T22:50:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	thanks for your help!
2008-08-21T22:50:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	np

2008-08-22T00:09:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	x86 will work fine
2008-08-22T00:10:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	ah you again... i should have you on speed dial ;P Thanks once again mate! :)
2008-08-22T00:10:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	 lol
2008-08-22T00:10:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	installing xubuntu now?
2008-08-22T00:11:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	about to download it for a usb bootable drive... well actually i'm creating the bootable usb drive now
2008-08-22T00:11:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	gotcha
2008-08-22T00:12:00.000Z	jmichelsen	tzd	I prefer the cd method, usually just works but gl
2008-08-22T00:14:00.000Z	tzd	jmichelsen	yeah me too, this is the first time I'm using the usb drive... need it though since an eee pc won't have a cd drive and i don't have an external one either
