2007-02-12T15:10:00.000Z	clearzen		How do you change the top and bottom images for the cube in beryl??
2007-02-12T15:12:00.000Z	clearzen		ben16s:If it is a server install it won't have X11
2007-02-12T15:13:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: ssh and putty x11 forwarding can't work on an ubuntu server??
2007-02-12T15:13:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	Well a true server install won't have the xorg packages for a desktop
2007-02-12T15:14:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	Servers don't use x11 because there is not a gui
2007-02-12T15:14:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	But you can always add it with something like
2007-02-12T15:14:00.000Z	clearzen		aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2007-02-12T15:15:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: yes but on my windows machine i've got Xming
2007-02-12T15:15:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	It wasts resources to run a gui on a server though
2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: that's why i want to esxport it
2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	Use nomachine instead of putty for X11 forwarding
2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	It has always worked better for me anyway
2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: ok i will try
2007-02-12T15:17:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: because with ssh i've got the error message : can't open display
2007-02-12T15:17:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: when i launch an xclock app for example
2007-02-12T15:17:00.000Z	clearzen		ben16s:http://www.nomachine.com/
2007-02-12T15:18:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	http://www.nomachine.com/download.php    for the download page
2007-02-12T15:19:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: it's for nx server??
2007-02-12T15:20:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	no it is a client/server program for remote administration including x11, sound, and video forwarding
2007-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: so it can work with an ubuntu srver even if X server is not installed on it
2007-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	clearzen	ben16s	Yes. It is not limited to X11 forwarding.
2007-02-12T15:22:00.000Z	clearzen		 ben16s: Check out the documentation it should tell you how to do what you want with it
2007-02-12T15:22:00.000Z	ben16s	clearzen	: ok i'll try, thanks
