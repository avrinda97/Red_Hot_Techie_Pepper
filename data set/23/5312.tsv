2009-05-20T09:28:00.000Z	th0r	arand	correct. for sda6.
2009-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	th0r	arand	FluxD the command might be chroot instead of root
2009-07-23T04:29:00.000Z	arand	th0r	actually, since wine has write and read access to your whole home directory (and all other dirs you have rw to) quite nasty things _can_ happen, I've heard about one that dumped .EXE files all over these directories... not directly harmful but annoying and a bugger to clean up afterwards.
2009-07-23T04:30:00.000Z	th0r	arand	yeah....it would be a mess, but it wouldn't do any permanent damage
2009-07-23T04:31:00.000Z	arand	th0r	Unless you consider completely thrashing your login with all your configurations "permanent" no.
2009-07-23T04:32:00.000Z	th0r	arand	it is highly doubtful it could do all that...it would have to be smart enough to address drive Z and then navigate to your home directory
2009-07-23T04:33:00.000Z	th0r	arand	unless it was a programming work of art any damage would be limited to ~/.wine/drive_c and folders beneath it.
2009-07-23T04:33:00.000Z	arand	th0r	well undoubtedly they already do: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=72598
2009-07-23T04:34:00.000Z	arand	th0r	I guess since wine willingly shows it all those drives it just writes to everything it can get it's hands on, not that hard.
2009-07-23T04:35:00.000Z	th0r	arand	and all of that started when he ran some viruses he had collected using wine....god don't help dumb
2009-07-23T04:37:00.000Z	arand	th0r	Well, it was for an experimental reason. However, it does not lessen the fact that wine and viruses may be considerably harmful.
2009-07-23T04:38:00.000Z	th0r	arand	looks like I will have to concede that one
2009-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	th0r	arand	would be interested in knowing how those got into /usr without the root password. The files he found in ~/.local/share/applications don't surprise me...that is where wine puts the .desktop files for installed software
2009-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	arand	th0r	what I think is that wine needs restrictive sandboxing, tightly confined to ~/wine/c_drive/
2009-07-23T04:40:00.000Z	th0r	arand	agreed...I thought that was the default install
2009-07-23T04:41:00.000Z	arand	th0r	it is not, it has full rw to everything the user has through the Z: device, which is kinda scary...
2009-07-23T04:41:00.000Z	th0r	arand	that is....I wasn't aware of that. Will have to look into limiting that 'feature'
2009-07-23T04:42:00.000Z	arand	th0r	losher: and it is not a simple procedure either >_<
2009-07-23T04:45:00.000Z	th0r	arand	well...now you got me spooked. I could dump wine but I need dreamweaver
2009-07-23T04:47:00.000Z	arand	th0r	well so far only people that have intentionally run viruses have been affected (afaik) so currently the problem might not be that big, and as long as you are selective with the apps that runs in wine I guess the safety might be satisfiable, it might become a considerable hole in the future though, if nothing is done...
2009-07-23T04:49:00.000Z	th0r	arand	agreed. If kompozer didn't crash on tables I could dump dreamweaver, but until there is a decent wysiwyg html editor I will stick with wine
2009-07-23T04:50:00.000Z	arand	th0r	don't we all ;) myself I keep windows installs for gaming.
