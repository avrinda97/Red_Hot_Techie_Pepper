2005-04-27T05:56:00.000Z	duken		just change your repository
2005-04-27T05:57:00.000Z	visor	duken	have you read already the ubuntu guide?
2005-04-27T05:58:00.000Z	duken	visor	yes
2005-04-27T05:58:00.000Z	visor	duken	so you have all the codecs installed?
2005-04-27T05:59:00.000Z	duken	visor	i try it
2005-04-27T06:02:00.000Z	duken	visor	u mean i must installed multimedia codecs ?
2005-04-27T06:02:00.000Z	visor	duken	youll try? or you already installed them? most of the times it is because of the codecs (ubuntu does not come with mp3 support by default) if not, then try changing the output plugin to esd wich is what gnome use
2005-04-27T06:02:00.000Z	duken	visor	i try now
2005-04-27T06:03:00.000Z	visor	duken	1-: Install the codecs from the restricted packages repos, 2-: change the output to esd or esound in xmms options
2005-04-27T06:03:00.000Z	visor	duken	better yet, use rhythmbox :P
2005-04-27T06:06:00.000Z	visor	duken	rhythmbox is the "music player" in the sound menu in ubuntu
2005-04-27T06:06:00.000Z	visor	duken	seems you never used linux before, ill recommend you to read http://ubuntuguide.org there is answers for many questions there ;)
2005-04-27T06:18:00.000Z	duken	visor	thanks, xmms can sound now
2005-04-27T06:19:00.000Z	visor	duken	youre welcome to the nice ubuntu community :)
2005-04-27T06:20:00.000Z	visor	duken	welcome to the jungle then... xD
