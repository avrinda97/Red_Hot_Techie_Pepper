2007-07-04T07:54:00.000Z	gaten	lexus_nexis	dont post that here. use pastebin
2007-07-04T07:54:00.000Z	gaten	lexus_nexis	ok, looks like the device has an error. is it a usb stick?
2007-07-04T07:56:00.000Z	gaten	lexus_nexis	so its a card reader you're trying?

2007-07-04T08:07:00.000Z	gaten	lexus_nexis	you need to download a live CD, like the ubuntu install disk or something like system rescue. then you need to run 'fsck.ext3 /dev/hda1', where hda1 is the partition your feisty install is on
