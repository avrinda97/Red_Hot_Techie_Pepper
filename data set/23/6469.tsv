2008-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	amorphous_	erUSUL	it's a machine that wont userswitch to an account because it says 'multiole logins found' & wants the user to choose between console1 or 9 whenever the user switcher is used to switch to that user. machine has been rebooted and still same problem...

2008-10-03T19:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	amorphous_	why not just use opendns ?
