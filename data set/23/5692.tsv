2006-10-05T12:42:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	if thats what you mean then yes i think it does
2006-10-05T12:42:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	yes, using hte frame buffer
2006-10-05T12:43:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	for example, you can watch a movie full screen without x on the fb
2006-10-05T12:43:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	using mplayer

2006-10-05T12:45:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	not that i am aware of
2006-10-05T12:45:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	it may be though..
2006-10-05T12:45:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	i have never seen it
2006-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	there is a small x implementation for embedded devices you could use at a push i suppose
2006-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	variant	ok, thanks anyway. apt-cache show w3m-img gave me a hint that w3m-img supports inline images in X terminal and 'Linux frame buffer'' ? I wonder what does 'frame buffer' mean ?
2006-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	its direct access to the graphics cards frame buffer.. if your card is supported (probably is) then that should work'
2006-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	thats a good start :)'
2006-10-05T12:48:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	test it with mplayer -vo fb file.avi
2006-10-05T12:48:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	variant	thank you, I'll try that. I'l come back with w3m later.
2006-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	gl
2006-10-05T13:05:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	variant	thank you, this is perfect :) I've got w3m working
2006-10-05T13:05:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	excellent
2006-10-18T15:38:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	this link might help you: http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2004-October/060534.html
2006-10-18T15:38:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	variant	Thanks.
2006-10-18T15:38:00.000Z	variant	vanhtu1987	the problem is that he has an unssuported hardware which the 2.6.18 kernel has an experimental patch for
2006-10-18T06:13:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	variant	The version of links2 in the Ubuntu tree doesn't support TSL by default, AFAIK.
