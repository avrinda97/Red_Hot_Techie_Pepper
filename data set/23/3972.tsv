2008-01-02T02:27:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt		Does anyone knows if the 7.10 ubuntu-version includes the new kernel 2.6.36???
2008-01-02T02:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Feisty is still running the older kernel.
2008-01-02T02:30:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	The card doesn't work at all?
2008-01-02T02:31:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	no...no way...and I don't know what to do...:-(
2008-01-02T02:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	What card is it again?
2008-01-02T02:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Ok, bear with me, I'm going to see if I can't help you out
2008-01-02T02:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	On feisty?
2008-01-02T02:33:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	Really...yes...one moment..please...
2008-01-02T02:34:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	I've got an Dell...with an "WifiCatcher"...maybe this is the problem...?
2008-01-02T02:34:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Have you looked at this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=493095&highlight=Feisty+Intel+AGN+Wifi+4965
2008-01-02T02:34:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	yes i tried this guide...but it doesn't work...
2008-01-02T02:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	If WifiCatcher is software, it won't affect ubuntu, obviously...if it's hardware, the problem should be addressed.
2008-01-02T02:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Ok, what problem are you having after following the guide?
2008-01-02T02:36:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Ok, let me read a litttle.
2008-01-02T02:36:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	thank you very much!

2008-01-02T02:38:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	yeah...this is the site...I used these files too...the same error during the execution on the file...
2008-01-02T02:38:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	I can go to ubuntu and give you the error-message, ok?
2008-01-02T02:39:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Blu3pr1nt	Ok.
2008-01-02T02:44:00.000Z	Blu3pr1nt	PurpZeY	> I just found out, that there is no package for debian...maybe thats the prob?
