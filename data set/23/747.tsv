2011-05-10T09:11:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		hello again I STILL have the same problem with executing files. NOTHING works!!! whether they are downloaded from the internet or on backup drives. this is totally unacceptable. I did a fresh install even and STILL no beans
2011-05-10T09:12:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		yes
2011-05-10T09:13:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		I NEED to execute this file I have a business building aircraft
2011-05-10T09:13:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		err virtual aircraft
2011-05-10T09:14:00.000Z	bin_bash	Sir_Gabriel	have you tried chmod +x
2011-05-10T09:14:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		bash: ./X-PlaneDVDInstallerLinux: No such file or directory
2011-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		yeah I have done CHmods, downloaded file sharing stuff...
2011-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	bin_bash	Sir_Gabriel	does it show up in ls?
2011-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		yes and in the nautilus program
2011-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	bin_bash		have you tried double-clicking it?
2011-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		I click it and nothing happens.
2011-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		yes 64 bit
2011-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel	ubuntu	10.04 .2 LTS amd64
2011-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		yes
2011-05-10T09:17:00.000Z	bin_bash	Sir_Gabriel	if the binary is 32 bit it might not work
2011-05-10T09:17:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		but I need 64 bit in order to access more than one core on the proc
2011-05-10T09:17:00.000Z	bin_bash		mk but if the program doesn't work on a 64 bit machine then it doesn't matter how many cores you have
2011-05-10T09:17:00.000Z	bin_bash		Some 32 bit programs are just fine on 32 bit machines, and some aren't
2011-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		the program is SUPPOSED to work on 64 bit
2011-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	bin_bash	Sir_Gabriel	is it a file or a directory
2011-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		others have it working.
2011-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	Sir_Gabriel		it is a file
2011-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	bin_bash	Sir_Gabriel	when you right-click it what are your options
