2010-07-06T07:21:00.000Z	toter	sean-laptop	About chromium os... I discovered that their servers are having problems. It is not my fault that I can't execute the command "gclient sync" to get chromium os' source code. Apparently other people tried to sync and are having the same problem
2010-07-06T07:21:00.000Z	toter	sean-laptop	I want to compile to get the bleeding edge latest... When were your chromium os' debs created?
