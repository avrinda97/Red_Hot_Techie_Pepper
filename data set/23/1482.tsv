2010-03-13T01:51:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	i'm trying to do a complete strip down of ubuntu.
2010-03-13T01:52:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	thats cool, but that will require some work
2010-03-13T01:52:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	like a minimal system.
2010-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	stripping beyond removing unused packages will quickly break a system, consider a distribution more suited for what you want?
2010-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	ok...let me rephrase the "ubuntu" question again.
2010-03-13T01:54:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	how can i boot an .iso image using the grub menu?
2010-03-13T01:54:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	you can not boot an iso file directly from grub
2010-03-13T01:55:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	what kind of medium can i boot from the grub menu?
2010-03-13T01:55:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	well thats not entirely true, its possible to boot an iso fs i suppose but is never used and quite impractical
2010-03-13T01:55:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	to boot you need a kernel and a root file system the kernel has filesystem drivers for
2010-03-13T01:56:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	may i recommend you have a look at www.linuxfromscratch.org
2010-03-13T01:56:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	can i boot a cd-rom from grub?
2010-03-13T01:56:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	hmm, probably not
2010-03-13T01:56:00.000Z	acicula	Sj4m35-15	why would you want to, you can just boot the cd straight from the bios
2010-03-13T01:57:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	that's the problem i can't boot from bios.
2010-03-13T01:58:00.000Z	Sj4m35-15	acicula	it's an cf-28 toughbook.
