2011-10-21T02:35:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	which would you suggest? :-)
2011-10-21T02:33:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	printer or printers app which one?
2011-10-21T02:34:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	I just opened dash and typed print. "Printing" is what it is named.
2011-10-21T02:35:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	the about says "system-config-printer 1.3.6"
2011-10-21T02:35:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	that one dosen't work very well
2011-10-21T02:36:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	the other one is in /usr/share/applications
2011-10-21T02:38:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	err, I'm not seeing one in there :-/
2011-10-21T02:38:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	you should see two
2011-10-21T02:39:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	that directory just has a whole bunch of .desktop text files in it
2011-10-21T02:40:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	correct but you can double click them
2011-10-21T02:41:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	oh. I'm looking at them in terminal. Still, the only ones with print in the name are system-config-printer.desktop and gnome-printers-panel.desktop. Am I missing a package or two?
2011-10-21T02:43:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	one of them is the one you saw in dash and the other one dash dosen't pull and is the one I always use
2011-10-21T02:46:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	I'm finding lots of other people with the same issues on google. I'll keep looking for a solution. None of the other deb packages look like they'd help.
2011-10-21T02:47:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	did you try both of those?
2011-10-21T02:50:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	both "Printers" and "Printing" end up at the same place.
2011-10-21T02:51:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	they are quite different here
2011-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	can you look at the file name that is being executed and then do "dpkg -L `which filename'" to tell me what package it is from?
2011-10-21T02:53:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	whoops that should be "-S" not -L
2011-10-21T02:59:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	the gnome one takes you to system settings and the other one takes you directly to the printer gui but it would appear now as you say they now both point to the same place
2011-10-21T03:01:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	googling didn't come up with an answer. Something must have gotten fouled with cups. I also have the issue that unity bit the dust (no launcher or top bar) and I'm in unity-2d.
2011-10-21T03:02:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	I installed gnome shell and ran with that for a couple days. Printing didn't work there either and to make matters worse my bluetooth mouse wouldn't either (at least it works in unity-2d).
2011-10-21T03:03:00.000Z	robin0800	kdog	I like gnome classic with compiz and configurable panels
2011-10-21T03:05:00.000Z	kdog	robin0800	yup, I'm living on the bleeding edge. Maybe I should just run with crunchbang :-)
