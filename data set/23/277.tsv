2012-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	noyb		Hello.  I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.  When I tried to mount a cd-rom using gmount I got the little gmount-iso window.  It asks for the "image file (.iso).  No matter what I try it seems impossible to mount.  I've also tried using the command line.  I've looked online for a gmount tutorial.  The only ones I've found assume that you know how to figure out what the .iso file is on the cd-rom you are trying to mount.  I am thoroughly confused.  Any idea
2012-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	noyb		s, anybody.  Thanks in advance from a lost noob.
2012-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	i'm confused, are you trying to mount a cd or an iso
2012-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	you don't need a cd for a router
2012-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	you can reset the router with the button on the back of it
2012-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	also, the software on the cd is unnecessary and probably windows only
2012-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	the software on the cd will most likely not work in ubuntu
2012-02-01T10:05:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	just hold down the reset button on the back of the router for about 30 seconds
2012-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	pastebin "ls -l /dev/s*"
2012-02-03T11:50:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	what did the errors say
2012-02-03T11:51:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	yes
2012-02-03T11:53:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	pastebin....
2012-02-03T11:57:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	for instance, don't do something like "hi everyone <enter> how do I format a drive?" use a comma instead of the enter
2012-02-03T11:58:00.000Z	noyb	Ben64	in other word, "brevity is the soul of something?"
2012-02-03T12:06:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	i'm still waiting for that pastebin
2012-02-03T12:10:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	O_o use a plug or something
2012-02-03T12:14:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	do you want your cd drive to work?
2012-02-03T12:16:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	I asked you 34 minutes ago for a pastebin and you still haven't provided that. It really isn't that complicated to mount a cd drive, but if you never respond, it will never happen
2012-02-03T12:46:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	when you use pastebin, it brings you to a page where your paste is, you need to paste that page link into here for someone to see it
2012-02-03T12:51:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	I just described it, "noyb: when you use pastebin, it brings you to a page where your paste is, you need to paste that page link into here for someone to see it"
2012-02-03T12:54:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	yep, and in just 73 minutes
2012-02-03T12:55:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	now pastebin "mount"
2012-02-03T12:59:00.000Z	Ben64	noyb	.... its a command, you have to hit enter and pastebin the result
