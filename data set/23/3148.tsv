2008-07-26T14:20:00.000Z	hateball		I installed OOo3 beta through using dpkg -i etc. How do I go about removing it the same way? dpkg -P *.deb refuses, as does xargs'ing searches to dpkg as well.
2008-07-26T14:21:00.000Z	unop	hateball	 apt-get remove ...
2008-07-26T14:24:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Problem is I cant pass the filenames to apt, as it doesnt list it that way
2008-07-26T14:24:00.000Z	unop	hateball	don't use filenames - use the packagenames
2008-07-26T14:25:00.000Z	hateball	unop	I was hoping to not have to do that... as it'd be quicker and mean less guessing
2008-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	unop	hateball	it's quite simple if you can use grep and cut ..  apt-get remove $(apt-show-versions -r ^openoffice.org | grep -i "$VERSION_STRING" | cut -d "/" -f 1)
2008-07-26T14:36:00.000Z	hateball	unop	In this case it was quite easy, just apt-get remove ooobasis3-* and it pulled the depenencies etc. I still think it'd be nice if you could pass it through the original packages somehow... If I installed 500 packages and then wanted to remove them I'd be quite annoyed
2008-07-26T14:38:00.000Z	unop	hateball	well, you can always extract the actual package names from *.deb in a directory and then pipe that to apt-get. i believe dpkg-scanpackages does this
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	hateball	unop	I dont seem to have dpkg-scanpackages, nor is it available in any repository... Cant seem to find a command that shows the package name like gdebi does, any other tips?
2008-07-26T14:53:00.000Z	unop	hateball	 it's in the dpkg-dev package which should be installed by default
2008-07-26T14:53:00.000Z	unop	hateball	 /usr/bin/dpkg-scanpackages
2008-07-26T14:55:00.000Z	hateball	unop	koshari : Wasnt installed by default on my 8.04 x64 at least.. But I'll give it a whirl now, cheers
2008-07-26T14:59:00.000Z	unop	hateball	heh, look what i overlooked.   for i in /path/to/*.deb; do dpkg-deb -W $i; done
2008-07-26T15:02:00.000Z	unop	hateball	  perhaps this.  for i in *.deb; do dpkg-deb -f $i Package; done | xargs sudo apt-get remove
2008-07-26T15:03:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Yeah that would do it. Nice.... *notes down for later (ab)use* Thanks :)
2008-07-26T15:04:00.000Z	unop	hateball	i hate the way all these dpkg/apt tools are organised - there's too many of them all doing different things, hard to keep track of what does what
2008-07-26T15:05:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Well for a newbie like me it is at least... The logical way would be just to dpkg -i *.deb to install, and dpkg -r *.deb to remove. Not having it remove everything, from that directory
2008-08-15T11:33:00.000Z	unop	hateball	killall has a -u option that takes a username as an argument
2008-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Whats wrong with that? It works
2008-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	unop	hateball	your way is a hack.
2008-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Still, works :p
2008-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	unop	hateball	the tools remember the priorities of services when they are enabled/disabled
2008-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	hateball	unop	Fair enough
