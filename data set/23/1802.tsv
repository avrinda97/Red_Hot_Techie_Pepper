2012-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	almoxarife		like the pic
2012-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	ic. I just installed pavucontrol. see if that helps. it's pulse audio control
2012-01-16T15:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	the link i sent you shows 'profile' at bottom, that is where you would make changes to get the right hdmi setting
2012-01-16T15:33:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	can I just play audio and click through the options or do i have to restart pulseaudio everytime?
2012-01-16T15:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	using what to configure?
2012-01-16T15:34:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	pavucontrol gives me lots of profiles but both HDMI ones don't seem to output sound
2012-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	select the profile, then start the prog that would output sound
2012-01-16T15:36:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	I'm assuming the prog that would output sound should have pulseaudio selected as output module?
2012-01-16T15:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	your app should be set to 'default' sound, what ever that is, like vlc out of the box, i dont mess with the settings, it works because it uses default , you are trying to set default sound
2012-01-16T15:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	and if not i assume you are perhaps the sound junky that i am not, i wanted my htc to work, and it does on default settings
2012-01-16T15:41:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	I'm quite happy with default if it works but it doesn't
2012-01-16T15:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	you setting up a media center pc?
2012-01-16T15:42:00.000Z	almoxarife		!es
2012-01-16T15:42:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	the dB meter in the "Output devices" tab of the volume control moves around happily
2012-01-16T15:42:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	yes. I installed the mythbuntu package
2012-01-16T15:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	the only thing i run on the htc is xbmc, it also has a config for sound, try that
2012-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	xmbc can't handle tuners
2012-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	slacker-		or can it now?
2012-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	slacker-	ask at #xbmc
2012-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	slacker-	almoxarife	could it be because the Codec mentioned in /proc/asound/card0/codec#3 (Intel CougarPoint HDMI) isn't mentioned in /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/* ?
