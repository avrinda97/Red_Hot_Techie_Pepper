2006-01-14T17:35:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		except a google search once I figured out what happened.
2006-01-14T17:36:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		Actually I didn't run it all the way.  I started it to see if it would freeze like it did as a regular user.  It asked me to go through the first run wizzard.  I killed it instead.
2006-01-14T17:36:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		well canceled
2006-01-14T17:38:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		Trojan
2006-01-14T17:38:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		that would make me mad
2006-01-14T17:38:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		bad java install?
2006-01-14T17:38:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		or was that not directed at me?
2006-01-14T17:39:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		wierd that none of the hidden directories are gone.
2006-01-14T17:39:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		ok sry
2006-01-14T17:40:00.000Z	OldSpiceAP		lol
2006-01-14T17:41:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	do you know that root has a different home directory than your user?
2006-01-14T17:44:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	did you log in as root instead of as your user?
2006-01-14T17:45:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	ok.
2006-01-14T17:45:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	do you have 10 gigs more disk space than you used to have?
2006-01-14T17:46:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	"df -h" shows you have more free space now?
2006-01-14T17:46:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	that is crazy.
2006-01-14T17:46:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	I've never heard of that happening
2006-01-14T17:46:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	you said that the hidden folders didn't get deleted.  are you sure that they didn't just get recreated when you logged on?
2006-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	run a "ls -alt" and see what the oldest thing in your home directory is.  it will be the last thing listed
2006-01-14T17:49:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	if you don't know how to switch back to X, and you don't know how to run a browser or IRC client in a VC then you have to reboot...
2006-01-14T17:50:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	it sounds like someone put a "rm -r *" somewhere in one of your files.  that would leave 'hidden' files and folders
2006-01-14T06:08:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	no files
2006-01-14T06:09:00.000Z	dooglus	OldSpiceAP	I imagine the "rm -r" would have deleted the file containing the "rm -r"
