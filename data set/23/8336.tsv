2004-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	yyc747		lol
2004-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	yyc747		yeah, I'm trying to install ubuntu... it's working well so far
2004-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	yyc747		how is the community (read as "will you be stoned for suggesting ubuntu's not the best?")
2004-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	yyc747		having before worked with gentoo and debian, I'm am worried about joining a third overzealous community
2004-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	yes, yes you will be stoned for saying Ubuntu's not the best... only because its just hard to find better  :/
2004-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	well, if that's the case, I will be happy.  I like gentoo/portage... I think there should be a project that will allow portage to create deb packages, since portage is an awesome tool for compile-time configuration
2004-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	apt-get -b source pkg isn't far off imo... it works  :/
2004-10-19T10:58:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	can one specify the equivilant of use flags?
2004-10-19T10:58:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	There is a Gentoo developer working for Ubuntu... so he knows how to optimize...
2004-10-19T10:58:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	debian/rules
2004-10-19T11:00:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	axe9: I have the Linux Pocket Guide... it is quicker than google, and covers the basics of a wide range of linux commands
2004-10-19T11:01:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	man -k something_you_want_to_do
2004-10-19T11:02:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	I have never heard of the -k option, and doing "man man" would make the universe implode
2004-10-19T11:02:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	umm, no it wouldn't...
2004-10-19T11:03:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	man -k = man search for keywords
2004-10-19T11:05:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	you substitute "warty" for "hoary" and "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade"
2004-10-19T11:07:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	I thought apt-get update only got the new package list.  what command actually installs the updates, and what file would I change hoary to warty in?
2004-10-19T11:10:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	grr... apt-get update gets a new list, apt-get install installs individual packages, apt-get dist-upgrade upgrades everything, even through major changes...
2004-10-19T13:40:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	no, it will not cost money to distribute amoungst the network... only for support...
2004-10-19T13:47:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	lindows = corporate kde debian
2004-10-19T13:53:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	nano isn't so bad... with screen, its not bad at all...
2004-10-19T13:54:00.000Z	yyc747	|trey|	but it has no features compared to vim or emacs
2004-10-19T13:54:00.000Z	|trey|	yyc747	I'm kinda an emacs virgin... vim is my freind though  :)
