2008-03-15T02:56:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		I'm running Heron alpha-6 on LiveCD and it is as fast as my 7.10 on harddisk
2008-03-15T02:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	nice
2008-03-15T03:02:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	blkid in the terminal
2008-03-15T03:02:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	thnx
2008-03-15T03:04:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	blkid /dev/sda1
2008-03-15T03:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	 just blkid
2008-03-15T03:05:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	either
2008-03-15T03:05:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	doesn't work
2008-03-15T03:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	 linux is case sensitive,  blkid
2008-03-15T03:06:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	I know... blkid does exist but it won't print anything
2008-03-15T03:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	 there is something very wrong then,  that would me you hve no partitons on your computer what so ever
2008-03-15T03:07:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	oh... I understand... I'm using LiveCD... I want to resize a partition in order to install Heron without deleting Feisty... so I have to update my Feisty /etc/fstab file
2008-03-15T03:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	that sould not keep blkid from displaying partitons as far as I know
2008-03-15T03:09:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	why is the fstab using UUID in stead of using just /dev/sda1
2008-03-15T03:10:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	it can use either or both,  uuid will keep partitions identified properly even if you add or remove hdds from your comp
2008-03-15T03:10:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	ok
2008-03-15T03:10:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	so if I change fstab to use /dev/sda1 instead of UUID it will work properly right?
2008-03-15T03:11:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	sudo blkid apparently
2008-03-15T03:11:00.000Z	Pelo	Dex-Freudii	it will
2008-03-15T03:11:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	thank you very much
2008-03-15T03:11:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	sudo blkid works
2008-11-07T22:11:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	that I did, but still it takes more than a minute to boot up
2008-11-07T22:13:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Pelo	which file?
