2012-08-11T04:21:00.000Z	mininessie		what would be the reason why running spotify updating my computer and running minecraft cause minecraft to run slow what part is that affectign computer the processor or what
2012-08-11T04:23:00.000Z	mininessie		i asked a qustion
2012-08-11T04:23:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	Are your CPUs at 100% when doing that?
2012-08-11T04:31:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	Is your CPU running at 100%? I didn't get an answer when I asked you.
2012-08-11T04:31:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	Also, how's your RAM when running those?
2012-08-11T04:32:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	It's not that uncommon when you have that much open. Minecraft is a big resource hog.
2012-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	of total memory 68%
2012-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	How's the CPU?
2012-08-11T04:35:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	idk how to check that
2012-08-11T04:35:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	What DE are you using?
2012-08-11T04:36:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	KDE
2012-08-11T04:36:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	There should be a system monitor program in either system or utilities in the menu.
2012-08-11T04:37:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	I haven't used KDE in a while, so I don't remember the exact location.
2012-08-11T04:39:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	its jumping all over the place but is never under 30 and its about 80 percent
2012-08-11T04:39:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	I'd say that with all three running it's too much for your system.
2012-08-11T04:39:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	Graphics may have something to do with this too. Minecraft is a heavy game because it renders all the blocks.
2012-08-11T04:39:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	so what would i need to make sure it can handle all of this stuff
2012-08-11T04:39:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	i have an nvidia 560 ti
2012-08-11T04:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	I don't really think there's anything you can do.
2012-08-11T04:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	You said you're updating while spotify and MC right?
2012-08-11T04:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	The update may be doing it. I'd wait until it's done.
2012-08-11T04:40:00.000Z	mininessie	KatsumeBlisk	i am actually on arch lol
2012-08-11T04:41:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	mininessie	Just chose a popular channel, eh? :P So what's your computer running/doing again?
