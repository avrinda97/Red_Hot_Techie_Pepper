2006-01-01T15:05:00.000Z	john_		so normally i go into configuration and disable it then activate it and 9 times out of 10 it works again
2006-01-01T15:05:00.000Z	john_		...i was getting this same issue with wired ethernet
2006-01-01T15:05:00.000Z	john_		anyway this time i start up i cant get to the configuration dialog
2006-01-01T15:05:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	lo is 127.0.0.1 loopback
2006-01-01T15:07:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	when you type lsconfig, what is the ip address you have for lo?
2006-01-01T15:08:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	open terminal window
2006-01-01T15:09:00.000Z	john_	mcjerry	i done that
2006-01-01T15:10:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	and what did it output?
2006-01-01T15:11:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	try ifconfig then
2006-01-01T15:12:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	did ifconfig output any other connections than lo?
2006-01-01T15:12:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	and what are the ips for eth0 and  ath0
2006-01-01T15:14:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	are you behind a router? are you sure static ip is correct wth correct gateway ip and dns server ips
2006-01-01T15:16:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	you got something wrong in your routing tables
2006-01-01T15:17:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	if you deactivate eth0 can you still access the internet with lo?
2006-01-01T15:18:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	you only have one ip address assigned to eth0 correct.....try opening network with sudo or root
2006-01-01T15:21:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	sudo network-admin
2006-01-01T15:23:00.000Z	mcjerry	john_	Dapper here
2006-01-01T15:25:00.000Z	john_	mcjerry	think I will just count my lucky stars that its working
