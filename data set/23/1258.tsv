2010-06-27T21:27:00.000Z	clayg		same with the bootloader/ plymouth or whatever - I "dislike" that change also
2010-06-27T21:28:00.000Z	clayg		not bootloader but graphics at the login screen, me not good with words
2010-06-27T21:30:00.000Z	clayg		now i read up on it and the only guide i find is somehting to change thebackground walllpaper in the beginning?
2010-06-27T21:30:00.000Z	clayg		what happens if you use an older ubuntu version and dont upgrade the kernel ever
2010-06-27T21:30:00.000Z	clayg		you can still use all applications for it as they update right?
2010-06-27T21:31:00.000Z	clayg		yeah need to find a distro i liked a little better or at least was able to use easier
2010-06-27T21:31:00.000Z	clayg		i guess version is what i meant not dist
2010-06-27T21:33:00.000Z	clayg		what would i lose by using say Hardy?
2010-06-27T21:34:00.000Z	clayg		instead of lucid
2010-06-27T21:36:00.000Z	clayg		so there is no grub2 gui to remove or edit what is presented at bootup?
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	No but you can remove the old kernels through synaptic and run update-grub
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	clayg	soadkombucha	looking through synaptic in the kernel section i dont see anything i can remove
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	try this: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove
2010-06-27T21:38:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	And then run this to make sure they're gone: dpkg -l | grep linux-image-2
2010-06-27T21:38:00.000Z	clayg	soadkombucha	giving it a shot now
2010-06-27T21:38:00.000Z	clayg	soadkombucha	first command gave "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
2010-06-27T21:39:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	Not a GUI program I know of
2010-06-27T21:39:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	Hmm.
2010-06-27T21:40:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	You could manually remove them from grub.cfg
2010-06-27T21:40:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	If they're bothering you THAT much, but be careful not to mess anything up
2010-06-27T21:41:00.000Z	clayg	soadkombucha	will check out grub.cfg is it located in the same directory
2010-06-27T21:45:00.000Z	soadkombucha	clayg	Search in synaptic for linux-generic
2010-06-27T21:47:00.000Z	clayg	soadkombucha	ok i found a few, i can just remove all but the latest and have no problems?
