2005-03-14T13:10:00.000Z	Quarupt		thx
2005-03-14T13:12:00.000Z	Quarupt		Man , i have a cute girl i know who really wants to show me something on webcam but gaim has no webcam support and she cant find netmeeting
2005-03-14T13:12:00.000Z	Quarupt		AHHH
2005-03-14T13:13:00.000Z	Quarupt		she is like 40 miles away
2005-03-14T13:14:00.000Z	Quarupt		hrm, maybe theres a different messenger with webcam support one thats not as hard to build as gaim-vv
2005-03-14T13:14:00.000Z	Quarupt		ya but i have class and work tomorrow
2005-03-14T13:14:00.000Z	Quarupt		there must be a way
2005-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	Quarupt		im gunna wine/msn messenger if i have too
2005-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	Quarupt		and of course wine wont download
2005-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	Quarupt		man im having a bad day
2005-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	dopez	Quarupt	search for mercury, its a java msn/yahoo client that can do video too, or let her run conf.exe and setup netmeeting
2005-03-14T13:16:00.000Z	Quarupt		mercury huh
2005-03-14T13:16:00.000Z	Quarupt		ok
2005-03-14T13:16:00.000Z	dopez		lol
2005-03-14T13:17:00.000Z	Quarupt	dopez	everywhere i find says its a win32 app not a java client
2005-03-14T13:17:00.000Z	dopez	Quarupt	mercury.to , i havent tried it myself but they say video works on linux and windows
2005-03-14T13:18:00.000Z	dopez	Quarupt	its probably easier to let her setup netmeeting and you install gnomemeeting, thats how i do it :)
2005-03-14T13:19:00.000Z	Quarupt	dopez	she doesnt wanna DL or install anything
2005-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	Quarupt	dopez	and the link for the linux version of mercury is broken
2005-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	Quarupt		damn it
2005-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	Quarupt		only the bittorrent link works and im getting like 2k on it
2005-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	Quarupt		I know what she looks like
2005-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	dopez	Quarupt	if she runs xp she only has to run conf.exe and click a few times next, netmeeting is already included just hidden
