2009-03-18T08:00:00.000Z	Kraft_		yeah
2009-03-18T08:00:00.000Z	Kraft_		i was wondering how to do that
2009-03-18T08:01:00.000Z	Kraft_		I see. cool!  what are some of the ...how do you say... terminal commands to use
2009-03-18T08:02:00.000Z	Kraft_		im trying to install zsnes, an emulator so i can play super nintendo games
2009-03-18T08:04:00.000Z	Kraft_		its just zsnes_1_51, (that's a folder.) than i open it up, and theres 2 folders "Docs" and "Src"
2009-03-18T08:04:00.000Z	Kraft_		i ran "configure" in terminal
2009-03-18T08:04:00.000Z	Kraft_		i dont know if that did anything or not
2009-03-18T08:05:00.000Z	Kraft_		Zsnes
2009-03-18T08:05:00.000Z	Kraft_		whoa this is confusing
2009-03-18T08:05:00.000Z	Kraft_		user@user-desktop:-$
2009-03-18T08:06:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	Look under zsnes/src
2009-03-18T08:06:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	That's not what you think it is.
2009-03-18T08:07:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	In all cases, the one named "configure" is the one you want
2009-03-18T08:08:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	Invoke it as "./configure --help" (without quotes)
2009-03-18T08:08:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	Yes, Linux (and other Unix-like systems) are case-sensitive.
2009-03-18T08:09:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	A file named STARTREK is not named the same as one named startrek, or StarTrek, or even StArTrEk
2009-03-18T08:09:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	Because you specified an absolute path
2009-03-18T08:09:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	/ is the start ofyour file system...
2009-03-18T08:11:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	You may want to run "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2009-03-18T08:11:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	This will install the GNU toolchain (the GNU compiler and binutils), and some basic system libs
2009-03-18T08:51:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	...
2009-03-18T08:51:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	That could be caused by nearly anything.
2009-03-18T08:52:00.000Z	segin	Kraft_	Misconfigured SDL libraries, gstreamer/esd/aRts failing to release the audio device for use by other programs, etc.
