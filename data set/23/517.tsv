2011-12-08T05:14:00.000Z	godofmischief	ETERNA	even tried the linux driver provided from geforce, but this caused a nvidia kernal conflict that jacked things up ended up resintalling.
2011-12-08T05:14:00.000Z	godofmischief	ETERNA	followed the directions provided by geforce to install the driver that is a far newer version then ubuntu suggests, had a nvidia kernel error i coldn't recover from
2011-12-08T05:15:00.000Z	ETERNA		Godofmischief: You do know...
2011-12-08T05:15:00.000Z	ETERNA		Godofmischief: that you can run the installer with the --reinstall option in a TTY to fix the issue?
