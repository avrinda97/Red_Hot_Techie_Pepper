2006-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	justintime32		hey, does anyone know how to remove the bcm43xx driver from dapper?
2006-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	blacklist it
2006-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	It's part of linux-image ... Dapper right?
2006-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	What kinds of problems?
2006-03-19T14:57:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	You could add "ndiswrapper" to /etc/modules and do "lsmod|grep bcm" to make sure the bcm43xx driver isn't still being loaded.
2006-03-19T14:58:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Do an "ifconfig wlan0" -- do you get anything?
2006-03-19T14:58:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	It's possibly not being listed elsewhere because it's not configured.
2006-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Sounds like you either have the wrong windows driver, or bcm43xx is still being loaded
2006-03-19T15:00:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Not sure that would cut it... you might want to stick "ndiswrapper" in /etc/modules, reboot, and lsmod to make sure bcm43xx is gone.
2006-03-19T15:00:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	If dmesg lists it as "wlan0", then there's no question, it's not eth0, eth0 must be an ethernet card.
2006-03-19T15:02:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Reboot and pastebin your dmesg
2006-03-19T15:03:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Just use modprobe.d/blacklist instead ("blacklist bcm43xx")
2006-03-19T15:13:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	What does iwconfig say about your interfaces?
2006-03-19T15:13:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	And can you pastebin your dmesg?
2006-03-19T15:14:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	pastebin time :)
2006-03-19T15:14:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Nonono
2006-03-19T15:14:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	After you've submitted to ubotu's link, post the link to it in this channel.
2006-03-19T15:15:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org, submit your entire dmesg, and send us the link it provides you with.
2006-03-19T15:20:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	eth0 is your RealTek card, wlan0 is your wireless... do you get normal output with "iwconfig wlan0" ?
2006-03-19T15:21:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Sure, and also ifconfig -a would help
2006-03-19T15:25:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	That is some weird, wild funky stuff... you've got dmesg spouting out wlan0 but finally settling on eth0 after assigning eth0 away to your realtek card!!! (only I didn't believe you at first :)
2006-03-19T15:26:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	If you get a chance, try sending your 2 pastebin links http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10237 and http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10238 to #ubuntu+1 -- they may have more experience with it, since dapper made the executive decision to stick the bcm43xx into dapper.
2006-03-19T15:28:00.000Z	silvaran	justintime32	Is it still working okay, even with the erroneous device assignments?
