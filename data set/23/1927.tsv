2010-04-28T21:45:00.000Z	dunas		Any idea why I can't add this computer to the Ubuntu One account?
2010-04-28T21:46:00.000Z	bens	dunas	cause u1 is all borked right now :)
2010-04-28T21:46:00.000Z	bens	dunas	create a new user account, log in with it, and connect u1.  Should bring you to ubuntuone SSO to sign in.
2010-04-28T21:46:00.000Z	bens	dunas	I had the same problem with last nights build.
2010-04-28T21:47:00.000Z	dunas	bens	I see, so making a new account should fix it?
2010-04-28T21:51:00.000Z	bens	dunas	I deleted my account only because i couldn't figure out where u1 was storing configs.
2010-04-28T21:51:00.000Z	bens	dunas	i recreated a new account and tried to connect again and it worked.  the first time I tried and it failed, i think it was because SSO failed on the first try, and you don't get another chance.
2010-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	dunas	bens	aha. I had to recover my password, that might've broken its sequence somehow.
2010-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	bens	dunas	yup, its a bug, but i don't think anyone has reported it yet.
2010-04-28T21:53:00.000Z	dunas	bens	seems more like a bug in U1 than a bug in 10.04, though. Hopefully they'll get it hammered out by tonight- might be they're already aware.
2010-04-28T21:54:00.000Z	bens	dunas	I already talked to them about it last night.  They hadn't heard about it.
2010-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	bens	dunas	let me know if recreating your account works.
2010-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	dunas	bens	will do, was waiting to launch firefox until the restricted packages installed
2010-04-28T22:04:00.000Z	dunas	bens	how did you delete the account?
2010-04-28T22:18:00.000Z	bens	dunas	no problem.
2010-04-28T22:07:00.000Z	bens	dunas	lots of ways to do it.
2010-04-28T22:07:00.000Z	bens	dunas	easiest is to just create a new account through system-administration-usersandgroups
2010-04-28T22:08:00.000Z	dunas	bens	Oh, I thought you meant create a new U1 account
2010-04-28T22:08:00.000Z	bens	dunas	actually, try this.
2010-04-28T22:09:00.000Z	bens	dunas	close u1-preferences, then open a terminal and killall -9 ubuntuone-login
2010-04-28T22:09:00.000Z	bens	dunas	then start u1-preferences again andsee if it prompts you to login to SSO again.
2010-04-28T22:11:00.000Z	dunas	bens	massive success
2010-04-28T22:12:00.000Z	dunas	bens	but yes, that worked perfectly. Thanks for your help.
