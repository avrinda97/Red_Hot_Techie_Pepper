2011-06-27T21:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	that isn't a problem :)
2011-06-27T21:54:00.000Z	xmd	IdleOne	I have booted ubuntu successfully from my external hard drive
2011-06-27T21:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	ok so you are using the external HDD as a live USB?
2011-06-27T21:55:00.000Z	xmd	IdleOne	exactly
2011-06-27T21:56:00.000Z	xmd	IdleOne	I am in ubuntu now, it works great, but it says i have no disc space
2011-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	you need to install grub to the MBR of the HD
2011-06-27T23:08:00.000Z	xmd	IdleOne	install grub to the MBR of the HD?
2011-06-27T23:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	yes, you will need to boot from the small usb drive again
2011-06-27T23:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	correct, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
2011-06-27T23:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	run live and follow directions on that link I jujst gave you.
2011-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	xmd	because at install you didn't install it to the correct place
