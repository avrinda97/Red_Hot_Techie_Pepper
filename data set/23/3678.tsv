2008-11-18T19:20:00.000Z	fus10nx		I just setup a RAID1 on my Intel RAID controller, and in the Ubuntu install it saw 2 disks...is that normal? Anyhow, I set it all up and it gave a GRUB boot error
2008-11-18T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	thats fake raid, fakeraid is a terrible technology
2008-11-18T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	fake raid has terrible linux support, hence seeing it as two disks
2008-11-18T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	if your just using linux on those disks I suggest using linux software raid which is excellent
2008-11-18T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	you have to use the alternative cd
2008-11-18T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	or install to one disk in the normal cd and mirror it later
2008-11-18T19:22:00.000Z	fus10nx	ikonia	ok so i'll disconnect 1 drive, install ubuntu then plug back in 2nd drive and mirror it?
2008-11-18T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	you don't need to disconnect a drive
2008-11-18T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	just install it to one disk
2008-11-18T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	I wrote a forum post on how to do it
2008-11-18T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	thats it, make the disks "normal" in your bios
2008-11-18T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	fus10nx	bit of an old post but this should guide you
