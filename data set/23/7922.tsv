2009-02-22T23:06:00.000Z	ivan_		really?
2009-02-22T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 install the grub package and confgure the menu.lst - yes you can. :) I never use lilo in years.
2009-02-22T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 how did you get lilo anyway?
2009-02-22T23:08:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	: i get LILO from ubuntu 8.04
2009-02-22T23:09:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	: i get LILO from ubuntu 8.04, it has 2 boot loader, GRUB and LILO
2009-05-12T21:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 deoends on your needs.. I use transmission mainly
2009-05-12T21:13:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	 well I'm used to ÂµTorrent so I like a fast and lightweight torrent client
2009-05-12T21:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 buzzwords that mean very little. :) you can use wine and utorrent.exe if you wanted to.
2009-05-12T21:14:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	well it's not exactly like that, for example Azureus is neither fast nor lightweight
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 how were the disks created? what program?
2010-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	easy cd dvd creator
2010-01-08T09:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ivan_	 its possible it used some sort of UDF filesystem that windows cant handle. You made it by some sort of 'drag/drop to the dvd' type operation? like it was a big floppy disk? or did you use a more normal burning type method?
2010-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	ivan_	Dr_Willis	i used a normal system... I burned the in Windows, and I use the burn button, I didnt do anything weird as far as i know
