2008-03-20T19:58:00.000Z	neopsyche_	amenado	so .. you can solve the problem now that you see a picture and know what wire it uses?
2008-03-20T19:59:00.000Z	neopsyche_	amenado	it only makes a diffrence to me if someone can actually solve the problem.. otherwise its just a waste of time.
2008-03-20T19:59:00.000Z	neopsyche_	amenado	i only argue when I think something might be a waste of time.
