2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	Vince_		I'm having problums installing UBUNTU.  I've tried installing Breazy, Dapper, and the current version.
2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try to install the newest version, It says that it cannot open the TTY Device which apparently is a known bug.
2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try to install Dapper, it tells me that it cannot mount the CD.  Even though its already loaded and running.
2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try and install Breazy it installs to the point where it asks me to configure my user account and then all it does is ask me over and over agian and will not progress any further.
2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	Vince_		Can somebody help me get one of these versions installed?  I'd like to end up with Dapper if possible.
2007-03-11T11:05:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	are you installing from text mode or live cd?
2007-03-11T11:07:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	Text Mode
2007-03-11T11:07:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	any odd hardware? how much ram? sometimes certain usb devices disagree with the installer (ive had troubles with a webcam)
2007-03-11T11:08:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	Nothing overly unsual.  I had all this working before, but i've had to change motherboards
2007-03-11T11:09:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	do you have any usb devices plugged in?
2007-03-11T11:11:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	A printer (Dell A920), USB Mouse, A Nostromo Keypad, and a thrustmaster joystick
2007-03-11T11:12:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	you might want to try unplugging everything that isnt needed and then plugging them back in once you have a successful install. Otherwise you might want to try fiesty.
2007-03-11T11:14:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	I'm technical enough I can run a version of Linux if everything works right. Im not good enough that I can tinker with releases that arn't final yet ;-)
2007-03-11T11:14:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	fiesty is far along enough that it will be stable. Also has some pretty cool new features.
2007-03-11T11:15:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	Yes but its not well documented yet.  The reason I want to go with Dapper for the moment is because if I want to do anything with it I can find something pretty easy on google to explain it to me
2007-03-11T11:17:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	Yes and it told me /bin/sh cant access tty; Job control turned off and then gave me a prompt I couln't do anything with
2007-03-12T05:05:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	what motherboard are you using
2007-03-12T05:07:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	Checking now,  I belive its an AZURS or MSI board with a NVidia Nforce2 chipset
2007-03-12T05:13:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	are you using the integrated video?
2007-03-12T05:14:00.000Z	Vince_	prevone	IT has onboard but I have an AGP card installed.
2007-03-12T05:18:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	did you try fiesty?
2007-03-12T05:22:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	I understand that you may be uncomfortable with using testing software but the truth is that the major differences between the different versions is simply versions of software
2007-03-12T05:28:00.000Z	prevone	Vince_	i agree
