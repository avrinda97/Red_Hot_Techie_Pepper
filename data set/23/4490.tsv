2007-07-30T05:54:00.000Z	meta4ical_		hello can anyone see this?
2007-07-30T05:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	I can see it...
2007-07-30T06:45:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	Changing the entry back to vesa allowed me to boot back in, but I still really need to be using fglrx
2007-07-30T06:45:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	Is their a log or something I can check to see why it wouldn't work?
2007-07-30T06:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	It's liekly an issue with either refresh or resolution...  cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep WW    -- you can tweak xorg.conf to force refresh and or resolution but you need specs for your monitor "spported resolutions" etc..
2007-07-30T06:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	Also learn about cp and mv commands to backup/restore your xorg... ;)
2007-07-30T06:51:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	Did you by chance get that message I PMed you?
2007-07-30T06:51:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	No I didn't get a message...
2007-07-30T06:52:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	Two's O.K. anymore use pastebin
2007-07-30T06:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	Nope - you're issue is jsut with refresh and resolution I'm guessing --
2007-07-30T06:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	those have nothing to do with fglrx... when you get black screen do you hear the login sound?
2007-07-30T06:55:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	I am so lost, the xorg.conf has like 4-5 lines all with resolutions and whatnot
2007-07-30T06:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	You did not answer prior question...
2007-07-30T06:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	And I told you re: monitor/docs/etc...
2007-07-30T06:56:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	Yes - but do you hear login sound - it's very important...
2007-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	could this be the problem? # DISABLED_MODULES="ath_hal fc fglrx ltm nv"
2007-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	Where is that in?
2007-07-30T07:02:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	 /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2007-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	No -- you did not answer quesiton re: login sound... I'll assume yes you did hear it when you booted to black screen.... In which case it is a resolution/refresh issue with monitor...
2007-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	I said twice in a row No to that question =/
2007-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	I did not see those replies...
2007-07-30T07:04:00.000Z	meta4ical_	ShackJack	I wrote "no ;p" and the first time a sentence containing no
2007-07-30T07:05:00.000Z	ShackJack	meta4ical_	You did not address me in those responses so I missed them...
