2011-08-15T00:46:00.000Z	saladin1980		is there anyway easy to make a windows 7 bootable usb drive in linux?
2011-08-15T00:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	yes
2011-08-15T00:47:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	is there a way to point me right direction i have tried dif ways and nothing seems to make it able to bootable win7 usb:(
2011-08-15T00:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	format the thumb to a NTFS put a boot flag on it and extract to that partition, some suggest unetbootin,  have not got unetbootin to work, others claim they have, this is 2 different methods.
2011-08-15T00:50:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	unet don't work i tried it ONLY supports linux distros:(   so i will try the boot flag and such and see if that works..   (using gpart i assume to do the flagging)
2011-08-15T00:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	if your using a p2p W7 don't you can't be sure your safe, is all I will say beyond this.
2011-08-15T00:52:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	its my student edition:)  its a valid nothing illegal on this one:)
2011-08-15T00:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	just posting the requisite warning, that is what mine is W7 pro, ;)
2011-08-15T00:54:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	, polah i am just tring to make it a install win 7 from the usb
2011-08-15T00:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	the multisystem usb loader and the ntfs as described will work, or at least have every time I have done it.
2011-08-15T00:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	there is a windows usb loader if you can get to a windows set up as admin as well.
2011-08-15T00:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	duh I know that.
2011-08-15T00:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	the ntfs is throwing you of it is not a install but a load for install.
2011-08-15T01:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	this works as well. http://liveusb.info/dotclear/  just translate if needed.
2011-08-15T01:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	if you try the multisystem app I have found it work only if formatted with gparted, probably the disk utility works as well.
2011-08-15T01:06:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	i just did a format with ntfs and then took that and then reparted it so it would recognize as a bootable and then took that with the iso..(after making stupied computer read it)  extracted into it and now just waiting for extraction to finish
2011-08-15T01:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	cool I think that will be it, I have used that methid about 10 times without a failure, make sure the boot flag is ther gparted will show it.
2011-08-15T01:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	interestingly that ISO has all the official releases on it as well.
2011-08-15T01:14:00.000Z	saladin1980	urlin2u	what iso u talking about?
2011-08-15T01:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	the W7 ISO or a DVD has all the release from MS within the bit amount 32 0r 64, you have ultimate to the ones below it is a file inside that controls what you offred per your purchase.
2011-08-15T01:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	good to know if you want to upgrade or due and need to reinstall or work on others computers.
2011-08-15T01:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	saladin1980	cool some don't know this, that you xcan remove the file and choose the install you want, then use the key for that version.
