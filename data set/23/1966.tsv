I don't know what he meant so i thought I would research it. He suggests I boot up with all the drives attached to the system ahead of time llutz_
2012-01-08T12:10:00.000Z	StepNjump		sorry for repeating your nick twice
2012-01-08T12:10:00.000Z	StepNjump		nice to know!!!! great I will document that in my KB
2012-01-08T12:10:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	you can mount an external drive anytime, just don't unplug it without unmounting first
2012-01-08T12:12:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	the shutdown process includes unmounting all drives, so that'd be fine
2012-01-08T12:15:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	try getting to console (CTRL+ALT+F1), try ssh'ing in, REISUB
2012-01-08T12:17:00.000Z	StepNjump	Ben64	ssh ing into the system you mean via ssh????
2012-01-08T12:17:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	yep, sometimes if graphics are frozen I can still get in via ssh and kill the offending process
2012-01-08T12:18:00.000Z	StepNjump	Ben64	you mean via TTY..? SSH is a secure shell.. via remote computer you mean?
2012-01-08T12:19:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	yeah remotely, I use my phone to ssh in
2012-01-08T19:59:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	it means processes in the background
2012-01-08T20:00:00.000Z	StepNjump	Ben64	so it's nothing to worrry about?

2012-01-18T08:04:00.000Z	StepNjump	Ben64	just food for thought, try to bring your laptop close to your router and see if this will fix your slow speed issue
2012-01-18T08:04:00.000Z	Ben64	StepNjump	it used to do 1MB/s till I upgraded ubuntu, its within 20' of the router
2012-01-18T08:05:00.000Z	StepNjump	Ben64	.... I keep being told its not good to upgrade.. it's not up to par.. I dont know if that is your issue but
