2008-07-23T18:09:00.000Z	WillLuongo	muntrue	Well that explains it then. lol what do I do instead?
2008-07-23T18:10:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	Yea i had that same problem, What card do you have and whats the problem ?
2008-07-23T18:11:00.000Z	WillLuongo	muntrue	it is an Averatec 3270, whatever video card comes in that... information is a bit lacking but what i've found is Viachrome
2008-07-23T18:11:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	And what issues do you have with it
2008-07-23T18:12:00.000Z	WillLuongo	muntrue	It doesn't detect the video card, just uses vga, max resolution is 800x600 which unfortunately doesn't seem compatible with even most of the default apps
2008-07-23T18:12:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	allright. do you know how to copy your xorg.conf ?

2008-07-23T18:19:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	Just to be sure, there is no restricted driver available right ?
2008-07-23T18:20:00.000Z	WillLuongo	muntrue	Not that I have been able to find... admittedly I am not very good with synaptic, as most of my experience is apt-get and Adept...
2008-07-23T18:20:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	Check here : System->Administrator->Restricted drivers manager
2008-07-23T18:20:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	I also possible found a forum post that will fix your problems
2008-07-23T18:24:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	did you try this : sudo-apt get install xserver-xorg-driver-via
2008-07-23T18:24:00.000Z	WillLuongo	muntrue	I sure did not, but I am going to now! :D
2008-07-23T18:25:00.000Z	muntrue	WillLuongo	Will have to restart X after that ( just do a complete restart just to be sure ya know )
