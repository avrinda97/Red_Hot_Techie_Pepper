2008-10-15T13:48:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Can anyone help me with this http://pastebin.com/d4289be20 im using Hardy Heron amd64 build, and im also using gfxboot grub. I ran into this problem before and dont remember how it was fixed. Please help
2008-10-15T13:50:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	have you tried issuing:  sudo apt-get -f install
2008-10-15T13:52:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	not yet, should i go thru each package or can i pass the force with "sudo apt-get upgrade"?
2008-10-15T13:52:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	just type "sudo apt-get -f install" first and nothing else
2008-10-15T13:53:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	it seems you have some packages unconfigured and that can fix it.
2008-10-15T13:53:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	same outcome
2008-10-15T13:54:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	I'd be stuck as well at that point.
2008-10-15T13:54:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	well thanks for taking a look
2008-10-15T13:59:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	what happened to have you experience that ?
2008-10-15T13:59:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	it only happens when linux-image-'uname -r' and linux-ubuntu-modules, image, etc are updated
2008-10-15T14:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	its directly related to gfxboot grub but i dont remember why
2008-10-15T14:02:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	take a look at line 4, 5, & 6.. its running /sbin/update-grub and running into a problem
2008-10-15T14:03:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	can you pastebin your contents of /sbin/update-grub for me?
2008-10-15T14:06:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	I wouldn't want to update grub right now. The machine I have ubuntu installed is functioning as a file server...
2008-10-15T14:07:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	i just need a file to reference my update-grub to
2008-10-15T14:07:00.000Z	trilobit`	WIGGMPk	hold on I did it.

2008-10-15T14:09:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	no, dont acctually run update-grub... do this.. "gedit /sbin/update-grub"
2008-10-15T14:09:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	then copy and paste the contents of the file
2008-10-15T14:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	trilobit`	using pastebin of course
