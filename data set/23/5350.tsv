2007-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	ljl wrote an easy way :)
2007-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	ok, and that was? :)

2007-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	neat :)
2007-01-12T06:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	i think it depends on the mode you use in firestarter -- permissive-to-restrictive or the other way around -- in the permissive-to-restrictive mode (if thats what it is indeed called) .. the default policy is to block all ports unless you explicitly set a rule
2007-01-12T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	it seems to give me that option for outbound, but for inbound I can't find it.  Is it hidden away somewhere that you know of?
2007-01-12T06:59:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	ahh, no, thats a limitation of firestarter (as far as i am aware) .. it seems to be the classic home user's firewall management utility quite useless otherwise
2007-01-12T07:00:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	i remember wanting to open up ports on firestarter .. couldnt find out how to do it
2007-01-12T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	that would be find if it did block everything by default.  But I am running zope and it seems accessible to everyone, oh well, off to learn iptables.  Thanks for confirming
2007-01-12T07:02:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	i think you might taken the restrictive-to-permissive mode where the default policy is to allow all connections .. and yea, manually doing the iptables is a better way to go
2007-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	hmmm, actually, i just installed !firestarter to check this out -- it depends on the policy you edit -- inbound or outbound .. check under the 'policy' tab, there's a drop down menu for  'editing' that allows you to edit either/or
2007-01-12T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	right, it does let be do restrictive-by-default for outbound.  But when I switch over to inbound (which is what I want to configure), there is not way to change it to restrictive-by-default or permissive-by-default.  So I can only add ports to allow.  If firestarter doesn't block a port by default, then i can't block it
2007-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	errm, i vaguely remember something like it from an earlier version -- i can't find it either -- but i'm quite positive that it ensures that the default policy is to drop traffic .. you can verify this with  sudo iptables -L
2007-01-12T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1296/  is line 15 telling me the rule is invalid or is that just some rule syntax?
2007-01-12T07:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	looks like the same on line #38  .. i think it's an option to say, drop all packets which appear to be INVALID
2007-01-12T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	ok thanks
2007-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	seems I was wrong by the way.  Firestarter is blocking everything by default
2007-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	yep, didn't you see that in the IPTABLES -L output? :p :)
2007-01-13T07:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	he's after something that displays pictures on the desktop
2007-01-13T07:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	jrib	there's lots of instances where www-data needs write access to directories
2007-01-13T07:43:00.000Z	jrib	un_operateur	www-data owns all of his web content
