2011-03-02T02:12:00.000Z	pinchi		!help I signed in into an online languange site called Babbel. (www.babbel.com). I have a problem with the audio tracks - some days ago I could hear them, but now I cannot hear them anymore. Otherwise my player plays and my youtube works.. But it is strange. Could someone help me?
2011-03-02T02:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	you checked the volume?
2011-03-02T02:14:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	yes I did
2011-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	- i am still waiting for your answer
2011-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	sorry, i've never been good with sound
2011-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	thanks anway
2011-03-02T02:20:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	i thought ubottu may have a troubleshooting link for pulseaudio
2011-03-02T02:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	maybe this may help: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio#Known Issues
2011-03-02T02:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	of course i'm assuming you're using pulse rather than alsa
2011-03-02T02:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	ahh, there we are, a troubleshooting link
2011-03-02T02:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	it appears that Babbel uses flash
2011-03-02T02:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	perhaps it's a flash issue (though you can play youtube vids fine)
2011-03-02T02:32:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	- should I re-install flash again?
2011-03-02T02:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	you could try, on't know if it will work (cos you got sound on youtube vids right?)
2011-03-02T02:34:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	It is weird
2011-03-02T02:35:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	I tried to check my sound preferences and so on.. but.. nothing mathes
2011-03-02T02:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	just checked quickly but it appears there is no mute option in the flash menu (right click settings)
2011-03-02T02:36:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	I am kind-of LEFT to those stuff - can you tell from the beginning? :)
2011-03-02T02:36:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	wish i could help more but i'm out of ideas
2011-03-02T02:36:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	I even wrote to the web page crew and they couldn't help me..
2011-03-02T02:37:00.000Z	pinchi	ThinkT510	But thank you again - !
2011-03-02T02:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	np, glad to try
2011-03-02T02:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	pinchi	this seems to be an older link but hope it helps: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash
