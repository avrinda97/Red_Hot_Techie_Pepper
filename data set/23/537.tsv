2011-06-28T05:43:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE		I just got a "the package system is broken" error, how would I fix this?
2011-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	can you give a pastebin of: sudo apt-get update
2011-06-28T05:45:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	what is a pastebin?
2011-06-28T05:48:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	ubottu http://paste.ubuntu.com/633937/
2011-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	what about after that?
2011-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	you may need to define resolutions ni the screen section
2011-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	that was the last of it. I'll do that now
2011-06-28T05:54:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	my resolutions are fine
2011-06-28T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	sorry, crossed wire
2011-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	the command had no effect, I closed the error message about the broken package system, and the same error message popped up again. it says to disable third party repositories (idk wtf they are) and to run the command  apt-get install -f. I'll pastebin the results of running that command
2011-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	ok try:   sudo apt-get --reinstall install nano
2011-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	does it install ok?
2011-06-28T05:58:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	it seemed to install okay.
2011-06-28T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	ok does:  sudo apt-get -y upgrade    run ok?
2011-06-28T06:00:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	seemed to. it doesn't really say if it was succesful or not.

2011-06-28T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	you'd see some blatant errors and such
2011-06-28T06:03:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	oh, well no errors except for unknown media types
2011-06-28T06:05:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	ActionParsnip	still getting package system broken error messages.
2011-06-30T09:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	THIS_IS_INSANE	try:  !ask | andr0-mr      ;)
