2012-05-18T03:49:00.000Z	john3voltas		thanks a bunch
2012-05-18T03:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	You can also check /boot/grub/grub.cfg and /boot/grub/loopback.cfg on the iso.
2012-05-18T03:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	What is your end goal? Why do you want to use a non default path to the squashfs?
2012-05-18T03:53:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	i want to boot ubuntu in a frugal way using grub4dos
2012-05-18T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	It's much easier to simply leave the iso file as-is and loop boot it via grub2.
2012-05-18T03:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	Why not?
2012-05-18T03:56:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	simply because grub2 needs installation whereas grub4dos can be put to work without being installed into the mbr
2012-05-18T03:57:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	i need it for my company laptop where i am forced to use windows and prohibited to install/run linux
2012-05-18T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	grub2 can also be loaded from Windows's bootloader, though I'll admit the documentation for doing so is poor.
2012-05-18T03:57:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	for me and for this particular case, grub2 is a 'no go'
2012-05-18T03:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	In fact Wubi uses grub2, and it sounds like Wubi might be an ideal solution for you (which is not something I say often :)
2012-05-18T03:58:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	 i don't even know what a wubi is
2012-05-18T04:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	Wubi is the Windows Based Ubuntu Installer. It creates an ext4 disk image file on your Windows partition and sets up ntldr/BCD to boot from it allowing you to have a full Ubuntu installation without any repartitioning or changing of the MBR. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows
2012-05-18T04:02:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	as said, i can't install linux or anything suspicious like wubi. all i need is a boot parameter to tell the kernel where to find the filesystem squashfs.
2012-05-18T04:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	I don't know what kernel parameter that would be, sorry.
2012-05-18T04:03:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	do you mean the kernel parameters are not documented?
2012-05-18T04:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	The may or may not be documented. If they are documented then I don't know where to find them.
2012-05-18T04:10:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	this is for debian: http://grml.org/online-docs/live-initramfs.en.7.html
2012-05-18T04:10:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	i wanted to find the same for ubuntu
2012-05-18T04:19:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	hey, what's that 'file' command? like append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper ...
2012-05-18T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	I believe that it's the path to the preseed file.
2012-05-18T04:23:00.000Z	john3voltas	Jordan_U	honestly don't know what a preseed file is. thought it could be the same as the live-media-path from debian...
2012-05-18T04:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	john3voltas	No, it for settings related to installation.
