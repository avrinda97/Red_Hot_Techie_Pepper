2011-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	PseudoGou		Does anyone know where the DSDT is located in 11.04?
2011-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	PseudoGou		has /proc/acpi been deprecated and by what?
2011-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	PseudoGou		Unity is ugly, period.  Use KDE.
2011-05-13T10:24:00.000Z	PseudoGou		You're not going to get an answer with that attitude.
2011-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	haha kde :D
2011-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	they're still available somewhere in /sys; but you hsould just use acpidump, that's what most people will have you use if you need to provide them information anyways
2011-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	oh you weren't making a joke? my condolences
2011-05-13T10:29:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 Do you know if LMSENSORS is uneccesary by the new /sys/ HW monitoring structure?
2011-05-13T10:29:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	iasl; chances are you're doing something very wrong if you need to do anything with them
2011-05-13T10:30:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 No, I've done this before.  It's a well documented process.  You just insert a custom DSDT with the corrections when you recompile the kernel
2011-05-13T10:30:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	i didn't say it wasn't "safe", i said it was almost certainly very wrong
2011-05-13T10:31:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	that doesn't mean you should be rebuilding them, and that DEFINITELY means you aren'tn solving a specific problem in doing so
2011-05-13T10:35:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 No, DMESG will not display everything
2011-05-13T10:37:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 Like I said - programmers shouldn't be left to hardware matters just as scientists shouldn't spout philosophy
2011-05-13T10:37:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	if you want to know what ran at boot; look at the configuration that drives it, if you're wanting to look there for possible candidates to disable, you'd be looking at the same place you'd disable it too, it's magic
2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	man you really have no clue what you're talking about, and making those statements on top of it is just really silly
2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 You'll never see EVERYTHING....
2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 Your help was well received, now be quiet.
2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	you're even injecting personal bias and an unabashed outlook of ignorance on the subject
2011-05-13T10:39:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 I suppose you're from the school of thought that tells people not to use root
2011-05-13T10:40:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	you're embarassing yourself, really; i know enough about acpi to say what you are doing is in fact useless at best, harmful at worse; and harmful in ways you aren't equipped to figure out yourself; i'm not making generalizations, i'm talking about _you_
2011-05-13T10:40:00.000Z	PseudoGou	ohsix	 You talk, but you say nothing...  Your words are meaningless and empty.
2011-05-13T10:41:00.000Z	ohsix	PseudoGou	how about dazzling me with your knowledge of acpi and what you actually attempt to solve, and or fix by doing these incantations that you insist are a universal win
