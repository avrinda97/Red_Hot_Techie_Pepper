2005-06-30T16:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	so what?
2005-06-30T16:38:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	what prog do I run on windows so that I take control of my Linux machine
2005-06-30T16:38:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	realvnc.com - download the windows client
2005-06-30T16:39:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	isn't tightvnc enough??
2005-06-30T16:39:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	what about nx???
2005-06-30T16:39:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	well, you need a windows server and tightvnc is just for linux
2005-06-30T16:39:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	just get the official vnc 4 server/client from realvnc.com
2005-06-30T16:47:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	I can't get through, I dunno why...
2005-06-30T16:48:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	you have to be more specific. you can't get through to what? are you trying to connect to your linux box from windows or from windows to linux? do you have a firewall running? you'll need to open up port 5900-5901 TCP. are you using the correct ip?
2005-06-30T16:49:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	I switched off the firewall... when I double click to VNC viewer 4, a window saying server where I fill in the IP address and I used the right ip address
2005-06-30T16:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	it's not just the address, you must specify the port
2005-06-30T16:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	ipaddress:1 = ipaddress:5901
2005-06-30T16:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	vnc on linux by default uses 5901..then 5902 and so forth. you can run multiple vnc servers- it'll just go up one port
2005-06-30T16:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	if you run x11vnc you can use the current X session on 5900
2005-06-30T16:59:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	it works but not I was expecting... I get to control the Linux computer but I don't see what is on the screen nor does the screen show what I'm doing
2005-06-30T05:00:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	not like from Linux to Windows
2005-06-30T05:01:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	what do you mean you don't see what you're doing?
2005-06-30T05:03:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	what I'm doing on my windows machine can't be seen on the linux machine
2005-06-30T05:03:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	so if you vnc into the windows machine..you can't see what you're doing on the windows machine?
2005-06-30T05:05:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	U see I run vnc to run Ubuntu on Windows
2005-06-30T05:05:00.000Z	afroman	jasoncohen	but what I was doing on my windows machine I couldn't see it onthe Ubuntu screeen
2005-06-30T05:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	afroman	well, what did you see on the ubuntu viewer?
