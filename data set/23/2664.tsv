2009-11-22T20:35:00.000Z	biopyte		besides using 'brightside', is there a way to enable edge flipping on the gnome desktop (ubuntu 9.10)?
2009-11-22T20:37:00.000Z	biopyte		how can i configure the gdm login screen (change theme) in 9.10?
2009-11-22T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 short answer. you dont. :) its a lot less configurable then the old. You can change the wallpaper easially.
2009-11-22T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 theres also a few other tweaks you can do to it at this time.  but its  not near as themeable as the old.
2009-11-22T20:47:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	that was exactly my impression after doing the upgrade today. why do they deprecate important features. i want my old login screen back!
2009-11-22T20:47:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	thanks for the info. at least i dont have to waste more time on this now.
2009-11-22T20:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 becuse they are working on adding new features to gdm and other areas. so eventually it will be better.
2009-11-22T20:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 if its that critical you can install the old gdm. but i dont advise it
2009-11-22T20:52:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	ok thanks. so lets hope for improvements within the near future. the gnome guys cant leave this POS as it is right now.
2009-12-29T18:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 last i plasyed with that. it could flip when you moved the mouse over to the right and just held it there for a moment, or you can set it to flip on 'draging a window' only
2009-12-29T18:34:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	dragging windows across the borders works fine here, but no way moving with the mouse cursor only
2009-12-29T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 I hate moveing with just the mouse.. so i never want that feature.
2009-12-29T18:37:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	thats one of my most beloved features :-)
2009-12-29T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 yep. its all about 'linux your way' ;)
2009-12-29T18:40:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	switching virtual desktops there is always this useless animation, showing an image of the VT for 3 seconds or so. do you what i mean? how can i deactivate this behaviour? its a paoin in my eyes.
2009-12-29T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 Hmm you mean on the alt-ctrl-f1 through F6 consoles? ive never noticed an animation there.
2009-12-29T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 if you mean the animation when it changes desktops./ thats disablable i recall
2009-12-29T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 i find with my 2 monitor setup  i rarely need extra desktops now. Other then a place to stick some unnedded windows. :)
2009-12-29T18:42:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	no i mean ctrl-alt-left/right/up/down triggers a short animation indicating that you switched desktops. its difficult to explain for me.
2009-12-29T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 its tweakable. compiz has so many settings its staggering. :)
2009-12-29T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 personally i tend to switch via the mouse wheel.
2009-12-29T18:56:00.000Z	biopyte	Dr_Willis	hey, try edge flipping on desktop wall. its so cool.
2010-11-24T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biopyte	 ive seen windows have 7+GB in just some cache in the windows dir..
