2005-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	oo		I got a partition with 1.8 gb free which im planning to install ubuntu minimal on. when I in the installationprogress choose the guided partition tool. It chooses to make the swap partition like 112 mb big. and the other 1.7gb. is the swap partition to small?
2005-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	oo		got 128 mb ram
2005-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	oo		and where is the missing ~900 mb.?
2005-07-02T05:18:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	it needs to be at least equal, and in your case trebel
2005-07-02T05:23:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	at LEAST 2x your physical ram
2005-07-02T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	any gimp, 3x
2005-07-02T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	and buy more physical ram (gimp eats it up quickly)
2005-07-02T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	remove nerim.net and backports from your sources list
2005-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	oo	nalioth	ok  - cool. I am just so used to using nerim.net. But w32codecs ?
2005-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	www.mplayerhq.hu  and download the 'essential package'
2005-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	there are instructions there on where to put them
2005-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	oo	nalioth	yeah - but as long as my Linux system actually _has_ a package manager i'd rather like to use it...
2005-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	oo	nalioth	but thanks a lot! :)
2005-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	using unofficial repos WILL lead to system breakage
2005-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	we see it all the time in ehre
2005-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	oo	nalioth	Debian Sid also leads to breakage, but you are of course correct.
2005-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	i dont know anything about sid or nancy
2005-07-03T11:11:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	depends on your system
2005-07-03T11:12:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	and they are ?
2005-07-03T11:12:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	doesnt matter. if you have a powerful processor and megaram, KDE is smooth
2005-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	you might want to stick with gnome or xfce for "blazin response"
2005-07-03T11:17:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	celeron what?
2005-07-03T11:18:00.000Z	nalioth	oo	celerons usually lag behind their full pentium brethren (due to artificial castration)
