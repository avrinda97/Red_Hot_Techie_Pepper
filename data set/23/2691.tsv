2008-12-11T11:10:00.000Z	aeolien		Hi! Does anyone know how to restore the Applications menu?
2008-12-11T11:10:00.000Z	aeolien		Mines... blank.
2008-12-11T11:11:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	right click, Add to Panel..., then find it somewhere in the list
2008-12-11T11:11:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	I should have been more descriptive. It's there. I just get a small blank rectangle when I click on it.
2008-12-11T11:12:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	as in, you have the Applications/Places/System, but it's blank?
2008-12-11T11:12:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Places and System work. The menus open properly. Applications doesn't really open when I click on it.
2008-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	have you tried right clicking on Applications -> Edit Menus?
2008-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	It's highlighted as if it's open, and there's a small rectangle from it when I click on it. I presume that's an empty menu.
2008-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Edit Menus doesn't open the Menu Editor.
2008-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Nothing happens when I open it.
2008-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	I'll try restarting gnome-panel
2008-12-11T11:14:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	gnome-panel says "Error loading menu layout from "~/.config/menus/applications.menu: Document empty"
2008-12-11T11:14:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	give me one second
2008-12-11T11:15:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	i'll pastebin mine, so you can try recreating the file
2008-12-11T11:15:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Thanks!
2008-12-11T11:17:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	http://pastebin.com/m53dd95f5 (replace username in highlighted line =P), tell me if this works
2008-12-11T11:19:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Sweet! I've lost my customization, but that's nothing compared to this!
2008-12-11T11:19:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	Thanks!
2008-12-11T11:19:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	I'll log out and in again to see if it 'takes'
2008-12-11T11:19:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	that's good to hear =), you're welcome
2008-12-11T11:19:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	okay =P
2008-12-11T11:24:00.000Z	aeolien	aves	That's it! Thanks!
2008-12-11T11:24:00.000Z	aves	aeolien	i'm glad it stayed! =)
