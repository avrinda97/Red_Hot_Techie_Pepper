2011-02-18T13:56:00.000Z	VxQe		Could someone please give me some advice re setting up ssh?
2011-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	install openssh-server on the server side, it will run at startup and has x forwarding enabled by default
2011-02-18T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	did you restart the sshd service after editting the config?
2011-06-20T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	check the entry
2011-06-20T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	what line did you add?
2011-06-20T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	i believe there is a file which will tell your OS to update the router
2011-06-20T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	if you set the interface to DHCP (address only) you can then specify the DNS servers and in the order you desire
2011-06-20T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	I do that myself and always install a local dnsmasq service to all systems to speed up web access
2011-06-20T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	can you telnet to your router and do stuff there?
2011-06-20T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	most home grade junk doesn't let you by default
2011-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	dnsmasq is the BOM
2011-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	VxQe	ActionParsnip	APPARENTLY.
2011-06-20T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	check how long name resolutions take to happen after the second ask ;)
2011-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	what medium does the link use?
2011-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	yep, that's right :)
2011-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	ok then possibly a bad cable or a bad port on the connection device
2011-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	or bad port on the system or bad driver settings
2011-10-19T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	what chip does the ethernet controller use?
2011-10-19T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	sudo lshw -C network     will tell you
2011-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	VxQe	ActionParsnip	it's an RTL8111/8168B, probably not cable since it works in windows?
2011-10-19T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	VxQe	http://www.rvdavid.net/how-to-get-gigabit-speeds-from-rtl81118168b-pci-express-gigabit-ethernet-controller-on-ubuntu-linux/
2011-10-19T07:18:00.000Z	VxQe	ActionParsnip	that's not an issue, everything shows up as 1GB/s
2011-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	VxQe	ActionParsnip	the proprietary drivers appear to be working fine. However the realtek installation script is broken. :(
