2009-06-16T00:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	you need to add the medibuntu repo first then you'll be able to install acroread.  have you added medibuntu then updated your database ie "sudo apt-get update"?
2009-06-16T00:54:00.000Z	nickoe	ZykoticK9	yes
2009-06-16T00:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	then "sudo apt-get install acroread" should work?

2009-06-16T00:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	there's something wrong with you medibuntu.list file.  mine is very short on 8 lines sorta thing?
2009-06-16T00:58:00.000Z	nickoe	ZykoticK9	mine is 3 lines
2009-06-16T00:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	sorry i don't speak german so i'm not quite sure what it's saying, but the apt-get update has some issues i'd say

2009-06-16T01:01:00.000Z	nickoe	ZykoticK9	ignoring... 2 sec, I will see if i can find the correct frase in english
2009-06-16T01:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	i'm mainly having a language problem with your logs, perhaps a danish chat would be better - but i think there is a problem with you "apt-get update" and probably medibuntu repo...  good luck man.
2009-06-16T01:06:00.000Z	nickoe	ZykoticK9	okay, I will try. Or du you have a name of an other good pdf viewer?
2009-06-16T01:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	you could look into Foxit which is a SUPER fast PDF viewer https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Foxit, good luck.
2009-06-16T01:17:00.000Z	nickoe	ZykoticK9	I just installed acroread from the deb at http://get.adobe.com/dk/reader/otherversions/
2009-06-16T01:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nickoe	NICE that's an even easier solution :)
