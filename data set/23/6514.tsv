2006-03-23T15:04:00.000Z	sfar-ubu		noob-question: can i un-root myself in terminal without closing the terminal
2006-03-23T15:05:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	if you su'd to root you can just type 'exit'.  I think you can just 'su' to another user if you wish
2006-03-28T13:25:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	what player?
2006-03-28T13:26:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	xmms and beep media player
2006-03-28T13:26:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	do you use esd as the sound output?
2006-03-28T13:27:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	i dont know, where do i look that  up?
2006-03-28T13:27:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	system  > preferences > multimedia systems selector
2006-03-28T13:28:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	 sink:esd, source:oss
2006-03-28T13:29:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	go to preferences in xmms and beep and select esd as the audio output
2006-03-28T13:30:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	 thanks.. that did the trick:D
2006-03-28T15:25:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	if the bin file is a virus, you throw it in the trash.  If the in file is something you want to run and you can't use synaptic to do it, you run it
2006-03-28T15:26:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	 :D
2006-03-28T15:26:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	thanks, i knew i was supposed to run it, but i didnt know how :>
2006-03-28T15:26:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	what is it a bin file of?
2006-03-28T15:27:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	xmms-control desklet thingy
2006-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	hmmm I don't know what you do with those.  To run a file you just go to the directory where it is located and do ./file though
2006-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	"./file" didnt work.. "file" did tho.. replied "Install_XMMS_Sensor.bin: a python script text executable
2006-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	I meant ./nameofthefileyouwanttorun
2006-03-28T15:31:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	that worked better ;)
2006-03-30T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	global, it changes every instance of dapper on a line instead of just the first instance
2006-04-02T13:43:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	killall totem
2006-04-02T13:44:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	_jason	that didnt work for me tho.. even with "sudo killall totem"
2006-04-02T13:45:00.000Z	_jason	sfar-ubu	kill -9 it
