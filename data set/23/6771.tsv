2008-02-02T18:36:00.000Z	karel		no-one who can help me fix my windows boot? :(
2008-02-02T18:37:00.000Z	th0r	karel	boot from the windows cd, choose 'R'epair mode, and at the prompt type 'fixmbr'
2008-02-02T18:38:00.000Z	karel	th0r	that's what I normally do, but this time it tells me it can't find a harddrive... :S
2008-02-02T18:38:00.000Z	th0r	karel	when you installed ubuntu did you format the entire drive?
2008-02-02T18:39:00.000Z	karel	th0r	no, notice the problem occured when I removed my ubuntu partions ;)
2008-02-02T18:40:00.000Z	th0r	karel	how did you remove those partitions? You should have repaired windows first
2008-02-02T18:41:00.000Z	th0r	karel	do you have another linux installed on the computer?
2008-02-02T18:41:00.000Z	karel	th0r	no
2008-02-02T18:42:00.000Z	th0r	karel	at the moment can you get anything running on that computer? It sounds like you deleted the wrong partition(s)
2008-02-02T18:42:00.000Z	karel	th0r	it's like this: everything worked in dualboot, I removed ubuntu partition and normally grub doesn't work then anymore and I fix it with a fixboot/fixmbr but this time it doesn't see my harddrive
2008-02-02T18:42:00.000Z	karel	th0r	livecd's etc, but I don't have anything on the harddrive except windows normally
2008-02-02T18:44:00.000Z	th0r	karel	it would have been safer to repair the mbr first and use windows to delete the partitions, but it should have worked the way you did it. Sounds like you deleted the wrong partition or the partition table got scrambled. Either way, if the install CD doesn't see anything you probably lost windows. I would try to reboot the livecd and run gparted from there to check the partition table
2008-02-02T18:44:00.000Z	karel	th0r	how do I check it? (I suppose gparted livecd is ok, no need for ubuntu?)
2008-02-02T18:45:00.000Z	th0r	karel	gparted is a program that is on the ubuntu livecd.Boot ubuntu livecd and check the partitions from there
2008-02-02T18:45:00.000Z	karel	th0r	there's a gparted livecd: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php --> it's a lot faster then ubuntu ;)
2008-02-02T18:46:00.000Z	th0r	karel	no problem....however many cd's you want to create
2008-02-02T18:46:00.000Z	karel	th0r	ok, what do I do in gparted?
2008-02-02T18:47:00.000Z	th0r	karel	see if you can find the windows partition...see if gparted can even read the partition table. If the windows partition no longer exists there isn't much you are going to be able to do but reinstall from scratch
2008-02-02T18:47:00.000Z	th0r	karel	I personally use fdisk for my partition work...don't trust gparted, but fdisk is command line
2008-02-02T18:48:00.000Z	karel	th0r	gparted sees my ntfs partition and sees boot flags
2008-02-02T18:48:00.000Z	th0r	karel	then windows should be able to see it. If you had not deleted ubuntu first then you could have reinstalled from the backup grub makes, but that is gone now so the only option you have is the windows install cd.
2008-02-02T18:50:00.000Z	karel	th0r	could the fact that I have a sata hd have anything to do with it?
2008-02-02T18:50:00.000Z	th0r	karel	not that I know of
