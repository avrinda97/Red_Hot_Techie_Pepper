2009-03-07T06:42:00.000Z	ghang		hi everyone, i bought a UMPC call Wibrain I1, and i try to install ubuntu on it with wubi.exe, but fail , when after install and restart the computer into DOS mode , it directly computer poweroff , why ? is the factory setting not allow user to use DOS mode or the ATOM processor cannot install Unbuntu with this way ?
2009-03-07T06:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	ok wubi is  not that good a way to insatll  Ubuntu, and it seems you have some computer issues
2009-03-07T06:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	have you tried a Ubuntu Live CD on there?
2009-03-07T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	is that a old computer you bought?  and DOS mode????????   do you mean recovery mode in Windows?
2009-03-07T06:44:00.000Z	ghang	sebsebseb	, hi , no , i bought a very cute UMPC , is a very very mini computer , palm computer , and didnt have cdrom/dvdrom
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	which OS is on it?
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	ok a netbook?
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	ghang	sebsebseb	 oh... similar ,since it was also using atom processor
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	you went into DOS mode and the computer turns off???????
2009-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	how much  RAM?   1GB?
2009-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	and the computer shoudn't just turn off ever, unless bad hardware
2009-03-07T06:47:00.000Z	ghang	sebsebseb	never ~ even i install a Ghost it was also unable to run in DOS mode, i only can use the GHOST under windows, yes is RAM 1GB , thats why i think it was the factory set something to denine user to get into DOS mode
2009-03-07T06:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	ok  you got some problems with your lap top.  it's hardware or windows issues.   that would be why wubi didn't work either.  if you can get those issues sorted out try a Ubuntu Live CD after md5suming it and install from that
2009-03-07T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	Go to #windows  for help with  that
2009-03-07T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	no good putting Ubuntu on,  unless  you know the hardware is fine, and that Windows works good to
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	you told me the computer just turned itself off?
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	a computer should never just turn itself off
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	that could mean your hardware is bad
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	or it was just Windows being stupid
2009-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	yep ok well not here for that one, but yes #windows
2009-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	and there's  #hardware
2009-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	ghang	sebsebseb	thank bro
2009-03-07T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ghang	then later on when you download an Ubuntu ISO,  you sould md5sum it before burning to a CD
