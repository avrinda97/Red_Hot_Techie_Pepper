2008-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	_346L3_		bonjour :D
2008-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	_346L3_		mhm...
2008-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	_346L3_		my question about the compilation of the kernel on ubuntu 8.10: has anybody tried to do it? i can't compile the kernel, as it seems the ubuntu-addons are broken...
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	_346L3_		mhm... I know all these howtos...
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	_346L3_		i followed a few of them, because i suspected i was doing something wrong...
2008-11-14T00:12:00.000Z	_346L3_		the problem is: the parts of the kernel compile quite nice... until it tries to compile the addons ubuntu added to the source...
2008-11-14T00:12:00.000Z	_346L3_		it then exits with complaints about undefined functions etc...
2008-11-14T00:12:00.000Z	_346L3_		I did everything as it was recommended in the official ubuntu-howtos...
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	_346L3_		mhm...
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	_346L3_		which could these be?
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	can you pastebin your output for "./configure"
2008-11-14T00:14:00.000Z	_346L3_	wwpiexec	wait a sec... the VM is booting ;)
2008-11-14T00:20:00.000Z	_346L3_	wwpiexec	uhm... the output of ./configure is quite simple... o.O "bash: ./configure: No such file or directory"
2008-11-14T00:20:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	you said you're trying to compile from source?
2008-11-14T00:21:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	ok.. are you runing "./configure" from within the directory of the source?!
2008-11-14T00:22:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	is there an autoconfig file?
2008-11-14T00:23:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	why dont you simply go through the normal proceedures for compiling it.. and then redirect stdout and stderr to a file.. and then pastebinit
2008-11-14T00:24:00.000Z	_346L3_	wwpiexec	I guessed these WERE the normal procedures for compiling it?
2008-11-14T00:25:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	usually it is ./configure and then make ... but i've never compiled kernels before.. but i didn't think it was any different.. seems like they just use make with config options and flags.. maybe there is someone else here who can help.. sorry
2008-11-14T00:26:00.000Z	_346L3_	wwpiexec	mhm... no problem, but thanks anyway... :-| only problem is: you were the only one responding to this... :-/
2008-11-14T00:27:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	usually when the compiler says function undefined.. either the programmer messed up.. (which is prob. not the case).. or there is a dependency missing.. and the code is linking to a file that doesnt exist and calling a function in there..
2008-11-14T00:29:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	are you sure the information is not outdated.. or maybe run through the steps.. you might have mistyped something..
2008-11-14T00:30:00.000Z	wwpiexec	_346L3_	hmm.. where is the howto?
