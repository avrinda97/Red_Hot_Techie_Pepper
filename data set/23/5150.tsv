2007-02-10T07:57:00.000Z	cables		Idiamond, are you usinga VGA connection?
2007-02-10T07:57:00.000Z	cables		Idiamond, does your monitor have an auto-adjust function?
2007-02-10T07:58:00.000Z	cables		Idiamond, there's lots of stuff in Xorg for sync and stuff for analog connections, but I don't know how to deal with that.
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z	cables		Speaking of which, isn't it a big risk if anyone with access to the system can just boot in recovery mode?
2007-02-10T08:01:00.000Z	kitche	cables	well it's a risk for just having someone able to get physical access to a computer so recovery mode is not a big deal
2007-02-10T08:01:00.000Z	cables	kitche	yes, but what's the point of having different user levels then?
2007-02-10T08:02:00.000Z	cables	kitche	I guess if someone's smart enough to get into GRUB and screw things up, they're smart enough to screw things up via liveCD.
2007-02-10T08:02:00.000Z	kitche	cables	they do different things
2007-02-10T08:03:00.000Z	cables	kitche	you can change important files via a Linux LIveCD, and you can change important files via root in Recovery mode. That's all I'm saying.
2007-04-13T12:27:00.000Z	kitche	cables	you might :) sounds more of a troll
2007-05-28T12:02:00.000Z	cables	kitche	are you serious? FORGOT?
2007-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	cables	kitche	it just means that people somehhow didn't update their linux-restricted-modules package
2007-05-28T12:04:00.000Z	cables	kitche	it normally does handle it
2007-05-28T12:05:00.000Z	cables	kitche	by default, it seems that "linux-generic" is installed, which means that if it gets updated, so do the modules and the image. It's just that somehow people mess up their systems and that package gets uninstalled so they don't get updates to both.
2007-05-28T12:06:00.000Z	cables	kitche	it's possible... I dunno though.
2007-06-06T05:18:00.000Z	kitche	cables	smb.conf should have a section for print sharing
2007-06-06T05:19:00.000Z	cables	kitche	it does, but I have no idea what to do with it!
2007-07-04T16:30:00.000Z	kitche	cables	the user that is
2007-07-04T16:30:00.000Z	cables	kitche	I don't think I installed postfix, maybe it was a dependency of something...
2007-07-04T16:30:00.000Z	cables	kitche	how would I go about fixing this?
2007-07-04T16:31:00.000Z	cables	kitche	postfix is installed. Should I remove it?
2007-07-04T16:32:00.000Z	kitche	cables	umm you can try but that's your best bet that it didn't add postfix user to your system and apt is complaining about it
2007-07-04T16:32:00.000Z	cables	kitche	ok.
