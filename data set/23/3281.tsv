2008-05-30T05:45:00.000Z	m_newton		OK, is there a way to make it secure?
2008-05-30T05:45:00.000Z	m_newton		<Starnestommy> OK, is there a way to make it secure? You see i was running a port scanning program that told me that it was open and unsecure
2008-05-30T05:47:00.000Z	m_newton		<matthew> so when they say that it is unsecure, the port test is wrong?
