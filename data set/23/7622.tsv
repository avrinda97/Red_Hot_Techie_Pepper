2005-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	disquiet		Haha, danko, ok
2005-06-06T11:28:00.000Z	disquiet		I do have more than one, though. Differnet angles over several years. So had I sent them, I would have been able to back it up.
2005-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	disquiet		danko - thanks again for your help last night
2005-06-06T09:28:00.000Z	disquiet		how are y'all today?
2005-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	disquiet		I had a headcahe for a week straight and couldn't figure it out... and now I'm not at work for 3 days and it's gone... interesting....
2005-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	disquiet		it's the damn recirculated cubical air!
2005-06-06T09:31:00.000Z	disquiet		I had a migraine on a thursday and a friday, and my head still hurt by the next friday.
2005-06-06T09:31:00.000Z	disquiet		I think I'm just allergic to my job
2005-06-06T09:31:00.000Z	disquiet		no, seriously? my job bites and I'm disgustingly underpaid and too much is expected of me. Just like every other job in the world.
2005-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	disquiet		BUT - they don't make me wear shoes.
2005-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	sounds like work related stress might be the cause of your headache
2005-06-06T09:33:00.000Z	disquiet	anto9us	- I'm starting to think that. A little nagging pain just sets in as soon as I turn on my computer there.
2005-06-06T09:33:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	might be worth checking the refresh rate if you have a CRT monitor too
2005-06-06T09:33:00.000Z	disquiet		that's a good idea
2005-06-06T09:34:00.000Z	disquiet		I didn't think this job would be as stressful as it turned out to be
2005-06-06T09:34:00.000Z	disquiet		there's something wrong with a company when the lowest paid, lowest rung, has everything depending on them doing their job perfectly.
2005-06-06T09:35:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	I find stress in work isn't caused by tasks (unless you're given impossible ones) but by the people and relationships
2005-06-06T09:35:00.000Z	disquiet	anto9us	- it's a combination of poor training, high expectations, and a big jerk in the credit department
2005-06-06T09:37:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	there we go, you need to resolve the issues you have with the jerk in the credit department by the sounds of it. Show no fear ;)
2005-06-06T09:38:00.000Z	disquiet	anto9us	- I've figured out the problem. He loves me, hates the guy I work with, so makes it hard on us. If I call him directly, he's sweet as pie. I think he only likes girls.
2005-06-06T09:39:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	sounds like alpha male syndrome :)
2005-06-06T09:40:00.000Z	disquiet	anto9us	- yep, and he's going to learn how to bow to me, the alpha female of the washington DC branch!
2005-06-06T09:40:00.000Z	anto9us	disquiet	go girlfriend!!!
