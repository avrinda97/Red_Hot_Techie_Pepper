2006-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	ulfar		Is there any way to use dapper to patch a program when installing ?
2006-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	ulfar		for example, i need to patch wine before installing it, do i have to manually install or is it possible to use dapper ?
2006-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	apt-get build it from source
2006-09-25T10:59:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	usually winehq has premade debs too of their latest
2006-09-25T11:00:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	yea but i have to patch the source :p
2006-09-25T11:02:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	latelst WoW is 1.12.x?
2006-09-25T11:02:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	if so: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=5606
2006-09-25T11:02:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	omg lol
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	tell me, if i already built the source from scratch, and then use apt-get to install wine again, will it override my settings for me ?
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	no it won't
2006-09-25T11:04:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	how can i remove my source installation ? .p
2006-09-25T11:04:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	dpg -r? or what you mean? have you built a .edb or not? if there is no .deb, there is no good way to uninstall. and the config might be overwritten too
2006-09-25T11:04:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	ONLY proper way to install is via .debs, selfmade debs or from a repository
2006-09-25T11:05:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	how about .tar.gz
2006-09-25T11:05:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	as I said: NO
2006-09-25T11:05:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	i used apt-get source wine, and then installed it :P
2006-09-25T11:05:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	lol too bad
2006-09-25T11:05:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	then you installed a .deb via dpkg -i? that's fine. now dpkg can remove it too (or apt)
2006-09-25T11:12:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	btw they are using alot older version of wine, is that alright ?
2006-09-25T11:13:00.000Z	wols	ulfar	that's what I don't get. I'd say in newer versions of wine, those patches should be already in. have you tested them?
2006-09-25T11:14:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	i only tested the latest wine using apt-get install
2006-09-25T11:14:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	however wow crashed :(
2006-09-25T11:14:00.000Z	ulfar	wols	i can see the intro! but when it comes to the login screen i crash
