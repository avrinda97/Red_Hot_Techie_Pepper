2011-01-25T20:15:00.000Z	s5s		Ubuntu is the first OS that has hung on me in the past 10 years. Yes, my question is what do I do so that ubuntu doesn't hang
2011-01-25T20:15:00.000Z	s5s		I suppose the only thing I can do is not use ubuntu
2011-01-25T20:17:00.000Z	s5s		And it doesn't even hang once and then nothing. It hangs periodically - about once a day or so...
2011-01-25T20:18:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	define "hang"
2011-01-25T20:19:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	doesn't work. Is that good enough. Mouse pointer stops moving, computer is not responding. I believe it's a memory leak...one of many
2011-01-25T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	can you get to a tty?
2011-01-25T20:20:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	non-responsive means I can't do anything incl. tty
2011-01-25T20:20:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	what video driver are you using?
2011-01-25T20:21:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	the same I'm using in fedora, debian and they don't hang
2011-01-25T20:21:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	this isn't a proper answer...  If you want help, try to answer questions.  If you just want to waste people's time and whine, then just use a different distro.  Use what works for you instead of wasting people's time
2011-01-25T20:22:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	I'm using r506 which is for ati X1400
2011-09-08T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	what does "no dough" mean?
2011-09-08T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	and why do you want this package?
2011-09-08T01:30:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	does it matter why I want the package? I need it for development obviously :\
2011-09-08T01:31:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	yes, I ask because often people ask because they are compiling a package in the repositories and are not aware of APT. I just wanted to rule that out
2011-09-08T01:32:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	yeah. I'm using aptitude but for some reason curl-config --cflags shows nothing (it's supposed to show where the headers are)
2011-09-08T01:34:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	I think I found it. Strange the curl-config is broken I think. IT's supposed to show /usr/include/curl/
2011-09-08T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	right, I was going to say that installing the -dev package you mentioned earlier should drop the files in /usr/include/curl
2011-09-08T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	note that pkg-config --libs libcurl also returns an empty line
2011-09-08T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	sorry, I meant pkg-config --cflags libcurl
2011-09-08T01:36:00.000Z	s5s	jrib	hmm
2011-09-08T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	I have never use libcurl.  You are certain there needs to be something returned here?
2011-09-08T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	s5s	my guess is this blank output is ok as gcc should check /usr/include/ by default, no?
