2008-05-17T09:34:00.000Z	Phirephly		So, on to the questions, anyone feel like helping me run Heron at 1440x900 with only integrated graphics?
2008-05-17T09:34:00.000Z	Phirephly		Currently stuck at 1280x800 and everything is too big.
2008-05-17T09:35:00.000Z	Phirephly		The only help Google is tossing me is for nvidia.
2008-05-17T09:37:00.000Z	Phirephly		To get 1440x900 without an nVidia card, I'm assuming (from what I've read) that I'll need to muck around with Xorg?
2008-05-17T09:37:00.000Z	Phirephly		Anyone familiar with it?
2008-05-17T09:38:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
2008-05-17T09:39:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	I'll be honest, I'm taking a shot in the dark, I'm not familiar enough to claim I know what I'm doing.
2008-05-17T09:40:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	tpye in console this command and floow instructions on screen -  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-05-17T09:40:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	I'll give it a shot.
2008-05-17T09:40:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	when u get to resolution part, mark 1400x900
2008-05-17T09:43:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	I'm toying around with reconfiguring xorg, but it's asking me for a keyboard layout. It won't let me push OK or pick a certain layout. Nor does it have anywhere to type it in. Am I missing something here?
2008-05-17T09:44:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	Nevermind. I'm just being dense.
2008-05-17T09:44:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	keep default
2008-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	After all the keyboard settings, I'm returned to console. There are no video settings.
2008-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	at end it should ask you advanced
2008-05-17T09:47:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	It echoes, "xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration
2008-05-17T09:48:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	b4 that part chevck for advanced option and there u should edit that modes manualy
2008-05-17T09:50:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	It's asks me if it wants me to use the kernel framebuffer device interface, and no matter what I choose, it sends me to the keyboard stuff. At the very end, it asks for Keyboard options, but after that, it just throws me back to console.
2008-05-17T09:50:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	uwhat card u got ?
2008-05-17T10:15:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	Is that like an uprising?
2008-05-17T10:15:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	joke :)
2008-05-17T10:15:00.000Z	Phirephly	m1r	Someone should start it, then :P
2008-05-17T10:16:00.000Z	m1r	Phirephly	:)
