2005-02-26T14:30:00.000Z	bestadvocate		whats up raven3x7
2005-02-26T14:31:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	my Hoary is current.  gimp is not going to be uninstalled
2005-03-05T06:58:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	I am
2005-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	have you had any problems with playing files? I get some error on "pipes" or something
2005-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	yes, if I don't kill and restart polypaudio, I have several problems
2005-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	oh, yes
2005-03-05T07:03:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	if you have troubles, kill and restart polypaudio
2005-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	I can't find polyaudio in top so but i got XMMS and BEEP working (too bad beep cant add xmms playlists)
2005-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	are you using Hoary?
2005-03-05T07:07:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	yes but i think its my lack of knowledge of how to kill something thats getting in the way
2005-03-05T07:08:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	if you're current, a recent dist-upgrade would have you using polypaudio instead of esd
2005-03-05T07:09:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	im current, updated 20 min ago
2005-03-05T07:09:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	okay.
2005-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	out of curiosity how would one go about restarting polyaudio/killing it?
2005-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	1) polypaudio -k (the easiest, but not only way to kill it)
2005-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	2) polypaudio
2005-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tritium	thanks worked like a charm!
2005-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	tritium	bestadvocate	good :)
