2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they do update their packages
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they don't upgrade the packages to newer versions most of the time
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		because 6.06 is a LTS release
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		stability is key
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	floyd2	dyn-afk	example: quodlibet is at 0.18 and latest is 0.23
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		I know
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		but that's because they want stability and security
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	floyd2		updating a media player is not going to affect system stability
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they'll still update everything so it doesn't have security holes and suchs
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dyn-afk		-s
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	dyn-afk		but that doesn't mean they upgrade everything to the latest versionnumber
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	dyn-afk		for example OpenOffice.org: version 2.0.2 is in 6.06
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	floyd2		Having to wait for an OS upgrade to upgrade a simple program is kind of rediculous. Other nameless OS don't suffer from this
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	dyn-afk		there are however some security holes
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they updated 2.0.2 with those security patches
2006-10-07T10:07:00.000Z	dyn-afk		it still is 2.0.2 but it has the security patches from 2.0.3
2006-10-07T10:07:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they didn'tupgrade 2.0.2 to 2.0.3
2006-10-07T10:07:00.000Z	dyn-afk		<floyd2> Having to wait for an OS upgrade to upgrade a simple program is kind of rediculous. Other nameless OS don't suffer from this << that's because they are not LTS
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		SUSE, Red Hat, etc. have the exact same "problem"
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		they're stable and secure but not very up to date
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	floyd2	dyn-afk	Windows and MacOS don't have LTS?
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		that's what edgy eft is for in case of ubuntu: bleeding edge stuff
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk	floyd2	yep
