2006-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	edulix		hi !
2006-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	edulix		I'm trying to reinstall grub using the livecd
2006-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	edulix		I've mounted the linux partition in /linux
2006-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	edulix		(hda6, it's ext3)
2006-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	why not just install grub without the livecd?
2006-06-16T13:21:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	uh ?
2006-06-16T13:23:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	iirc, there's an easier way to set up grub...
2006-06-16T13:23:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	hold on a sec
2006-06-16T13:24:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	yes, grub-install, but it fails
2006-06-16T13:24:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	with the same error?
2006-06-16T13:25:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	no, the error is another one more obscure, which means probably the same:  The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly.
2006-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	yeah...i got that error too.
2006-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	strange
2006-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	what else can i do ?
2006-06-16T13:40:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	any luck?
2006-06-16T13:40:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	my box freezes up when i try grub-install now...
2006-06-16T13:40:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	yes!
2006-06-16T13:41:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	what'd you do?
2006-06-16T13:41:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	geometry (hd0) told that /dev/hda6 is (hd0,6) (instead of (hd0,5) as usual  )
2006-06-16T13:41:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	aha
2006-06-16T13:42:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	cool. well, i guess i'll just stick with lilo for now...my problem seems to be bigger
2006-06-16T13:44:00.000Z	edulix	gpm	but now I'm getting other error
2006-06-16T13:46:00.000Z	gpm	edulix	what's that?
