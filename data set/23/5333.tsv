2008-08-10T15:43:00.000Z	robinparker		is it true that Adobe Flash doesnt work in  64bit  and many more applications??
2008-08-10T15:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	robinparker	it works, you just have to do some work to get 32bit web browsers, etc, to work on 64bit..
2008-08-10T15:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	robinparker	i personally, just don't think the problems w/ 64bit, are worth the hassle...
2008-08-10T15:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	robinparker	its not even that much faster... i noticed no difference at all.

2008-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	robinparker	IndyGunFreak	what is the default password for ROOT user?
2008-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	robinparker	there is no root password, its your sudo user password.
2008-08-10T16:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	robinparker	just use sudo to to make root commands, its not that difficult.
