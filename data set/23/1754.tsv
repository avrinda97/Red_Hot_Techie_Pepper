2009-11-25T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	yep, adobe love doing that, they suck
2009-11-25T18:42:00.000Z	python_root	ActionParsnip	I got a Job to do i will have to install MS and Adobe CS again ?
2009-11-25T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	i guess, you can install it with cedega or crossover and it may work
2009-11-25T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	they are paid for software though, it may run with wine too
2009-11-25T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	if you run: sudo fdisk -l ; mount    you can see whats going on, if its not mounted, manually mounted

2009-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	python_root	ActionParsnip	But now it is not detected in that too

2009-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	you can try foremost to recover the data, or you may be able to make the disk a single partiton like it was
2009-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	python_root	ActionParsnip	i need no data from it
2009-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	i'd go for foremost personally, remember: gracefully remove usb devices or it WILL happen again
2009-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	python_root	then use gparted to make a partition on the device and format it as you need
