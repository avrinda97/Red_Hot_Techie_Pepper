2008-11-22T01:59:00.000Z	franko		anyone know how to share an internet connection between wlan0(that goes out internet) and eth0(on which i plugged a Windows PC)?
2008-11-22T01:59:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 you may want to try googling for bridging - I think that lets you do it
2008-11-22T02:00:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	I followed this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370
2008-11-22T02:01:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 try http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31632 the iptables approach seems unnessesary
2008-11-22T02:02:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	ok i will try
2008-11-22T02:09:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	mmh.. but i need a router function for my pc, not just bridging...because i have only 1 ip available just for my laptop
2008-11-22T02:09:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	... i need to create a "little LAN"..
2008-11-22T02:10:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 I'm afraid I can't help you there then...
2008-11-22T02:11:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	cyball: but only able to access my www dir, and not going on internet
2008-11-22T02:12:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 so you want your windows box to connect to a certain directory on your linux box without getting anything else from the network
2008-11-22T02:12:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	yes
2008-11-22T02:13:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	no, no sorry
2008-11-22T02:13:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	i do not need to connect a certain dir
2008-11-22T02:13:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 so you want the opposite of that?
2008-11-22T02:13:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	only an outgoing over internet :(
2008-11-22T02:14:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 ok - so I still think that bridging would be your better option - unless you explicitely need that windows box to have an IP address on the network - or for that windows box to host a website of its own
2008-11-22T02:16:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	question: with bridging option i will give an IP address to the win machine or not?
2008-11-22T02:17:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 not quite sure how it behaves - but it will definitely get an IP address - whether that will be shared with the linux box I don't know
2008-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	my real problem is that i do not receive my IP accres throw dhclient, and my fastweb router give me only one IP address...so...
2008-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	... i will try with bridging
2008-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 I think from what you say bridging will work just fine for you :)
2008-11-22T02:19:00.000Z	franko	elliotjhug	thanks for advice... i will try soon
2008-11-22T02:19:00.000Z	elliotjhug	franko	 not a problem
