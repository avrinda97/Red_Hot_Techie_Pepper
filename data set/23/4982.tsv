2007-04-13T10:21:00.000Z	shinichizio		I keep asking this and I always find some way around it. But eventually I'll need to so; how do I add repositories for downloading things?
2007-04-13T10:23:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	its in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-04-13T10:24:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	Thanks muchly. But something I'm not sure about; is it better to add something to a repository and apt-get it than compile a tarball? Or can you not just apt-get everything?
2007-04-13T10:25:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	its better to use apt
2007-04-13T10:25:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	that way ouo get all the dependencies and youo can also removoe it when i need to
2007-04-13T10:25:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	Okay, thanks.
2007-04-13T10:27:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	remember to do apt-get update after you edit sources.list      and always backup everything in /etc that you edit
2007-04-13T10:27:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	Okay. Thank you. Now, as far as adding things from specific pages, do I just throw the URL in the list?
2007-04-13T10:29:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	the web page will provide youo with their debian source url ( starts with "deb " )
2007-04-13T10:29:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	Er. Where would that be exactly?
2007-04-13T10:30:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	: what are you trying to add to your apt
2007-04-13T10:30:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	A game. (Insert dramatic music, thunder) It's Gearhead Arena.
2007-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	they dont offer an official debian package - you'll have to install from the tar file or find a debian package from somewhere on the interweb
2007-04-13T10:34:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	D: Bawh. Well. I don't think they'll have a debian package anywhere, but thanks for the help. So it's not ALWAYS possible to add something via apt-get then.
2007-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	gearhead is in the ubuntu repositories - is that different than gearhead arena ?
2007-04-13T10:36:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	Maybe. o_o; How do I apt-get that?
2007-04-13T10:36:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	- apt uses dkpg which is deb.  tar.gz is just a generic pre-compiled binary or source for any linux distrobution
2007-04-13T10:37:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	sudo apt-get install gearhead
2007-04-13T10:37:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	: did you enable all the ubuntu repositories in synaptic?
2007-04-13T10:38:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	I have no idea. How do I do that? And can I check to see what this 'gearhead' is before I download it?
2007-04-13T10:39:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	apt-cache search gearhead
2007-04-13T10:39:00.000Z	TaJMoX	shinichizio	or go into synaptic and search for it
2007-04-13T10:40:00.000Z	shinichizio	TaJMoX	I didn't find it in synaptic. How do I enable everything? Sorry to ask all these dumb questions
