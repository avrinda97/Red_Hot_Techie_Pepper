2010-02-10T23:14:00.000Z	zilkomaa		Is there a way to make more space available for root ?
2010-02-10T23:16:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 yes there is , There are tools for changing partion sizes ,  But the all recomend a backup before
2010-02-10T23:17:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	yeah, but the problem is that i have only 50gig partition for linux.
2010-02-10T23:18:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	but i have available ntfs partitions that i could format ext4...
2010-02-10T23:20:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	I mayed my installation simpel one /boot 3 G one /swap,   Then one big root for the rest
2010-02-10T23:21:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	yea u made it simple
2010-02-10T23:22:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	you can use lvm2 partion then it is more esay too later mess around, but lvm2 do take a lot of space also
2010-02-10T23:23:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	Is it good program?
2010-02-10T23:24:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	lvm2 is interesting ,  you can do a lot like taking a backup and resize partion even if it is mounted and in use
2010-02-10T23:25:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	but relly not needid just for a desktop user
2010-02-10T23:27:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 did you run out of space for root ? even if it was around 50G
2010-02-10T23:43:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	I did a mistake with installing linux only gave 10gigs for root
2010-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	And for /home directory i gave 30gigs
2010-02-10T23:45:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	And i just checked it wasnt 50gigs it is 42gigs to whole ubuntu. i thought i dont need more than that..
2010-02-10T23:50:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	Hope you can fix it,  I guess the simpel way is to buy a new disk
2010-02-10T23:51:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	i have ntfs partition in this same disk just have to resize it and format one partition to ext4 thats it
2010-02-10T23:54:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	will you make this ntfs partion your new root ?
2010-02-10T23:58:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	damn good point didnt think about that..is there anyway to add more root disk space, or is it hard to make new root from ntfs space that i have for this disk space problem?
2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 I think it will work did it on a gentoo system before. Then I copyed the data in root to then new system and made some changes in grub
2010-02-11T00:04:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 If u do this root copying --one-file-system is a god option
2010-02-11T00:08:00.000Z	zilkomaa	capron	OK.
2010-02-11T00:11:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 No  a swap is kind of allways recommended ,  But not if you have a SDD
2010-02-11T00:14:00.000Z	capron	zilkomaa	 It is good then it can hibrate ,  If you have two disk you can make a swap on both and linux will kind of raid this swap
