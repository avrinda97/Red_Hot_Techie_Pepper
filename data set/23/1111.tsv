2010-09-12T21:10:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	thank you! it is exactly what I was looking for :D
2010-09-12T21:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	ffmpeg is great for converting video
2010-09-12T21:12:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I am trying to convert audio. I got my old itunes library in m4a and want to put it on my new mp3 player, therefore i need it in mp3...
2010-09-12T21:12:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	or do you have an other suggestion for this? (I was using super converter on windows before=
2010-09-12T21:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	for pure audio conversion , I use soundkonverter
2010-09-12T21:14:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	or soundconverter as suggested by erUSUL
2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I ll give it a try
2010-09-12T21:21:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I tried soundconverter (soundkonverter doesn t seem to be in the repository) and it seems it can t convert into mp3.
2010-09-12T21:22:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	what codec are you converting ?
2010-09-12T21:22:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	m4a
2010-09-12T21:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	m4a is listed as convertable in my version of soundkonverter. Open your package manager/software sources, enable all canonical partners and other software sources, then look for soundkonverter
2010-09-12T21:50:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I am now using soundkonverter but I need the mp3
2010-09-12T21:51:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	never mind I didn t see the link suggestions
2010-09-12T21:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	open soundkonverter , output format
2010-09-12T21:52:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I only got ogg mpc spx for the moment
2010-09-12T21:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	have you installed ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2010-09-12T21:54:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I don t think so. What is it?
2010-09-12T21:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	it contains most codecs required for converting your audio
2010-09-12T21:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	reboot after installing and soundkonverter should find the codecs
2010-09-12T21:56:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	i am downloading them right now. I ll do so and get back to you if there are more questions out in the open. thank you for your help so far!
2010-09-12T23:27:00.000Z	ChesterX	BluesKaj	I finally got it working thank you. For further problems: You have to reinstall the converter (doesn t mather if SoundKonverter or Sound Converter) so that he takes the ubuntu-restricted-extras into account. Thank again for the valuable help!
2010-09-12T23:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChesterX	glad to hear it :)
