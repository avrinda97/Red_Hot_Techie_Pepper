2011-02-10T22:41:00.000Z	kwtm		Why does it keep saying that "linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic" have been kept back, *every time* I do sudo apt-get [update and then] upgrade?
2011-02-10T22:41:00.000Z	kwtm		Is there some setting I've accidentally done that says "don't update these"?

2011-02-10T22:50:00.000Z	kwtm	Cpt_Zyph	I have been googling for the past few weeks, so your help would be appreciated in sifting out which answers are valid and which are not.  For example, your link was from 2007 --I wasn't sure that was valid now.  If you say it is, then I believe you.  Of course, it always helps to know the answer already.

2011-02-10T22:54:00.000Z	kwtm	Cpt_Zyph	Do I understand correctly, then, that packages "held back" are NOT due to some setting that I made?
