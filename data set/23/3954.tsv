2007-12-31T04:15:00.000Z	K_Dallas		Q: I have connected D-Link DIR-615 to my network (home) and have managed to make it work under Windows.  Now, I am on my Ubuntu7.10 and am wondering how I have to procede to have connection in there too. Thanks (The security is set as WPA if it matters)
2007-12-31T04:17:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	I'm trying to walk Rem through the same thing, he seems to have disappeared though...
2007-12-31T04:21:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	I'll wait till Rem comes back but couyld you plz let me know when you start explaining, thanks
2007-12-31T04:24:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	I was heading to the shower in a couple of mins. But I can help you first since Rem doesn't seem to be back yet.
2007-12-31T04:25:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	thanks. i have a dsl connection and a d-link router working fine under windows.
2007-12-31T04:26:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	pppoe yes
2007-12-31T04:26:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	and just eth0
2007-12-31T04:27:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	i forgot, it is a toshiba satellite laptop
2007-12-31T04:27:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	I meant on the LAN side, you're runninga a dhcp server on the router which gives you an ip automatically in Windows?
2007-12-31T04:27:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	i have dynamics IP
2007-12-31T04:28:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	ok, then it should be pretty easy. Do you have a network icon in the sys tray? Then we can go through the GUI.
2007-12-31T04:29:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	yes i have and i even tried to set up the wirelss connection manually
2007-12-31T04:30:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	ok. Automatic settings (roaming) should work since you've got a dhcp server in the router. What ip do you get on eth0?
2007-12-31T04:32:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	i tried roaming mode which didnt work but where do i see my eth0 ip (I have 192.168.0.1 which is the usual router)
2007-12-31T04:34:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	when using roaming mode, which ip did you get? Which ip-range is the router set to hand out?
2007-12-31T04:36:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	if i read it correctly: 192.168.0.196 to 199
2007-12-31T04:36:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	ok. Did you get one of those or something else in roaming?
2007-12-31T04:44:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	I am connected now, roaming did the trick, thanks a lot
2007-12-31T04:45:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	nice! Glad I could help. =) What was the problem?
2007-12-31T04:45:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	would you by any chance if net2go.com is safe enough to share files
2007-12-31T04:45:00.000Z	K_Dallas	TwoD_	i am not sure but i did the microsoft thing, rebooted ;)
2007-12-31T04:45:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	no idea sorry.
2007-12-31T04:45:00.000Z	TwoD_	K_Dallas	aha =D
