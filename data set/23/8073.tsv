2005-04-11T08:50:00.000Z	prego	agab	nice printer ;-) to whom you want to share it ?? windows? linux?
2005-04-11T08:52:00.000Z	agab		could anyone explain me how to share a printer in ubuntu? i am using cups
2005-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	prego	agab	but to also linux machines??
2005-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	agab		yes all the machines are linux
2005-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	agab		fedora
2005-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	agab		ok
2005-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	agab		i changed listen to port 631
2005-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	prego	agab	it is useful to point a web browser to the_host:631 from clients to see if it is working
2005-04-11T08:55:00.000Z	agab	Xappe	the page said that i have no permissions
2005-04-11T08:56:00.000Z	agab		when i try http://192.168.25.85:631/
2005-04-11T08:56:00.000Z	agab		yes
2005-04-11T08:56:00.000Z	agab		from the remote machine
2005-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	agab		when i try http://192.168.25.85:631/ from the local it appears the cups page correctly
2005-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	prego	agab	then you have to modify correctly the cupsd.conf since it is not accepting foreign requests.
2005-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	agab		please Xappe, i will be waiting your help
2005-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	prego	agab	make sure you are not using a firewall, also
2005-04-11T08:58:00.000Z	prego	agab	in such case, enable the 631 port....
2005-04-11T08:58:00.000Z	agab		i just installed ubuntu, how could disable the firewall in an ubuntu fresh installation?
2005-04-11T09:00:00.000Z	agab		in cupsd.conf i should put the line: Allow from 192.168.25.* for my network?
2005-04-11T09:02:00.000Z	agab		are there that label inside the cupsd.conf file?
2005-04-11T09:02:00.000Z	agab		ok, i am going to test it
2005-04-11T09:02:00.000Z	prego	agab	no firewal in ubuntu by default. Unless you have installed firestarter which I guess you have not
