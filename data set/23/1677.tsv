2010-06-20T00:29:00.000Z	howlymowly		hi guys.. i got a REAL big problem...  zattoo seems not to work anymore on my computer, because I have the wrong version of flash player installed (I am on ubuntu 10.04 64 bit)  what can i do now :)?
2010-06-20T00:30:00.000Z	howlymowly		because it seems ubuntu 64 bit doesn not support that version of flash player
2010-06-20T00:32:00.000Z	howlymowly		jesus... I am on a real hurry...  because denmark is playing on the worldcup rght now :D I need that flash player ^^
2010-06-20T00:32:00.000Z	howlymowly		Ã¤hh i mean.. the "flashplugin-installer" package
2010-06-20T00:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	If you give a link to the site that you want to work with (if it's available in the U.S.) Then I can try to help you with instructions that I can confirm work.
2010-06-20T00:34:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	www.zattoo.com
2010-06-20T00:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	I was afraid of that "You seem to be accessing the Zattoo website from a country we do not yet serve."
2010-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	But it appears they have a download link for their own "player" for linux.
2010-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	yeah..  I installed that player.. but it relies on flashplayer, too :)
2010-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	Do you get an error when installing the .deb file, or when running the application?
2010-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	I installed it with -force--architecture...  it works..  the application also works..  just when starting tv i get the error
2010-06-20T00:46:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	hmm.  the ActionParsnip left...  i just realies.. when installing the lfashplugin64-installer, it downloads flash version 10.0.45.2 ...  instead of 10.1
2010-06-20T00:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	How long untill the game that you want to watch starts?
2010-06-20T00:47:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	its already running ! :D
2010-06-20T00:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	Do you have a 32 bit Ubuntu LiveCD?
2010-06-20T00:48:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	maybe that's an idea... i could try that that out...
2010-06-20T00:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	I could walk you through creating a full 32 bit chroot for a more permanent solution, but since time is of the essence :)
2010-06-20T01:20:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	i solved the problem..  it had nothing to do with flashplay, in the end..  I got redirected to another site on yahoo  withthe error message.. but after I restarted my router  everything worked...  i was alarmed, when trying to watch the game on other computers in our house :)
2010-06-20T01:21:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	any idea, how a router could jsut redirect you to another part of hthe webpage???
2010-06-20T01:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	If you restarted your modem as well, it may have changed your external IP address (which the site uses to determine that you're in an allowed country)
2010-06-20T01:22:00.000Z	howlymowly	Jordan_U	that could be...
2010-06-20T01:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	howlymowly	Maybe your router doesn't like vuvuzelas?
