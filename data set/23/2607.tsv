2010-06-25T02:04:00.000Z	technobowl		Ubuntu LAMPP etc/host
2010-06-25T02:04:00.000Z	technobowl		trying to put the server on-line
2010-06-25T02:04:00.000Z	technobowl		having a difficult time
2010-06-25T02:05:00.000Z	technobowl		I already edited the script in the root
2010-06-25T02:05:00.000Z	technobowl		there is no error, everything has been installed
2010-06-25T02:06:00.000Z	technobowl		I just can't put it online
2010-06-25T02:06:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	what are you trying? what are you error messages?
2010-06-25T02:07:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	first things first, is your webserver (apache) running?
2010-06-25T02:08:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	can you ping localhost?
2010-06-25T02:08:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	what happens if you open browser at http://localhost ?
2010-06-25T02:09:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	so there's no index.html in the DocumentRoot? or index.php
2010-06-25T02:11:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	yeah, and what happens when you go to http://localhost/wordpress, or where ever it is installed?
2010-06-25T02:12:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	wait, your Wordpress is NOT on localhost?
2010-06-25T02:13:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	ow wait, when you browse to localhost/wordpress, you get the contents of the index.php ?
2010-06-25T02:14:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	php mod probably not active
2010-06-25T02:14:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	so, that is NOT the problem??
2010-06-25T02:16:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	I misunderstood
2010-06-25T02:16:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	You registered a domain name?
2010-06-25T02:17:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	then how would people access your machine by name?
2010-06-25T02:17:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	sure, if you want it to be accessible from internet, then you have to buy/register domainname
2010-06-25T02:19:00.000Z	oCean_	technobowl	well, it's kind of offtopic for this channel, since your issue is not ubuntu-related. You're welcome to join #ubuntu-offtopic and ask there for further information
