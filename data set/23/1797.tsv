2010-08-10T00:24:00.000Z	almoxarife		is it possible to install 64bit ubuntu on a 32bit machine?
2010-08-10T00:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	grep --color ' lm ' /proc/cpuinfo
2010-10-12T02:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	for f in source_dir/*; do cp "$f" dest_dir/"$f".mp4; done
2010-10-12T02:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	use cron for setting up the periods/time the script will run. how would you get the file type? or is known in advance?
2010-10-12T02:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	the file exists in the original folder without extension
2010-10-12T02:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	and what extension do you have to add?
2010-10-12T02:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	the type is h.234/mp4 so I assume .mp4 is safe/>?
2010-10-12T02:06:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	awesome :) , thanks , I think I will decipher that string to learn something
2010-10-12T02:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	the 'f' is a specific file name?
2010-10-12T02:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	yes f gets set to each filename in the source_dir in tourn
2010-10-12T02:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	yes f gets set to each filename in the source_dir in turn
2010-10-12T02:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	any file in the original dir = f  ??
2010-10-12T02:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	in each iteration of the loop f is a filename
2010-10-12T02:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	got it, so if I want it to chose only one particular file type, in this case mp4's I need to set that up prior to the 'cp $f' stament?
2010-10-12T02:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	you said original files have no extension.
2010-10-12T02:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	true, but I can see the file type in nautilus
2010-10-12T02:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	the shell can not tell you will have to do a more complex script using "file" to check each file
2011-01-10T17:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	one file per line?
2011-01-10T17:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	yes
2011-01-10T17:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	while IFS= read -r file; do rm -- "$file" ; done < file
2011-01-10T17:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	do I change 'file' to my actual file name? and in both instances as shown?
2011-01-10T17:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	almoxarife	no only the last one is the name of the file with the filenmaes within
2011-01-10T17:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	erUSUL	thnks
