2005-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	IcedKiwi		ok
2005-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	A bit...
2005-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	python is nice.
2005-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	"the python thing"?
2005-03-31T10:08:00.000Z	IcedKiwi	WW	the installer thing for the compiler, i think
2005-03-31T10:08:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	One nice thing about python is you can run python, and experiment with commands.
2005-03-31T10:09:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	You are running ubuntu, right?  What "installer thing for the compiler" would you need for python?
2005-03-31T10:10:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	Ah, I see.  What are you running on?
2005-03-31T10:13:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	The more I think about it, the more sense python makes... try to get it to work!
2005-03-31T10:13:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	And if anyone says you should learn Perl first, run away.
2005-03-31T10:25:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	Does the Ubuntu LiveCD work on your computer?  If so, you could use that to start experimenting with python.
2005-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	OK, use python in ubuntu.  You don't need the internet while you are programming (although it can be nice when you want to google or get some help).
2005-03-31T10:34:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	By the way, Ubuntu comes with a Python book: /usr/share/doc/diveintopython/html/index.html
2005-03-31T10:35:00.000Z	WW	IcedKiwi	Assuming your computer is set up to boot from the CD, you just put the Live CD in the drive and reboot.
