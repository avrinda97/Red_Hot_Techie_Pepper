2006-01-24T12:10:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	also to get started?
2006-01-24T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 works fine for me.
2006-01-24T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 i had to fix a 'font fixed' issue.
2006-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	yes, but I'm not a very advanced user
2006-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	for instance, how do I check for the IP of an Ubuntu system?
2006-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 ifconfig command :P
2006-01-24T12:12:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	ok, that's cool
2006-01-24T12:12:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	i just type the IP of the host in the tiny little box and press enter?
2006-01-24T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		normally ip:desktop
2006-01-24T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		ie: 192.168.1.100:1
2006-01-24T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 or it may even take its name. if your dns/hosts stuff is set right.
2006-01-24T12:13:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	and if no host is found, no message is given?
2006-01-24T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 it normally pops up some message.
2006-01-24T12:14:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	hmmm, it doesn't for me
2006-01-24T12:14:00.000Z	dwerf		could it take a while?
2006-01-24T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 on a home lan - its just a moment or 2. could be some sort of firewall/port blocking going on. You DO have a vncserver running on the remote box?
2006-01-24T12:16:00.000Z	dwerf	Dr_Willis	well the remote host had ticked the proper boxes under System > Preferences > Remote Desktop
2006-01-24T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 i NEVER use that feature. :P  i ssh to the remote and manually run vncserver.
2006-01-24T12:17:00.000Z	dwerf		yes but the guy on the other side is a nOOb
2006-01-24T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 it may be poping up a message box on the remote saying "do you want to allow XXX to connect"  ect.. never tried it.
2006-01-24T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwerf	 or there may be somthing else that needs to be done. (i dont use that feature, so i cant tell you any more)
