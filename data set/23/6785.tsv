2007-01-20T15:53:00.000Z	gabaryah		ok 2nd question i have to run beryl through start up by selecting XGL can i use beryl on KDE
2007-01-20T15:54:00.000Z	gabaryah		ok so i switch to kde than run beryl-manager
2007-01-20T15:55:00.000Z	gabaryah		than it will work?
2007-01-20T15:55:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	yep
2007-01-20T15:59:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	right-click on beryl-manager and see if its selected the right window manager...
2007-01-20T16:00:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	um, type 'beryl' in a shell and see what error you get
2007-01-20T16:02:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	um, are you using Xgl or AIGLX?
2007-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	but are you still in xgl?
2007-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	is KDE running in xgl? or just regular X?
2007-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	um, well seems likely it's not... are you using nvidia binary drivers on X?
2007-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	ah perfect... what model?
2007-01-20T16:07:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	um did you install fglrx?
2007-01-20T16:09:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	crud... well, basically, it works like this: fglrx won't let you work with AIGLX, only with Xgl - so you have to downgrade to normal mesa libs and use the open-source 'radeon' driver
2007-01-20T16:09:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	when you do that, AIGLX will work, and beryl will work seamlessly...
2007-01-20T16:10:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	but you have to get rid of fglrx completely
2007-01-20T16:10:00.000Z	graft	gabaryah	okay, so you have two options: get AIGLX working on X, or configure KDE to launch Xgl instead of X
