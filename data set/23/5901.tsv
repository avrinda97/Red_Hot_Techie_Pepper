2006-08-07T05:59:00.000Z	lkasjf		heya, I am trying to setup my wireless inet connection but I can't seem to get my WPA key working when I use iwconfig.... I have been trying to use "iwconfig eth1 essid wrieless_3 key s:haha" what's wrong?
2006-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	lkasjf		(my WPA key is 'haha')
2006-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	Did you install wpasupplicant?
2006-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	lkasjf		ah no
2006-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	lkasjf		yes sorry
2006-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	lkasjf		it is there
2006-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	Hrm, not sure then...can you connect to open wireless points?
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	lkasjf		hrmm
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	lkasjf		no I can't
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	I had wireless issues (broadcom chipset sucks) and had to go through hoops to get it to work
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	lkasjf		hrmm
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	lkasjf		well
2006-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	lkasjf		I jsut found out about wpasupplicant
2006-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	Are you using gnome?  I installed the networkmanager and that helped
2006-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	If you have a broadcom chipset... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear
2006-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	that worked for me
2006-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	lkasjf	Aberrant22	what did?
2006-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	lkasjf		I need WPA support :/
2006-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	That tutorial worked...though I had to remove my interfaces (except lo) from /etc/network/interfaces
2006-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	lkasjf		well
2006-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	lkasjf		I can connect without a WPA key
2006-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	lkasjf		but when I have a WPA key I can't connect
2006-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	Aberrant22	lkasjf	mmm, sorry, just know the basics....I use network-manager to connect to everything
