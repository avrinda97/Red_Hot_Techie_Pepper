2004-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	thanks
2005-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	need the output of the following on pastebin.com: lsmod, lspci -v, cat /proc/asound/cards, amixer
2005-04-25T06:35:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	isapnp cs4235 codec:ws/sb driver ad1848  (it is not pci)  mods are cs4232 ad1848 sound and soundcore
2005-04-25T06:36:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	so you're using the oss/free driver
2005-04-25T06:36:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	I'm only familiar with the alsa ones, which are snd-cs4236 (preferred) and snd-cs4232
2005-04-25T06:39:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	those are the ones knoppix uses.  it is strange that ubuntu does not look at dmesg to get this info
2005-04-25T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	that's because that's a nasty method of pulling information
2005-04-25T06:42:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	going to reboot to clear all the modprobes i have been doing
2005-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	where did you want me to paste output?
2005-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	pastebin.com
2005-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	here is lsmod http://pastebin.com/270993
2005-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	what other info did you want to see?
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	lspnp -v
2005-04-25T06:57:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	look like i do not have lspnp.  how can i get it?
2005-04-25T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	you need to install pcmcia-cs
2005-04-25T07:01:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	k
2005-04-25T07:15:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	lspnp -v gets:  lspnp: /proc/bus/pnp not available
2006-11-24T09:50:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	two. have one on board, but added a pci for performance issues
2006-11-24T09:57:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	 only thing i get is from asoundconf list : AudioPCI
2006-11-24T09:58:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	ensoniq?
2006-11-24T10:01:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	where do i mute External Amplifier at?
2006-11-24T10:11:00.000Z	gpled	crimsun	so it seams the the trouble is in not knowing which sound card should be in use?
2006-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	crimsun	gpled	use one of the backports if you're on ia32
