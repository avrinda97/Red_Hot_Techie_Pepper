2007-03-08T07:37:00.000Z	jaycie		i will be glad to buy an internal card if that simplifies things
2007-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	Selaiah	jaycie	I bought a WRT54GL router and flashe dit with a special firmware. Its now working as a wireless bridge with my main router. TO go on online now all i have to do is plug in my comp with an ethernet cable to router2 :D
2007-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	Selaiah		Thats how i circumvent ALL the linux wlan troubles, ive had before with internal cards.
2007-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	Selaiah		:D
2007-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	Selaiah		dd-wrt
2007-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	jaycie		i can't plug in.. i have to use wireless and i talked to linksys and they don't support any cards i think
2007-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	Selaiah		Why do you HAVE to us ewireless Jaycie?
2007-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	Selaiah		ive read good results from ppl with netgear WPN111 or something
2007-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	jaycie	Selaiah	router is upstairs and this ubuntu pc will be downstairs
2007-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	Selaiah		yes Jaycie thats why i suggested buying a 2nd router ;P read again please
2007-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	jaycie		2nd router?
2007-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	Selaiah		you basicly connect both routers wirelessly, and put the 2nd next to your comp.
2007-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	jaycie		hm
2007-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	Selaiah		then you connect ur pc with ethernet to the 2nd router
2007-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	Selaiah		that way you have to make NO setup at all.
2007-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	jaycie		yes plz do erstazi
2007-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	jaycie		i hate to buy another router.. linux does not make it so simple for newbies lol
2007-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	Selaiah		buying a new router is not significiently more epxneisve than buying a proper wlan card tho Jaycie :D
2007-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	Selaiah		the Wlan card that I read the most positive results about in regards to compatibility was 45 euro here in germany. The Router thats flashable with flexible linux Firmware was 60 euro :P
2007-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	Selaiah	jaycie	And just remember. once its running its running. Mac OS, Windows, Linux, new kernal reinstall.. its all running, you never have to install wpa supplicant or enter any passwords again or worry about drivers. All you need is onboard ethernet. :D
