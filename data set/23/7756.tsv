2005-05-07T13:35:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	after apt-get update of course
2005-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	which one? you don't go anywhere, you just run it, the command should be in your path
2005-05-07T13:39:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	pygames has several programs, none of them called pygames
2005-05-07T13:39:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	try something like "pysol"
2005-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	might be wrong, it's been years since i've tried the pygames games
2005-05-07T15:45:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	why?
2005-05-07T15:46:00.000Z	Thorrn4	topyli	nvm them, I dont need it; sorry 2 waste ur time
2005-05-07T15:46:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	you could have had a reason, then i'd waste time to tell you how to do it :)
2005-05-07T15:48:00.000Z	Thorrn4	topyli	on 2nd thought, can u tell me?
2005-05-07T15:48:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	first, why?
2005-05-07T15:49:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	i don't have root on any box. you need a reason
2005-05-07T15:50:00.000Z	Thorrn4	topyli	I want to add a file to the...bin folder for example, it will not allow me; I want to add a theme to the usr/share/theme folder, but I cannot
2005-05-07T15:51:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	say, you want to do "foo". now you do "sudo foo". it will ask for your own password and complete the command
2005-05-07T15:54:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	what i mean is, use sudo so you don't have to use root
2005-05-07T15:55:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	let me find you an useful link, hold on
2005-05-07T15:57:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	here's a nice lecture for you :)

2005-05-07T15:59:00.000Z	topyli	Thorrn4	it's not really something you have to read through. just enough to see why ubuntu has no root
