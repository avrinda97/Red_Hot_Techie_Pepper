2007-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	smbfs itself has limits that I found out about the hard way (like 2gb file size limits)
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	we already covered the fact that there may be girls in here...  but then there may not be... hard to say
2007-05-28T08:36:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	i suggest using the cifs file system in your mount command... you will need samba installed
2007-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	CIFS is the common internet file system format, which is basically super-Server-Message-Block filesystem
2007-05-28T08:38:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	cool.  Now get someone to help me with my lack of audio and we'll be even!

2007-05-28T08:38:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	you know about alsa schtuff?
2007-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	mojo	Ericc	oh, i see... yeah, if you want... though it is possible someone else may benefit from infos on mounting windows network shares
