2011-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	Datz	maco	I believe they are only held on ubuntu brainstorm for amonth

2011-02-23T02:30:00.000Z	Datz	maco	humm, well this one idea disappeared, not sure where it went
2011-02-23T02:30:00.000Z	Datz	maco	maybe it was implemented
2011-02-23T02:30:00.000Z	maco	Datz	did you try teh search? the "popular" tab just shows what's been popular for the month
2011-02-23T02:31:00.000Z	Datz	maco	yea, I tried
2011-02-23T02:32:00.000Z	Datz	maco	I bet it was implemented. there are no ideas in that section
2011-02-23T02:34:00.000Z	Datz	maco	I guess I'll find out in 11.04
