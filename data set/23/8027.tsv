2006-01-23T17:49:00.000Z	null		it asks for the root password but entering the _user_  password works
2006-01-23T17:49:00.000Z	null		dunno why it says 'enter root password' then!!
2006-01-23T17:50:00.000Z	null		err.. i know about sudo and i just changed the root pwd too..
2006-01-23T17:50:00.000Z	null		anyway, it clearly says 'enter root password' and bails when the root pwd is put
2006-01-23T17:51:00.000Z	null		which is why i first asked whats the default root passwd when i came here!
2006-01-23T17:51:00.000Z	null		nope
2006-01-23T17:52:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	are you sure it asks for the root password, not your password?
2006-01-23T17:54:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	ok. good
2006-01-23T06:17:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	you can install KDE by installing the 'kubuntu-desktop' package. it should be in main
2006-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	will i get kde 3.5 ?
2006-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	you won't need to add any repositories
2006-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	and the version you get depends on which ubuntu release you're using
2006-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	breezy
2006-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	so i don;t need to add any repo and can just install kbuntu-desktop
2006-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	if you want to check the details, go to packages.ubuntu.com
2006-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	if you spell it right, yes ;-)
2006-01-23T06:21:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	lol.. :)
2006-01-23T06:24:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-35.php   <-- sya si need to add to sources list
2006-01-23T06:25:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	that's to get v3.5, because it's not breezy's default version
2006-01-23T06:25:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	ah ok..
2006-01-23T06:26:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	so if i add this source to my sources list, how will synaptic know to get the new version of kubuntu-desktop instead of the older version from main ?
2006-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	hyphenated	null	tar can be used for lots of things
2006-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	null	hyphenated	but i have never known tar to use for copying and use the later copy as a replacement!
