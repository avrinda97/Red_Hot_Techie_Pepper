2012-09-03T22:13:00.000Z	emph		Can anybody help me? How come my movie freezes while I'm watching it? This didn't happen to me in Windows, so it's not my computer's fault
2012-09-03T22:13:00.000Z	aaas	emph	just the movie or the computer?  have you tried different players?
2012-09-03T22:15:00.000Z	emph	aaas	just the movie, I tried VLC
2012-09-03T22:15:00.000Z	aaas	emph	try playing from command line with mplayer/ffmpeg , maybe it will throw an error?
2012-09-03T22:16:00.000Z	emph	aaas	what exactly am I supposed to write in the terminal, before that? gksudo?
2012-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	aaas	emph	depending on your proficiency..navigate to the directory with the movie file and try 'mplayer <name of movie>' or 'ffmpeg <name of movie>'
2012-09-03T22:18:00.000Z	emph	aaas	To be honest, I have no idea how to do that, I'm a newbie using Linux
2012-09-03T22:19:00.000Z	aaas	emph	well just try different players first you should have several listed in the menu
