2009-06-06T02:28:00.000Z	buttons840		concerning ssh, what is x11 forwarding, and why is it suggested that i disable it?
2009-06-06T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	with X forwarding you can start an X prog on the remote machine and have it display on your local machine, as for the suggestion to turn it off: I (nearly) alays turn off thing I don't need
2009-06-06T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	it is, try for instance ssh -X into a remote machine and the start xeyes on the remote machine :-))
2009-06-06T02:34:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	i can't do that because i don't have x11 installed on the server, am i right?
2009-06-06T02:35:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	I'm not sure about the dependencies, but you can start a graphical program that way, even if there is no X on the server
2009-06-06T02:36:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	lets say i wanted to use gedit with x11 forwarding, what command would i use?
2009-06-06T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	*if* you had gedit installed on the remote machine, you would 1) ssh -X user@remote, 2) gedit &, and wait for the editor to appear on your screen
2009-10-14T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	you should have told us about screen, there the scrolling is done differently
2009-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	ok, i'm using screen, how can i scroll and select many lines to copy/paste?   (i prefer not to install a new app like pastebin it just to paste a few lines)
2009-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	its called "copy mode" and reached with ctrl+a <esc>
2009-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	thanks
2009-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	you are welcome :-)
2009-10-14T01:31:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	how does it work, it still doesn't scrol
2009-10-14T01:31:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	 let me check my screen version
2009-10-14T01:32:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	cursor keys up/dn
2009-10-14T01:33:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	i suppose i can also just pipe the app into a file?     asterisk -r > txtfile.txt  ?
2009-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	yes, but what about screen?
2009-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	yes, with ctrl a esc i can move the cursor up, but i cannot select many lines at once
2009-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	use the mouse?
2009-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	i mean i start to drag my mouse selection towards the top of the screen, and it just stops instead of scrolling, i can't mouse select anything outside the visable screen
2009-10-14T01:36:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	I didn't need it - but have a look at man screen :)
2009-10-14T01:37:00.000Z	guntbert	buttons840	use <space> to start marking, and then move and then <space> again
2009-10-14T01:46:00.000Z	buttons840	guntbert	sorry to bother you again, but i can select the lines i need, but then i right click on the terminal and the copy option is greyed out, how do i get it to my clipboard?
