2010-05-09T13:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 use the wine ppa repos  or repos from winehq
2010-05-09T13:29:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 Ohh, i don't really understand that, I'm a beginner.

2010-05-09T13:35:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 thank you
2010-05-09T13:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 or via command line --> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
2010-05-09T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 thats how it works on myu netbook and  other laptops
2010-05-09T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 its a feature of X and the video drivers.
2010-05-09T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 'xinerama' lets you have one big wide display. or you could setup as 2 independant displays
2010-05-09T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 depends on yoru video card/chipset to some degree
2010-05-09T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 i just used the  system > settings > monitors tool to set mine up
2010-05-09T13:57:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 but if i plug the 2nd monitor will the program....system > settings>monitors tool notice that?
2010-05-09T13:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 try it and find out. on my laptop. I think i had to restart X the first time i pluged it in.
2010-05-09T13:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 also the laptop may have special FN-XXX keys to enable the externaldisplay
2010-05-09T13:58:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 And how do you restart x?
2010-05-09T13:58:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 Yes, i have one too//f1...it's a dell inspiron 1545
2010-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 I enabled the monitor but it shows me the same screen as in laptop.
2010-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 but i want to be  a different screen so I can have more space to work with
2010-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 Try the monitor settings tool now. see if you can enable xinerama
2010-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 what video card/chipset is in that thing? ati/nvidia/intel?
2010-05-09T14:03:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 ati, ati hd 4330:)
2010-05-09T14:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gentookitty	 no idea what limits are with ati. there may be an ati specific config tool
2010-05-09T14:04:00.000Z	gentookitty	Dr_Willis	 I will try and see
