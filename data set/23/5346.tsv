2006-12-27T07:28:00.000Z	trev_		does anyone know of a gui for creating virtual drives in ubuntu?
2006-12-27T07:28:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:it works fine for me
2006-12-27T07:28:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:what version of ubuntu are you running?
2006-12-27T07:28:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	for some reason, i get no sound at all - in the menu where it says Play Starcraft, there's sound, but not when you actually go into the game and play
2006-12-27T07:29:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	edgy
2006-12-27T07:29:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:and what version of wine are you using?
2006-12-27T07:29:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	0.9.27 i think or whatever latest version is
2006-12-27T07:30:00.000Z	trev_	factboy818181	i am also running 0.9.27 and it works perfectly for me except for battle.net, I have done a fair bit of research in getting starcraft to run on 6.06 before I upgraded and never once found your issue
2006-12-27T07:31:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	probably my sound card then
2006-12-27T07:31:00.000Z	trev_		let me check quick
2006-12-27T07:31:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	by the way i get - ALSA lib seq_hw.c:457:(snd_seq_hw_open) open /dev/snd/seq failed: No such file or directory when opening winecfg
2006-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:the same thing happens to me I think
2006-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	interesting, i tried disabling ESD and everything to no success... i even got bnet to work once or twice, but now it died on me.
2006-12-27T07:33:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:will it play without sound
2006-12-27T07:33:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	yep, it just doesn't feel as good though
2006-12-27T07:33:00.000Z	trev_	factboy818181	on mine it ate cpu but it ran without any lag
2006-12-27T07:34:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	wish it could work with sound though, that'd be gerat
2006-12-27T07:34:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:found something......
2006-12-27T07:34:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:check this out, mabey someone will reply to it http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=322082&highlight=starcraft
2006-12-27T07:35:00.000Z	trev_		factboy818181:in 2 weeks of troubleshooting starcraft nothing else came up
2006-12-27T07:37:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	keeps on telling me /dev/snd/seq does not exist
2006-12-27T07:38:00.000Z	trev_	factboy818181	i think the same thing is happening to me, mabey they'll know in #winehq
2006-12-27T07:39:00.000Z	factboy818181	trev_	ok, thanks
