2005-10-23T06:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	ask
2005-10-23T06:40:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	and pupil :  i ask all the time, but only get responses 20% of the time... my problem is i cannot launch any apps from the desktop which require admin passwd, they just don't start
2005-10-23T06:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	what do you mean they dont start
2005-10-23T06:42:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	and pupil: they just don't start when i go to, say, System --> Admin --> Synaptic, it doesn't start
2005-10-23T06:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	load the terminal up
2005-10-23T06:42:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 loaded
2005-10-23T06:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	type `gksudo synaptic'
2005-10-23T06:43:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 that works to launch it, but what about launching it from the system menu?
2005-10-23T06:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	so it works. hmm.
2005-10-23T06:44:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 it works fine, like i said the problem is launching from gnome menu
2005-10-23T06:46:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 are you addressing me or shedi ?
2005-10-23T06:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	oh sorry u
2005-10-23T06:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	gedit /usr/share/applications/synaptic.desktop
2005-10-23T06:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	keys and values are seperated by '='. what is the value of the 'Exec' line?
2005-10-23T06:49:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 Exec=gksudo /usr/sbin/synaptic
2005-10-23T06:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	Strange. what version of ubuntu
2005-10-23T06:49:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 i don't think this is an issue with synaptic, it is any app that needs admin password to start also has this problem
2005-10-23T06:49:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 5.1 breezy
2005-10-23T06:51:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 i.e. if i go to System --> Administration --> Networking the same problem, it just doesn't launch
2005-10-23T06:52:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 i get a notice in the application selector panel that the app is starting, and then it disappears
2005-10-23T06:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	sort of a strange probliem. i dont experience that
2005-10-23T06:52:00.000Z	shekhar	kbrooks	 any possible remedies?
2005-10-23T06:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	shekhar	None. I suggest you ask on the forums'
