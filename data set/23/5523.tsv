2007-03-07T11:49:00.000Z	owner_		is there any ubuntu release with desktop edition with lamp already installed
2007-03-07T11:49:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	not a desktop edition
2007-03-07T11:49:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	but you could do a server lamp instlal then just sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2007-03-07T11:50:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	when you try to do what?  install ubuntu-desktop on the server?
2007-03-07T11:51:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	well yeah you need to get the network working first.
2007-03-07T11:51:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	or you could add the desktop cd as a repo then instlal that way
2007-03-07T11:51:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	but you would still have no net access.
2007-03-07T11:52:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	what is it exactly you are trying to accomplish?
2007-03-07T11:52:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	well what type of card do you have?
2007-03-07T11:52:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	What type of network card that is...
2007-03-07T11:53:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	lspci | grep Ethernet
2007-03-07T11:53:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	should show you the chipset.
2007-03-07T11:54:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	well lamp is just Linux Apache Mysql and Php.  ITs not that hard to install them. on any system.
2007-03-07T11:55:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	well getting the network card working would be step one.
2007-03-07T11:55:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	then installing software would be step 2.  Because a webserver without working network is kind of pointless
2007-03-07T11:57:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	okay well then all you need to do is install apache mysql and php right?
2007-03-07T11:57:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	you should be able to find all of those in synaptic.
2007-03-07T11:58:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	your default webpage will go in /var/www
2007-03-07T11:58:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	and you can get to it by pointing your browser on that machine to 127.0.0.1
2007-03-07T11:59:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	did you install php?
2007-03-07T11:59:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	and the libmod for apache?
2007-03-07T12:01:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	then restart the apache after install php and it should work.
2007-03-07T12:01:00.000Z	h1st0	owner_	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
