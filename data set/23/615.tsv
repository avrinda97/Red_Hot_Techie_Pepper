2011-12-17T03:10:00.000Z	abu-bakr		(old drive is dying)
2011-12-17T03:12:00.000Z	abu-bakr		Raid5 anyone/
2011-12-17T03:13:00.000Z	abu-bakr		no one have experience with Raid arrays?
2011-12-17T03:14:00.000Z	abu-bakr		ok folks how do I get someones attention on that?
2011-12-17T03:15:00.000Z	abu-bakr		Ok auronandace ... thanks
2011-12-17T03:15:00.000Z	abu-bakr		:)
2011-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		Ok.. while the page loads
2011-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		does anyone know if I should copy my partition over onto one of the raid disks first
2011-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		or after creating the array
2011-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		?
2011-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	overclucker	abu-bakr	setup raid first
2011-12-17T03:17:00.000Z	abu-bakr	overclucker	thanks.. and then I can use gparted to copy the old partition over?
2011-12-17T03:18:00.000Z	abu-bakr		old part is 70gb and the raid array will be 300gb
2011-12-17T03:18:00.000Z	overclucker	abu-bakr	that may not work
2011-12-17T03:19:00.000Z	abu-bakr		or perhaps link the currently dying hard drive into the new array (4 disks total) then once synch is complete.. pull the failing disk?
2011-12-17T03:22:00.000Z	overclucker	abu-bakr	are you replacing a failing drive in a raid array?
2011-12-17T03:24:00.000Z	abu-bakr	overclucker	no.. the old drive was just on its own.. I now have 3 replacement drives so thought I would give Raid5 a shot (missing some of the speed of my ssd on the laptop :P )
2011-12-17T03:35:00.000Z	overclucker	abu-bakr	it looks like using gparted to copy the old image over should work.
2011-12-17T03:42:00.000Z	abu-bakr	overclucker	thanks.. so I will be ok copying the old partition over on to the new array once its created?
2011-12-17T03:42:00.000Z	abu-bakr		(when that does eventally happen as its failing to create at the moment ...)
2011-12-17T03:42:00.000Z	overclucker	abu-bakr	that should work. i just had to check on how raid safe gparted was.
2011-12-17T03:44:00.000Z	abu-bakr	overclucker	brilliant thanks for your help! I will give it a try and ..(probably be back asking why the raid is failing to create :P )
2011-12-17T03:46:00.000Z	abu-bakr	overclucker	this is the message i'm getting: Error starting job: Failed to execute child process "mdadm" (No such file or directory)
