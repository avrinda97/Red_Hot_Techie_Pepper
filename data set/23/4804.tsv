2007-06-14T07:37:00.000Z	Gnea	heroin	that's nice, but it's really BS.
2007-06-14T07:38:00.000Z	Gnea	heroin	linux itself *CAN* get viruses, they've been known to occur. plus, if the system itself is connected to another potential windows system, then files could pass through the linux system infected.

2007-06-14T07:42:00.000Z	heroin	Gnea	the most common way to get into a linux system is exploits for ssh vnc and crap.. whereafter bots called kaitens are installed which just open a new hidden ssh connection and mail a person the IP
