2010-06-20T05:41:00.000Z	mom		oh its #ubuntu-pt
2010-06-20T05:41:00.000Z	mom		too late oh well
2010-06-20T05:41:00.000Z	mom		i dont think there is #ubuntu-br
2010-06-20T05:43:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	u can see that it exists for yourself by typing /join #ubuntu-br
2010-06-20T05:44:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	thats just what those 51 people would like
2010-06-20T06:08:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	I'd recommend `sudo -u <other-user> zenity —question —text="Shutdown?"`, or something like that
2010-06-20T06:08:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	assuming ur sending that via ssh, or something like that
2010-06-20T06:10:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	mmm zenity is cool, that would be fun for practical jokes
2010-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	I have too much fun with it, but I have the computer with the other use running openfire (xmpp chat server) so I can just talk to them anyway
2010-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	or specify —display=:0.0
2010-06-20T08:36:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	I'd recommend "for i in `seq 1 999`; do mkdir $i; done"
2010-06-20T08:40:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	nice
2010-06-20T08:41:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	i think there is an elegant bash way to do it too
2010-06-20T08:41:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	quick and dirty shell lol
2010-06-20T08:44:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	like you would want [0-9[0-9][0-9] somehow, because your way just creates a directory 2 when you'd want it to be 002
2010-06-20T08:45:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	I guess u'd have to put in an if to add the 00 and 0 to the beg lol
2010-06-20T08:55:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	hey i got it :)
2010-06-20T08:55:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	mkdir {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}
2010-06-20T08:56:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	well, I guess that work good too lol
2010-06-20T09:13:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	i doubt even rm -rf / works
2010-06-20T09:14:00.000Z	acovrig	mom	lol, sudo mv /* /dev/null isn't good either
2010-06-20T09:14:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	but does it work? :)
2010-06-20T09:18:00.000Z	mom	acovrig	i think i tried to force kill the init process once and that didnt work :(
