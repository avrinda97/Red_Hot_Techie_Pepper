2006-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	joh6nn	arrick	well, i mean, in order to get that box connected to the internet, what hoops need to be jumped through?  you need to run any scripts or anything first?
2006-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	arrick		nope
2006-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	joh6nn		hmm
2006-04-12T07:04:00.000Z	arrick		hey what all things on that page do I need to include in the soureces list?
2006-04-12T07:04:00.000Z	joh6nn		well, that error you're getting is because by default, ubuntu tries to synch your box's clock up via ntp at boot.  apparently, on your box, this is happening before the box actually has an internet connection
2006-04-12T07:05:00.000Z	arrick		ok
2006-04-12T07:06:00.000Z	arrick		sending a dns error for syncing the clock?
2006-04-12T07:06:00.000Z	joh6nn	arrick	yep: if you haven't got a net connection, dns doesn't work nearly as well
