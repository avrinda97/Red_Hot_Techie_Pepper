2006-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	I'd be more inclined to help you without the "frakking"
2006-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	and tonyyarusso: I typed in "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" and "sudo ifconfig wifi0 down"
2006-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	and tonyyarusso: Then I typed in "ping www.google.com."
2006-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	and tonyyarusso: It doesn't ping.
2006-12-09T16:26:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	and tonyyarusso: There's an ip. It's 192.168.0.7
2006-12-09T16:26:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	you seriously need to calm down a little
2006-12-09T16:26:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	okay, you have an IP - on which interface ?
2006-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr: Okay, what do you mean by that? It's showing on my console.
2006-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	is this IP connected to the internet ? type "route -n" to see
2006-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	an interface is a network port
2006-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr: It's showing 0.0.0.0 for gateway.
2006-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	what does "route -n" show you ?
2006-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr:I just typed in "route -n"
2006-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	great - now you need to show us what the result was
2006-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr:It shows me the destination, 192.168.0.0, the gateway 0l0l0l0, and Genmask 255.255.255.0
2006-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr:No others.
2006-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	I'd get a new IP, that should also set your gateway
2006-12-09T16:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	run "sudo dhclient"
2006-12-09T16:29:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr:Okay, it's working, at least for the eth0.
2006-12-09T16:30:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	what's working ?
2006-12-09T16:30:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr: My ethernet's working.
2006-12-09T16:30:00.000Z	Emo_Samurai	nothlit	tonyyarusso adaptr: So when I take down eth0 and put up wifi0, I type "sudo dhclient?"
2006-12-09T16:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Emo_Samurai	dhclient will use your first interface by default, so that will just bring up eth0 again
