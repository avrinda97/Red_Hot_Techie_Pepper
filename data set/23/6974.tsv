2007-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	bionic_seahorse		anybody have a working dual-head setup using an ATI card?
2007-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	yeah
2007-03-20T10:14:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	sure, I'll try to help
2007-03-20T10:17:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	does this help?  aticonfig --dtop=horizontal --overlay-on=1 (Then CTL+ALT+Backspace)
2007-03-20T10:17:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	assuming you installed fglrx-control, that should work
2007-03-20T10:18:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	OK
2007-03-20T10:21:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Any luck?
2007-03-20T10:24:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Looks like /msg is disabled
2007-03-20T10:27:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Gotcha. Give me a sec
2007-03-20T10:30:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	You have fglrx-control installed, right/
2007-03-20T10:31:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	I'd do this first aticonfig --dtop=horizontal --overlay-on=1
2007-03-20T10:32:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	 aticonfig --resolution=0, (then the resolutions for the primary display comma delimited)
2007-03-20T10:32:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Now this is just a guess
2007-03-20T10:33:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	 aticonfig --resolution=1, (then the resolutions for the secondary display comma delimited)
2007-03-20T10:33:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Failing that, go into /etc/X11/xorg.conf and manually edit the resolutions ^_^
2007-03-20T10:34:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	I got lucky that the system I have the dual head on has two identical LCD's
2007-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	DRI is a bit beyond my ken
2007-03-20T10:36:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	I just pretty much do an install of the xorg-xserver-ati drivers and then fglrx-control and then run aticonfig with the changes I need to make when I set up a video card
2007-03-20T10:36:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	I gotcha. makes sense
2007-03-20T10:38:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	I've got an X1600 in this dual boot gaming rig I'm on
2007-03-20T10:38:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	ATI 9800 Pro in a little XPC hooked up to my TV
2007-03-20T10:41:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	None of those
2007-03-20T10:44:00.000Z	Wo|f	bionic_seahorse	Nice, thanks!
