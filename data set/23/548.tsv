2011-06-17T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 weechat or irssi
2011-06-17T16:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 i perfer weechat, irssi is nice also. but lacking in some ways. :)
2011-06-17T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 7 is normally for X. 1-6 are for consoles
2011-06-17T16:45:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	ya, so where do i reset unity... i cant see any bars ... cant do anything except look at my usb drive on the desktop
2011-06-17T16:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 at any console. use the proper command
2011-06-17T16:46:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	and what would be that ? unity --reset ? ive tried that...
2011-06-17T16:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 that resets the icons/launcher as far as i know..
2011-06-17T16:47:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	so can u directly tell me what i can do? cant use lynx to find solutions u know
2011-06-17T16:47:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	the best part is all users are affected
2011-06-17T16:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 use the command shown avove from a console...
2011-06-17T16:50:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	that gconf *** line followed by unity reset ? from any tty?
2011-06-17T16:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 use the command shown  from a console. yes...
2011-06-17T16:50:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	u want me to sudo that?
2011-06-17T16:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 why would you think you need sudo?
2011-06-17T16:51:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	ok i'll try that
2011-06-17T16:52:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	well i tried changing settings for one user wonder why all users have "no sidebar" problem then ?
2011-06-17T16:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 if a single user changed settings.. it should not be affecting other users.
2011-06-17T16:52:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	well thats what is supposed to happen but thats not the case here
2011-06-17T16:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 i would guess that  what you think happened - is not what really happened..   its possible some update/upgrade messed stuff up for all users.. but its hard to tell.
2011-06-17T16:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 try making a new user, see if they have the same issue.. *(what is the issue anyway)*
2011-06-17T16:55:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	u kick azz
2011-06-17T16:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	eleVen	 check the weechat docs/beginner guides.. it has some amazing features
2011-06-17T16:57:00.000Z	eleVen	dr_willis	yo... i will check it out.. thanks once again... u r the dr...
