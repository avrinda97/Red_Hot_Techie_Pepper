2006-05-03T16:09:00.000Z	SeaBrie		can I ask a [hopefully]  quick and noddy apt question?
2006-05-03T16:10:00.000Z	SeaBrie		ok, if I remove a package using aptitude purge <package> and then manually remove its config file (let's say all of /etc/samba/ for argument's sake), how do I get apt to replace that with the default files again on reinstall?
2006-05-03T16:10:00.000Z	SeaBrie		currently it just complains that /etc/samba doesn't exist
2006-05-03T16:10:00.000Z	SeaBrie		no, it doesn't :)
2006-05-03T16:10:00.000Z	SeaBrie		it deletes /etc/default/samba
2006-05-03T16:11:00.000Z	SeaBrie		(this is using dapper, btw)
2006-05-03T16:11:00.000Z	SeaBrie		(yesyes, I should've backed it up first)
2006-05-03T16:11:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	you don't need to do anything, apt, by deafalt, replaces conf files with the default
2006-05-03T16:12:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	hrm, my experience differs
2006-05-03T16:12:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	yes
2006-05-03T16:19:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	Are you sure that it's the missing conf file causing the problem
2006-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	I'm 99% sure, yes
2006-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	I trust you, but do you have anything that supports that, or are you guessing?
2006-05-03T16:21:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	I had it "working" before I nuked the package and /etc/samba
2006-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	good enough evidence. instead of using the package system's reinstall thing, how about purging it, then installing it?
2006-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	using dpkg?
2006-05-03T16:35:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	how do you do that thing in the irc room?
2006-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	you mean the "* SeaBrie does something"?
2006-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	yes
2006-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	"/me does something"
2006-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	Allan	SeaBrie	also, how do you do smilies? Like this? :)
2006-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	yes, like that
2006-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	SeaBrie	Allan	add it to /etc/modules
