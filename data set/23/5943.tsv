2009-05-21T04:34:00.000Z	Yankefish		can anybody help me restore ubuntu after editing with easybcd
2009-05-21T04:36:00.000Z	Yankefish		i installed with wubi 9.04, then i booted vista and used easybc to edit bootloader name, there was a drop box with c,e,f, and boot under it i selected boot now ubuntu dont load anymore goes to a dos like screen and says wubi
2009-05-21T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	Wubi NO!
2009-05-21T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	Wubi not recommend by many people that know Ubuntu resonably well
2009-05-21T04:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	I don't  fix weird wubi issues, because  well  weird wubi issues really are weird, and the standard stuff that applys to normal partitions, do not apply, for example being able to access the partition on a Live CD
2009-05-21T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	so  in reply to your PM,  I am not going to help you with  fixing Wubi issues,  I would just advice into not using Wubi :)  and doing partitions for real
2009-05-21T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	there is a way to access the wubi  file,  and it's files, but I don't have that link on me hummm
2009-05-21T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	if you messed up  the bootloaders  so you can't boot up  Ubuntu/Wubi
2009-05-21T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	maybe I am going to help after all a bit, but only if can find that link
2009-05-21T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	you got data on there, that you want to get hold of?
2009-05-21T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	well in that case remove wubi :)
2009-05-21T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	and do partitions for real :)
2009-05-21T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	remove Wubi :)
2009-05-21T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	you can do a proper dual boot set up, it's not that difficult
2009-05-21T04:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	maybe even get rid of Windows, or run in a virtual machine, depending on what you would be using Windows for or woudn't be using it for
2009-05-21T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	if you can access Windows,  or sort it out so you can, you can remove wubi like that
2009-05-21T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	DON'T use Wubi, use real partitions instead :)
2009-06-05T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	why triple boot those?
2009-06-05T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	you should only let Vista resize it's own partitions, and I assume this applys to Windows 7 to
2009-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	otherwise possible dataloss, also you could virtual machine Windows 7
2009-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	that Windows 7  RC come  1st March 2010 and it will start shuting itself down every 2 hours, then stop working in June
2009-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	of course by then the real Windows 7 will be out anyway
2009-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yankefish	also Windows 7 is really just Vista with some changes,   in fact it's even known as NT 6.1, where as Vista is known as NT 6.0, which confirms what I said
