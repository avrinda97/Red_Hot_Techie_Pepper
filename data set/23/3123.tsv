2009-06-10T04:35:00.000Z	sam555		can one upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04 using a 9.04 live cd?
2009-06-10T04:37:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	You can also upgrade through the internet, of course.  But the only CD method is the alternate/server CD (or DVD, although that seems like overkill)
2009-06-10T04:38:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	I'm currently upgrading via the internet, but it was taking a it bit and I have another computer to upgrade
2009-06-10T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	with a few computers on a home network, you might be better off (if one's always on, especially) setting up a cache of packages.  So you only download them from the internet once, then the other computers grab them from that computer.
2009-06-10T04:41:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	is it possible to do that right now if I've already started the process with one?
2009-06-10T04:42:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	You could stop the process.  If it's just downloading packgaes, it won't hurt anything.
2009-06-10T04:43:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	or should i download the alt cd for 8.10 and 9.04?
2009-06-10T04:43:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	currently I'm in the processes of upgrading from 8.04 to 8.10 and it's going from 1 to 10 hours as far as when it will be completed
2009-06-10T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	Actually, this howto says we can copy them to the cache after the fact.  So, I suppose you don't have to stop it at all.
2009-06-10T04:43:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	oooh, show me the link!

2009-06-10T04:45:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	It won't save you any bandwidth (it'll actually use a bit more)
2009-06-10T04:46:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	aww
2009-06-10T04:46:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	the only benefit is if you go around to multiple computers with it, and if you set up the cacher, that's moot.
2009-06-10T04:46:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	indeed
2009-06-10T04:46:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	the issue with the alternate CD (well, not an issue, just the way it works) is that it's the packages that were released with 9.04.  So all the updates afterwards still have to be downloaded.  When upgrading from the internet, you're already downloading those updates.
2009-06-10T04:47:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	i see
2009-06-10T04:47:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	Also, the alternate CD has lots of packages in its repository you may not use.  Your upgrade only may use 400MB or packages (or whatever), but it may have 100MB of stuff that isn't on the Alt CD.
2009-06-10T04:48:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	gotcha
2009-06-10T04:48:00.000Z	Flannel	sam555	So you'd still be downloading 700 + 100, instead of 300+100 (I really don't know what the numbers are)
2009-06-10T04:51:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	but i understand
2009-06-10T04:51:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	i'm gonna set up the repository
2009-06-10T05:47:00.000Z	sam555	Flannel	you there?
