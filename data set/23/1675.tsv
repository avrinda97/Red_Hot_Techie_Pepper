2009-12-01T19:41:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	run os-prober
2009-12-01T19:42:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	but you need to consult this first
2009-12-01T19:42:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	would you guide me step by step?
2009-12-01T19:42:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	follow the link referenced by ubottu
2009-12-01T19:51:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	how is it now?
2009-12-01T19:55:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	it is hard for me, but I will listen to you guys' advice to keep reading
2009-12-01T19:57:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	are you refering to this section? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover%20Grub%202%20via%20LiveCD
2009-12-01T19:59:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	do you have other pc from which you can do the chatting?
2009-12-01T19:59:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	I have 2 PCs
2009-12-01T20:01:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	can you boot off the live cd on the computer in question
2009-12-01T20:05:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	i mean, boot the computer from boot cd
2009-12-01T20:05:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	sure I can
2009-12-01T20:06:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	ok try to do it now..
2009-12-01T20:07:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	your problem is windows 7 is not on the grub menu list, righ?
2009-12-01T20:10:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	the grub2 wiki outlines how to use os-probe to probe for existing windows installation and adds it to the grub2 menu
2009-12-01T20:13:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	so, still the link you guys gave me?
2009-12-01T20:13:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	wait, after installing win 7 the grub menu has gone?
2009-12-01T20:14:00.000Z	donita_	jongbergs	so you mean, I don't have to learn how to EDIT the menu language, just go "os-probe"? is that right?
2009-12-01T20:17:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	yes, we will try to reinstall grub
2009-12-01T20:21:00.000Z	jongbergs	donita_	the reason you can't see the grub menu because windows 7 overwrites it..you should have installed win 7 first
