2010-02-05T06:26:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	sloopy	but when i check my ip through whatismyip.com it gives my something differnet
2010-02-05T06:27:00.000Z	cyberjunk502		sloopy:like 210.***.45.112

2010-02-05T06:28:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	sloopy	i am using gprs dialup connection but its giving me same ip address when i restart the connection
2010-02-05T06:29:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	sloopy	same on the whatismyip.com
2010-02-05T06:29:00.000Z	sloopy	cyberjunk502	your dialing in to a box that probly uses ip masquerading or similar, to continue on to the inet
