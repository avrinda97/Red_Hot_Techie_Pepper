2009-10-01T20:43:00.000Z	Trizicus		I am a programmer; where do I start to start programming in Linux?
2009-10-01T20:44:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	what sort of languages do you prefer?
2009-10-01T20:46:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	gcc and g++ will be your main staples.
2009-10-01T20:48:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	those are the standard C and C++ libraries. further library documentation is usually attached to whichever library packages you choose to install. also, consider installing the manpages-dev package. you're familiar with man pages?
2009-10-01T20:49:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	you were on windows before, or?
2009-10-01T20:50:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	process is nearly identical. install an ide if you want, but easiest just to whip up a text file in your favourite editor, and practice compiling a few "Hello, World!" analogues via the terminal.
2009-10-01T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	google around for "subversion cvs howto" and the like. there is an enormous amount of material available for first-time users.
2010-02-09T21:07:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	the web page referenced in the error message seems to have a solution for you.
2010-02-09T21:07:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	Solution does not work; i've tried.
2010-02-09T21:07:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	which did you try?
2010-02-09T21:09:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	you've made ntfs-3g suid root?
2010-02-09T21:10:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	yes
2010-02-09T21:10:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	and you've verified that you have correct permissions on the mount point?
2010-02-09T21:11:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	only other thing i can think of is the version of ntfs-3g. i assume you've checked that it is at least as recent as the version mentioned on the web page?
2010-02-09T21:12:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	Yes it is latest
2010-02-09T21:12:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	I can umount but I cant mount
2010-02-09T21:12:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	and if you replace "users" with just "user" in fstab?
2010-02-09T21:13:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	Same thing
2010-02-09T21:14:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	well, if you've checked permissions and everything else, i don't know what else to suggest. consider having a look at the ntfs-3g forums, perhaps someone else has a similar issue.
2010-02-09T21:15:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	I do not have to reload /etc/fstab after changing it correct?
2010-02-09T21:16:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	no, the next mount command will check against the updated file.
2010-02-09T21:16:00.000Z	Trizicus	sipior	So then this obv a ntfs-3g problem
2010-02-09T21:16:00.000Z	sipior	Trizicus	and interaction between ntfs-3g and mount, i would imagine.
