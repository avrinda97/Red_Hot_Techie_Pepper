2007-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	waht hardware?
2007-07-14T16:39:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	motherboard /disk controllers ... just give make/model of your bix
2007-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	have you checked the CD already?
2007-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	might be that the kernel doesn't like some components in that box. there are boot options to try
2007-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	Mitchbbaker	stefg	uh what do i do with the last bit?
2007-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	ignore the stuff about startup servives for now.. just read the first link
2007-07-14T16:45:00.000Z	Mitchbbaker	stefg	which option should i use?
2007-07-14T16:45:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	you'll have to experiment a bit. acpi=off would be agood start
2007-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	while you were rebooting i read some forum posts about a bios update helping
2007-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	debian != ubuntu
2007-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	Mitchbbaker	stefg	yeah i know
2007-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	updating the bios never hurts. So i'd do that first, then see which problems remain
2007-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	dell support pages
2007-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	hope you still have a floppy drive
2007-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	stefg	Mitchbbaker	there's tricks, yeah... but i'd rather ask Dell about that
