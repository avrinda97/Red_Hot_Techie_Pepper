2006-05-18T09:25:00.000Z	Trip348		Hi, I'm a newb, wants to get started with ubuntu. Current setup is C: 10GB With XP and D: 70GB Stuff with 13GB available. Both are NTFS and the D drive have at least 7 GB of free unoccupied space at the very end of the drive. How do I go forward to install Ubuntu on a new partition?
2006-05-18T09:25:00.000Z	Trip348		yesw
2006-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	Trip348		One drive
2006-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	the 7GB free space is enough if you want
2006-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	yeah if necessary
2006-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	it will want to break the 7gigs up into two partitions..
2006-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	one partition for the system and one for a swap partition
2006-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	sort of like the swap file in windows, but a partition instead
2006-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	Trip348	mustard_1	 ok
2006-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	Trip348	mustard_1	Should be double the Ram size right?
2006-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	correct
2006-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	but not strictly necessary
2006-05-18T09:30:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	if you have lots of RAM its unlikely to every get used much
2006-05-18T09:30:00.000Z	Trip348	mustard_1	512MB
2006-05-18T09:31:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	linux won't be able to write to the ntfs partition..it will read it just fine
2006-05-18T09:33:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	I think the issue is going to be that you already have two primary partitions...and there is a limit of four primary partitions, so after ubuntu breaks the last free space into two more partitions you will be at your limit of primary partitions
2006-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	a second hard drive or a bit of a rethink on how you are going to set up your drive in the future might be something to consider.  For now though you have enough space to try it out.
2006-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	Trip348	mustard_1	The d drive is a logical wrapped in an extended partition
2006-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	ah!  ok
2006-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	well thats pretty good then :D
2006-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	ubuntu will automatically partition the free space for you with the installer
2006-05-18T09:38:00.000Z	Trip348	mustard_1	Thanks for the help, I'll go looking for an external drive to borrow now then.
2006-05-18T09:39:00.000Z	mustard_1	Trip348	k
