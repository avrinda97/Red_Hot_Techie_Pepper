2007-06-13T07:18:00.000Z	aMMuNix		why can't I resize my ext3 partition?
2007-06-13T07:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	you can, but you can't move the start of the partition - use gparted
2007-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	what do I have to do in order to resize it then? (all I want is to take some free space out of it)
2007-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	just run gparted & wind back the size
2007-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	I am, the resize option cannot be clicked
2007-06-13T07:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	oh, cos the partition is mounted - you'll need to boot the livecd & resize
2007-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	you there?
2007-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	aye
2007-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	I'm now talking from the LiveCD, it gives me a different error now
2007-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	it says /dev/sda1 is mounted
2007-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	that's bad, it shouldn't
2007-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	well unmount it
2007-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	wow I'm dumb
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	still won't work
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	sure it will
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	it ain't working :P
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	is the disk full?
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	you're running gparted?
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	did you umount the partition??
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	right click > unmount? yes
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	aMMuNix	close gparted, unmount all mounted hdd partitions, rerun gparted
2007-06-13T07:39:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Frogzoo	can you please explain how can I unmount all hdds?
