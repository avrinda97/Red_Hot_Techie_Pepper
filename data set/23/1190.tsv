2012-02-19T22:04:00.000Z	nishttal2		I installed Ubuntu 10.10 on macbook pro 4,1.. i thought sound was not working becoz i coudlnt hear anything but when i connected external speakers and jacked up the volume on those to max, i could hear very faint music. .. i have all volumes to MAX in alsamixer.. what am i doing wrong?
2012-02-19T22:05:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	This is only a workaround, but try installing pavucontrol and raising volume above 100%
2012-02-19T22:08:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	pavucontrol is not letting me go above 100%.. also even at 100% i am getting a lot of static noise when nothing is playing
2012-03-04T21:49:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	Try Xubuntu
2012-03-04T21:53:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	Just get the latest Xubuntu from http://xubuntu.org
2012-03-04T21:56:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	XFCE is a lot like Gnome2
2012-03-04T21:57:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	You'll feel right at home with it
2012-03-04T22:07:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	minixvbox, gulzar, escott ok going to format and install xubuntu.. see you shortly
2012-03-04T21:59:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	XFCE is almost a Gnome2 clone. LXDE is also similar, but provides a little less widgets and such stuff, panels are not as customizable.
2012-03-05T21:28:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	You need to uninstall Flash and upgrade Chrome. Chrome has flash built-in, installing another version will cause such nonsense.
2012-03-05T21:29:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	how do I unstall Flash
2012-03-05T21:29:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	there is a "Adobe Flash plugin" (for mozilla) .. is that the one i need to uninstall?
2012-03-05T21:29:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	yeah
2012-03-05T21:31:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	i uninstalled that.. and restarted chrome.. is still get the out of date flash message
2012-03-05T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	I did say you need to upgrade Chrome as well.
2012-03-05T21:31:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	yeah but before that i thought i'll check if Flash was uninstalled.. but it seems its still there
2012-03-05T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	Eh, told you Chrome has built-in Flash which it uses.
2012-03-05T21:32:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	about:plugins can tell you if you have 1 or 2 flash versions
2012-03-05T21:33:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	in about:plugins  i see.. Flash - Version: 10.3 d162 Download Critical Security Update, Shockwave Flash 10.3 d162
2012-03-05T21:35:00.000Z	nishttal2	theadmin	yoohoo that did it.. thanks for your help man :)
2012-03-05T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	nishttal2	Cool. I'm not a man though. Don't assume.
