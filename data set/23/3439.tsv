2008-08-08T15:10:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	i sent the output to u
2008-08-08T15:11:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	unfortunately that looks correct
2008-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	anything ??
2008-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	it looks right to me
2008-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	the setup is all right.. everythin is connecting.. ping n all works... its just the page that doesnt load.. its a .cgi script based thing.. could that be a reason ???
2008-08-08T15:13:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	what happens when you try to load it? what kind of router is it?
2008-08-08T15:14:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	its a ADSL cum wireless router... Linksys.. !! Its working correctly... What else could be the reason ????
2008-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	i'm a bit lost. there are some routers which don't like firefox but i've never seen one not load at all because of that
2008-08-08T15:16:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	Its not really anti firefox, cuz it works on firefox on windows an OpenSUSE... i guess something is kinda blocking the setup.cgi page from loading.. Is there any firewall or someting by default in ubuntu ???
2008-08-08T15:21:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	so what exactly happens when you try to access the router through firefox?
2008-08-08T15:22:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	The loading bar reaches half.. and the page shows loading after entering the correct password and username.. and ya.. the address bar says "http://192.168.1.1/setup.cgi?next-file=setup,htm
2008-08-08T15:22:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	so definitely not a connection issue, some problem with the browser
2008-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	yeah... not a connection thing.. am using it right now to chat with you guys...
2008-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	you got me stumped
2008-08-08T15:24:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	unless it's proxy settings in the browser?
2008-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	I tried it from a LiveCd to.. n dat doesnt have any settings... ryt ???
2008-08-09T23:12:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	hey, i reinstalled Ubuntu, and i dont know how, but its solved the script problem.. So the Linksys router is k, but the distro had some error...
2008-08-09T23:14:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	wierd. are you still using the same firefox version and everything?
2008-08-09T23:15:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	Yeah... all the same... No change...
2008-08-09T23:15:00.000Z	rconan	Scorp_	having noatime or relatime is definitely worth it
2008-08-09T23:15:00.000Z	Scorp_	rconan	can you gimme ur fstab details ??
