2006-03-09T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		whats 'properly' ?
2006-03-09T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		they are text files last i looked at them
2006-03-09T10:28:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	nah, not quite
2006-03-09T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 good vague answer there. :P
2006-03-09T10:29:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	they have different character encodings or w/e, gedit will not open the file
2006-03-09T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 try a different editor?
2006-03-09T10:31:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	ill keep that in mind :)
2006-03-18T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 heard of memory leaks in Gdesklets for ages....
2006-03-18T10:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 may be specific applets have the leaks
2006-03-18T10:57:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	that's what i am wondering though..
2006-03-18T10:58:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	i think i solved the problem though.. before my app kept calling addtimer(time,function)   i wasn't sure but i figured it would keep making new timers... so now it just updates whenever i click on it.. no timers
2006-03-18T10:59:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	i have 1gb of ram as well and don't touch the swap... but gdesklet was taking up 350mb of ram and i was well into my swap
2006-03-18T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 :P costly eye candy
2006-03-18T11:00:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	yeah.. well, i'm hoping that if i make it so it only updates when i click on it that it won't have any mem leaks
2006-03-18T11:26:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	it's quite the concept isn't it! very interesting
2009-12-24T03:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	  you Can make one if you are using compiz fairly easially.. or i recall normal gnome has a way to do it also
2010-01-23T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 for many nvidia cards ive had - i HAVE to use teh nvidia drivers for it to properly detect the res of the monitors
2010-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	you don't have to properly detect the resolution of monitors..
2010-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	  but with intel - most of those are built in.
2010-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 with many of my Nvidia machines. they use the wrong res. I install the nvidia drivers and they detect teh res properly. its been this way for at least 5 machines ive worked with in the past.
2010-01-23T06:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	 you may want to check the Intel video wiki page/forum threads.
2010-01-23T06:08:00.000Z	mordof	Dr_Willis	i'm going to google it.. but again, you don't need it to detect the resolution itself - that's what xorg.conf is for
2010-01-23T06:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mordof	  ive not had to have res information in xorg.conf in ages.
