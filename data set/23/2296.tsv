2010-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	this too simple for you ? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/SimpleBackupSuite
2010-02-07T18:27:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	I think Simple Backup is not oriented toward DVDs. I may be wrong.
2010-02-07T18:27:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	i'm not sure that it matters...that would be handled by the filesystem no ?
2010-02-07T18:28:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	ok i see what you mean, it doesn't do volumes
2010-02-07T18:28:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	I'm fairly new to Ubuntu; only about a year in it, so there may be stuff I'm missing. I consider burning a DVD to be a special and particular task, distinct from copying a file from one hard disk to another.
2010-02-07T18:30:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	if you can get it to sort the backups in separate volumes when a size threshold is reached, then creating ISOs from a set of files is trivial
2010-02-07T18:31:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	I understand. This is a matter of mental model. I'm sure, in these modern times, I can just throw in a DVD and use Nautilus to drop files into it until it's full. Then I keep track with pencil and paper what I've copied and what not.
2010-02-07T18:32:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	sure but i meant that you can actually script the files > iso stage
2010-02-07T18:33:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	I agree that if I wrote my own backup utility, it would exactly fit both my needs and my desires, rational or otherwise.
2010-02-07T18:36:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	so you'd be happy with simplebackupsuite if it accomodated dvd/cd as a destination ?
2010-02-07T18:38:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	I really think the best way for me to express myself is by pointing to Retrospect: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospect_%28software%29
2010-02-07T18:39:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	so i assume you are not using the linux client because it doesn't do disc medium ?
2010-02-07T18:40:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	You're talking about Simple Backup?
2010-02-07T18:40:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	no apparently retrospect has a ubuntu client
2010-02-07T18:41:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	actually not anymore, seems you'd have to use alien to install it from an rpm : http://forums.dantz.com/showtopic.php?tid/7919/
2010-02-07T18:42:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	*That* would be weird.
2010-02-07T18:42:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	keep in mind that thread is seven years old
2010-02-07T18:44:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	In any case, it's still the proprietary format. I used to think that was wise but now I see the light: no amount of compression or cleverness is worth anything except a straight copy format on the medium.
2010-02-07T18:44:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	this is true
2010-02-07T18:45:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pybackpack-a-user-friendly-file-backup-tool-for-ubuntu-linux-desktop.html
2010-02-07T18:51:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	actually dont bother with sbackup....people citing extremely long times to retrieve a single file from large backups and failed sessions
2010-02-07T18:51:00.000Z	xiong	airtonix	Oh, I like pybackpack!
2010-02-07T18:51:00.000Z	airtonix	xiong	yeah that one looks very similar to the simplebackupsuite but does disc medium
