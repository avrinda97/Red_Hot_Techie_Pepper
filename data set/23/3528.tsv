2008-08-13T17:51:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	indian_munnda	first, open up the folder where you put the file, right click and select "extract here"
2008-08-13T17:52:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	i have extracted that into a folder on the desktop
2008-08-13T17:52:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		ok
2008-08-13T17:52:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	indian_munnda	what is in the extracted folder exactly?
2008-08-13T17:53:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	these are supporting files i think
2008-08-13T17:53:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	there are 2 folders named as docs and patched
2008-08-13T17:54:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	and other images of the real play interface
2008-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	there are some executables also like one is named as "Realplay 10" and when i run it it says "There was an error launching the application"

2008-08-13T18:04:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	i have downloaded the last one whose size is 6.5 M
2008-08-13T18:05:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		And you are trying to run the script "realplay" ?
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		if it prints errors, try running it from gnome-terminal (Terminal)
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	indian_munnda	the_darkside_986	i run that but that doesn't worked
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	indian_munnda	open up Terminal, cd to Desktop/realplay-whatever, and run ./realplay and see what Terminal prints.
