2007-01-22T15:13:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Compile it your self
2007-01-22T15:14:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Why?
2007-01-22T15:18:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	You can compile from source....
2007-01-22T15:19:00.000Z	stephans	Kyral	that is absolutely the lat resource of desperation.... there is a reason that there is a package management system...
2007-01-22T15:19:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Actually /usr/local is there for a reason
2007-01-22T15:19:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	/usr/local was left out of the control of Apt for the reason of thats where people should put self compiled apps
2007-01-22T15:20:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Actually that is dependacy hell
2007-01-22T15:21:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	You will learn nothing by playing it safe
2007-01-22T15:22:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Then switch to a non-point based release distro like Gentoo or Arch
2007-01-22T15:25:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Aliening an RPM is just as dangerious
2007-01-22T15:26:00.000Z	stephans	Kyral	at leas it will be in the package database so it can be managed
2007-01-22T15:26:00.000Z	Kyral	stephans	Again, /usr/local :P
2007-01-22T15:26:00.000Z	stephans	Kyral	I can be helll for me later...
