2010-09-29T22:50:00.000Z	Braber01		hi I've switched form the GUI login to the login SHELL and I need help, I want to be able to use irssi with out having to leave my login shell, however my internet won't work unless i run 'startx' and enter my login password in a prompt any ideas on what could help me?
2010-09-29T22:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 you mean you are using 'wireless' internet?
2010-09-29T22:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 you need to set wireless up some how to work at boot without network manager it seems.
2010-09-29T22:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 not really.
2010-10-08T21:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 perl is not to hard to learn.. and can be real handy.
2010-10-08T21:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 the more languages you learn the easier it is to learn new ones. :)
2010-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	Braber01	Dr_Willis	/var/run/* starts under your root dir.
2010-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 and i think /var/run/samba is made by samba when it starts up.  just not sure how to prove that.
2010-10-09T23:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 learn the basics..  its handy at times.. and learning 'regular expressions' will help in many other languages
2010-10-13T21:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 check /etc/init/gdm.conf - if that exists. upstart is handling gdm. reame the file to be /etc/init/gdm.DONTSTART  or simil;er to disable it.
2010-11-25T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 if you aer doing reinstalls.. why not just install 10.10 to begin with?
2010-11-25T19:06:00.000Z	Braber01	Dr_Willis	1)because I'm lazy and alredy have 10.4 on a usb drive
2010-11-25T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 i think it would be better  to do a clean install of 10.10
2010-11-25T19:07:00.000Z	Braber01	Dr_Willis	would that be better than using update manager since that doesn't seem to be workin for me?
2010-11-25T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 since it would proberly actually work.. id say yes.
2010-11-25T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 and since upgradeing would download the whole cd anyway and more....
2010-11-25T19:08:00.000Z	Braber01	Dr_Willis	Thank you :)
2010-11-25T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 plus you would then have a 10.10 cd/iso/flash drive........
2010-11-25T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 why WOULD you want to upgrade :)
2010-11-25T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 use dd, back it up.. restore it as needed..
2010-12-30T08:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 export the new PATH.    in .bashrc or .profile normally.. -> export PATH=$PATH:new/path/path
2010-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	Braber01	Dr_Willis	smw: never mind I was logged in as root logging out fixed the problem
2011-02-22T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Braber01	 does it look funny now?
