2009-07-15T02:46:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	apt-file search libcompat shows    dietlibc: /usr/lib/diet/lib/libcompat.so  and dietlibc-dev: /usr/lib/diet/lib/libcompat.a
2009-07-15T02:47:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	what does that mean?
2009-07-15T02:48:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	The gcc -lcompat error indicates a need for libcompat.so or libcompat.a.  Those dietlibc and dietlibc-dev packages provide those library files, (and header files).
2009-07-15T02:49:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	thanks
2009-07-15T04:07:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	You may want "sudo apt-get install libssl-dev".
2009-07-15T04:08:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	libssl-dev is already the newest version.
2009-07-15T04:08:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	this is a new error.. the -lcompat works now :P But then this showed up :(
2009-07-15T04:09:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	this is the output i get: checking for ssl... configure: error: Cannot find ssl libraries
2009-07-15T04:14:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	This page lists dependencies- http://www.arcemu.info/wiki/index.php?title=Compiling:_Linux   But libssl-dev should be resolving the current configure error.
2009-07-15T04:15:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	I already got libssl-dev, updated and all
2009-07-15T04:16:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	You will need to delve into exactly what the configure script is looking for.  It isn't explaining its needs very well.
2009-07-15T04:16:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	got all those files
2009-07-15T04:18:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	this is the ./configure: ./configure prefix=/home/arcemu/server --enable-lua-scripting --enable-collision --enable-debug
2009-07-15T04:19:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	Try "bash -x ./configure prefix=/home/arcemu/server --enable-lua-scripting --enable-collision --enable-debug" and see what it is really doing.
2009-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	you want me to copy the full output?
2009-07-15T04:26:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	did you get my PM?
2009-07-15T04:26:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	yes
2009-07-15T04:31:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	got anything yet?
2009-07-15T04:32:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	The configure script may be caching bad results from earlier.  You could restart from autoreconf, or start over in a new directory.
2009-07-15T04:32:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	restarted about 5 times now :P
2009-07-15T04:33:00.000Z	stroyan	Ramonster	It is time for me to go eat.
2009-07-15T04:33:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	bon a petit ;)
2009-07-15T04:33:00.000Z	Ramonster	stroyan	thanks for your time
