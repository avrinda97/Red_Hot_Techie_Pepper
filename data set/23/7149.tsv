2007-04-13T12:43:00.000Z	hume		i have lost my user password, and try to boot the computer into recovery mode (from grub) to be able to set it again, but ends up in "give root password" (which I don't have) or Ctrl-D which leads back to normal KDM log in. How can I come to a prompt where I can set my user password?
2007-04-13T12:44:00.000Z	eck	hume	did you set a root password? iirc you should not be prompted unless you actually gave the root user a password
2007-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	eck	hume	you might be able to bypass it by adding init=/bin/bash as a kernel boot parameter
2007-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	hume	eck	where do I add that?
2007-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	eck	hume	in the grub screen hit e and then add it before the -- in the kernel line
2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	hume	eck	no -- in the kernel line, just kernel /boot/vmlinuz-xxxxxxx root=......
2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	eck	hume	that's fine
2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	hume	eck	so where do I put it....?
2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	hume	eck	before kernel?
2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	eck	hume	anywhere on the line
2007-04-13T12:53:00.000Z	hume	eck	hrm...addning that makes the boot hang at a usb-device
2007-04-13T12:55:00.000Z	eck	hume	it is sort of an old trick, i am not too surprised that it doesn't work on these new fangled systems
2007-04-13T12:56:00.000Z	eck	hume	if you can you should just use a live cd
2007-04-13T12:56:00.000Z	hume	eck	yes, how do I use that to change pw?
2007-04-13T12:56:00.000Z	eck	hume	once you get into a live cd, chroot into the old environment and run passwd
2007-04-13T13:04:00.000Z	hume	eck	i got the live CD running now, am I to do chroot <root of my hard disk file system> then?
2007-04-13T13:05:00.000Z	eck	hume	if you have the old system mounted at say /mnt/ubuntu , you would run sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu
2007-04-13T13:06:00.000Z	eck	hume	then you're basically in the old system and you can reset your password with passwd
2007-04-13T13:07:00.000Z	hume	eck	feel a bit stupid - my old system does not seem to be mounted - is there a way to find out where it is, or do I just guess at /dev/hda?
2007-04-13T13:08:00.000Z	eck	hume	oh, you need to mount it first, e.g. 'mkdir /mnt/ubuntu && mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubuntu'
2007-04-13T13:15:00.000Z	hume	eck	ok, now I have the root file system identified - but not the home directories (on another partition) - do I need those as well?
2007-04-13T13:16:00.000Z	eck	hume	no, you just need /etc to change the passwords
2007-04-13T13:18:00.000Z	hume	eck	great, now it works, thanks a lot!!!
