2009-02-15T05:26:00.000Z	Dante`		Hi, I've a little issue with the screen command. When I launch a screen via ssh from my gnome-terminal and when I use my mousse to scroll, it goes in the commands history (like if I utilise up arrow) instead of scrolling the stdout.
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	yes and what's the problem exactly if you want to scroll stdout press scrolllock then
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	yes and what's the problem exactly if you want to scroll stdout press scrolllock then press the up arrow
2009-02-15T05:29:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	the problem is that on 4 servers, 2 ubuntu servers, it's the only which does that. I'd like to not use the scroll lock, just cause it's faster to just scroll with the mouse instead of doing ctrl+a echap page up
2009-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	"the only one" I mean
2009-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	hmm I don't use a gui on servers sicne I find it to be a waste of resources really but sounds like it's a configuration issue
2009-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	and I dont see what is differents on this server cause the screen configuration is the same than on another.
2009-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	I don't use a gui on my server !
2009-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	I use ssh+screen in a traditional way.
2009-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	it's just that on this server, which I didn't install myself cause I bought it (OVH), the screen does this weird behaviour
2009-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	well then you need to figure out the issue like I said I don't use a gui on my server(my definition is different then what you think I m saying)
2009-02-15T05:33:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	as in I don't use a gui at all on my client to my server
2009-02-15T05:33:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	you mean that you don't use X and a mouse on your client ?
2009-02-15T05:34:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	you connect your server directly from a tty ?
2009-02-15T05:34:00.000Z	Dante`		weird...
2009-02-15T05:34:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	not weird since using a gui for me is a waste of resources when I m just sshing
2009-02-15T05:35:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	why waste resources when you'll just be in a ssh session on a remote machine doing all the work
2009-02-15T05:35:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	ok ok, so anyway you cant help me if you dont use a mousse
2009-02-15T05:35:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	I use a mouse
2009-02-15T05:36:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	but u dont use a gnome-terminal...
2009-02-15T05:37:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	thx anyway
2009-02-15T05:37:00.000Z	kitche	Dante`	also just so you know you onyl scroll gnome-terminal you don't scroll the remote output
2009-02-15T05:38:00.000Z	Dante`	kitche	yes, sorry, I mean I want to scrool in the gnome-terminal history and do not send "^[[A" through the ssh tunnel to the screen
