2006-10-31T17:28:00.000Z	abo		since I upgraded to Edgy I can't get the video stream on bbc (and other news websites) to show
2006-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	abo		can anyone help me fixing the websites embeded videos? I tried automatix, and tried to reinstall players and plugins... no joy I must be doing something wrong
2006-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	abo		ok... I tried removing realplayer and reinstalling it using synaptic and yet it doesn't work
2006-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	savvas	abo	try installing the w32codecs it has in its lists
2006-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	abo	savvas	the codecs do work properly, I can play wmv files and other video/audio files, it's only the firefox plugins that are not working
2006-10-31T17:34:00.000Z	savvas	abo	did you try installing packages totem-mozilla or mozilla-plugin-vlc ?
2006-10-31T17:35:00.000Z	abo	savvas	I have totem-mozilla installed
2006-10-31T17:35:00.000Z	abo	savvas	should I try reinstalling it?
2006-10-31T17:37:00.000Z	abo	savvas	I also have mozilla-plugin-vlc intalled
2006-10-31T17:38:00.000Z	savvas	abo	close firefox, reinstall it and try again. if it doesn't work, close firefox, try the same procedure with the vlc plugin
2006-10-31T17:38:00.000Z	savvas	abo	if that doesn't work, well.. dunno what else to suggest :\
2006-10-31T17:38:00.000Z	abo		ok savvas, I'll do now and let you know
2006-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	abo	savvas	it didn't work, but while playing around, I change the player to mplayer, and got this error: Video codec 'MS WMV 9 (win32)' is not handled. You might need to install additional plugins to be able to play some types of movies, I checked apt-get install w32codecs, it said it's at the newest version
2006-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	savvas	abo	maybe it's a copyrighted wmv, which i don't think ubuntu supports
2006-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	abo	savvas	the bbc news video are copyrighted?
2006-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	abo	savvas	can you try to play them yourself and let me know plz?
2006-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	savvas	abo	give me the link, i can try :)
2006-10-31T17:53:00.000Z	abo		http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/help/3681938.stm
2006-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	abo	savvas	best would be to go to http://news.bbc.co.uk/ and select any video
2006-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	abo	savvas	any video in video news
2006-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	savvas	abo	sorry, doesn't work on mine :p i don't think i have any plugins installed though and i really won't because i don't use them a lot
2006-10-31T17:56:00.000Z	abo	savvas	ok thanks anyway
2006-10-31T17:56:00.000Z	abo	savvas	just to note, it used to work on dapper before I upgraded to edgy
