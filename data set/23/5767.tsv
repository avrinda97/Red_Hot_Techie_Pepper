2007-01-02T14:41:00.000Z	cens0red		hey what package contains wx-config ?
2007-01-02T14:41:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	wx-2.6-dev?
2007-01-02T14:42:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	thanks.
2007-01-02T14:42:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	That's wrong, hold on.
2007-01-02T14:44:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	?
2007-01-02T14:45:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	I think it's libwxgtk2.6-dev.
2007-01-02T14:45:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	thanks. There should be a way of finding out this stuff.
2007-01-02T14:46:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	Yeah, it's called packages.ubuntu.com, but for some reason it doesn't think wx-config belongs to any package.
2007-01-02T14:46:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	I'm assuming it belongs in the library dev package, that would make the most sense.
2007-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	cheers. I'll just install everything that has "wx" and "dev" in it.
2007-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	I guess brute-force works as well.  :)
2007-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	I would try libwxgtk2.6-dev first though, just to make sure.
2007-01-02T14:50:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	ok installed it. did a "locate wx-config" and got nada.
2007-01-02T14:52:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	If you're looking for the location of a command, `which` is better than `locate`.
2007-01-02T14:52:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	yeah thanks. It's in there.
2007-01-02T15:56:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	./configure --help
2007-01-02T15:56:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	the only reference I can find in the help is something called JACK_CFLAGS. Not sure what that means.
2007-01-02T15:57:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	There's no '--enable-jack' or '--with-jack=' options?
2007-01-02T15:57:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	no. All I know is I have used audicity with jack before .. and when I run the ./configure script it says "searching for jack ... No "
2007-01-02T15:58:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	Do you have JACK's header files?
2007-01-02T15:59:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	I'm not much of a coder. Not sure what that means. Can u elaborate?
2007-01-02T16:00:00.000Z	po0f	cens0red	When you installed JACK (either directly or as a dependency), you got just the library.  To do any development, you have to install the *-dev package for it as well, which will give you the header files to use that library.
2007-01-02T16:01:00.000Z	cens0red	po0f	thanks for that explanation. I just installed the appropriate -dev package, as per crimun's suggestion.
