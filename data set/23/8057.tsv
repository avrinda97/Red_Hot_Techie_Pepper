2005-02-12T12:26:00.000Z	iRocha		Hello
2005-02-12T12:27:00.000Z	iRocha		Can I install Ubuntu by ftp?
2005-02-12T12:27:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	just have asked that!! ;-)
2005-02-12T12:27:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	no yet an answer
2005-02-12T12:27:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	thanks :)
2005-02-12T12:28:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	having problems with the CD?
2005-02-12T12:28:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	"Can't mount CD" or something like that.
2005-02-12T12:28:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	when??
2005-02-12T12:29:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	after choosing the language and keyboard mapping
2005-02-12T12:29:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	did you check the md5sum prior to burning?
2005-02-12T12:29:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	they are the original ubuntu cd's
2005-02-12T12:30:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	they worked at home, but not in the computer i'm trying to install it now
2005-02-12T12:30:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	:-((. In my case, I had to dump the iso and burn it again with 1x so the installation seems to be working right now in an old machine...
2005-02-12T12:30:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	but this is not the case of the original CDs!!
2005-02-12T12:31:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	the original warty live cd works fine, but the latest hoary live cd doesn't work too, very strange.
2005-02-12T12:31:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	then, just install Warthy and upgrade to Hoary, isn't it?
2005-02-12T12:32:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	i can't install warty, only the live cd runs.
2005-02-12T12:32:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	oh, wait, sorry
2005-02-12T12:33:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	i guess this friend of mine won't have ubuntu installed so soon :(
2005-02-12T12:33:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	he he. I'm not an expert... but the debian way might solve the problem as weblin says
2005-02-12T12:35:00.000Z	prego	iRocha	did you check the messages on console 3rd or four (ALT+F3, ALT+F4,...)?
2005-02-12T13:14:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	anything yet?
2005-02-12T13:15:00.000Z	iRocha	prego	i wasn't here
