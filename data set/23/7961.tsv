2005-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	jesus\		I can't kill proftpd
2005-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	sudo /etc/init.d/proftpd stop
2005-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	notice that those processes are in 'D' state
2005-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	more than likely your disk is spewing errors
2005-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	try checking dmesg for error/panic/oops output
2005-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	uninterruptible sleep

2005-03-12T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	it's a little more involved than just grepping for those strings
2005-03-12T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	e.g., manually look through dmesg|less
2005-03-12T12:29:00.000Z	jesus\	crimsun	 i found no errors in dmesg, the only error-like things re the ntfs-errors
2005-03-12T12:30:00.000Z	jesus\	crimsun	 I hdparm'ed my disks yesterday, can that be the problem or would there be some output in dmesg if something goes wrong?
2005-03-12T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	short of ptracing the master process, I don't know.
2005-03-12T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	you could check whichever changes you made using hdparm
2005-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	jesus\	crimsun	 what do you mean by that?
2005-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	by what?
2005-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	jesus\	crimsun	 I also have a constant load of 62% (when I'm doing nothing)
2005-03-12T12:37:00.000Z	jesus\	crimsun	 by "crimsun jesus\: you could check whichever changes you made using hdparm"
2005-03-12T12:40:00.000Z	crimsun	jesus\	e.g., revert whatever changes you made using hdparm
