2005-09-07T05:32:00.000Z	Drajka		I'm trying to update my gfx drivers...
2005-09-07T05:32:00.000Z	Drajka		i already downloaded the pack from the nvidia web site.. linux, amd64bit
2005-09-07T05:32:00.000Z	Drajka		it's saying ti need to close X server before I can install
2005-09-07T05:32:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	a) it's a lie, b) you're better off using the nvidia drivers that come with ubuntu, c) sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2005-09-07T06:10:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepoistoryHowto
2005-09-07T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	and when you read the page, it has a list of similarly-named ones, one of which is the one I meant
2005-09-12T08:19:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	sure it is
2005-09-12T08:19:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	/msg ubotu repository
2005-09-12T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	if you have configured apt to use universe, you have wine available
2005-09-12T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	did you install it yet?
2005-09-12T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	wine
2005-09-12T08:22:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	so, paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	not unless your irc client is utter crap
2005-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	lots comewith ubuntu
2005-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	please tell me you're joking about wanting wine to run mirc
2005-09-12T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	anyway, you have wine available
2005-09-12T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	paste the output of 'apt-cache policy wine'
2005-09-12T08:28:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	do. not. paste. in. here.
2005-09-12T08:29:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	I wouldn't be annoyed except that I told you three times
2005-09-12T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	wine runs 32-bit i386 windows programs on 32-bit i386 linux
2005-09-12T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	if you care about binary crap, install the ubuntu i386 port
2005-09-12T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	that could be a problem with the baclports repository
2005-09-12T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	Drajka	have to talk to the backports people, I guess
