2010-09-21T00:21:00.000Z	fedora_newb		I have installed notepad++ through wine, maybe a better question for winehq, but thought i would ask here, is there a way to right click on files and open through notepad++?
2010-09-21T00:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	you use wine to run a text editor!!!?? o.0
2010-09-21T00:22:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	you bet...gedit doesn't have all the features as notepad++ that i need
2010-09-21T00:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	try one of thwe other 10 thousans editors for linux....
2010-09-21T00:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	you may try scite ( notepad++ is based on it )
2011-04-03T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	try passing a fsck to the partition first
2011-04-03T00:07:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	fsck?
2011-04-03T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	filesystem check
2011-04-03T00:09:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	Filesystem revision too high while trying to open /dev/sda1. The filesystem revision is apparantely too high for this verion of e2fsck or the filesystem superblock is corrupt
2011-04-03T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	try with a different superblock
2011-04-03T00:10:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	like sda2?
2011-04-03T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	no; « sudo e2fsck -b 32768 /dev/sdxx »
2011-04-03T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	replace xx with the letter number of the partition
2011-04-03T00:14:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	it gave me usage commands
2011-04-03T00:15:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	Superblock has an invalid journal (inode 8). Clear <y>?
2011-04-03T00:16:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	should I hit Y?
2011-04-03T00:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	how its going?
2011-04-03T00:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	hi
2011-04-03T00:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	e2fsck fixed the partition ?
2011-04-03T00:38:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	yes :)
2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	should I think about replacing my hdd now? Thinking because of this issue it might be bad?
2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	fedora_newb	hard to say; we do not know why the filesystem got corrupted... check SMART status ( health) . System>Admin...>disk utilitie
2011-04-03T00:40:00.000Z	fedora_newb	erUSUL	kk, again, thank you for the help, you don't know how much headaches you saved me...
