2011-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	spyvsspy		all LCDs
2011-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	spyvsspy		even the bios isnt coming up
2011-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	spyvsspy		i cant, I can not get any response from the cpu at all
2011-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	spyvsspy		wont even boot into the bios (at least the monitors will not display the bios)
2011-05-11T19:48:00.000Z	spyvsspy		its like they are in permanent sleep mode
2011-05-11T19:48:00.000Z	spyvsspy		only after I rebooted after editing xorg.conf did this start
2011-05-11T19:48:00.000Z	spyvsspy		ya, Ive done that, I have 2 video cards pulled them both, reconnected did all kinds of stuff like that
2011-05-11T19:49:00.000Z	spyvsspy		at one point I did get to the bios when I pulled one video card, and only had one monitor plugged in,  but couldnt get into the bios
2011-05-11T19:49:00.000Z	spyvsspy		in time, and ubuntu booted
2011-05-11T19:49:00.000Z	spyvsspy		then it all went black
2011-05-11T19:49:00.000Z	Rziz	spyvsspy	most issues regarding inability to reach post are caused by bad ram in my experience
2011-05-11T19:49:00.000Z	spyvsspy		ya, its not bad ram
2011-05-11T19:50:00.000Z	spyvsspy		I tested in another machine; Im completely baffled
2011-05-11T19:50:00.000Z	spyvsspy		this is the second time this has happened w/ ubuntu, the first time, I fixed it somehow, but cant remember
2011-05-11T19:50:00.000Z	spyvsspy		lol
2011-05-11T19:50:00.000Z	Rziz		do you get any post error beeps?
2011-05-11T19:50:00.000Z	spyvsspy		no, it all the sounds (hd/fan etc) are normal
2011-05-11T19:51:00.000Z	spyvsspy		and RAM tested in another machine as fine
2011-05-11T19:51:00.000Z	spyvsspy	ubuntu	is putting the monitors into permanent sleep mode somehow, or there is a bug w/ this particular mobo
2011-05-11T19:51:00.000Z	Rziz		I think it's absurd to suppose an incorrectly configured X Window System can prevent you from accessing your bios ..
2011-05-11T19:51:00.000Z	spyvsspy		no, I cant boot anything
2011-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	spyvsspy		rziz, its not absurd, this has happened before
2011-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	Rziz	spyvsspy	are you using any kind of propetiary drivers?
