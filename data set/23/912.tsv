2012-09-01T10:32:00.000Z	mhahe		hey guys i read the ubuntu guide on how to configure and install ubuntu for raid configuration... but it doesnt mention how to deal with pre-existing OS (windows 7) i want it to go alongside windows
2012-09-01T10:32:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	you cant put windows on software raid from ubuntu
2012-09-01T10:33:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	you are talking about softwareraid? or fakeraid? or hardware-raid?
2012-09-01T10:34:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	ok then its software-raid
2012-09-01T10:35:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	install windows somewhere and make space on both drives for ubuntu
2012-09-01T10:35:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	e.g. windows 28gb, then you still have 100gb and 128gb, put 100gb in software-raid
2012-09-01T10:37:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	use the first link for software-raid
2012-09-01T10:38:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	but why you need raid0 on a notebook?
2012-09-01T10:38:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	raid IS NOT a backup solution
2012-09-01T10:39:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	why you need raid on a notebook?
2012-09-01T10:39:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	then dont use raid if you dont know what it means
2012-09-01T10:42:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	why you need raid?
2012-09-01T10:48:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	can you tell me why you need RAID? as it seems you even dont know what raid is and trust me there is no reason to use raid on a notebook
2012-09-01T10:49:00.000Z	mhahe	iceroot	I have 2 hdds so isnt that raid 0?
2012-09-01T10:49:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	no
2012-09-01T10:50:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	raid is more then just "i have two hdds". have a look at wikipedia what RAID is and then thing about if you really need it
2012-09-01T10:51:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	raid is not a backup
2012-09-01T10:52:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	and raid0 is making the chance 50% higher that your filesystem will fail
2012-09-01T10:52:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	just forget the idea of raid and you will be fine
2012-09-01T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	sure
2012-09-01T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	ubuntu will automaticly mount your windows-partiton and show it in the filemanager
2012-09-01T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	no need to edit /etc/fstab
2012-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	iceroot	mhahe	first windows, then ubuntu
