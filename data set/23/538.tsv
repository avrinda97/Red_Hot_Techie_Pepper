2011-09-05T19:39:00.000Z	kkulhavy		Hi I tried to install Ubuntu on my computer
2011-09-05T19:39:00.000Z	kkulhavy		SQUASHFS error: Unable to read page, block 288520d6, size c65a
2011-09-05T19:39:00.000Z	kkulhavy		ubiquity bus error core dumped
2011-09-05T19:40:00.000Z	kkulhavy		An error occured during installation of this Package
2011-09-05T19:40:00.000Z	kkulhavy		I have problems with this MD5
2011-09-05T19:40:00.000Z	kkulhavy		I tried to MD5 sum the CD directly and always get different MD5 even when I try again
2011-09-05T19:40:00.000Z	kkulhavy		When I compare the two files with binary editor, they are identical except there is a block of zeroes appended to the official iso
2011-09-05T19:41:00.000Z	kkulhavy		and this block of zeroes is missing on the CD
2011-09-05T19:41:00.000Z	kkulhavy		And its the same even if I repeat the burn
2011-09-05T19:41:00.000Z	kkulhavy		Could it be the problem?
2011-09-05T19:43:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	My advice is to verify with md5sum; upon completion of that reburn the CD at the slowest speed.
2011-09-05T19:45:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Sidewinder1	how do I find out the slowest speed?
2011-09-05T19:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	Whatever burning program should allow you to adjust the burn speed.
2011-09-05T19:47:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Sidewinder1	I use cdrecord, speed=0 makes 48, speed=1 makes 8x so I hope 8x is correct
2011-09-05T19:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	I never used cdrecord; just set it to the slowest speed that it allows; then go get some milk and cookies. :-)
2011-09-05T19:50:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	If you're sure it's corrupt and NOT re=writeable, toss it.
2011-09-05T19:51:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Sidewinder1	its not rewritable, I am not sure if its corrupt
2011-09-05T19:53:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	If the ISO was corrupt (non-matching md5sum) and it's not rewriteable; it's trash.
2011-09-05T20:23:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	CdDs are usually 700 meg., I believe.
2011-09-05T21:51:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	Congrats!!
2011-09-05T22:02:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Sidewinder1	thanks, but almost wasnt
2011-09-28T19:21:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	I'd demand my money back!
2011-09-28T19:26:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	kkulhavy	You kinda' asked for it, no?
