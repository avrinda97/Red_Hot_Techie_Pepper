2007-06-23T07:33:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	could using the built in compiz cause a problem?
2007-06-23T07:33:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Just out of interest
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	the mouse works OK other than that? e.g. on other systems?
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Yes it works perfect
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	maybe a flaky cable? Or coke spilled over the mouse ...
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Its wireless
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	maybe low batteries?
2007-06-23T07:31:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	They have only just been changed :S
2007-06-23T07:31:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	It only ever happens with ubuntu
2007-06-23T07:31:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	or a mobile phone or WLAN access point somewhere somehow causing intereferences?
2007-06-23T07:31:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Never had a problem like that wit it before
2007-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Its like i can still move the cursor and the wireless keyboard still works
2007-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Its just the clicks stop being recognised
2007-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	I did notice, I think my xorg.conf claims to be emulating 3 buttons, could that cause anything?
2007-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	yes ... turn it off. and see if it improves anything.
2007-06-23T07:35:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Even without 3 button emulation, its still playing up
2007-06-23T07:35:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	hmm ... what brand is that mouse?
2007-06-23T07:36:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Think having 3 wacom touchpads configged inside my xorg.conf could be doing something?
2007-06-23T07:36:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	I dont even have any touchpads or anything
2007-06-23T07:36:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Its a labtec
2007-06-23T07:37:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	Think i should try removing the 3 wacom devices out of xorg?
2007-06-23T07:37:00.000Z	Shaftino	scorp123	One is configged as a mouse too :S
2007-06-23T07:44:00.000Z	scorp123	Shaftino	you could also add some comment to it ... e.g. : sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.Backup_DEFAULT_23-Jun-2007
