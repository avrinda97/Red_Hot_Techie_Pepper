2011-01-29T19:17:00.000Z	habeous		it's a virtual hard disk, so I don't quite know how you'd add more....
2011-01-29T19:17:00.000Z	habeous		backup your ubuntu stuff before you start poking
2011-01-29T19:18:00.000Z	habeous		that's my advice.... my wubi install reduced my computer to a paperweight because of an update
2011-01-29T19:19:00.000Z	habeous		external hard drive.
2011-01-29T19:19:00.000Z	habeous		deja dup

2011-01-29T19:20:00.000Z	habeous		did you recompile?
2011-01-29T19:21:00.000Z	habeous		oh, that driver wrapper
2011-01-29T19:21:00.000Z	habeous		linux driver wrapper?
2011-01-29T19:21:00.000Z	mun	habeous	recompile? hmm don't think so.
2011-01-29T19:22:00.000Z	mun	habeous	should i?
2011-01-29T19:23:00.000Z	mun	habeous	ok. so is the hiddev driver an external one?
2011-01-29T19:24:00.000Z	habeous	mun	i'm googling now
2011-01-29T19:25:00.000Z	mun	habeous	so it shouldn't come as part of the default set of drivers?
2011-01-29T19:27:00.000Z	mun	habeous	do you know how i can check the kernel version?  uname -a gives me 2.6.35-22-generic so is my kernel 2.6.35-22?

2011-01-29T19:49:00.000Z	mun	habeous	but that's unity
2011-01-29T19:50:00.000Z	habeous	mun	sorry, got you confused with sercan
2011-01-29T19:50:00.000Z	mun	habeous	ah ok
