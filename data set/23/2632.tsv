2009-03-21T21:10:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Suggestion:  dd if=/dev/hda1 | ssh $user@$host 'gzip - > /pub/image.gz'
2009-03-21T21:12:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	and then gzip -d < image.gz | dd of=/dev/hda1
2009-03-21T21:12:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	hm I'll try that if partimage fails, I m always afraid to install stuff when the os is as LiveCD
2009-03-21T21:12:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	I'm sure I'm jumping in at the tail end of a conversation, but I did something like that before and that worked for me.
2009-03-21T21:13:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Just got here, so...
2009-03-21T21:13:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	so basically making an image of /dev/sdc1, transfering it over to the second machine (where the os is live) over ssh and then unpacking image ?
2009-03-21T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Yep, make a compressed tarball out of it and send it to another machine across the network and then just  unpack the whole partition.
2009-03-21T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Of course, if it'
2009-03-21T21:15:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	well mbr isn't so hard (I think?) to handle getting the whole / on the second networked computer is what is killing me
2009-03-21T21:15:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Of course, if it's hda1 and is bootable, (you are cloning), then you will need to do the mbr
2009-03-21T21:15:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	thanks for input
2009-03-21T21:16:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Here are my notes:  http://www.ntlug.org/BP-trryhend/TripleBootProject?action=view
2009-03-21T21:16:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	cool :)
2009-03-21T21:17:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	really ? ssh faster than nfs?
2009-03-21T21:18:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Apparrently so...
2009-03-21T21:18:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	I am quite surprised, it's noted though as it's very interesting
2009-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Well, don't take my word for it, because I'm not really sure.  There were other circumstances, one bing wired vs wifi...
2009-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Like I say, those are just notes that I shared.
2009-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	 But the process worked.
2009-03-21T21:22:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	if I am to use nfs though (it's only 2.5GB), can I just dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/media/temp/system.iso and then just transfer it over nfs via . On the second machine, I'd just dd if=system.iso of=/dev/sda1 ?
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	Yes that should work
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	LakesProse	usr13	great thanks!
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	usr13	LakesProse	NP
