2006-04-16T13:03:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 you can use xmms and xmms-cdread
2006-04-16T13:05:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 can you play the cd from a VT?
2006-04-16T13:05:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 alt-<F1> and login to a VT
2006-04-16T13:05:00.000Z	dave_cb	AAA	 im a newbie so waht does VT means?
2006-04-16T13:05:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 use mplayer and see if you can make it go
2006-04-16T13:05:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 virtual terminal
2006-04-16T13:08:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 you can also use cdplay, it is int the cdtools package; apt-get install cdtools
2006-04-16T13:08:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 unless of couse you want to use the best media player on earth, mplayer
2006-04-16T13:10:00.000Z	dave_cb	AAA	 im guessing im using Konsole (thats the only terminal i know of :( )
2006-04-16T13:12:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 in your konsole type apt-get install cdtools  that will install cdplay and allow you to play cd's without kde or gnome or foo
2006-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 just use sudo vim
2006-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 you will be done in 2 min
2006-04-16T13:25:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 you have to be root
2006-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 try this in a konsole
2006-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-04-16T13:27:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 I can help you edit it with a real editor
2006-04-16T13:31:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 you have to use like 8 key presses max to change and save exit the file
2006-04-16T13:31:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 all you are doing is remove one or two #'s depending on if you want the src deb's
2006-04-16T13:32:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 do it do it :)
2006-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	dave_cb	AAA	how do i save the file on VIM?
2006-04-16T13:36:00.000Z	AAA	dave_cb	 to be fair, <SHIFT> zz will save and close the file, :w  will write the file and :wc will write and close the file
