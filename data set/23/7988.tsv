2005-03-02T16:38:00.000Z	iPal		hello?
2005-03-02T16:38:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	hi
2005-03-02T16:39:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	don't ask to ask...just ask
2005-03-02T16:42:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	hmmm...you get what error msg?
2005-03-02T16:42:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	I had problems mounting/reading a CD that I burned to hard....I used a speed the CD was not happy to burn...
2005-03-02T16:44:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	did you try to use x8?
2005-03-02T16:44:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	try to burn one with 8x
2005-03-02T16:44:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	might help
2005-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	8x should be ok
2005-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	depends on the CD
2005-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	before you burn though...look if the md5sum is correct
2005-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	you can get the md5sum stuff on the site
2005-03-02T16:46:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	hmmm...maybe there is a bug report about this
2005-03-02T16:51:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	can't find a report about this....
2005-03-02T16:51:00.000Z	iPal	scizzo	thanks
2005-03-02T16:52:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	if you find something that is wrong...look at bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-03-02T16:53:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	I tried to install ubuntu on a i386 machine when I burned the CD to fast and it stuck AFAIK at the same place as you....
2005-03-02T16:53:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	just try with 4x or 8x I used 8x and it worked fine
2005-03-02T16:54:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	that I don't know
2005-03-02T16:54:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	was it a loop you mounted it as?
2005-03-02T16:54:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	does this happen if you try to mount some other iso?
2005-03-02T16:55:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	hmmm...
2005-03-02T16:55:00.000Z	scizzo	iPal	I have no answer for that....sorry
