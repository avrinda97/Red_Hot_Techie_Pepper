2008-05-14T16:42:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		When using the nvidia settings manager and clicking the 'save settings' button, i get 'Unable to create new x config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'
2008-05-14T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 you did backup your xorg.conf beforhand? and you did run the tool as root?
2008-05-14T16:42:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	i backed up xorg.conf, but i don't know how to run it. i installed nvidia-settings cause i couldn't find the link to this program
2008-05-14T16:43:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	That program started this one. but i don't believe it did it as root
2008-05-14T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 gksudo or whatever the gnome sudo command is.
2008-05-14T16:43:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	I know how to use gksudo, i don't know what the program name is to run it
2008-05-14T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 hit nvidia<TAB>   :) there are 2 nvidia config tools in the repos. One has a X in the name the other dosent. ONE is a text based tool that can enable nvidia stuff. other tweaks  the existing config.  (it has a gui)
2008-05-14T16:45:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	Way ahead of you. it gets to nvidia- and stops. ones i found were nvidia-xconfig which appeared to do nothing and some bug reporting thing
2008-05-14T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 hit tab twice. :) it will show all matching.
2008-05-14T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 the one WITH a X is the non-X tool.. the one without the X is the X gui tool... (figure that out eh)
2008-05-14T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 i normally run the nvidia-xconfig -twinview  (I think thats the name) to enable twinview, restart X, then rerun the other one with gksudo, to tweak the setup.
2008-05-14T16:46:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	nvidia-settings (the new program that lauched the one i want), nvidia-bug-report.sh and nvidia-xconfig. None are the one i want
2008-05-14T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 what do you want exactly? those 2 are the only ones ive ever used. :)
2008-05-14T16:47:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	It's a GUI with the window title 'NVidia X server settings'. Has a whole heap of settings
2008-05-14T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 it needs to be ran as root.  Or it cant write to the xorg.conf to make the changes
2008-05-14T16:48:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	Yea i know. I don't know the name of the program to run it :P
2008-05-14T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 because you dident realize the name-completion was beeping at you to tell you that you had more then 1 match. :)
2008-05-14T16:49:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	I pasted all 3 matches. None of them were the correct GUI program
2008-05-14T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 ive not seen any other gui tools for the nvidia stuff.. I imagine the gnome tools may do a similer thing. I never have used the gnome tool then.
2008-05-26T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 install it only as a local user, and keep it in the users home dir.  or wait a while for RC1 to get released...
2008-05-26T10:16:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Dr_willis	Will it appear in software updates when it's ready? The latest pidgin didn't
2008-05-26T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 no idea. since some would consider the browser more imporantant then pidgin.. yes. :)
2008-05-26T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Flynsarmy	 or so ive heard  it mentioned.
