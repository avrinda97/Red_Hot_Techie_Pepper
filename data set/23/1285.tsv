2010-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	azolap		so i am logged in as user ubuntu. but is there a way i can access my files on the hd?
2010-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	  try to mount the partitions :), using the file manager
2010-05-30T04:55:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   btw, DRDY ERR type errors are usually spit out  by libata module meaning, the HD is going south or has a few bad sectors already, you can always run a live-cd with utils to do a S.M.A.R.T check on it if you wish :)
2010-05-30T04:59:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   for the *nix partition, you can do a 'disk check' as Dizkonnekted already suggested, -> sudo e2fsck -c /dev/YOURINSTALLHERE; as far as doing it on win7, I'd suggest you get something like Hiren's boot cd, [ http://www.hirensbootcd.net/ ] which has a bunch of disk checkers youu can run from a live-cd session
2010-05-30T05:03:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	    no, both checks are OS dependent, so each works for each filesystem :)
2010-05-30T05:06:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	    firstly, if your file manager can 'view' it, chances are is mounted, you don't use e2fsck on a mounted system, so, unmount it before using it, you want to know where YOURINSTALL is, just issue -> fdisk -l;  that'll tell you, it'll be /dev/sda1 or so
2010-05-30T05:10:00.000Z	azolap	Typos_King	i'm a bit confused as to which is my ubuntu partition on the hard disk.. in file manager i have "88.2GB Media" and "Filesystem" .. both look like ubuntu installs :s
2010-05-30T05:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	  what did 'fdisk -l' say?   can you paste it to paste2.org?
2010-05-30T05:16:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	    .... df -h isn't saying much on that, I thought you were going to paste 'fdisk -l' :|
2010-05-30T05:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	    that'll be /dev/sda5 then
2010-05-30T05:22:00.000Z	azolap	Typos_King	oh ok.. what is sda6 then? because i remember seeing sda6 a lot when i was trying to boot ubuntu before. and also in my filesystem, is the "88.2GB Media" or "Filesystem" device my ubuntu install on the hdd?
2010-05-30T05:23:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	    sda5 is '/' or root, 'sda6' is the 'swap partition' or the virtual memory one, from the paste, is a 3.5gbs one
2010-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	azolap	Typos_King	ok so i've just tried 'sudo e2fschk -c /dev/sda5' but i got e2fschk: command not found
2010-05-30T05:27:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   e2fsck :)
2010-05-30T05:28:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   which we warned you about several minutes ago
2010-05-30T05:28:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   unmount it first, then retry it
2010-05-30T05:31:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	  depends on cpu speed and memory, and partition size, yes, it can take 1hr or more
2010-05-30T05:31:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   usually you want to hehe, yes
2010-05-30T05:36:00.000Z	azolap	Typos_King	it found another problem.. Error reading block 8355841 while reading inode and block bitmaps. Ignore error<y>?
2010-05-30T05:37:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   yes, you can ignore them for now, at the end, it will do an auto fix
2010-05-30T05:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	   chances are, it will, yes, it will try to fix and then say that you need to reboot, however, based on the DRDY ERR message, I'd think the errors will keep coming back, and you will reneed to run e2fsck again to be able to log back in, whenever not being able to, reason being, I'd think is your HD has bad sectors/clusters
2010-05-30T05:45:00.000Z	azolap	Typos_King	oh right i see.. so i will really need a new hard drive? but this should enable me to log back into ubuntu for a short time and take a backup of my files?
2010-05-30T05:46:00.000Z	Typos_King	azolap	  right
