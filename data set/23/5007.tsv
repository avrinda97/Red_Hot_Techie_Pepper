2007-03-17T11:53:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	assuming sufficient ram. (196m+) i'd guess you need to hit [ctrl] +[alt] +[f1]   and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	intelikey		when it blanks out on you  ^
2007-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	intelikey		nice flook
2007-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	tried ctrl-alt-f1, nothing happens. ive ot 768mb ram
2007-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	intelikey		flood
2007-03-17T11:56:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	frame buffer is out of sync.   that happens    boot with  vga=normal nosplash     added to the kernel line.   that might get you as far as a console so you can reconfig the xserver
2007-03-17T11:56:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	to give you a better idea of what happening: just as xserver is about to load, its as if someone has unplugged my monitor/keyb/mouse. its not that my monitor has gone black, but has no signal
2007-03-17T11:57:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	yeah  try that boot line  ^   might help.
2007-03-17T11:57:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	so vga=normal nosplash?
2007-03-17T11:58:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	yes.    but i make no promices  that it will fix it.   it "might."
2007-03-17T11:59:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	thanks for that. this is probably asking too much, but any ideas on how to reconfigure the xserver once i hit console?
2007-03-17T11:59:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	the xserver on the live CD uses vesa   the splash uses frame buffering  some times the two are incompatable    if that don't help you can try the "alternate" install CD it has the textmode installer.
2007-03-17T12:00:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-17T12:00:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	and where can i get the 'alternate' install CD from?
2007-03-17T12:00:00.000Z	intelikey		that's the command you want in the console ^ ohana
2007-03-17T12:01:00.000Z	intelikey	ohana	from the same place you got the live.
2007-03-17T12:01:00.000Z	intelikey		!alternate | ohana
2007-03-17T12:02:00.000Z	intelikey		i'm gone for a while. later folks.
2007-03-17T12:02:00.000Z	ohana	intelikey	ok, so once i use that command in console, what will that do? or is there something else i need to do once that goes through?
