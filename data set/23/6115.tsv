2007-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	stefano		by the way i am having trouble with dynamic dns since ever, i am certain i set it up correctly but i keep getting abuse-email
2007-12-03T17:53:00.000Z	stefano		i should say it should refresh only when the ipa has changed, but apperantly thats not the case
2007-12-03T17:55:00.000Z	stefano		uh
2007-12-03T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	what client?
2008-03-14T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	ie if I use chsh to set my shell to zsh, I never see bash
2008-03-14T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	chsh
2008-03-14T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	why?
2008-03-14T19:07:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	special purposes :-)
2008-03-14T19:07:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	i am writing my own shell, just for fun
2008-03-14T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	why won't chsh do what you asked?
2008-03-14T19:08:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	i want users that log in via ssh be able to see my shell in action without ever seeing a bash
2008-03-14T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	chsh changes your login shell
2008-03-14T19:10:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	sounds good, is it permanently as well?
2008-03-14T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	yes
2008-03-14T19:10:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	thank you very much
2008-03-14T19:14:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	chsh complains that /bin/myprogram is not a valid shell
2008-03-14T19:14:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	i got it working before when i was setting up a MUD though
2008-03-14T19:14:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	but i don't remember how i did it :>
2008-03-14T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	stefano	/etc/shells lists acceptable shells
2008-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	stefano	jrib	thanks, i just read it in the manpage, sorry for the stupid question
