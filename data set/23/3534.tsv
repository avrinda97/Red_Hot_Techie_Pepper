2008-09-22T18:57:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	if you have both repos installed - skype will be installed from the repo that contains the highest version i.e. the skype repo
2008-09-22T18:57:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	NO, if I am on AMD64 (64bit) i can definitely not install it through the repo
2008-09-22T18:58:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	which repo are you referring to here?
2008-09-22T18:58:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	this one
2008-09-22T18:59:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	did you update APT before you tried installing skype?
2008-09-22T18:59:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	yes ofcourse
2008-09-22T18:59:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	what does  apt-cache policy skype  give you then?
2008-09-22T19:00:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	fixes are only suggested if the page is known to have errors - but we haven't established that yet.
2008-09-22T19:01:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	 1. repo is added, 2. im on 64bit, 3. skype is not there: conclusion: the page is wrong :P
2008-09-22T19:03:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	it's likely that the skype repo doesn't have a 64bit build - but then again, the skype howto tells you what to do if you need a 64bit version.
2009-10-21T21:57:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	a bit, what's the question?
2009-10-21T21:58:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	in man gnome-session there are 3 files mentioned but on my system none of them are present and also running gnome-session-safe does not create any session file
2009-10-21T21:59:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	 session files are created in ~/.config/gnome-session i believe - do you have that directory and anything within it?
2009-10-21T22:00:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	im looking for that issue because in system->preferences->apperance->visual effects my settings are not saved and always reverted on reboot, i believe it has something to do with the session management
2009-10-21T22:02:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	yeah there are several files present, do you have any idea why the visual effects applet would want to delete the ~/.gnome2/session file?
2009-10-21T22:02:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	i'm not totally sure -- but i believe the  ~/.gnome2/session  is no longer used
2009-10-21T22:02:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	then is that a bug?
2009-10-21T22:03:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	well, if you have this file and it is not being used - then it's not a bug.  but if you're getting an app wanting this file or to delete it, then yes, it's a bug./
2009-10-21T22:04:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	hmm, would be nice to talk to the guy that wrote the patch, any idea who is the maintainer of gnome-control-center?
2009-10-21T22:05:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	that info should be available on http://packages.ubuntu.com
2009-10-21T22:05:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	thanks
2009-10-21T22:07:00.000Z	lanoxx	unop	so u are sure that ~/.gnome2/session is not used any more? cause then i would report the bug against gnome-control-center
2009-10-21T22:07:00.000Z	unop	lanoxx	i'm fairly sure, not 100%
