2009-12-09T09:12:00.000Z	datz		Hi, I want to update my packages via the command line. How can I do this?
2009-12-09T09:12:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	sudo apt-get update
2009-12-09T09:12:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	followed by sudo apt-get upgrade install
2009-12-09T09:13:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	thanks, how do I know if the system needs to be restarted?
2009-12-09T09:13:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	only really need to reboot if you installed kernal packages
2009-12-09T09:14:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	it only warns you to reboot if you're using the update manager... also if you login to the system remotely via ssh
2009-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	linus has been on a tear with kernal updates lately
2009-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	I'm on 8.04 now btw
2009-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	I think mostly due to the ext4 filesystem and some timing things
2009-12-09T09:17:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	I only have access via ssh now, and I need to restart a bunch of stuff
2009-12-09T09:17:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	init 6 baby :s
2009-12-09T09:18:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	do sudo reboot
2009-12-09T09:18:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	ok, thanks
2009-12-09T09:18:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	open another term and ping the host you needed and when it comes back up you can ssh back in
2009-12-09T09:19:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	ok... guess I'll do that, thanks.
2009-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	oh, yea..there's no indication of wheather a reboot is needed, right?
2009-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	not really, you should not have to if it's just a server you ssh into
2009-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	I may restart my server once a month
2009-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	it's probably been about that, expect for the mysterious restart that occured earlier today..which is part of the reason I want to update. :)
2009-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	would it hurt to reboot it?
2009-12-09T09:22:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	are you knocking the local churches website offline?
2009-12-09T09:22:00.000Z	dtownhero	datz	if not, do it. be brave.
2009-12-09T09:22:00.000Z	datz	dtownhero	lol..nope, just checking, if there was indication of needed reboot, since ther isn't, goting to now
