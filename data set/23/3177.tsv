2008-07-02T14:48:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	you could've just moved it :-)
2008-07-02T14:58:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	what's the deal with the kernel version spam?
2008-07-02T14:58:00.000Z	Zaber	sipior	what?
2008-07-02T14:59:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	well, i was just curious why you were asking folks if they were running a specific kernel. it seemed kind of random.
2008-07-02T15:00:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	and reinstalling the relevant kernel package is not an option?
2008-07-02T15:00:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	reinstalling the package, friend, not the entire system :-)
2008-07-02T15:02:00.000Z	Zaber	sipior	-- the problem is my package-manager -- its broken
2008-07-02T15:02:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	heh, that's unfortunate. how'd that happen?
2008-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	what file are you missing?
2008-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	you could steal it from the package
2008-07-02T15:05:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	no need to install it, merely unpack the archive
2008-07-02T15:10:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	well, what error are you getting?
2008-07-02T15:26:00.000Z	sipior	Zaber	why not simply grab debconf, extract the archive manually, and install the relevant files by hand?
