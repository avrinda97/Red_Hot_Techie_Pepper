2007-11-16T21:00:00.000Z	Isolder		What would cause me to not have sudo access on a fresh server install? that can't be default.. otherwise I'd be unable to do anything?
2007-11-16T21:00:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	is your user member of the admin group?
2007-11-16T21:01:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	let's just verify that: run 'groups' and see if 'admin' is listed
2007-11-16T21:03:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	to fix this, you can reboot in recovery mode (grub menu option) and run 'adduser username admin'
2007-11-16T21:03:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	did you only create the one user during install?
2007-11-16T21:04:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	no, once will fix it.
2007-11-16T21:04:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	after that, you'll be able to use sudo
2007-11-16T21:05:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	no, somehow you've created a non-default install in that respect.
2007-11-16T21:05:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	odder things have been known to happen.
2007-11-16T21:07:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	no, normally it sets up one user and adds that to the admin group automatically
2007-11-16T21:16:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	is Windows MR any better in that respect?
2007-11-16T21:17:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	indeed, I mean ME ;)
2007-11-16T21:18:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	okay, I'll keep it in mind (got an old ME laptop that I sometimes use for serial devices)
2007-11-16T21:19:00.000Z	Isolder	soundray	installing the server again and i dont think it's going to give me admin privileges, this isn uts
2007-11-16T21:19:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	what's your install source? Ubuntu Server CD?
2007-11-16T21:21:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	I'll quickly check launchpad for reports...
2007-11-16T21:23:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	it's been reported: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debian-installer/+bug/158952  -- could you please add a comment confirming it?
2007-11-16T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	great, thank you
2007-11-16T21:25:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	did you test the workaround I suggested?
2007-11-16T21:25:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	the report mentions fixing /etc/sudoers, which shouldn't be necessary IMO
2007-11-16T21:48:00.000Z	Isolder	soundray	i'm now trying to recover and i think i may have been wrong
2007-11-16T21:48:00.000Z	Isolder	soundray	i'm reading the group file and it shows adm: redone
2007-11-16T21:48:00.000Z	soundray	Isolder	no, adm != admin
