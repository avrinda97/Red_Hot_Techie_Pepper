2009-11-18T18:28:00.000Z	thanda	indus	You can look into the screen-shot, it says 10.04 which is not released.
2009-11-18T18:28:00.000Z	indus	thanda	hehe
2009-11-18T18:29:00.000Z	thanda		I think, update-manager -d is little crazy to deal with. ;-)
2009-11-18T18:30:00.000Z	thanda		Yes, I am getting the point, but lynx is not released yet.
2009-11-18T18:31:00.000Z	thanda		I suppose, it would be best to leave it as it is...and wait for another six months...
