2010-09-22T02:02:00.000Z	Shwaiil		Q: I'm trying to install rapache, but trough terminal it says there's no rapache package. Also, using synaptic, is not listed there. Any help ? Thanks
2010-09-22T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	what is rapache?
2010-09-22T02:02:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	 hi! Its a GUI for apache
2010-09-22T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	http://www.stefanoforenza.com/rapache-on-ubuntu-10-04-not-likely/
2010-09-22T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	why do you want a gui?
2010-09-22T02:06:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	 for example, to start/stop the server, doing it manually its like typing 14 keys, while with a simple one or two clicks you stop and start the server, and so on
2010-09-22T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	is that it?
2010-09-22T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	if you really need to start and stop the server that much and feel like "sudo service apache2 stop" is too much typing, create an alias.  Or if you want some sort of clickable thing which imo is less efficient, write a one line shell script you click on.  Honestly though, I don't see why you would be starting and stopping the server so often for it to be an issue
2010-09-22T02:11:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	was giving just a prespective, after experiencing xamp,wamp,etc stuff like that. I didnt knew I could 'sudo service apache2 stop", I was doing it diferently, anyway thanks
2010-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	try #vbox
2010-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	been trying, but no reply back, no one in the room maybe
2010-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	last time I tried it "just worked"
2011-10-06T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	what do you mean by "there's no shell for it"
2011-10-06T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	like?
2011-10-06T01:39:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	stop apache or restart
2011-10-06T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	that's just « sudo service apache2 start » or « sudo service apache2 stop » in your terminal
2011-10-06T01:40:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	ok but, if u dont know the command or you're not woste to CLI,, it's not that simple. I would like to know if there's a GUI for LAMP on ubuntu. Would make life much easier when working with diferent people now woste to linux
2011-10-06T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	that's the command for starting and stopping services :)  What else do you need to do?
2011-11-13T23:37:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	if you don't like it, don't use it :x  there are plenty of desktop environments and window managers to choose from
2011-11-13T23:38:00.000Z	Shwaiil	jrib	they could at least, let people choose.. like theme "classic"
2011-11-13T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	you can choose
2011-11-13T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	Shwaiil	if you really want that gnome2 feel though, I'd suggest xfce
