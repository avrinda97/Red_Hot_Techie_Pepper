2008-04-01T05:30:00.000Z	kelvin911		i mean real 3d desktop
2008-04-01T05:30:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	when you have a 3d card and the appropriate drivers
2008-04-01T05:31:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	how 3d can it get, nobody has a true volumetric display on the market yet
2008-04-01T05:31:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	look at the youtube link, i dont mean compiz-fusion, i have it, but i want something like that in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ
2008-04-01T05:32:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	look at the link it looks quite real
2008-04-01T05:33:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	hmmm.. ok. Yes, I've seen that b4 .. it doesn't look all that practical to me. and afaik there's no desktop like that on linux yet.
2008-04-01T05:35:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	i know it isnt that practical but it does impress people
2008-04-01T05:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	I prefer useful stuff like zoom, expo, group and tab, etc.
2008-04-01T05:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	I don't really need a way to make my computer desktop as messy as my real desktop.. I can live without that
2008-04-01T13:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	 I think  rename /^/a *.avi
2008-04-01T13:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	for that I would use "ls -1 *.jpg | { x=0 ; while read file ; do mv "$file" image_${x}.jpg ; x= $[ $x + 1 ]; done }
2008-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	for watching things, 'motion' is aewsome..
2008-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	watching what?
2008-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	i uses vlc to watch movies and listening to music
2008-04-01T13:50:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	only mplayer for realplayer
2008-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	current lappy is asus... only got 256M ram in it tho so it sucks bigtime..
2008-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	i will never buy laptop that has 256MB only, not even in 2002
2008-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	for laptop u want more ram than usual
2008-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	if running xp
2008-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	I didn't buy it.. I got given it after the guy who had it upgraded, and he flogged half the ram for his new lappy :)
2008-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	kelvin911	zcat[1]	nice
2008-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kelvin911	well, I can't really complain :)
