2006-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	andy		hi all, I have 2 sata hard drives (One with WinXP and one with Ubuntu).  Is there a way I can make my computer ask me which drive I would like to boot into?
2006-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	andy		could you reccomend a boot loader
2006-10-07T12:55:00.000Z	andy		?
2006-10-07T12:56:00.000Z	andy		ok, Ill google it, thanks
2006-10-07T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	grub will do that, so will lilo.  grub is the default ubuntu bootloader
2006-10-07T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	if you've already installed ubuntu, read the first link ubotu is sening you
2006-10-07T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	check your query from ubotu
2006-10-24T08:44:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	if you don't know, you're almost certainly not ;)
2006-10-28T05:12:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	what reasons do they give?  your prior comments are rather vague
2006-10-28T05:12:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	ok, will post
2006-10-28T05:16:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28743/
2006-10-28T05:17:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	i dont see why it cant just keep alcarte as it is
2006-10-28T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	that's an error, it looks like.  In alacarte's dependencies, would you mind filing a bug at launchpad.net?
2006-10-28T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	just a clerical error, looks like the dependency is misversioned
2006-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	seems like an aptitude problem to me... it says this for 263 other packages...
2006-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	plus synaptic does not do it
2006-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	oh, well, maybe Im not seeing something.  Definately file a bug though.
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	ok, where exactly, please
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	launchpad.net then search for the aptitude, then file a bug
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	will do :-)
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	Flannel	andy	thanks.  Just give as much info as you can.
2006-10-28T05:21:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	sure
2006-10-28T05:59:00.000Z	andy	Flannel	launchpad says to use the official bugtracker for aptitude, do you know where that is please?
