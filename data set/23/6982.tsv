2006-01-09T16:57:00.000Z	app		Then, isn't there any "general Ubuntu talk" channel?
2006-01-09T16:59:00.000Z	app		BTW  I still did not manage to get ntp installed with the clock. I need help! And I want help in making the clock applet default GUI working, not help by circumventing the problem with separate NTP install with synaptic or apt-get. I want everything to work, and first and most I want the default tools to work!
2006-01-09T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	app	ntpdate is installed by default afaik
2006-01-09T17:01:00.000Z	app	Seveas	and rob_lt: Why does the screen clock not enable NTP, but insists on failing to install it again and again? This is a fresh 5.10 install I just booted the first time.
2006-01-09T17:01:00.000Z	Seveas	app	what's the error you get?
2006-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	Seveas	app	I'm failing to understand what you are doing...
2006-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	Seveas	app	ah, that's indeed a bug, it should immediately know that ntp support is available...
2006-01-09T07:03:00.000Z	Seveas	app	!tty in the /etc/sudoers Defaults
2006-01-10T16:38:00.000Z	Seveas	app	hold <alt>, click, drag
2006-01-10T16:43:00.000Z	app	Seveas	alt-dragging will not lift windows through the upper edge of the screen, not with Metacity defaults. Can you change that?
2006-01-10T16:43:00.000Z	Seveas	app	for me it does..
2006-01-10T16:44:00.000Z	Seveas	app	as I said: /me :)
2006-01-10T16:59:00.000Z	app	Seveas	says its working for him, Jowi.
2006-01-10T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	app	oddly enough, it only worked with the ati installer
2006-01-10T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	app	I can't move normal gnome-terminal above that border
2006-01-10T17:06:00.000Z	Seveas	app	oddly enough, it only worked with the ati installer<--
2006-01-10T17:06:00.000Z	Seveas	app	I can't move normal gnome-terminal above that border<--
2006-01-10T17:10:00.000Z	Seveas	app	that's bad...
2006-01-10T17:11:00.000Z	Seveas	app	grab the correct one from my repo
2006-01-10T17:13:00.000Z	Seveas	app	that's arguable but thanks :)
2006-01-10T17:28:00.000Z	app	Seveas	I installed your mirrors with custom section, but no skype with apt-cache search?
2006-01-10T17:31:00.000Z	Seveas	app	skype is in extras, not in custom
2006-03-07T17:09:00.000Z	Seveas	app	roflol :D
