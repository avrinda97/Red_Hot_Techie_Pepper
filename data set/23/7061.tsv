2005-10-22T14:51:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	stupid question: is xdm vital for u r it's for the fun of researching how things work?
2005-10-22T14:52:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	it is vital.
2005-10-22T14:52:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	for ltsp?
2005-10-22T14:52:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	we are trying to avoid the overhead of gdm/kdm on a ltsp system which will be on livecd/dvd.  small footprint as possible.
2005-10-22T14:54:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	cause i just setup ltsp with no xdm running. but now indeed i don't know if things are better with xdm
2005-10-22T14:54:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	which dm did you use?
2005-10-22T14:55:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	gdm with XDMCP enable=true in gdm.conf
2005-10-22T14:55:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	yes.  We have been able to get it working with gdm as well.  just dont want the overhead of the gnome libraries etc.... that comes with that.
2005-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	ok am not good enough with all that (not say stupid to the strongest point) can't help sry
2005-10-22T14:57:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	np. thx anyway.
2005-10-22T14:58:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	u might help me though. what kernel do u have in /var/lib/tftpboot?
2005-10-22T15:00:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	I actually repointed tftpboot to /tftpboot instead of /var/lib but to answer your question, it is the 2.4.26-ltsp-3/pxelinux.0
2005-10-22T15:00:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	k ty
2005-10-22T15:01:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	when last I spoke with jim from ltsp, the 2.6 kernel did not yet work correctly and he suggested using the 2.4.
2005-10-22T15:01:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	is ltsp or ubuntu doing the detection?
2005-10-22T15:01:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	what do you mean by detection?
2005-10-22T15:02:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	xorg detection i guess. X_CONFIGURE = Ubuntu
2005-10-22T15:03:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	in lts.conf
2005-10-22T15:04:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	my lts.conf just leaves it as XSERVER = auto
2005-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	i changed it to X_CONFIGURE = Ubuntu but still throw me to low vesa while edubuntu recognises the good card. but i think that comes from the kernel in fact and this is too big a thing for to recompile
2005-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	beyond my knowledge.  you might ask on #ltsp.  I am sure they could answer.
2005-10-22T15:07:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	sbartleylinux	gonna try edubuntu
2005-10-22T15:07:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	bluefrog-10	cool. thx again.
