2007-11-28T03:59:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	 Are you trying to install from source?  ...some application?
2007-11-28T04:00:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	And what application would that be?

2007-11-28T04:14:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	I dono;  Maybe  libconf and / or depmod -a
2007-11-28T04:15:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	did you first do make  ?
2007-11-28T04:15:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	What are you installing?   (What tarball did you download? From where?)
2007-11-28T04:16:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	Have you first checked to see that the application or package is not in Ubuntu repositories?
2007-11-28T04:18:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	If you will tell us what you are trying to do, we will be able to help you more effectively.
2007-11-28T04:19:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	 If your primary language is not English, there are other Ubuntu channels for other languages...
2007-11-28T04:21:00.000Z	jc	libnet-problem	 Just ask your questions.  Don't argue.  Arguments will do no one any good.
