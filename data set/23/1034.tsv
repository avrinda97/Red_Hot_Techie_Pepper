2010-10-01T05:09:00.000Z	phil_in_london		swiss army knife that one is.
2010-10-01T05:10:00.000Z	phil_in_london		habs, try a right click on your icon in the upper left most of the screen, that gets you to menu editor, then look through the options for anything related to what you want that is NOT checked and check it.
2010-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Thanks, I'll try that.
2010-10-01T05:15:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	It looks like I'm only able to edit what programs are in the top bars in that "edit menus" menu, and not the icons. And Notification Area is already added to the "Add to Panel" menu bobstro.
2010-10-01T05:16:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	I'm on the admin account.
2010-10-01T05:18:00.000Z	phil_in_london	Habs	if you have that option available to you, then definitely yes.
2010-10-01T05:57:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	The only thing related to network or notification is the Notification Area, which is already added.
2010-10-01T06:00:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Already did that a while ago. The only thing that gets changed when i remove it is my printer icon and the three little lines, which come right back after i re-add it.
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	phil_in_london	Habs	nothing that says NetworkManager Applet?
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Definitely nope.
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	phil_in_london	Habs	okay, hang on then.
2010-10-01T06:02:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Ok, thanks.
2010-10-01T06:07:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Ok, now I get the Network Connectiojs shortcut on my top bar. I can't connect to a network through Network Connections.
2010-10-01T06:10:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	I am connecting to wireless, and no, I didn't have a network connections icon before, but it doesn't help much that I have one now because i cant connect to a network through it and I can access it from System -> Preferences.
2010-10-01T06:12:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Ok, one sec.
2010-10-01T06:14:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	So wicd is installed.
2010-10-01T06:16:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	"Home AP".
2010-10-01T06:17:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Oh. I don't know my nick then.
2010-10-01T06:19:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	So wcid seems to work. Still not getting the top icon though. I don't know my nic, but I know I was able to connect to this network a few days ago on Ubuntu.
2010-10-01T06:20:00.000Z	phil_in_london	Habs	okay, so, wicd can see it , so its a piece of hardware familiar to ubuntu, now we just gotta figure out how to get it back into the notification bar.
2010-10-01T06:21:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	Printer, time, Bluetooth, sound, messages, my user, and the shutoff controls.
2010-10-01T06:26:00.000Z	Habs	phil_in_london	When I right click it i just see launch, properties, remove from panel, etc.
