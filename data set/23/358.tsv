2011-11-12T22:49:00.000Z	ft_mn		Hi, I have messed up things with the bootloader, I have one Hard Disk splited into two partitions one of them is NTFS(windows) and the other one is ext4(Ubuntu)... Now I cant boot from none of them, so I have an Ubuntu live cd booting from... The thing is that even with the Live cd I cant install grub to one of my partitions what can i do?
2011-11-12T22:50:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	grub has been uninstalled?
2011-11-12T22:51:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	now it is on the Ubuntu partition
2011-11-12T22:52:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	no*
2011-11-12T22:53:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	open a command line, mount the ubuntu-partition,
2011-11-12T22:53:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	ok...
2011-11-12T22:55:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	what is next ?
2011-11-12T22:55:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	which grub version was installed? you can see in #ubuntu-partition/sbin/grub*???
2011-11-12T22:56:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	there is no such a grub folder in the sbin directory.... only in the boot/ directory there is grub
2011-11-12T22:57:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	ls  #ubuntu-part/sbin/grub*
2011-11-12T22:58:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	No such file or directory
2011-11-12T23:01:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	is there something on the grub.cfg file that might help?
2011-11-12T23:01:00.000Z	ft_mn		I think that all i need is to install grub properly on the MBR
2011-11-12T23:02:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	 I think that all i need is to install grub properly on the MBR... I have a small partition that I can dedicate it to grub but i dont know how to do it
2011-11-12T23:03:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	you can run grub-install --sthinglikeroot=
2011-11-12T23:04:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	if you had grub2-install (from the livecd) you could ran: grub2-install --boot-directory=#ubuntu
2011-11-12T23:05:00.000Z	ft_mn	iExist	it doesnt have grub2
2011-11-12T23:05:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	just a sec

2011-11-12T23:06:00.000Z	iExist	ft_mn	grub-install --root-directory=/#ubuntu/boot  /dev/sda maybe
