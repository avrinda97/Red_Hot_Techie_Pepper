2011-08-09T19:54:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		im looking for a http redirecting service to bypass router restrictions
2011-08-09T19:54:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	you could use tor
2011-08-09T19:56:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	tnx for hint, would vpn for ubuntu do that too?
2011-08-09T19:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	it could, but vpn wouldn't be the easier of the two.
2011-08-09T19:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	all you need is a proxy. If you need the resources on another network, or you want your browsing to be done through a consistent and known network, then vpn would be better
2011-08-09T19:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	otherwise, just use Tor with a browser button or vidalia
2011-08-09T19:59:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	tnx
2011-08-09T19:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	if it's just for one website you could also use a web-based proxy like proxify.com or ninjaproxy.com
2011-08-09T20:02:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	the proxy websites are also blocked by the linux router restrictions (hotspot provider)
2011-08-09T20:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	if you're at a hotspot, you can probably set manual dns servers for that hotspot. edit the connection, change auto dns to google's public dns servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
2011-08-09T20:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	you might have to reconnect to the hotspot (not sure)
2011-08-09T20:05:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	i hear good things about mullvad too for ubuntu (swedish vpn)
2011-08-09T20:07:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	maybe, but if you just need to get to sites blocked at a public hotspot, setting your own dns will probably do the trick. It depends on the talent of the person setting it up  ;)
2011-08-09T20:07:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	its pretty talented because its a linux restricted hotspot with lotta proxy's added to restrictions
2011-08-09T20:08:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	any url you know of that could bypass such?
2011-08-09T20:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	but they might only be blocking the dns requests. The Starbucks and Coffee Culture I go to both filter sites with DNS. By not using their dns, nothing is blocked, and then I use a proxy or Tor for privacy
2011-08-09T20:10:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	nice, tnx for the trick mate
2011-08-09T20:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	np.
2012-10-04T08:56:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	with the route add
2012-10-04T08:56:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	but it will take a good look at the man page
2012-10-04T08:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	I thought that if the subnet for his server is 3 255.255.255.0 then all non "this subnet" packets will go to the default gateway (internet). Not all routers will let you hit the outside ip from within the network
2012-10-04T09:02:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Seven_Six_Two	he got windows laptop yes, but he wants to try the ubuntu laptop with openssh server running
2012-10-04T09:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lotuspsychje	it's on the same subnet.
