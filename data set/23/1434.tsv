2010-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Interested in buying a Hummer?  It looks pretty but it is really useless.  A rock have higher purpose than that. :)
2010-04-27T11:27:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Export it as PDF or something?
2010-04-27T11:28:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	that could work, MrH: I need help on making sure pics that are on the slide will show no matter the comp os
2010-04-27T11:29:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Curse your classroom. Install Ubuntu 10.04 on his/her machine then open the powerpoint file.
2010-04-27T11:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	um the school district is really strict about what goes onto the comps
2010-04-27T11:32:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	That was a joke. See what happen when school tried to use proprietary software? More cesspool and does not help anyone at all. Exporting PDF or creating a website could work.
2010-04-27T11:42:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	I wonder if MrH_ ditched me D=
2010-04-27T11:45:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Your PPT file probably broke his machine.
2010-04-27T11:46:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	D=
2010-04-27T11:46:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	XD
2010-04-27T11:46:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	this ppt is more hassle than it seemed
2010-04-27T11:52:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Convert TIFF to png (like MrH_ say).
2010-06-12T11:06:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	From search engines.
2010-06-12T11:07:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Check your print manufacturer for support/download (drivers)
2010-06-12T11:07:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	ok
2010-06-12T11:10:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	yay there is a new cannon linux repo
2010-06-12T11:11:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	;3
2011-04-18T12:22:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	thats a horrid idea if you don't need to
2011-04-18T12:23:00.000Z	red2kic	ShapeShifter499	Installing Windows theme to confuse people is a terrible idea too. :\
2011-04-18T12:23:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	not really... install wine1.3 along with it and not too many will notice :p
2011-04-18T12:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	red2kic	any Linux  to look like windows and be able to run windows stuff too is a #epicwin considering (afaik) Linux isn't MS
