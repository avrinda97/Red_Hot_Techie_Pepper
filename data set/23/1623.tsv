2010-04-02T23:30:00.000Z	PatrickGleason	brontosaurusrex	cool beans. I am trying to come up with an ubuntu workflow, but it is hard.
2010-04-02T23:33:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	what are the weak spots you have?
2010-04-02T23:34:00.000Z	PatrickGleason	brontosaurusrex	well basically I never realized how wonderfully the creative suite all works together
2010-04-02T23:35:00.000Z	PatrickGleason	brontosaurusrex	plus i have no experience with inkscape, gimp, sribus, kompozer AT ALL
2010-04-02T23:36:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	inkscape and gimp are worth some learing, other two not in my experience
2010-04-02T23:36:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		*learning
2010-04-02T23:37:00.000Z	PatrickGleason	brontosaurusrex	so what can you use in leiu of those for dw and id?
2010-04-02T23:38:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	dw, nothing, whats id?
2010-04-02T23:39:00.000Z	PatrickGleason	brontosaurusrex	Indesign. Page Layout. no really web, but still use it often
2010-04-02T23:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	yes, there is nothing else i tryed than scribus
2010-04-02T23:41:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	but that was mostly to compose various logo versions for example...
2010-04-02T23:43:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	PatrickGleason	btw, you may want to look at ubuntustudio and its packs for other alternatives
