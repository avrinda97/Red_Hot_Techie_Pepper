2009-01-26T22:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	you use synaptic to install software
2009-01-26T22:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	are you trying to use something like apt-get at the same time as synaptic?
2009-01-26T22:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	what exactly are you doing when you get the error?
2009-01-26T22:55:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	installing packages
2009-01-26T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	okay, how are you installing packages?
2009-01-26T22:56:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	using synaptic package manager
2009-01-26T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	okay
2009-01-26T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	and you're only using synaptic?
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	can I be doing that and using Add/remove to install software
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	no
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	you can only use one package manager at a time
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	That's slow
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	there is a database that keeps track of which packages that are installed
2009-01-26T22:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	you can tell the package manager to install more than one package at a time
2009-01-26T22:59:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	Is there a site I can download a whole collection of packages and install?
2009-01-26T22:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	probably
2009-01-26T23:00:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	It looks like using the package manager after fresh installation is really slow
2009-01-26T23:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	maybe your net connection is slow
2009-01-26T23:01:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	It makes the ladder to high to climb
2009-01-26T23:02:00.000Z	kwesi	gordonjcp	I am in Ghana
2009-01-26T23:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	hmm
2009-01-26T23:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kwesi	perhaps you can change your package manager to use a mirror closer to you
