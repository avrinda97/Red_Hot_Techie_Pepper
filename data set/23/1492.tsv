2010-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	 if i type in the terminal coky starts
2010-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	 oups no...i don't know how to do that.
2010-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	and were conky is installed.
2010-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	I can't remember if conky needs root to run, does it?
2010-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	nope..no root neded.
2010-03-12T09:54:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	needed*
2010-03-12T09:54:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	where is conky installed
2010-03-12T09:55:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	i could try with the browse option maybe it will start.
2010-03-12T09:56:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	you could try a bit of a hack and make a script in your home directory that you call with the startup app
2010-03-12T09:56:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	 i don't know how to write that script yet...
2010-03-12T09:58:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	like, create a file in /home called "conky_start.sh" and put in it: "#!/bin/bash conky -c yourconfig". Then make it executable: "chmod a+x conky_start.sh". then add the script to the startup manager
2010-03-12T09:58:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	 thanks i'll try right now, thanks so much
2010-03-12T09:58:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	only thank when it works ;)
2010-03-12T10:00:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	if you need clarification of those instructions tell me. They were a bit slack
2010-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	void_pointer		the plastic would melt before the chips "baked"
2010-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	no it's ok...i done that i hope it will work
2010-03-12T10:02:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	if not I have more hacky ways to start things :)
2010-03-12T10:02:00.000Z	serverduck	void_pointer	i got to eat something, thank you so much
2010-03-12T10:02:00.000Z	void_pointer	serverduck	same
