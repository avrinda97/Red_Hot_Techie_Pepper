2006-03-15T11:12:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx		I have a problem trying to upgrade my sources.list, the message said.. : W: Coulnd't stat sorce package list http://package.freecontrb.org breezy/free Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/ packages.freecontrb.org_ubuntu_plf_dists_breezy_free_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 no such file or directory)  what should I do?
2006-03-15T11:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	comment that line out
2006-03-15T11:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	can you say "non-offical repo"
2006-03-15T11:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	I mean it can give you a whole slew of trouble
2006-03-15T11:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	their server may be down, may have changed, the file may be removed
2006-03-15T11:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	you should check out "easyubuntu", it uses the plf repos, but is much safer
2006-03-15T11:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	oh, is that what's causing the error?
2006-03-15T11:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	sure, you can even see what's going on in #easyubuntu
2006-03-15T11:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	if you use easyubuntu, then I'd say you would no longer really need the plf line in your source.list
2006-03-15T11:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	that's why having unoffical repos can break systems
2006-03-15T11:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	if you don't mind me asking, what's the program you want
2006-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	ok, comment out that line and sudo apt-get update
2006-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	you don't have any other unoffical repos in there do you?
2006-03-15T11:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	like debian ones
2006-03-15T11:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	you can paste your sources.list on pastebin and I'll have a look
2006-03-15T11:22:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	check your pm
2006-03-15T11:23:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	tristanmike	 here u go..  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9964
2006-03-15T11:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	yeah, comment out the wine/opera lines, leave soulmachine commented
2006-03-15T11:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	the thing about "non-offical repos" is, they're ok if you trust them but only have them active when you are getting software that is strickly from those, then when you get the stuff, comment them out again, don't leave them active and you should be good to go
2006-03-15T11:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	what you have is ok, stick with that and you'll be fine
2006-03-15T11:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	just make sure you leave all unoffical repos commented untill you need them
2006-03-15T11:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	brb
2006-03-15T11:28:00.000Z	tristanmike	Inf3ctedFx	type "/join #easyubuntu" for all you questions
