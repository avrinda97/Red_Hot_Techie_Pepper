2005-02-16T10:30:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	my cs46xx onboard supports hardware mixing :)
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	i spent many many hours fiddling with dmix when it was in CVS and barely documented before I realized my time would be better spent if I just bought an sblive
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	i can't buy an sblive for my lappy though
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	right, i know... hm...
2005-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	then you either need to use dmix or else do something more high-level
2005-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	no, my integreated supports hardware mixing :)
2005-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	then you are lucky :)
2005-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	me
2005-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	what's better?
2005-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	it's much nicer out of the box
2005-02-16T10:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	ok, that's a given :)
2005-02-16T10:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	but if i have a nice debian system setup perfect, why might i want ubunut? :)
2005-02-16T10:45:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	I wouldn't. But my debian setup (sid) was getting really fux0red after many a year. Firefox would not run properly. I tried a fresh install of sarge on a partition and it was so primitive, it would have taken forever to get it up to speed. Ubuntu is like a big headstart.
2005-02-16T10:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	how did you find sarge primitive?
2005-02-16T10:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	are you refering to apps, or just OTB experience/
2005-02-16T10:47:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	alsa, nvidia glx, growisofs
2005-02-16T10:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	hmmm
2005-02-16T10:47:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	palm pilot, udev
2005-02-16T10:48:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	all stuff that i can and have set up on debian, ubuntu saves me several hours doing that
2005-02-16T12:18:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	hmmm
2005-02-17T14:05:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	there is an ieda
2005-02-17T14:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pepperpot	didn't know that existed :)
2005-02-17T14:06:00.000Z	pepperpot	Dreamer3	actually i just did, and it doesn't say much about the specific levels
