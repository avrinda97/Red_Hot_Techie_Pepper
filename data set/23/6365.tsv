2009-04-05T02:49:00.000Z	keith		I get an error when trying to install my printer (server-error-internal-error) and I am not sure why. I installed the drivers from Lexmark, but still having no success. Can anyone help?
2009-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	keith		when I connect to localhost:631/printers it shows 0 out of 3 printers and I am not sure why
2009-04-05T02:52:00.000Z	keith		Can someone please help me install my Lexmark Z2300 printer?
2009-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	jdu	keith	if it is supported.  Plug it in and go to system > administration > printers    and add it.
2009-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	keith	jdu	if it was that simple, do you think I would be in here? :-p
2009-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	jdu	keith	sorry
2009-04-05T02:55:00.000Z	keith	jdu	Lexmark has drivers for it, but it doesn't seem to work after I install them. and Adding through the method you suggested causes an error.
2009-04-05T02:58:00.000Z	jdu	keith	yeah I am not sure how to help with that.   You might use the http://localhost:631/   interface rather than the ubuntu pygtk one
2009-04-05T03:00:00.000Z	keith	jdu	it shows 0 of 3 printers when I click to manage
2009-04-05T03:02:00.000Z	jdu	keith	what model number was it?
2009-04-05T03:02:00.000Z	keith	jdu	Lexmark Z2300
2009-04-05T03:04:00.000Z	jdu	keith	did you install from a .deb?
2009-04-05T03:04:00.000Z	keith	jdu	yes
2009-04-05T03:04:00.000Z	jdu	keith	did you run:  sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart
2009-04-05T03:04:00.000Z	keith	jdu	don't think so... but the system has been restarted. Shouldn't that do the same thing?
2009-04-05T03:05:00.000Z	jdu	keith	yes
2009-04-05T03:07:00.000Z	jdu	keith	so I am not sure,  as far as I can tell, it should be working .   Perhaps uninstall and then use the .tar.gz instead.
2009-04-05T03:07:00.000Z	jdu	keith	the website only mentions support for 8.04, but I wouldn't think it would matter
2009-04-05T03:08:00.000Z	keith	jdu	I didn't see that, I'll give that a shot perhaps. And yeah, I didn't think version should matter. How do I clear the three printers in there?
2009-04-05T03:09:00.000Z	jdu	keith	normally you click on Delete Printer, but you said it didn't show any right, but rather 0 of 3 printers
2009-04-05T03:09:00.000Z	jdu	keith	ie I'm not sure
2009-05-10T05:02:00.000Z	keith	jdu	Wouldn't it be better to let it autodetect the fs type?
2009-05-10T05:02:00.000Z	jdu	keith	probably, as long as it does
