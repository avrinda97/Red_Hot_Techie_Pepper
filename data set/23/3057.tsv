2008-08-13T03:17:00.000Z	jmichelsen_		I have a problem with a sata drive formatted in ntfs. The drive was sdf1 and is in fstab like that. Then for some reason I rebooted and it changed to sdb1 and want mount. Anyone have any idea here?

2008-08-13T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	i just changed to sdb1? you didn't change anything?.. why not just change the fstab entry to match the new device name?
2008-08-13T03:20:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	I am changing the fstab now, 1sec
2008-08-13T03:25:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	it usually doesn't change on it's own.. usually it's because you moved around some SATA connections or replaced hard drives or something
2008-08-13T03:25:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	all i did was reboot the pc
2008-08-13T03:25:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	no change internally at all
2008-08-13T03:26:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	then it shouldn't change.. but we'll blame it on the computer troll as usual =)
2008-08-13T03:27:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	lol yea no idea why it did that, guess i will just not reboot anymore
2008-08-13T03:27:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	how can i find the uuid?
2008-08-13T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	sudo blkid is one way
2008-08-13T03:27:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	didnt do anything lol
2008-08-13T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	nothing? running "sudo blkid" in a terminal didn't give you any output at all?
2008-08-13T03:29:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	no output
2008-08-13T03:29:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	sudo vol_id -u device gave me a # tho
2008-08-13T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	blkid might just give you already mounted filesystems.. not sure though
2008-08-13T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	but I guess any way to find out the uuid is fine
2008-08-13T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	yes
2008-08-13T03:30:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	yea either works, thanks
2008-08-13T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	or rather.. UUID=XXXXXXX
2008-08-13T03:31:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	ah great
2008-08-13T03:33:00.000Z	jmichelsen_	Slart	unop: great you guys, that mounted and all, thanks for all your help
2008-08-13T03:33:00.000Z	Slart	jmichelsen_	you're welcome
