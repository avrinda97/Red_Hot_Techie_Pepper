2011-04-11T21:55:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	try not to use the enter key so much.
2011-04-11T21:55:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 ok
2011-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	now have you double checked that the wires are right, and have you checked your settings yet?
2011-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 can u help me?
2011-04-11T21:57:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	ok, well that sounds like the eth0 isnt working then.
2011-04-11T21:58:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	does your ip require a user name and password to connect?
2011-04-11T21:58:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	and you have added?
2011-04-11T21:59:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	ok open terminal and see what dmesg says.
2011-04-11T22:00:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	also see what lspci says. it may be that you have to load the driver module for your eth0 in linux.
2011-04-11T22:00:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 actually I am in Windows 7 and for trying every command I have to restart and boot in Ubuntu
2011-04-11T22:02:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	ah i see, ok, well also check and see what ifconfig says as well.
2011-04-11T22:04:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 have u seen the post in the forrum
2011-04-11T22:07:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 have u checked the post
2011-04-11T22:07:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	im reading it now.
2011-04-11T22:09:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	did you try the cold boot option with the eth0 cord unplugged?
2011-04-11T22:10:00.000Z	prome	i_is_broke	 i did but of no use
2011-04-11T22:11:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	well he walked you threw most of what i would of too, so im really not going to be able to help much. maybe someone else in here is able too. now in the post you didnt put a password in where it said too. but it is there right.
2011-04-11T22:12:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	well good luck then. hope it works out for you.
2011-04-11T22:15:00.000Z	i_is_broke	prome	try checking with someone in #linux-hardware
