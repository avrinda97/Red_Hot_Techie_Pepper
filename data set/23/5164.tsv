2007-08-21T06:51:00.000Z	illriginal		anyone know if SATA, PCI Express, and Quad processors are compatible with Ubuntu?
2007-08-21T06:52:00.000Z	illriginal		good, im about to blow $1,200 on parts
2007-08-21T06:52:00.000Z	illriginal		lol and how about a terabyte hard drive?
2007-08-21T06:52:00.000Z	illriginal		woot
2007-08-21T06:53:00.000Z	illriginal		thanks for letting me know Vlet and Ju, really appreciate it!
2007-08-21T06:19:00.000Z	illriginal		Hey guys, I'm using Audicity to modify mp3s and make them into ring tones, but audicity needs a file: libmp3lame.so and i can't find this file on synaptic

2007-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	try installing lame... sudo apt-get install lame (?) Or use synaptic and search for lame...
2007-08-21T06:26:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	so - did it work?
2007-08-21T06:27:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	it is almost certainly in /usr/lib
2007-08-21T06:30:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	nope... not in there.
2007-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	dunno :-( Use Synaptic and search for "lame", perhaps it is in a different package to the lame program (seems odd thought) Wait, I'll go look...
2007-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	sorry, it's the "liblame0" package you need to install. I suggest uninstalling the lame package you just installed, then installing liblame (unless you want the lame converter for other reasons)
2007-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	and for some reason, audicity still doesn't recognize the file
2007-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	this is the command I type, autoremove lame ?
2007-08-21T06:35:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	"sudo apt-get remove lame" (assuming "lame" was the package you just installed) then "sudo apt-get install liblame0"
2007-08-21T06:37:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	no... that file doesn't work either. Audicity doesn't recognize the new files installed.
2007-08-21T06:38:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	liblame0-dev ?
2007-08-21T06:38:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	no, "liblame0"
2007-08-21T06:43:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	 Audicity can't find the file lol
2007-08-21T06:44:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	did YOU find the file, or did Audacity find the file?
2007-08-21T06:44:00.000Z	kauer	illriginal	so did Audacity end up seeing it too or not?
2007-08-21T06:45:00.000Z	illriginal	kauer	uhm.... Audacity asked for the file, so I had to search it in the "lib" folder, and the libmp3 file was in there
