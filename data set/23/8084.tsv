2005-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	brian__		i have one ery important question
2005-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	42
2005-08-02T08:03:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	I saw a movie about your life once ;-)
2005-08-03T05:47:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	That sounds about right
2005-08-03T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	The only eay you're going to get decetn framerates is by using a Linux native UT application.
2005-08-03T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Yes, hence the 3fps.
2005-08-03T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	At best you're going to be able to lift that to say 5 or 6 fps using Cedega. it's not worth the bother. Get UT for Linux and revel in the sudden speed.
2005-08-03T05:57:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Yes.
2005-08-03T05:57:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Keep in mind you're running WIDNOWS software on LINUX. it's a wonder it runs _at_ _all_ ;-)
2005-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Well, in fps games that need fast hardware, sure. Other stuff (like say SimCity) works fine and at decent speeds.
2005-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	... unless you run a Linux native application.
2005-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Just check that UT is set to use *hardware* 3d
2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	in the game options menu, it should tell you.
2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	No, opengl is hardware
2005-08-03T06:02:00.000Z	brian__	cafuego	so i chose correctly?
2005-08-03T06:02:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Yep
2005-08-03T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	What sort of framerates did you get under windows?
2005-08-03T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Hmm.
2005-08-03T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	The 64bit version can't run Cedega at all. (without hassle)
2005-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	a regular six-sided polygon
2005-08-03T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	brian__	Don't paste
