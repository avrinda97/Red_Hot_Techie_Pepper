2010-01-02T10:06:00.000Z	Some_Person		something's wrong -- my whole file system is suddenly read-only. I tried to install the "devscripts" package, but something horribly went wrong. http://paste.ubuntu.com/350246/
2010-01-02T10:07:00.000Z	Some_Person		During the installation, I got a prompts (blue thing with things to select). It said something about how do you get your mail, and I chose the default option, which was website or something like that
2010-01-02T10:09:00.000Z	Some_Person		anyone know how to fix this?
2010-01-02T10:10:00.000Z	pure_hate	Some_Person	I fail to see any reason why your files are read only in this paste
2010-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	pure_hate	well, for one thing, I can't create a file in my home directory
2010-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	pure_hate	and xchat is complaining that it's read only
2010-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	pure_hate	Some_Person	Have you checked the permissions
2010-01-02T10:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	pure_hate	furthermore, "dpkg: unable to access dpkg status area: Read-only file system"

2010-01-02T10:16:00.000Z	Some_Person	pure_hate	No, I can't
2010-01-02T10:16:00.000Z	pure_hate	Some_Person	Best thing to do is chroot in with a live disc and clean up the mess that way
