2008-08-27T23:16:00.000Z	usser	php6th	first head down to winehq.com get latest wine and then just double click the setup.exe like u do in windows
2008-08-27T23:17:00.000Z	usser	php6th	well before u actually execute setup.exe u have to do winecfg  on the terminal to set it up
2008-08-27T23:17:00.000Z	php6th	usser	ive installed warcraft3 alraedy, but when i run it, it just shows a black screen
2008-08-27T23:19:00.000Z	usser	php6th	u may have to run it in opengl mode. ie edit the properties of your warcraft3 launcher to add -opengl at the end
2008-08-27T23:19:00.000Z	php6th	usser	do i need to install opengl ? or may i run it with ATI propietary drivers?
2008-08-27T23:20:00.000Z	usser	php6th	if you have ati drivers installed all should be well just add -opengl to the laucher
2008-08-27T23:20:00.000Z	php6th	usser	 i tried with -opengl, but still shows a black screen
2008-08-27T23:21:00.000Z	usser	php6th	run it from the terminal, see what errors it spits out, also make sure u have latest wine wine --version should report 1.1.3
2008-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	usser	php6th	did u try to run it from the terminal ie wine /path/to/war3.exe -opengl
2008-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	usser	php6th	pastebin any errors that u get
2008-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	php6th	usser	i tried, the problem is that... the windows became black i cant do nothing, ill try again
2008-08-27T23:29:00.000Z	usser	php6th	also go to winecfg->graphics and setup emulate virtual desktop set it to 800x600, this will run any games in a windows instead of fullscreen
2008-08-27T23:44:00.000Z	php6th	usser	Warcraft 3 is running!!! but now the image is blinking
2008-08-27T23:44:00.000Z	usser	php6th	did u disable the desktop effects as someone suggested earlier?
