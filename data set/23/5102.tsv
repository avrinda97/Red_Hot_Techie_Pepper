2007-06-11T12:31:00.000Z	Icehawk78		haggard - is there a similar escpe for using differ on it?
2007-06-11T12:32:00.000Z	Icehawk78		Hmm... I'm trying to compare two binary files that should be almost identical, in order to find the difference between them.
2007-06-11T12:32:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	diff doesn't work?
2007-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	when you look at the files initially they appear identical
2007-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	?
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	- I know what is in the two files, so I would think that they *should* be almost identical. They are too large right now for me to be able to tell if they actually are or not.
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	but did you actually open a text browser and view the .bin files?
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	it could help?
2007-06-11T12:37:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	- I suppose that could be an issue. The files don't appear to be the same at all when I just vi them.
2007-06-11T12:38:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	yes, they do the same thing but were built with different parameters or something else like this
2007-06-11T12:38:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	well there you go, what do you really want to do by comparing them?
2007-06-11T12:38:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	I mean what is your final goal?
2007-06-11T12:41:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	as a beginning I would ask how large of a bin file are we talking about?
2007-06-11T12:42:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	that is quite large to analyze in any meaningful way unless you know what you are looking for.
2007-06-11T12:42:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	- And to make matters worse, I have just found the file the files *are* encrypted, too.
2007-06-11T12:43:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	well, that will make a difference :).  I imagine you don't know what kind of encryption :)
2007-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	are you trying to get wine to use it?
2007-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	I'm not sure I understand your question regarding wine
2007-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	what are you trying to do with the bin, if you feel uncomfortable telling me don't worry about it but it might make the whole process easier
2007-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	It's a saved game file for my Wii video game console. Right now, I'm mostly just trying to figure out the structure of the file, with the hopeful future goal of being able to edit the file.
2007-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	I am really not sure in this area, gl :)
2007-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	yigal	Icehawk78	you will do it
2007-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	Icehawk78	yigal	Thanks for trying. lol. I wasn't expecting anyone necessarily to be able to help in this particular area, I was just checking to see if I could figure out anything I may have missed.
