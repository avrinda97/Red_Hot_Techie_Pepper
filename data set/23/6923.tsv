2005-12-07T11:06:00.000Z	derek		Please, is there any way to format a fat32 partition as ext3 while running the live cd?
2005-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	sethk	derek	sure, mke2fs -j
2005-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	derek	sethk	what's that? and how to reach the fat32 partition here firstly?
2005-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	derek	you don't "reach" it.
2005-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	derek	you just get a shell, and do mke2fs -j /dev/hdXX
2005-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	derek	the XX depends on the drive and partition
2005-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	derek	suppose it is the second partition of the first drive, then it is /dev/hda2
2005-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	derek	assuming IDE drives, of course
2005-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	derek	sethk	yes, IDE
2005-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	derek	sethk	how do I list all the partitions?
2005-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	derek	for a drive, you do    fdisk -l /dev/hda           for the first,    fdisk -l /dev/hdb    for the second, etc.
2005-12-07T11:10:00.000Z	derek	sethk	what's -l for?
2005-12-07T11:10:00.000Z	sethk	derek	list
2005-12-07T11:11:00.000Z	derek	sethk	ok
2005-12-07T11:13:00.000Z	sethk	derek	you need to either be root or use sudo
2005-12-07T11:13:00.000Z	sethk	derek	for any administrative command
2005-12-07T11:13:00.000Z	derek	sethk	this is a live cd
2005-12-07T11:15:00.000Z	derek	sethk	how to display the sizes of the partitions?
2005-12-07T11:16:00.000Z	sethk	derek	the same way
2005-12-07T11:16:00.000Z	sethk	derek	it will show the number of blocks.
2005-12-07T11:16:00.000Z	sethk	derek	each block is 512 bytes
2005-12-07T11:16:00.000Z	derek	sethk	i see
2005-12-07T11:16:00.000Z	sethk	derek	or what carthik said works also, of course
