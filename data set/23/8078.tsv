2005-02-01T16:49:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	sudo generally makes sense
2005-02-01T16:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	nono, sudo is a process
2005-02-01T16:51:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	prefix the command with sudo
2005-02-02T10:44:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	what do you mean when you say it did not work
2005-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	ubuntu has tvtime in universe

2005-02-02T11:06:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	no, ignore that, that's a mirror of the file that you will also download
2005-02-02T11:38:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	it's all or nothing
2005-02-02T11:41:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	proudhon	I would not recommend it if you aren't comfortable with fixing broken stuff
