2007-12-30T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	where'd you pick up that vga for 1280x800, I've been searching ...
2007-12-30T11:09:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	I cheated...suse 10.3 set it at install
2007-12-30T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	that's not cheating, that's creative appropriation. Thanks
2008-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	do you have a pointer to a quick howto on that workgroup in home with fusesmb
2008-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	never mind, I read down a bit
2008-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	let me check...give me a sec
2008-01-08T07:55:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	I ran into a problem with fusesmb in either suse or ubuntu (I run both on different computers). So I compiled the source and installed from there...don't recall if the issue was in ubuntu or suse
2008-01-08T07:56:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	ok, thanks for the warning. I've known of fuse, but hadn't used it until I tried out sshfs. Now I need to know all :)
2008-01-09T02:04:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	you can change what gksu uses with gksu-properties, but it defaults to sudo backend
2008-01-12T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	X does that with some cards? I though it used the first free console after 1-6
2008-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	X uses F7, but it is called from F1....F2 through F6 should still be available for login, but F1 is the original you log into to start x
2008-01-12T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	no, not here.
2008-01-12T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	do you use magnifying glasses?
2008-01-16T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	you can do that with xchat as well ...
2008-01-16T08:31:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	I can I think run two instances of Xchat, is that what you mean? I couldn't find a way around those damn tabs
2008-01-16T08:31:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	right click the tab, select detach tab
2008-01-16T08:31:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	see....learn something new every day <smile>
2008-01-16T08:31:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	thanks
2008-01-16T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	it's it great :)
2008-01-16T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	oh, cooties
2008-01-16T08:39:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	agreed <shudder>
2008-01-27T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	th0r	astro76 kahrytan has helped quite a few people here, give him a break
2008-01-27T11:27:00.000Z	th0r	nickrud	being frustrated is no excuse for bad manners
