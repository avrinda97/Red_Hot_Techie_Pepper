2012-07-03T13:33:00.000Z	simonZR		hi, how can I manually add an IP to a url dns resolution in ubuntu 12.04 ?
2012-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
2012-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	or gedit instead of nano if you wish
2012-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	yes and then?
2012-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	it has examples
2012-07-03T13:35:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	not really
2012-07-03T13:35:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	oh?
2012-07-03T13:35:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	maybe it was modified before. In any case it says DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
2012-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	bindi		pfft, that's for wussies
2012-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	'your changes will be overwritten'
2012-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	bindi		i don't know if ubuntu 12.04 has something special in it then
2012-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	simonZR		in any case is that file not related to the dns server ?
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	try this http://askubuntu.com/questions/130452/how-do-i-add-a-dns-server-via-resolv-conf
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	simonZR		what I want is to add an (url,IP) entry so that it doesn't call the dns server, not change the dns server IP
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	that's not what I want
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	bindi		it's not?
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	bindi		do you want to add something like myfunnyhost.derp so it resolves into any IP you specify?
2012-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	I want to manually add a url dns resolution, rather than adding a new dns server
2012-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	bindi	simonZR	yes, that's what resolv.conf was for
2012-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	bindi		If you want to add more entries to /etc/resolv.conf, create a /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail and add them there.
2012-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	but the question you linked to says 'add a dns server'
2012-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	bindi		hmm
2012-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	simonZR	bindi	I don't have a dns server to point to, I just want to manually add a IP
