2012-03-23T00:26:00.000Z	CacheMoney		I've been having trouble getting my bootloader to appear when restarting, so I'm reinstalling Ubuntu.  I'm on this step http://imagebin/204701 and I'm not sure which device to choose for boot loader installation
2012-03-23T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	put the boot loader on the boot disk - nothing else
2012-03-23T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	keep your setup simple, the boot loader goes on the mbr of the boot disk, and the boot loader goes in the /boot partition
2012-03-23T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	your grub is pointing at a partition that doesn't exist
2012-03-23T01:42:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 How should I proceed?  Not sure what to do on this black screen..
2012-03-23T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	what's happened to your install to cause this ?
2012-03-23T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	grub should go on a device not a partition, so /dev/sda (or /dev/sdb (what ever your device is is )) is the correct approach
2012-03-23T01:45:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 Well, that's what I did and when I restarted I was presented with a black screen stating, "error: no such partition."
2012-03-23T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	how many disks to you have ?
2012-03-23T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	so two hard disks in your machine ?
2012-03-23T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	please just answer the question
2012-03-23T01:47:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 that's what Disk Utility told me..
2012-03-23T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	no - I'm asking you
2012-03-23T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	how many hard disk are in the machine - not what you think, what disk utility tells, how many factual physical hard disks are in the machine
2012-03-23T01:50:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 it might have just been the RAM i was looking at..
2012-03-23T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	I'm sure someone else will help you,
2012-03-23T01:53:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	please don't down that language
2012-03-23T01:53:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 i apologize
2012-03-23T01:53:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	"tone down" sorry
2012-03-23T01:53:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	no problem
2012-03-23T01:54:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	how should I exit the black screen saying, "grub rescue> _ "
2012-03-23T01:54:00.000Z	ikonia	CacheMoney	I've said I'm not interested in progressing at this time, I'm doing other things
2012-03-23T01:55:00.000Z	CacheMoney	ikonia	 okay
