2009-10-23T16:51:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	JuJuBee	Does the application ends with .exe?  Is the application for Windows?

2009-10-23T16:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	JuJuBee	You have the .deb ?
2009-10-23T16:55:00.000Z	JuJuBee	leaf-sheep	http://paste.ubuntu.com/299743/  these are directions I tried to follow.... and no not a .deb it uses autopackage
2009-10-23T16:57:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	JuJuBee	Is that all of the instruction?

2009-10-23T17:01:00.000Z	JuJuBee	leaf-sheep	it seems that ubottu is broken, they do exist and are already installed

2009-10-23T17:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee	leaf-sheep	 when I try to install the package using 32bit mode I get this... # Checking for libxkbfile.so ... failed
2009-10-23T17:10:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	JuJuBee	You could install Ubuntu 32 bit -- Install the server kernel (with PAE support) so you can use all the 6GB ram.
2009-10-23T17:11:00.000Z	JuJuBee	leaf-sheep	Id rather not do that.  I would rather leave my machine alone than do a complete re-install...
