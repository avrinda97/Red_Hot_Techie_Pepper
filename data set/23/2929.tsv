2008-10-02T01:50:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	using ubuntu on my personal desktop....
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	that
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	Just umount your smaba share
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	ahh thanks
2008-10-02T01:40:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	last thing: have you ever heard of same path, but different users seeing different files?
2008-10-02T01:43:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	I'll take a look, you think it's a chroot issue tho?
2008-10-02T01:43:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	nah, just looks like it points to your homedirectory regardless of where you want to go....so maybe it is a chroot issue
2008-10-02T01:44:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	right now, I'm just trying to get openfiler setup properly
2008-10-02T01:45:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	if you are chrooted yourself you should have access to files in /sbin that you would normally not be able to access in a non-chrooted system
2008-10-02T01:45:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	how do you mean?
2008-10-02T01:46:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	just try fdisk -l as a normal user
2008-10-02T01:46:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	If you are chrooted, it should show you the mounts that you have rights to. If not, it should show you that the file cannot be found
2008-10-02T01:46:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	openfiler is a baremetal installer
2008-10-02T01:48:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	sounds like chroot to me. Can you see /proc and /system?
2008-10-02T01:49:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	can cd into /proc...can't do /system
2008-10-02T01:49:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	I see... So you are not using Ubuntu.
2008-10-02T01:50:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	reason I came here was to sign out of samba on my ubuntu desktop
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	You should just umount your samba share, just like any other mount
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	k
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	VFS should take care of the fiddly bits on the low-level
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	okay
2008-10-02T01:58:00.000Z	danhs	matreya6	I hate to be dumb, cause I don't know this stuff, but have you looked into pulse issues?  I've heard those are a doozie in hardy
2008-10-02T01:59:00.000Z	matreya6	danhs	I don't use Pulse asa Soundserver, only ALSA and JackAudio
