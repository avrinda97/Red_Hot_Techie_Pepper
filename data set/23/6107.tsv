2011-01-27T18:28:00.000Z	dupondje		as non-root
2011-01-27T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	actually, continuing to read the man page, is scponly in /etc/shell?
2011-01-27T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	why don't you just use sudo?  But you can do something like: su - -c bash    I suppose
2011-01-27T18:24:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	sudo is not installed ^^
2011-01-27T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	erm, is this ubuntu?
2011-01-27T18:25:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	it just quits that command somehow, its debian .. :)
2011-01-27T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	actually, reading « man su » suggests -c bash won't work, ha
2011-01-27T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	yeah, the man page says -c will just be run by the shell set in /etc/passwd
2011-01-27T18:26:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	no idea how to override that ?
2011-01-27T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	man su, suggests -s
2011-01-27T18:27:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	but that doesn't do *** :)
2011-01-27T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	su - -s bash   doesn't work?
2011-01-27T18:28:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	nope
2011-01-27T18:28:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	it gives no error, but just throws me back to default shell
2011-01-27T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	give /bin/bash...
2011-01-27T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	/etc/shells*  (typo in man page)
2011-01-27T18:30:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	nope :(
2011-01-27T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	you probably need to change the default shell for root then
2011-01-27T18:30:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	true :) but thats the problem :) how ... :D
2011-01-27T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	the usual, boot a live cd, or use recovery mode from the grub menu
2011-01-27T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	from scponly man page by the way: "(though root should never be configured to be using scponly as the default shell."
2011-01-27T18:32:00.000Z	dupondje	jrib	I know its a fail :) to bad
2011-01-27T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	dupondje	heh, you should just use the live cd or recovery mode, but I'm thinking if you want to play a game, you could try using scp to overwrite the /etc/shells file with one that includes scponly, then use su - -s /bin/bash
