2006-09-11T16:14:00.000Z	nozorro	schupa	this isn't related to you screen resolution though
2006-09-11T16:16:00.000Z	schupa	nozorro	no but when reconfigured Xorg i had to fill in something about my keyboard layout and i didn't have a clue of what i should write
2006-09-11T16:16:00.000Z	nozorro	schupa	if you're going to edit xorg.conf, copy over the old settings under the "InputDevice" Section. if it still doesn't work, go to the keyboard pref app in gnome
2006-09-11T16:17:00.000Z	schupa	nozorro	thanks, will try.
2006-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	nozorro	schupa	look whether there's anything looking like it under /etc/X11. should have a 'bck' extension. the date also helps
