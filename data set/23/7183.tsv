2006-03-02T17:52:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 pastebin your sources.list
2006-03-02T17:53:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9277 -- thanks for checking it out.
2006-03-02T17:54:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	line 007 is the one where I was hoping to get the new update-manager package through.
2006-03-02T17:55:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 that doesn't look like an apt repository
2006-03-02T17:55:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 i suggest just downloading the deb and installing it yourself :] 
2006-03-02T17:57:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 do they suggest adding the site to sources.list?
2006-03-02T17:57:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	it should work according to http://tinyurl.com/rtgxo -- also, apt-get update doesn't complain about it.
2006-03-02T17:57:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	yes.
2006-03-02T17:59:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 ok so you've got the line in there just like he says, it won't install update-manager for you?
2006-03-02T06:00:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	it will install update-manager, but it wants to get the old version from main.
2006-03-02T06:01:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 ahhhhh.  put line 7 @ the top of the file
2006-03-02T06:01:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 man sources.list   your most preferred source goes at the top of the file :] 
2006-03-02T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	are you sure? I made the change, re-did apt-get update, same situation.
2006-03-02T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	it reorders the sources.list internally anyway, doesn't it?
2006-03-02T06:05:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	bah i dunno then :] 
2006-03-02T06:08:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	package clamav.
2006-03-11T17:47:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	how is your friend's pregnancy going?
2006-03-19T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	the same applies to scalpels ;)
2006-06-09T13:33:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	do you mean non-interactively? "ssh user@remotehost ls"
2006-06-09T13:34:00.000Z	wastrel	soundray	 tha works 100%
2006-10-15T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	with a soldering iron?
2006-10-15T14:47:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	he made it work again by removing the newly added RAM
2006-10-15T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	wastrel	stock ubuntu should deal with that, shouldn't it?
