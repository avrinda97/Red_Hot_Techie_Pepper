2009-11-19T16:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	do you have an ftp server running in windows ?
2009-11-19T16:47:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	nope
2009-11-19T16:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	you need an ftp server in windows to connect to it
2009-11-19T16:48:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	but if I'll transfer files from ubuntu to windows, is it ok to have the server in windows? and not ubuntu?
2009-11-19T16:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	i used the filezilla ftp server in windows is easy to set up
2009-11-19T16:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	you can use other means like shared folders (via samba) but if you want to use ftp you need an ftp server in windows
2009-11-19T16:59:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	can you tell me how to connect gftp to filezilla server in windows? if you dont mind
2009-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	is easier to use Nautilus. Go to Places>Connect to Server || choose ftp put the ip of the windows machine and click connect
2009-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	make sure windows does not have a firewall blocking ftp
2009-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	hmm i did try but it wont connect :( places- connect to- server 192.168.1.5
2009-11-19T17:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	firewall in windows ?
2009-11-19T17:11:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	I just got router not using any firewall
2009-11-19T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	but maybe the windows firewall is active??
2009-11-19T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	check
2009-11-19T17:13:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	just disabled it, Public FTP or FTP with login?
2009-11-19T17:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	depends on how you configured the ftp server in windwos
2009-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	any specific configurations need to be done in filezilla server ? I really never used it before
2009-11-19T17:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	nere	well at least you have to configure what folder in windows you offer in the server and if you use a password or not
2009-11-19T17:26:00.000Z	nere	erUSUL	wow it connected, and a folder was opened in ubuntu but how do I add a file to it?
