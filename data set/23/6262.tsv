2006-06-18T15:17:00.000Z	rayston		anyone know why there doesnt seem to be a xorg.conf file in my X11 folder?
2006-06-18T15:19:00.000Z	rayston		anyone know why there doesnt seem to be a xorg.conf file in my X11 folder? I want to edit it, but Icant find it
2006-06-18T15:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	it should be in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-06-18T15:20:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	:yah, thats what Ithough, but its not there, yet, im in gnome right now
2006-06-18T15:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	really?
2006-06-18T15:22:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: yah, really, that folder is there, and theres various xorg.conf backup files, but not the actual xorg.conf file, it doesnt seem to be a hidden file either
2006-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: so, is it possible that X is somehow using one of the backup files or something? Iwas messing with those files recently while trying to get my Nvidia Drivers working, it was there then, but now its gone
2006-06-18T15:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	Well if you're really unlucky you might have managed to remove it all together.
2006-06-18T15:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	however it's not a biggie. Just run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg if your X won't start.
2006-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	:well, my X starts just fine, Ijust cant edit the file, will that command put the file back so I can edit it?
2006-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: to clarify , I cant edit the file, because its not there
2006-06-18T15:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	I know. But dpkg-reconfigure will write you a brand new one.
2006-06-18T15:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	if you are able to restart X w/o /etc/X11/xorg.conf then you are doing something really weird tho. :)
2006-06-18T15:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	try this from your root dir: slocate xorg.conf
2006-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	:I PM'd you the output of that command, I hope that was okay
2006-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	Well I didn't recieve it so you might not be registered.
2006-06-18T15:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	try !pastebin
2006-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15947
2006-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: dja get that last?
2006-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	I cannot see why xorg would be using any of the backup files nor the /etc/xorg.conf file(s)
2006-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	rayston	BlueEagle	: is there any way to confirm what file xorg IS using? I mean, that has to be in a file somewhere right?
2006-06-18T15:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rayston	I do not know
