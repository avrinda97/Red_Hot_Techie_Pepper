2010-11-22T16:16:00.000Z	rautamiekka		I were told to install Ubuntu to one of the school's computers and I did, installed the whole system over the Net. However, now that Desktop is installed, the connection doesn't function at all, doesn't get the IP although it did during installation.
2010-11-22T16:17:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	Sometimes proxy detection is flaky or turned off
2010-11-22T16:17:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	What should I do ?
2010-11-22T16:17:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	Check the proxy settings ;P
2010-11-22T16:17:00.000Z	Zorlin		System -> Preferences -> Network Preferences
2010-11-22T16:18:00.000Z	Zorlin		Network Proxy* rather
2010-11-22T16:18:00.000Z	Zorlin		click Automatic then close it and reboot, hopefully
2010-11-22T16:19:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	The funny thing, looking at an WinXP machine next to it, there is no proxy settings used in Internet Explorer's.
2010-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	Not even automatically detect proxy settings?
2010-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	Not even automatic selected.
2010-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	Zorlin		I'm just making assumptions based on how schools usually have internet access set up :)
2010-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	Zorlin		In that case, that isn't your issue and you should disregard my terrible advice, rautamiekka. =]
2010-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	No problem. Just a moment.
2010-11-22T16:21:00.000Z	Zorlin		I don't have any ideas, so I'll pass you back to the channel and get back to what I was doing
2010-11-22T16:23:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	Thank you ! That fixed it :)
2010-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	...Seriously?
2010-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	Seriously.
2010-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	Hey, whatever works. I'm glad it did. :)
2010-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	Me too.
2010-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	This means that the installer was auto-using proxy auto-detection.
2010-11-22T16:27:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	That's what I figured. The live system and the installer are slightly different, as are those two and the final installation.
2010-11-22T16:27:00.000Z	rautamiekka	Zorlin	One new thing learnt.
2010-11-22T16:28:00.000Z	Zorlin	rautamiekka	Usually they all act the same but oddities between them can point to things like your solution :)
