2008-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	erik__		i have problems getting the "unlock" button to work.. right now i can't change any system settings
2008-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	erik__		and i have added my account to policykit and admin group
2008-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 are you sure your user is part of the "admin" group?
2008-04-25T17:45:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	i have made sure it's added to the group in /etc/group
2008-04-25T17:45:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	should i check anywhere else?
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	nope...as long as it was there that's a good start....if it wasn't and you just added it you will need to log out and back in for it to take effect...are you connecting to the machine remotely or are you on console?
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	this is a desktop computer. no remote connection
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	i added it and logged back in.. no change
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	clicking the unlock button just freezes the window for a moment and gives me an windowsy "unknown error", heh
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 I remote to my desktop all the time and PolicyKit is picky about that...that's why I ask....
2008-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 well that is about all the troubleshooting I know of to make policykit work...hahaha...you may want to try re-installing the packages in Synaptic as I've seen it help some people....but unforunately that's about all I can offer... :)
2008-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	ah ok.. bummer
2008-04-25T17:49:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 I have Hardy on about 5 machines and it does work...sounds like you have a package issue of some sort...
2008-04-25T17:50:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 Yeah policykit needs some polishing...I think it was one of the "rushed" packages for this release...
2008-04-25T18:15:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 did you try re-installing policykit and policykit-gnome?
2008-04-25T18:15:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	nope.. i'll try that now i guess
2008-04-25T18:18:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 nice!   :)
2008-04-25T18:19:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	i'm running a laptop with an additional screen
2008-04-25T18:19:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	not using xinerama.. so when i run the admin app from my secondary display the unlock button doesn't work and give me the unexcpected error
2008-04-25T18:19:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	but it works fine on the other screen
2008-04-25T18:19:00.000Z	v0lksman	erik__	 hahaha....file a bug on that for sure....
2008-04-25T18:19:00.000Z	erik__	v0lksman	this is actually a bug, i guess the policykit or gnome app can't bind to the correct session or something
