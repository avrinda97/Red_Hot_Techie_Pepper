2011-02-25T21:48:00.000Z	arch_nme		I'm trying to get my phone to show up so I can transfer files off it, it's a motorola zn300, it looks like it's being detected but not getting mounted http://paste.ubuntu.com/572241/
2011-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 many phones have a data mode, or usb-storage mode setting you need to use when you plug them into a pc.
2011-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	 my phone is saying usb mass storage on the screen when I plug it in
2011-02-25T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 try mounting it by hand. check output of sudo fdisk -l, dmesg, and blkid to see what device its being
2011-02-25T21:50:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/572241/ there is my output from dmesg and lsusb, how do I mount it though?
2011-02-25T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 sudo mount /dev/whatever /media/MAKEADIRCTORY
2011-02-25T21:51:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	where are you getting the whatever?
2011-02-25T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 from the commands i mentioned earlier...
2011-02-25T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 when you plug it in, wait a few moments and run 'dmesg' it should mention the device.. or  fdisk -l shows ALL devices
2011-02-25T21:52:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/572241/ this is my dmesg and lsusb output
2011-02-25T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 look for /dev/XXXXX type lines mentioned when you plug the thing in.
2011-02-25T21:54:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	it doesn't say anything like that http://paste.ubuntu.com/572241/
2011-02-25T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 check 'sudo fdisk -l' perhaps the phone is just not seen.
2011-02-25T21:55:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	it does see it, fdisk -l doesn't do anything, I see it in dmesg and lsusb though
2011-02-25T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 its 'sudo fdisk -l'
2011-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	that just shows my harddrive and swap files
2011-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 below those lines it should eventually mention  a /dev/sdXX
2011-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 sounds like its not detecting it as a usb storage device.
2011-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	I just have an sda1 sda2 and sda5
2011-02-25T21:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 sounds like its not detecting it as a usb storage device device.
2011-02-25T21:58:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	yeah, it does anything I can do about that
2011-02-25T21:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arch_nme	 check google for your exact phone and linux. is this a 'smart' phone runnign android?
2011-02-25T22:00:00.000Z	arch_nme	Dr_Willis	no it's a motorola zn300, already check google not much out there, the phone is runnign a linux OS, but not andriod or anything it's not a smart phone just a regular phone
