2009-09-14T05:20:00.000Z	jerriy		Ubuntu is useless
2009-09-14T05:21:00.000Z	jerriy		As far as midis are concerned
2009-09-14T05:23:00.000Z	jerriy		Menza: I just spend more than an hour installing midi stuff (via synaptic) but the result was a complete failure (I tried multiples of programs: I installed Timidity, Muse, Playmidi and Fluidsynth. But all failed
2009-09-14T05:25:00.000Z	jerriy		I have a reward for anyone who tells me how to play the file (the "play sound" thing) on this page ---> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+E+G+Bb+D+F%23+A
2009-09-14T05:26:00.000Z	jerriy		Who wants to get rich by telling me how to play the file (the "play sound" thing) on this page ---> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+E+G+Bb+D+F%23+A
2009-09-14T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	what's my reward?
2009-09-14T05:27:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	What's the answer?
2009-09-14T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	answer my question first :)
2009-09-14T05:29:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	the reward is immortality - now answer my question
2009-09-14T05:30:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	meh, it's a midi file
2011-08-15T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	have you tried things like clearing cache?  disabling extensions? firefox safe-mode? new firefox profile?  fresh new ubuntu user?
2011-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	... different browser?
2011-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	yes I've done' that
2011-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	and what were the results in each case?
2011-08-15T15:04:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	it is unlikely a setup issue if it doesn't happen with a fresh new ubuntu user
2011-08-15T15:04:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	what issue is it then?
2011-08-15T15:05:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	don't know.  I'd google the error and scroll through the results while you wait
2011-08-15T15:08:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	if you have natty-updates or natty-security repositories (which you should), you will get firefox 5 through update manager
2011-08-15T15:09:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	it's Lucid lynx (long term release)
2011-08-15T15:10:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	sorry, wrong nick
2011-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	can you confirm that this happens on a fresh new ubuntu user?
2011-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	jerriy	jrib	what you mean "fresh"? I use ubuntu since 2008
2011-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	jerriy	create a new user and test there
