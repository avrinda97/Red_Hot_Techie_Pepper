2011-10-31T07:08:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	it's ubuntu server, there is *only* text only mode. when I say no video, i mean absolutely nothing
2011-10-31T07:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	you haven't added a gui?  that's not very ubuntu-server like ;)  sorry can't help then.  good luck.
2011-10-31T07:09:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	I will try escape and/or shift to see if I can get *anything* up
2011-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	do you have a vga= line?  you shouldn't.
2011-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	no vga= line
2011-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	it is deprecated, but still works (or breaks things sometimes)
2011-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	GRUB_GFXMODE= is a portion of the "new" way
2011-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	and it's technically a kernel thing, not a grub thing
2011-10-31T09:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	i doubt you can actually.  Hopefully i'm wrong though.  (i'm under the impresseion the LiveCD doesn't support RAID, or didn't historically)
2011-10-31T10:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	that's true - perhaps it's only a install issue.
2011-10-31T10:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	FYI you can use "/msg ubottu mount" to get factoids privately
2011-10-31T10:06:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	Yep, ubottu told me that
2011-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	How was ubottu's gender determined?
2011-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	by her creator i imagine
2011-11-01T10:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	i'd start with /var/log/messages
2011-11-01T10:14:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	not found
2011-11-01T10:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	try tab completion perhaps ubuntu uses a messages.0 or something?
2011-11-01T10:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	i guess ubuntu just uses syslog (vs debian's messages) sorry to lead you astray
2011-11-01T10:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	humm, i have both a syslog and a messages?  (not ubuntu though)
2011-11-20T11:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	Ubuntu is NOT free software... and it seems to be moving further and further away from it
2012-01-24T08:28:00.000Z	pnorman	zykotick9	isn't it gksudo?
2012-01-24T08:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	pnorman	both should work
