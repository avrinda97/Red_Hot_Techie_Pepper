2005-08-30T12:19:00.000Z	adriyel		I use rhythmbox
2005-08-30T12:19:00.000Z	adriyel		and totem
2005-08-30T12:19:00.000Z	adriyel		with the gstreamer backend...
2005-08-30T12:19:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	when does it crash?
2005-08-30T12:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	are you using the default Ubuntu sound settings?
2005-08-30T12:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	(esound)
2005-08-30T12:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	did you change BMP's output plugin configuration to use esound, then?
2005-08-30T12:21:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	that would - more than likely - explain those crashes
2005-08-30T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	np
2005-08-30T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	as many as we need.
2005-08-30T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	I'm a MOTU (wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU)
2005-08-30T12:25:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	think of the Colony images as milestones.
2005-08-30T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	not much "glory" ;)
2005-08-30T12:26:00.000Z	adriyel	crimsun_	some of the most important jobs lack glory
2005-08-30T12:28:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	libflash isn't my area, sorry
2005-08-30T12:28:00.000Z	adriyel	crimsun_	crap, was hoping you'd know about that issue. Do you know who to contact?
2005-08-30T12:33:00.000Z	adriyel	crimsun_	can you help me with a doom3 issue?
2005-08-30T12:34:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	if your libflash issue is related to the 32-bit layer, it's fixed in 1.0.10rc1 of ALSA. We may be able to see it in Breezy.
2005-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	adriyel	crimsun_	I can't get sound working in doom3. no crash, it just seems to be muted. I've checked and nothing pertinent seems muted. additionally, I've tried it with esound alsa and oss, all three don't work, suggestions?
2005-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	are you using Breezy?
2005-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	no, Hoary, correct?
2005-08-30T12:36:00.000Z	crimsun_	adriyel	ok, you'd need to update ALSA to see.
2005-08-30T12:36:00.000Z	adriyel	crimsun_	I'll update it
