2007-07-26T08:13:00.000Z	iso	profanephobia	yes, i have something similar in my fstab right now
2007-07-26T08:14:00.000Z	profanephobia	iso	edit the /root/.smbcredentials first with username and password
2007-07-26T08:15:00.000Z	profanephobia		username=winusername
2007-07-26T08:15:00.000Z	profanephobia		password=winpassword
2007-07-26T08:15:00.000Z	profanephobia	iso	and i was use nano or vim to edit these files
2007-07-26T08:16:00.000Z	profanephobia	iso	once you added the password and username info open your fstab file and add //netbiosname/sharename    /media/sharename        cifs    credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0
2007-07-26T08:17:00.000Z	iso		10:16 < profanephobia> iso: once you added the password and username info open your fstab file and add //netbiosname/sharename     /media/sharename        cifs    credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0

2007-07-26T08:19:00.000Z	profanephobia	iso	also make a backup of your fstab file
2007-07-26T08:21:00.000Z	profanephobia		tul3es: is your macbook the duo core
2007-07-26T08:22:00.000Z	iso	profanephobia	my fstab is set up this way, however I found the mount broken one day.  mount -a fixed it, but i'm wondering if there's a mechinism that will detect and remount?
2007-07-26T08:22:00.000Z	profanephobia		tul3es: ok so the macbook you have has reported bugs with the current linux headers.. if you want try gsynaptic
2007-07-26T08:24:00.000Z	profanephobia	iso	i would try auotFS
2007-07-26T08:24:00.000Z	profanephobia		autoFS*
2007-07-26T08:24:00.000Z	profanephobia		ok
