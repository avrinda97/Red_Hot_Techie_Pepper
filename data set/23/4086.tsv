2008-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Dusty_		what seems to be the problem vasilisa
2008-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	No matter what i do, it fails me. I used the latest driver for my card off their site, followed all the tutorials, and now ogre3d's samples are all messed up in color
2008-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Dusty_		@vasilia, first you need to find out if it's actually your driver
2008-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	I turned compositing off, i ran aticonfig....
2008-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	Dusty_		@vasilia, take a screenshot and see if your screenshot shows the funky colors
2008-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Well, i donwloaded the one for my card
2008-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	vasilisa		ok
2008-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	if the screenshot shows the funky colors, it's your drivers, otherwise it's your monitor
2008-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Funky colors in screenshot: check
2008-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	Dusty_		ok so it's your video card(which is actually a good thing in this case)

2008-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	what video card are you using ?
2008-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	ATI X700
2008-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Unfortunately
2008-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	is that a benchmark utility you have running ?
2008-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	A what?
2008-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Its one of the Ogre samples. they all do that
2008-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	onr your screen, you have a FPS counter and other such things
2008-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Yeah they put those in there
2008-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	was wondering if that was some kind of benchmark utility
2008-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Thats part of the program.
2008-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	Dusty_	vasilisa	does that program using direct x to render those images or openGL ?
2008-10-05T09:47:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dusty_	Im in linux, so openGL naturally
