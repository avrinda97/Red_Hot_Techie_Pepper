2012-07-07T21:41:00.000Z	flan_suse		Ubuntu 12.04 and themes have thrown me for a loop.
2012-07-07T21:42:00.000Z	flan_suse		When you apply a "theme" is it GTK3 or GTK2? And what's the difference betweens setting the Theme under "Appearance" and setting it under MyUnity? Nothing seems consistent.
2012-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	flan_suse		And how come some themes look ugly when setting them (flat, windows-2000) but others look fine?
2012-07-07T21:44:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	be sure you have GTK3 and unity theme, not gnome-panel themes
2012-07-07T21:46:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	And that will take care of the window decoration too? (window manager theme)
2012-07-07T21:47:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	you could use ubuntu-tweak to install themes. be carefull with the options :-)
2012-07-07T21:47:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	This is going backwards, though.
2012-07-07T21:47:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	There seems to be 3 ways to set themes: Appearance, MyUnity, and ubuntu-tweak.
2012-07-07T21:48:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	i find myunity not so handy with themes.
2012-07-07T21:48:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	This fragmentation was not a problem back in 10.04, for example. I just want to know how to set the entire theme, like I did on 10.04 (with a single click, it sets the colors, gtk2 theme, metacity theme, icon theme, and wallpaper.)
2012-07-07T21:49:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	I'll look into ubuntu-tweak. Just kind of disappointed in the direction *everyone* is going.
2012-07-07T21:49:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	GTK themes are just started, i am waiting for a good theme editor.
2012-07-07T21:50:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	Right, but it still feels "unpolished" and discarded.
2012-07-08T04:03:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	AES-cbc , >> http://blog.markloiseau.com/2012/05/ubuntu-aes-xts-plain64/
2012-07-08T04:03:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	I actually read that article like 5 minutes ago.
2012-07-08T04:04:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	However, in the comments he says he's unsure about 12.04 (that they might have changed it to XTS.)
2012-07-08T04:04:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	That's why I'm asking in here, just in case someone else used the alternate installer for 12.04 and knows if the default has been changed.
2012-07-08T04:06:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	afaik it still is.
2012-07-08T04:06:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	Thank you. I hope it allows you to choose another cipher (such as aes-xts-plain)
2012-07-08T04:08:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	well, you can, according to that article, i also noticed the watermark vunerability.
2012-07-08T04:09:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	He uses the live CD (not the alternate installer) so he manually runs cryptsetup commands and specifies aes-xts-plain64.
2012-07-08T04:10:00.000Z	flan_suse	OerHeks	However, the last time I've done this (10.04), I had to use his approach as well, since the alternate installer did not let me specify the cipher mode (from what I remember.)
2012-07-08T04:11:00.000Z	OerHeks	flan_suse	maybe the minimal cd is an option? not for whole disk encryption ofcourse
