2007-02-19T08:42:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid		what are the latest nvidia(beta) drivers that work with the Geforce 4s?
2007-02-19T08:44:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	nvidia aren't dropping support for gf4 in new drivers, afaik o.o
2007-02-19T08:44:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	are you sure? i heard the 97xx stoped working with the 4s
2007-02-19T08:45:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	I'm checking it out now.
2007-02-19T08:45:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	thanks
2007-02-19T08:46:00.000Z	Ferret		q
2007-02-19T08:47:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid		!nvidia9
2007-02-19T08:50:00.000Z	Ferret		aes-crypt, bcrypt, ccrypt, mcrypt
2007-02-19T08:54:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	As far as I can tell the only thing they did with 97xx was add geforce 8 support
2007-02-19T08:54:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	They were fixing bugs in geforce 3/4 in the 96xx series, so it would be odd to remove that support entirely a month later o.O
2007-02-19T08:56:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid		Ferret" while you were looking so was i, the demoted geforce 4 and lower to legacy status
2007-02-19T08:56:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=82822
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	Haha, I looked at that page a few minutes ago and simply didn't notice the note.
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	Surely that big a change is worthy of being in the 'release highlights' list. :/
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	It's not mentioned at all on http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-9746.html
2007-02-19T08:59:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	i am more of do this research for a friend(geforce 4) i have a geforce 6
2007-02-19T08:59:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	Yeah, when I first saw your question I thought I knew right away because I have a GF4, but then I remember I had to downgrade it to a GF5 FX because of leaky caps
2007-02-19T09:00:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	geforce fx are newer, correct?
2007-02-19T09:00:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	It's surprising that this is in no way mentioned on the nvidia site at all, nor can I find anyone anywhere complaining about it... so you might want to try 97xx series anyway
2007-02-19T09:00:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	After getting 96xx working
2007-02-19T09:00:00.000Z	Ferret	LordUltimaDavid	The GF5 FX is newer and a *lot* slower than GF4 TI
2007-02-19T09:02:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	ill tell me friend to wait till 7.04 and the whole CNR stuff till he can use Beryl again
2007-02-19T09:02:00.000Z	LordUltimaDavid	Ferret	maybe ill buy him a geforce 6
