2012-05-14T01:33:00.000Z	simplew		Im veryconfused here, i see that for 64bits and 32bits the lib packages have EXACTLY the same name, so how is possible to isntall a library for both arches???
2012-05-14T01:33:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	why do you need libraries for both...?
2012-05-14T01:34:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	i do, but what that has to do with what i asked?
2012-05-14T01:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	because 99% of the time someone asks a strange technical question, they're doing something outside of how ubuntu is supposed to be used
2012-05-14T01:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	for instance when asking how to set the root password, we refer them to sudo instead
2012-05-14T01:35:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	what that has to do with what i asked?
2012-05-14T01:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	this is the official ubuntu IRC support channel. It's purpose is to help support users who do not pay for a support package (most home users).
2012-05-14T01:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	the only time you should ever need to manually select a package from a different architecture is if you are trying to compile software from source. I've been using ubuntu since Gutsy and have *never* had to do it (and I *am* a software developer)
2012-05-14T01:44:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	e really noob for what i can see
2012-05-14T01:44:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	your last comment didn't make much sense (was it cut off?)
2012-05-14T01:46:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	you think your funny
2012-05-14T01:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	no, I honestly am not sure what your comment meant
2012-05-14T01:48:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	a really noob dev for what i can see
2012-05-14T01:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	and why do you think that?
2012-05-14T01:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	you were told twice how to do it. Use the :i386 suffix
2012-05-14T01:54:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	im not understanding
2012-05-14T01:54:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	like this:  apt-get install libkactivities6-i386   ?
2012-05-14T01:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	on a 64bit machine, replace "sudo apt-get install some_package" with "sudo apt-get install some_package:i386"
2012-05-14T01:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	please use paste.ubuntu.com for multi-line output
2012-05-14T01:56:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	ok
2012-05-14T02:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	if you continue to insult those attempting to help you, you will find that they will *quickly* cease attempting to help you
2012-05-14T02:01:00.000Z	simplew	DarwinSurvivor	the way you help its also insulting
2012-05-14T02:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	simplew	you have been told multiple times how to resolve the issue you have asked and are beginning to become an nuissance. If the solution you were given did not work, please use paste.ubuntu.com to show any error messages you received while attempting said solution
