2010-03-02T23:09:00.000Z	michael__		What's the most stable Ubuntu release available at the moment? I need something with excellent support for an ATI graphics card. At the moment I have Karmic x64 which has given me a million and one problems.
2010-03-02T23:09:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	you can't get "excellent" support for an ati card in gnu/linux...
2010-03-02T23:10:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	what do you suggest then?
2010-03-02T23:10:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	nothing, that's a fact. It's the present reality.
2010-03-02T23:11:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	I should do more research when purchasing cards.
2010-03-02T23:11:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	probably :)
2010-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	some ati cards are working decently, other are a real headache
2010-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	I now have a semi-expensive card that's useless.
2010-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	you can wait to see if new and improved drivers get published
2010-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	can you guesstimate how long that might take?
2010-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	XD no idea
2010-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	i guess nobody has
2010-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	I'm screwed then I suppose, at least for the moment.
2010-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	yep
2010-03-02T23:14:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	there are plenty of different categories of Nvidia cards
2010-03-02T23:14:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	I understand but I have paid like Â£50 (around $80) for an ATI card.
2010-03-02T23:15:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	and it doesn't work at all??
2010-03-02T23:16:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	it's a pain in the facking ass man. At the moment I am using ATI's drivers, and jack all works. Compiz sure doesn't, damn I can't even drag the windows around the desktop without experiencing the worst frame rate ever.
2010-03-02T23:17:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	uhm...that's weird...
2010-03-02T23:17:00.000Z	papapep-afk	michael__	which is the card model?
2010-03-02T23:17:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	yeah it's a pain.
2010-03-02T23:17:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	ATI Radeon 4670
2010-03-02T23:23:00.000Z	michael__	papapep-afk	okie doke thanks.
