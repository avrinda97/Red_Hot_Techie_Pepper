2011-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	worldwarcheese		Any help on removing files from a previously made boot-USB that now says "read only" when I need to wipe it to make a fresh install flash drive?
2011-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	you want to wipe it?
2011-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	yes and it's a PNY 16gb usb flashdrive
2011-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	cd into the directory, rm -rf * ?
2011-04-15T09:35:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	sorry if my command line work is a bit lacking but the USB says it's at /dev/sde and when I try to cd that I got as far as /dev$
2011-04-15T09:36:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	sde would be a file, no.
2011-04-15T09:38:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	that's okay and I can see it on my disk utility as /dev/sde so that's as far as I've gotten. do you at least know how to get past the whole "read only" part? I used to know, but have forgotten long ago
2011-04-15T09:38:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	wouldn't it just be sudo?
2011-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	haha yeah, if I remember the command for a wipe. I'm doing this all in-GUI ;_;
2011-04-15T09:40:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	D:
2011-04-15T09:46:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	don't know if this helps any but when I plug the flash drive in it is recocgnized by the Boot Disk Creator but not my filesystem...
2011-04-15T09:46:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	that's really odd.. can't you just format it?
2011-04-15T09:47:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	I tried using the Boot Disk Creator and it runs (making /dev/sde1 partition) but then when I try to open the partition to make the install drive nothing happens
2011-04-15T09:47:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	That's really odd. :S
2011-04-15T09:48:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	you're telling me. I've done this a hundred times over and NEVER seen this problem before.
2011-04-15T09:49:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	is something different from before?
2011-04-15T09:50:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	Only that these drives were used in an old SL install that when awry. Now I can't recocgnize, locate, format or remove files from them. It's insane
2011-04-15T09:50:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	it is. I'm intrigued now.
2011-04-15T09:51:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	however, I've already tried on other USB's and the same issues are coming up. In fact, every drive attatched to my machine is seen as an unrecocgnized drive that needs "format"ing before I can use through the USB startup disk creator or whatever it's called
2011-04-15T09:52:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	Sounds just like Window-
2011-04-15T09:53:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	Haha too right. And I hate to do and try Windows to solve the problem but I'm running out of time >_<
2011-04-15T09:53:00.000Z	UbuntuFanatic	worldwarcheese	I'm the same. I refuse to use it unless I have to. :/
2011-04-15T11:10:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	UbuntuFanatic	and izinucs, an update: I was 'saved' by... windows... VISTA (DAMN!) but now I have a bootdisk and a netbook with 10.10NBR and I feel safe again (like wrapped in blankets). Thanks for all yer help
