2012-08-25T08:48:00.000Z	Nautilus		huh, I'm trying to make two identically sized partitions on this hd, one has the total sector size I want but the same numbers in gparted make a slightly different size partition.  This seems so odd.
2012-08-25T08:48:00.000Z	Nautilus		different size second* partition
2012-08-25T08:49:00.000Z	Nautilus		no reason to have a logical partition unless desired
2012-08-25T08:50:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	So i will have 24 GB in Swap and just one primary parition covering rest of my 1TB Disk Space. Is that fine?
2012-08-25T08:50:00.000Z	Nautilus		well it's fine but the real decision is up to you and depending what you'll be doing.
2012-08-25T08:50:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	__dbro__, has it that way and it works fine for him. Just wanted to confirm if there is some implication to performance.
2012-08-25T08:51:00.000Z	Nautilus		if you're new to ubuntu and going to use it as a desktop, probably fine.
2012-08-25T08:51:00.000Z	Nautilus		not really a performance thing.  If you need more performance getbetter hardware ;)
2012-08-25T08:51:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	I will installl a Web Application on this. A Database (PosteGres), Apache Web Server etc
2012-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	Nautilus		i do that in my 30G partition ;)
2012-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	Nautilus		though it is getting full, heh
2012-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	Guddu		lol
2012-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	Guddu		So making N number of parton doesn't mean a better performance as such
2012-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	Nautilus		so the other side of the Q is do you need 1TB?  What if you used half the drive and left half open for future use?
2012-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	U mean don't add it to partition table at this stage?
2012-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	Nautilus		nope, in fact in some cases you'd be making the head travel further than it would within a partition.
2012-08-25T08:54:00.000Z	Nautilus	Guddu	right, but tha's a user decision.
2012-08-25T08:54:00.000Z	Guddu		Thanks Nautilus __dbro__ I wil make on partition for now... :)
2012-08-25T08:54:00.000Z	Nautilus	Guddu	a real web server or a dev box?
2012-08-25T08:55:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	Production machine
2012-08-25T08:56:00.000Z	Guddu	Nautilus	At one place it also ask Device for Boot Partition....It has 2 options /dev/sda (entire Disk) and /dev/sda1 (/)....Which one shud i select.
2012-08-25T08:57:00.000Z	Nautilus	Guddu	production machine, not sure i'm the best advice either, yea I'd do one partition full disc size (not counting thew swap)
2012-08-25T08:57:00.000Z	Nautilus	Guddu	about the prompt, I have no clue but since sda is the DRIVE and sda1 is the "/" partition, I'd said sda1
