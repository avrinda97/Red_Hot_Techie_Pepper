2009-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	r2wj1		What's the easiest way to share files between linux machines?
2009-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	r2wj1		Can I set that up with no terminal stuff?
2009-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	r2wj1		I don't mind the terminal, but my roommate is a newbie
2009-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	r2wj1		and he wants to share our files
2009-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	r2wj1		He loves netbook remix
2009-09-30T10:18:00.000Z	flying_penguin	r2wj1	woof is pretty simple
2009-09-30T10:18:00.000Z	flying_penguin		if you like the terminal netcat is awsome
2009-09-30T10:18:00.000Z	r2wj1		what is woof?
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	r2wj1		I normally use sshfs for my personal stuff
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	flying_penguin		woof is a simple web server for one off file transfers http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	r2wj1		But I want a really point and click friendly file sharing system
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	r2wj1	flying_penguin	unfortunatley, that is not quite suitable
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	flying_penguin		nfs is better for a more perminate solution
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	r2wj1		Well that's what I'm after
2009-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	r2wj1		He wants to access the media server downstairs
2009-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	r2wj1		(both are ubuntu)
2009-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	r2wj1		er, when I say media server
2009-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	flying_penguin		but woof or netcat are great for transfering a singe file. scp is probably my favorite though but for that you need to be able to login to the remote machene
2009-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	r2wj1		I mean.. it's a debian box with a big harddrive
2009-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	r2wj1		it's not actually running services on it yet.. that's why I'm here
2009-09-30T10:21:00.000Z	r2wj1		!info media-tomb | r2wj1
2009-09-30T10:22:00.000Z	r2wj1		ta muchly
