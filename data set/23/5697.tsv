2006-10-11T14:59:00.000Z	avagant		Is there a way I can make windows and such not look so slick on ubuntu?
2006-10-11T15:00:00.000Z	avagant		I know but it seems all the themes make the corners rounded and weird crap.
2006-10-11T15:00:00.000Z	avagant		boxes?
2006-10-11T15:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	check out another WM such as fluxbox or ratpoison.
2006-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	Beat me too it.
2006-10-12T16:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	lol
2006-10-12T16:08:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	Is my main hd with Ubuntu on it suppose to be mounted? It's not giving me problems but I'm not sure.
2006-10-12T16:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	what do you mean? i assume that / should be mounted...
2006-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	I mean like my main one is /dev/hda1
2006-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	i assume so...could you paste your /etc/fstab and the error you're getting to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org?
2006-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	It's not really an error, like I said nothing bad has happened so far.
2006-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	ah.
2006-10-12T16:11:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26364/
2006-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	that looks fine as far as i can tell...
2006-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26365/
2006-10-12T16:14:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	is that gonna be a problem?
2006-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	that looks fine except that there are no options or dump or pass specified for /dev/hdb1
2006-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	dump or pass?
2006-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	avagant	ladydoor	I'm about as n00b as they come.
2006-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	like all the other partitions have. the last two fields
2006-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	it's mounted.
2006-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	if your computer is on and you're in ubuntu, / is mounted.
2006-10-12T16:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	avagant	nope! it's already specified, if you look at your post! :-). sorry, but i've got to go now...
