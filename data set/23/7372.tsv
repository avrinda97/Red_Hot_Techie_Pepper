2007-12-27T03:26:00.000Z	collins		Hello all
2007-12-27T03:26:00.000Z	collins		I compiled the 2.6.23 kernel because i needed support for my aircard that doesnt exist in 2.6.22
2007-12-27T03:26:00.000Z	collins		when i compiled the new kernel, the nvidia driver stopped working
2007-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	collins		i installed the nvidia driver manually
2007-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	collins		and now it says i need to install linux-2.6.23-restricted-drivers
2007-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	collins		but i cant because it doesnt exist
2007-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	collins		can i remove the restricted drivers check from ubuntu
2007-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	collins		its rather annoying
2007-12-27T03:28:00.000Z	collins		who wants to use that crap anyway
2007-12-27T03:28:00.000Z	tritium	collins	anybody who wants fglrx, nvidia, madwifi support, etc.
2007-12-27T03:29:00.000Z	tritium	collins	i.e., it is _far_ from crap, as it supports prevalent hardware
2007-12-27T03:29:00.000Z	collins	tritium	how do i use the nvidia driver with a non-ubuntu kernel
2007-12-27T03:29:00.000Z	tritium	collins	you'll have to rebuild the restricted modules
2007-12-27T03:30:00.000Z	collins	tritium	i rebuilt the nvidia kernel module
2007-12-27T03:30:00.000Z	collins	tritium	and UBUNTU boots into safe graphics mode and tells me that i need the restricted drivers manager
2007-12-27T03:31:00.000Z	tritium	collins	why are you building your own kernel?
2007-12-27T03:31:00.000Z	collins	tritium	i have a Sprint Aircard, pci-express that has native support in kernels 2.6.23 and up
2007-12-27T03:31:00.000Z	tritium	collins	fair enough
2007-12-27T03:31:00.000Z	collins	tritium	they have hackjob drivers for earlier kernels
2007-12-27T03:32:00.000Z	tritium	collins	what is the exact error, and where is it being reported?
2007-12-27T03:33:00.000Z	collins	tritium	 "You need to install the package  linux-restricted-modules-2.6.23.12 for this program to work
2007-12-27T03:33:00.000Z	tritium	collins	at what point?
2007-12-27T03:34:00.000Z	collins	tritium	when i go to open the restricted drivers manager
