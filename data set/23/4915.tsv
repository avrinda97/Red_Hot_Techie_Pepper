2007-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		hey guys
2007-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		I am desperate for some help
2007-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		I recently installed ubuntu on my Dell Inspiron 1150
2007-04-11T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		I read a bunch of reports saying that the wifi doesn't work out of the box but that you can make it work using ndiswrapper
2007-04-11T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		but I can't get it to work!
2007-04-11T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		I need some help
2007-04-11T07:29:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		there are no linux drivers for my network card, so I'm trying to use ndiswrapper to wrap my windows drivers and get them working
2007-04-11T07:29:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		has anyone here had any experience with ndiswrapper?
2007-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		thanks visualdeception
2007-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	i'm using ndiswrapper.  i followed a howto in the ubuntu forums.  what wireless card does the dell use?
2007-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		it's a 1350
2007-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	orbin	I've followed tons of how-to's. It says that everthing is installed correctly but it's just not working
2007-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	how are you trying to connect?
2007-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		what do you mean orbin?
2007-04-11T07:39:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	well, i have had luck with the network monitor applet after giving up on the builtin network manager..
2007-04-11T07:39:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	orbin	what network moniter is that, and how can I get it?
2007-04-11T07:40:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/ ... what distro are you running though?
2007-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	orbin	umm...ubuntu of course
2007-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	sorry. which release?
2007-04-11T07:42:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		oh, 6.10
2007-04-11T07:45:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	ok, i'm just trying to remember how i installed it.  are you comfortable with installs from source?
2007-04-11T07:46:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	orbin	I dont know
2007-04-11T07:52:00.000Z	orbin	CheesyJedi	actually, i think it's part of the default install.  can you run nm-applet and see if an icon appears on one of your panels?
