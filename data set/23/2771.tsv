2008-11-25T16:50:00.000Z	yeryry		there's a windows terminal server/remote desktop connection client, but is there a server for linux?
2008-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 there is no, no rdp server, i think. but you can use xdmcp, x11 forwarding, vnc and maybe some other techniques
2008-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 one no too much ;)
2008-11-25T16:54:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	I've tried vnc.. works, but seems very slow compared to rdp.. I'll look into xdcmp
2008-11-25T16:55:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 yes, that is a problem. rdp is really fast...
2008-11-25T16:58:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 if you want to experiment, there seems a rdp capable x server... but you should do that on your own ;)
2008-11-25T16:58:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 it is called Xrdp
2008-11-25T16:59:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	hmm..
2008-11-25T17:00:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 what connection do you have between terminal server and client? if it has high bandwidth and low latency (ethernet/...) ,then try xdmcp. it will normally work well, if once set up
2008-11-25T17:01:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	yep, ethernet
2008-11-25T17:01:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	would that give me a new session when I log in remotely, or could I log in to the existing session?
2008-11-25T17:02:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 it would give a new
2008-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	hmm, not so good.. and when I disconnect what would happen to that session? could I reconnect to it later?
2008-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 disconnection would end the session, afaik
2008-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	ok, that's useless heh
2008-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 with ssh you get a faster remote experience ;)  screen give you the possibility of persistent consoles. maybe that suffices?
2008-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	heh.. I already use telnet, but I need GUI... maybe I can tweak vnc to be faster..
2008-11-25T17:07:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 yes, maybe
2008-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	I got xrdp going, but its basically a rdp to vnc gateway, and isn't really any faster than vnc itself..
2008-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	oskar-	yeryry	 ok, thanks for that feedback, so it isn't worth trying, is it?
2008-11-25T18:01:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	it could be very useful in some circumstances, but not to me right now I don't think.. I think perhaps some of my slowness is due to using the "fake vnc" of x11vnc, and maybe using "true" vnc would be faster.. but I need to keep the same session between logins....
2008-11-29T18:20:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	I
2008-11-29T18:20:00.000Z	yeryry	oskar-	I'm guessing pc speaker for laptop means inbuilt sound card, and not really pc speaker.. heh
