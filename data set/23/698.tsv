2011-03-27T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	do you have any ubuntu support questions ?
2011-03-27T14:10:00.000Z	jammiesAREon	ikonia	yea i asked a while ago no one knew the answer
2011-03-27T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	what's the problem, as the hardware discussion you are currently in maybe better in #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-03-27T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	it wasn't one thing, it was the whole hardware disscussion, looked like a good discussion for #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-03-27T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	if the wireless device driver in ubuntu supports it, yes you can do it with iwconfig
2011-03-27T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	I've done it with an intel card on an old laptop for pwoer saving
2011-03-27T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	it depends onthe card, the driver and it's syntax
2011-03-27T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	not call cards support it
2011-03-27T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	no it doesn't
2011-03-27T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	it borrows no features from it at all
2011-03-27T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	as ubuntu has not released gnome 3, it's version 2
2011-03-27T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	how do you know
2011-03-27T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jammiesAREon	why will ftp "be" open, you don't know his security setup
