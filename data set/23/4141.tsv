2009-10-08T02:28:00.000Z	[manas]		i got one question, im thinking to move on other hard disk (bigger one) it 300gb i was thinking to give for windows partiocion 80gb and rest for ubuntu but i dont know swap space should i give????
2009-10-08T02:30:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	usual rule of thumb is give swap 1.5x the amount of RAM. Although from 2GB RAM and above, i just match it. So i currently have a 2GB swap file, which is probably much more than i'd need.
2009-10-08T02:33:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	i got 2gb rams too , but some one told me what sawp space need to be big, even when i  inatlled ubuntu now by default on 80gb it took around 10gb for swap
2009-10-08T02:35:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	oh no, you don't need that at all. With 2GB RAM the most i would do is 3GB swap which is 1.5x your current RAM. You don't need 10GB.
2009-10-08T02:35:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	how can i check my swap size now?
2009-10-08T02:35:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	if you need THAT much RAM for some specific application maybe scientific? You'd be much better off investing in more RAM and 64bit Ubuntu.
2009-10-08T02:36:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	i got x86-64bit machine
2009-10-08T02:37:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	can u tell me how i can check my swap now?
2009-10-08T02:37:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	usually the easiest way is to run the 'top' program. The 'Swap:' value in the upper left is your swap file size.
2009-10-08T02:38:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	sorry i didnt get u
2009-10-08T02:38:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	and if you're already running 64bit then you can support more than 3GB so if you need more RAM see what your motherboard supports and upgrade. Honestly for normal use you do NOT need that much RAM. My workstation is an Intel Quad Q6600 w/ 2GB RAM and it's never reached it's limits.
2009-10-08T02:38:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	in a terminal window ("command prompt") type:  top  , look in the upper left for :  Swap: ......
2009-10-08T02:40:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	i got amd2 64 bit 2.7 dual core 2gn rams u think it will be enought rams?
2009-10-08T02:40:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	should be just fine.
2009-10-08T02:42:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	ok thankx mate one more think i was thinking to do some server on the home network so people can put and take some data what shuold i use ftp?
2009-10-08T02:44:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	depending on your needs i would look into SSH. I personally use Samba for network shares because it's the easiest to get working on all the platforms i have at home, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux.
2009-10-08T02:45:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	i was thinking samba too but if sometime i need connect not from the network is it still gonna work?
2009-10-08T02:46:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	like connecting from outside your home network? Sure so long as you have your actual Internet IP handy, and if you're behind a router, have forwarded the appropriate Samba ports to your internal server.
2009-10-08T02:48:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	i never used samba i just heard it very good, is it working same way as ftp u just writing adress in a tool bar? sorry for this sily questions :)
2009-10-08T02:50:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	essentially yes. It uses a slightly different syntax:  \\server\share  , so if your server is: 174.12.141.312 , and you're sharing a "Music" folder, typing: \\174.12.141.312\Music , in an address bar will pull it up.
2009-10-08T02:51:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	but can i put like user and pass if i need?
2009-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	altf2o	[manas]	absolutely. I restrict public shares to known individuals or groups and assign a password to it. I also have personal shares that no one but myself can access, which are also password protected. Then i have public shares that people can just get from but not write to\delete etc.... It's really versatile.
2009-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	[manas]	altf2o	ok mate im going for samba
