2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	Sakireth	gnomefreak	Try to install totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin with the newest gstreamer on your PC. it will complain about version difference (it needs an OLDER one). So.... wtf?

2006-08-27T12:02:00.000Z	Sakireth	gnomefreak	Any fixes?
2006-08-27T12:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Sakireth	try sudo apt-get -f install
2006-08-27T12:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Sakireth	you just typed what i did (no package name right?)
2006-08-27T12:03:00.000Z	Sakireth	gnomefreak	Yeah.
2006-08-27T12:04:00.000Z	Sakireth	gnomefreak	apt-get says, if i install it with that, that the package is broken. (First i did apt-get -f install without a packagename, then apt-get install packagename to see what was wrong)
2006-08-27T12:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Sakireth	other than removing and reinstalling them i dont have a fix for it atm

2006-08-27T12:05:00.000Z	Sakireth	gnomefreak	Alright.
