2005-10-14T14:44:00.000Z	bob2	daejavu	use packages.ubuntu.com to find the pckage that is in
2005-10-14T14:44:00.000Z	bob2	daejavu	bear in mind that program is ridiculously old, tho, and probably not maintained
2005-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	bob2	daejavu	no, read what I said: search packages,ubuntu.com for libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3
2005-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	daejavu	bob2	copy that .. lemme check !
2005-10-14T14:47:00.000Z	daejavu	bob2	unable to find the package ! :S
