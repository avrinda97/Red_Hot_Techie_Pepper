2006-04-21T13:19:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	it has to be in the directory you are in at the moment
2006-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	Lit3	kingspawn	its extracted on the desktop
2006-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	well, from a terminal you have to cd ~/Desktop/ies4linux
2006-04-21T13:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	you gotta chmod the FILE you want to change, like chmod a+x MyFile
2006-04-21T13:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	that makes MyFile executable
2006-04-21T13:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	thats correct
2006-04-21T13:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	yeah, then ./ies4linux
2006-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	if the file is called ies4linux, yes you did
2006-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	go for it
2006-04-21T13:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	seems a safe bet

2006-04-21T13:30:00.000Z	kingspawn	Lit3	come on man, you cant ask about every single step. open with lets you extract immediately, save to disk keeps the file and lets you extract later
