2008-01-28T07:39:00.000Z	zetheroo		I would like the Pictures, Music and Video folders to be shared between users so that I do not have to have copies of all my media on both users...... how is this possible?
2008-01-28T07:39:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	you can either set the appropriate permissions or move the folders out of the home folder
2008-01-28T07:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	but can both users use the same folder equally?
2008-01-28T07:41:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	Either method are more or less the same
2008-01-28T07:42:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	I have Elisa Media Center working in another User without XGL loading so that Elisa can take full advantage of the 3D acceleration..... but I need Elisa to be able to grab the media from those three folders without me having to copy the data to that user and use up twice the disk space
2008-01-28T07:44:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	hmm... ok, well, I think the easiest way is to move the folder to some folder in root, say /mediacenter
2008-01-28T07:44:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	and give everyone read and write permissions
2008-01-28T07:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	but Elisa looks by default at the Home folder where those three folder are.....
2008-01-28T07:45:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	you can then add a symbolic link to your home folders
2008-01-28T07:46:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	maybe AikoAIko's idea is better
2008-01-28T07:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	oh I see... and delete the other 3 folders
2008-01-28T07:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	what idea?
2008-01-28T07:47:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	<AikoAiko> zetherroo: how about chmod a+rw the common directory and then ln -s common /home/dest
2008-01-28T07:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	I dunno how to do any of that terminal stuff.... sorry
2008-01-28T07:47:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	I never use Elisa, so I'm not sure how it works
2008-01-28T07:48:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	does it look at all the folders in home, or just specific folders?
2008-01-28T07:48:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	those three
2008-01-28T07:50:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	Let's say you have user1 that will hold all the media files
2008-01-28T07:50:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	so for all other users... remove the Music, Video, etc folders
2008-01-28T07:50:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	then do ln -s Video /home/user1/Video in each user's home directory
2008-01-28T07:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	so just make shortcuts
2008-01-28T07:51:00.000Z	dreamnid	zetheroo	finally in /home/user1/ chmod -R 777 Video
2008-01-28T07:51:00.000Z	zetheroo	dreamnid	oh ok
