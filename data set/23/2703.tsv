2009-02-24T14:08:00.000Z	gluonman		I am trying to figure out how to connect my T-Mobile Dash to my Ubuntu laptop so that I can do file transfers. The phone is unrecognized, though.
2009-02-24T14:10:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	are you using usb or bluetooth?
2009-02-24T14:11:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	I'm using USB.
2009-02-24T14:11:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	does the phone support detection as usb hd? if not you may need some particular programs
2009-02-24T14:12:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	the phone uses wm5.2 (Windows Mobile). It's designed for USB file-transfers and autosync. But Ubuntu just won't recognize it.
2009-02-24T14:15:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	try searching for your phone model and ubuntu, also check if it shows up with sudo fdisk -l
2009-02-24T14:16:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	does it work okay in other computers? maybe some option on the phone must be enabled
2009-02-24T14:17:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	if I plug it into a Windows computer, it automatically pops up the file-transfer/sync gui. So I can get my phone's pictures, etc. on a computer if it's WIndows no problem.
2009-02-24T14:17:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	so no, it's not the phone. It's Ubuntu.
2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	what is the phone model?
2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	it's the T-Mobile Dash.
2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	the Dash's OS is wm5.2
2009-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	have you seen synce.org?
2009-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	no.
2009-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	is it synce.org or did you intend sync.org?
2009-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	synCE.org
2009-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	alright. Does it do file transfer?
2009-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	think so, here is ubuntu install guide: http://www.synce.org/moin/SynceWithUbuntu
2009-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	thank you. I'll check that out. Any problems and I'll be back to ask you.
2009-02-24T14:26:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	hope that works idk if there is an easier way
2009-02-24T14:26:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	thanks.
2009-02-24T14:26:00.000Z	mchelen	gluonman	check the 8.10 guide if you are using intrepid
2009-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	gluonman	mchelen	alright.
