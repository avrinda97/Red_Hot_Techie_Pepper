2007-07-29T14:41:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	you are quite correct on that one, they do not seem to exist. and I doubt any ported tests really do any good since those ports are generally shoddy.
2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	what libs and tests?
2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	I've glanced at the methodology done by this guy: http://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	and it seems pretty fair. the libs he used  are design to make simple syscalls while not creating some overhead by themselves.
2007-07-29T14:46:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	fork umm.. I don't know about that one.. but I guess you could test that out, you'd just for all fairness have to use the direct windows api calls instead of some posix layer or cygwin for everything.. and visual studio for compiling
2007-07-29T14:46:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	(sorry my friend spilled some sprite on my keyboard and until replacement, I'll be typing quite slow)
2007-07-29T14:47:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	but if that was done, that'd be something yeah.
2007-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	of course, I'll be natively compiling those on each target arch... and indeed they might now apply correctly on windows. But really, such stats haven't seen the light since 2003 at best?
2007-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	most of the tests I have seen in last couple years have been synthetic and have measured something the very high level applications do.. like serving web pages etc..
2007-07-29T14:49:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	instead of w2k3/xp, taht'd be nice if that was done against Vista Business. (or ultimate) NOT home or home premium, they might not have similar kernel etc.. those home versions are not really meant to be used by anyone
2007-07-29T14:49:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	that'd be first
2007-07-29T14:50:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	because I have seen so far NO real good benchmarks of vista. and, I'd like to see one more benchmark actually
2007-07-29T14:51:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	something that measures how effectively the OS can delete files randomly. if you test that linux/bsds vs vista, you will get VERY surprising results I promise
2007-07-29T14:51:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	yes but I don't care much about high level apps. Let's say I wanna measure the groundings for top-level applications. Of course, enterprise use and end-user use are two different thing and such benchs will have to take this into account.
2007-07-29T14:52:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	yes, the idea is valid and good!
2007-07-29T14:52:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	if you even take all the handles ready.. say 20 000 files, handles on table.. and just iterate through it and ask for the file to be deleted on lowest possible level.. vista will be some 5x slower than any bsd or linux
2007-07-29T14:54:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	that is a building block mmkay as well :) and it's true, not just measured properly so far
2007-07-29T14:55:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	yes, I've read a study on file systems behaviors and indeed, lots of factors have to be considered (journaled fs vs softupdates and all the optimizations and contexts (raid levels etc))
2007-07-29T14:56:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	just take something very default from each family. it doesn't matter. one of them will be extraordinaly slow on moving and deleting :)
2007-07-29T15:00:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	the bsd's and linuxes etc have been beaten to death. no one has benchmarked the windows on level playfield in years
2007-07-29T15:03:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	yes they have been tested but I feel there's a lack of updates. If the best comparison (say linux vs bsds) I can get dates from 2003 I think any bsd/linux kernel dev wouldn't care about these. (and of course, yes there's a big gap concerning windows, solaris and some other minorities)
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	Anlar	strav_	when the linux devs change things they compare subjectively themselves, so they know where they area heading... so, interesting.. but not really for them.
2007-07-29T15:07:00.000Z	strav_	Anlar	you think of a place I can ask where I could get help for setting things as most objective as possible? (and yea this isn't planned for the devs (but still could suggest them to look elsewhere)... perhaps giving a good insight on performance could help the end-users (other consideration aside ie.: security, etc) in choosing a system that suits their needs)
