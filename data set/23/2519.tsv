2009-02-11T19:01:00.000Z	AdvoWork		is there any reason why i can ping ip from remotepc - otherpc, but if i goto http://ip from the remotepc it times out, yet http://ip on the localpc works fine
2009-02-11T19:03:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> can you ping from remote to localpc?

2009-02-11T19:06:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> can you ping from remote to localpc? but what is the result?
2009-02-11T19:06:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> also try telnet 80  from remote to localpc

2009-02-11T19:17:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> from your local, can you do  http://localhost  ?
2009-02-11T19:17:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	yeah local works fine
2009-02-11T19:17:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> your local has firewall activated?
2009-02-11T19:18:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	says Firewall not loaded
2009-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> verify with   sudo iptables -vL
2009-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> and what are the os on  both ends?
2009-02-11T19:20:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	both are ubuntu
2009-02-11T19:20:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> verify with   sudo iptables -vL   what does this tells you,  post the results please
2009-02-11T19:21:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	http://pastebin.com/d5ae8ebc4
2009-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> you noticed your default policy is DROP ?  this could prevent your remote host getting into your localhost port 80
2009-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	ahh i dont really understand much abotu that, can it be changed?
2009-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> and also whatever tool you were using telling you Firewall is not loaded.. its giving you false info, you have firewall active all the time, and yours happen to have rules active right now
2009-02-11T19:28:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	oh, so what can i do? i used "ufw status"
2009-02-11T19:28:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> iptables are complex, there are front ends like ufw and such.. for atutorial see http://www.linuxexposed.com/content/view/107/
2009-02-11T19:29:00.000Z	n8tuserff	AdvoWork	-> what you can do is a tutorial on iptables
2009-02-11T19:32:00.000Z	AdvoWork	n8tuserff	hmm, allowed port 80 in iptables, yet still times out
