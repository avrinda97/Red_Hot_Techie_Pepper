2008-09-29T11:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Bidget; you could look in X Server Display Configuration in Nvidia-settings to see if you can move the Layout of the tv monitor down
2008-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Bidget; then the resolution your card is pushing to the tv is not big enough, with component it does not resample the image and displays the exact resolution, if your tv is 1280x1024 but your card pushed 800x600 then it will have blank spots
2008-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Bidget; using an S-Video cable will fix the problem.
2008-09-29T11:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Bidget; you'll need to get the tv resolution set correctly, otherwise you'll have blank spots.
2008-09-29T12:00:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	her tv is a standard one.. not a plasma or lcd.. difficult to believe that a standard tv could display 1280x1024 but it might if it was real quality
2008-09-29T12:02:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	she's using twinview and would like to setup xinerama..

2010-01-30T21:28:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	you need  'service' ?
2010-01-30T21:29:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	if you don't then there are 3 ways to do it.. sudo gdm stop / sudo service gdm stop / sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop ..
2010-01-30T21:29:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	gotcha. thanks
2010-04-12T18:18:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	how did you install Namoroko? a .tar.gz?
2010-04-12T18:21:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	you should be able to apt-get remove firefox (if the package is firefox) then remove the ppa and apt-get update then apt-get upgrade then reinstall firefox ..
2010-04-12T18:22:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	I'll give it a shot.. I was thinking along the same lines..
2010-04-12T18:43:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	ok.. uninstalled Namoroka(FF) .. disabled the PPA.. updated, upgraded, dist-upgraded.. looked in synaptic and see several versions of FF .. installed FF 3.0.. renamed .mozilla to .mozilla.backup and FF won't start.. tries but doesn't start.
2010-04-12T18:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	any errors when trying to start firefox from a terminal?
2010-04-12T18:48:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	I'll check
2010-04-12T18:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	they have firefox-3.5 in the repo's.
2010-04-12T18:49:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	3.5 shows but isn't installable.. this is on Hardy.. error starting from terminal is "Could not find compatible GRE between version 1.9.0.1 and 1.9.0.*
2010-04-12T18:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	from googling i found this as a possible solution.. sudo xulrunner-1.9 --register-global
2010-04-12T18:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	did that help?
2010-04-12T19:00:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	almost.. it asked for multiple options.. so instead I uninstalled xulrunner (2 versions) and then installed FF which pulled the right version of xul..and configured it.
2010-04-12T19:00:00.000Z	scunizi	bastid_raZor	later I'll play with java and get that going.. thanks for the help.
2010-04-12T19:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	scunizi	good luck
