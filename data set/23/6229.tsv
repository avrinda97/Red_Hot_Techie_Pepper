2006-07-05T07:34:00.000Z	oskude	ucordes	did you install fglrx ?
2006-07-05T07:34:00.000Z	oskude	ucordes	the package name is xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-07-05T07:35:00.000Z	oskude	ucordes	i doubt that its preinstalled (by ubuntu installer)
2006-07-05T07:35:00.000Z	ucordes	oskude	i think it is- because in linux restricted modules (wich is installed) is also my madwifi driver installed, which works
