2007-12-17T13:07:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	That's news to me
2007-12-17T13:08:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	What is?
2007-12-17T13:08:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	That it comes with compiz-fusion. Does that mean if I upgrade to Gutsy I'll have compiz by default?
2007-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	Yeah, only they're labeled "Visual Effects" and enabled via GNOME's Appearance settings
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	Oh hey, I think Feisty has that too
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	One of the goals of integration with Ubuntu is that people don't have to know what Compiz is -- they'll just have these effects which are a natural part of the system
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	I know, that makes sense
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	Yes, but Feisty had a really old version of it (0.3-ish, I think?) and the one in Gutsy is 0.6.
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	It should be more obvious though
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	What's an easy way to upgrade from Feisty to Gutsy? Via CD?
2007-12-17T13:11:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	I guess we're in an awkward transitional state, where some people know what Compiz is and don't recognise it in Gutsy (so they try to install it), and others don't know what it is...
2007-12-17T13:11:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	Well, some people still install Beryl -.-
2007-12-17T13:11:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	Mm, the upgrade manager should at least tell you that there's a new dist version...
2007-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	The online upgrade would require the download of roughly 600+ MB of packages though (at least, this was my experience). It is _also_ possible to download the Alternate CD and use it as a repo in Synaptic (for an offline upgrade).
2007-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	I'm thinking I'd rather just insert the CD I have and do an upgrade there, right?
2007-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	Not sure about using the regular live CD for a full upgrade... I was told to use the alt CD.
2007-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	Hmm, darn
2007-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	but if you can leave your computer on for those several hours, then I guess, go for it?
2007-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	I'm so tired of burning Linux CD's -.-
2007-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	(for the online upgrade, I mean)
2007-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	MontoyaC	Fyda	When I get back from my trip, sure
2007-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	Haha, I have a CD album full of different distro discs :D
2007-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	Fyda	MontoyaC	It's always fun to try something new. And hey, a live CD can be useful for emergency rescue
