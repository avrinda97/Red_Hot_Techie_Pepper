2007-08-17T11:00:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	due to legal issues, ubuntu can not pre-install any proprietary software, it is kind of the "we can make it available, but can not be held liable for any royaly fees or any of that, but if you really want it, you can get it... here"
2007-08-17T11:01:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	Seems free enough for Debian.
2007-08-17T11:02:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	I don't know about Debian, I know Mepis has the option to "opt-in" but I think they have a deal or something for 3-D KDE
2007-08-17T11:02:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	The nv drivers do not handle 3D.
2007-08-17T11:03:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	correct, nv and Vesa don't do 3-d. you have to install the proprietary drivers for that option
2007-08-17T11:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	Back to my original question...
2007-08-17T11:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	Still, why doesn't the default installer allow those cards?  (Not even with the free nv driver)
2007-08-17T11:04:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	that would be more of a question for the Ubuntu folks. I'm sorry, I don't have the answer.
2007-08-17T11:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	But the nv driver is NOT proprietary. I think it's even part of xorg.
2007-08-17T11:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	The NVidia driver, sure, but I'm not talking about the NVidia driver, but the nv driver.
2007-08-17T11:06:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	every time I loaded any distro, it loaded with either Vesa or nv
2007-08-17T11:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	So it does allow you to use that card, you don't need to use the alternative CD?
2007-08-17T11:08:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	nope, I use the standard graphical live CD to install
2007-08-17T11:09:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	I am not the best example though, I mean, no matter what, I have to re-configure my xorg after install, because of my monitor (Acer AL1916W) 1440 x 900
2007-08-17T11:12:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	exactly.
2007-08-17T11:13:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	the whole deal is that by doing it the way they do it, they free themselves from any liability in the issues
2007-08-17T11:13:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	You keep seeming to utterly ignore /which/ driver I"m talking about. Makes for a very confusing convo on your end.
2007-08-17T11:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	And so my point was, since Ubuntu "always loaded the nv driver during install for me", you DO NOT need the "alternate cd", because the normal CD supports it just fine.
2007-08-17T11:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	Yup.
2007-08-17T11:15:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	yes.
2007-08-17T11:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	But that's exactly what people here seem to suggest that you require, you must've also ignored the context in which the convo started, making it even more confusing for you. :)
2007-08-17T11:17:00.000Z	genefitz	Arafangion	I am sorry, I must have missed that.
2007-08-17T11:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	genefitz	No problem, we've all done that :)
