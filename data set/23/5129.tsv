2007-02-11T14:44:00.000Z	andou	mynick	Thanks :)
2007-02-11T14:44:00.000Z	mynick	andou	welcome
2007-02-11T16:21:00.000Z	andou	mynick	I see. So, I should just use a different terminal?
2007-02-11T16:18:00.000Z	mynick	andou	ctrl/alt/f1
2007-02-11T16:18:00.000Z	andou	mynick	thanks, but it's not doing anything.
2007-02-11T16:19:00.000Z	mynick	andou	not sure, ctrl/alt/f1....f5 should be all terminal sessions
2007-02-11T16:19:00.000Z	andou	mynick	I'm following a LAMP install guide. I did this: vi /etc/fstab
2007-02-11T16:19:00.000Z	mynick	andou	okay, so your in the gnome terminal probably?
2007-02-11T16:19:00.000Z	andou	mynick	thre's no GUI
2007-02-11T16:20:00.000Z	mynick	andou	gui for what? apache?
2007-02-11T16:20:00.000Z	andou	mynick	I don't know what you mean by gnome terminal. I thought gnome was a GUI. I'm quite new to this.
2007-02-11T16:21:00.000Z	mynick	andou	oh thats okay we'll work through it
2007-02-11T16:21:00.000Z	andou	mynick	Thanks :)
2007-02-11T16:21:00.000Z	andou	mynick	Ok. I got it, thanks :)
2007-02-11T16:22:00.000Z	mynick	andou	typically a gui refers to applications with lots of pulldown menues and widgets ... hard to put into words now that i think about it
2007-02-11T16:41:00.000Z	andou	mynick	I couldn't seem to get out of vi without ctl-alt-del and restarting.
2007-02-11T16:41:00.000Z	andou	mynick	But, nano is fine.
2007-02-11T16:42:00.000Z	mynick	andou	vi is weird.  you haveto type : character then it will tell you what character to type to get out of it
2007-02-11T16:42:00.000Z	andou	mynick	Yeah. nano is easy to see. Thanks for the tip. So, I type : before the commands for vi?
