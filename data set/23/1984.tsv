2010-03-10T12:27:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	enable vino from within gnome
2010-03-10T12:28:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	set the gnome session in the xstartup file in the .vnc folder and restart vnc
2010-03-10T12:29:00.000Z	testpage	malifal	its gnome-session correct
2010-03-10T12:30:00.000Z	testpage	malifal	it would be nice to tell me exactly what it should be, i know it should be gnome
2010-03-10T12:33:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	sorry, yes i think that is correct
2010-03-10T12:33:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	you need to have port 5900 open or use tunneling
2010-03-10T12:35:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	what display number did it take? if :0 then it's 5900 if :1 then it's 5901
2010-03-10T12:37:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	that means vnc is working but starting twm
2010-03-10T12:38:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	vncserver -kill :0
2010-03-10T12:38:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	vncserver -kill :1
2010-03-10T12:39:00.000Z	testpage	malifal	when i login i get x terminal and this
2010-03-10T12:39:00.000Z	malifal	testpage	not sure what
