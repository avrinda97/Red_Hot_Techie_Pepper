2009-11-15T09:07:00.000Z	nvme		is there a way for me to make sure that all NTFS partitions are always mounted read only ?
2009-11-15T09:08:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	you can set the options in your fstab file, but if you mount any *new* NTFS partitions later, they won't just automatically be mounted ro too
2009-11-15T09:10:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	okay thats good enough i guess
2009-11-15T09:11:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	mount may support some sort of global default options too, but i don't know about it if it does
2009-11-15T09:24:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	i believe so
2009-11-15T09:25:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	do i have to do that every time i boot then ?
2009-11-15T09:25:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	if you don't delete the directory, it should just stay there when you u(n)mount / reboot
2009-11-15T09:29:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	i cant unmount the drives without root access now, is there a way to fix that ?
2009-11-15T09:30:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	hmm, shouldn't matter under ubuntu I think
2009-11-15T09:30:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	ah i got it i just need to put user instead of nouser
2009-11-15T09:31:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	sounds about right
2009-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	nvm that didnt work :P i still cant unmount drives without root
2009-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	what happens if you right click and 'eject' it?
2009-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	ejecting says the drive is busy, i need to unmount it before i can eject and i cant unmount without root which is a bit of a pain
2009-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	if it's busy, then maybe it really is
2009-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	i dont think you can eject a drive that is mounted
2009-11-15T09:37:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	eject is the GUI / user friendly way of saying unmount for most disks...obviously physically ejects ejectable media too
2009-11-15T09:46:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	i still cant mount / unmount the drives, it doesnt even ask me for a pass it just says you cant mount without root, i have to do it commandline
2009-11-15T09:48:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	google for autofs   that should help you :)
2009-11-15T09:50:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	i dont really want automounting, all i want to do is restrict my ntfs partitions to read only
2009-11-15T09:50:00.000Z	Wallace	nvme	i told you how to do that :p   you then said you wanted to do it as non-root
2009-11-15T09:51:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	well i added the fstab stuff , but doing that prevents me from being able to use the GUI to mount/unmount
2009-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	nvme	Wallace	right i dont mind having to mount with a password, problem is i get no password request :P
