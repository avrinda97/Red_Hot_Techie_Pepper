2009-01-05T23:03:00.000Z	LuXor		any help??? :(
2009-01-05T23:03:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	did you right-click network manager applet and use that gui (right click on the network icon in the top right and select Edit Conenctions...)
2009-01-05T23:04:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	nope.. i was just following the paper what i have just gave you
2009-01-05T23:04:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	ok, so try that. Its easier anyway. Ok, so do you have the "Network Connections" Dialog open?
2009-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	you mean configure the IP-s from the Network Manager?
2009-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	yes: right click on network manager, select "Edit connections"
2009-01-05T23:06:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	& then?
2009-01-05T23:06:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	is it a wired or wireless network you want to set a static ip for?
2009-01-05T23:07:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	& no.. its some zyxel modem connected to lan card.. i don know what is name of that
2009-01-05T23:07:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	so basically you just want to connect to the internet?
2009-01-05T23:08:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	& yes
2009-01-05T23:08:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	do you have dsl?
2009-01-05T23:08:00.000Z	homy		or what kind of a modem is it?
2009-01-05T23:09:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	& yes its DSL, and the modem is ZyXel ( i dont know model )
2009-01-05T23:09:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	ok, so select the DSL tab in "Network Connections"
2009-01-05T23:09:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	there is some user and password to configure... no static ip
2009-01-05T23:10:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	yes. the details you got from your provider. Why do you want to set a static ip address?
2009-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	because on windows it needs to be configured. and when you configure it your on the internet in some seconds...
2009-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	LuXor	homy	i dont know elseway to connect to internet
2009-01-05T23:13:00.000Z	homy	LuXor	sorry, as I know it, ussually you get password/username from your provider (if you have a usb-modem). Maybe sb else can help you
