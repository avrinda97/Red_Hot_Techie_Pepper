2006-11-03T08:35:00.000Z	texas915		what is the comand to install software
2006-11-03T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	sudo apt-get install whatever
2006-11-03T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	or sudo aptitude install whatever, if you prefer that
2006-11-03T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	yes, it is in the universe repository if you enable that you can just do sudo apt-get install kismet
2006-11-03T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	have you enabled the extra repos or do you know how?
2006-11-03T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	repository
2006-11-03T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	to enable the extra repositories and install kismet just copy and paste the following command: sudo vim -c '%s/# deb/deb/g' -c 'wq' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kismet
2006-11-03T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	did that work?
2006-11-03T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	well did it install kismet when you copied and pasted that into the terminal?
2006-11-03T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	just enter kismet into the terminal
2006-11-03T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	what does it say when you do "kismet"?
2006-11-03T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	have you tried looking in the menus for it. It might be in system>administration
2006-11-03T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	did you find it?
2006-11-03T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	...
2006-11-03T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	did you look in the menus like I said?
2006-11-03T08:55:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	well look see if you can find it. It might be in system>administration, look in all of them.
2006-11-03T08:56:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	do you know if it is a graphical app or a command line app?
2006-11-03T08:58:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	ok try gksudo kismet
2006-11-03T09:00:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	any progress?
2006-11-03T09:01:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	what is it saying now?
2006-11-03T09:03:00.000Z	bruenig	texas915	looks like a problem with kismet not installation or anything like that. I have never used kismet so I probably can't be of much help
