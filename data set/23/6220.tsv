2006-05-31T05:40:00.000Z	d42		How do I obtain the signing key used for a package, prior to running "apt-get install <package>", so that the key can be registered before doing the install?
2006-05-31T05:40:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	which repository?
2006-05-31T05:40:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	I don't know. Is there a generic way of finding out the key?
2006-05-31T05:41:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	I know the package name.
2006-05-31T05:42:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	Is it important to find out the repository name?
2006-05-31T05:42:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	usually it's "trying to install" followed by "missing key 1234567890ABCDEF" followed by "gpg --recv-keys 90ABCDEF && gpg --export --armor 90ABCDEF | sudo apt-key add -"
2006-05-31T05:43:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	yes, I saw many suggestions to that effect while searching Google for the past few hours on this subject.
2006-05-31T05:43:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	unfortunately I don't have the key.
2006-05-31T05:43:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	gpg --recb-key downloads it
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	yes, once I know the key, but I don't know the key.
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	apt-get will tell you 
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	Good, How does apt-get tell me?
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	apt-get didn't tell me, when I attempted to install the package.
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	Seveas		it will tell you when you do apt-get update
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	Seveas		W: GPG error: http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl dapper-seveas Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 49A120FD1135D466
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	Seveas		something like that
2006-05-31T05:47:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	I don't quite follow. I wish to install a new package. So how is apt-get update going to help?
2006-05-31T05:47:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	well, that package is in a repository...
2006-05-31T05:48:00.000Z	Seveas		if you simply have a .deb you cannot get missing key errors
2006-05-31T05:48:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	yes, it is in a repository.
2006-05-31T05:49:00.000Z	Seveas	d42	so do apt-get update, look at the gpg error, and add the key....
2006-05-31T05:51:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	Oh! I see! I've done "apt-get update" and now the packing is installing without authentication errors.
2006-05-31T05:51:00.000Z	d42	Seveas	Thanks for you help.
