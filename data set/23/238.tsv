2012-03-02T03:29:00.000Z	Zaitzev		I have google chrome installed, but it doesn't show in software center, how do I remove it completely?
2012-03-02T03:30:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	how did you install it?
2012-03-02T03:30:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	a .deb I believe
2012-03-02T03:31:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	problem is, it seems chrome is broken since flash (and a bunch of other plugins) isn't installed there..
2012-03-02T03:31:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	try doing "which chrome" (or whatever) to find the binary, then "dpkg --search <whatever which gave you>" to see if it tells you anything helpful?
2012-03-02T03:33:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	this is what it returned; google-chrome-stable: /usr/bin/google-chrome
2012-03-02T03:33:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	^
2012-03-02T03:52:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	I seem to remember having to symbolic link the flash .so file into a directory for chrome to see it.
2012-03-02T03:52:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	yeah?
2012-03-02T03:52:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	yea had to do it on debian. looking for details now.
2012-03-02T03:54:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	this isn't it, but try this to make sure: http://linux.chrissweeney.co.uk/topic.php?t=76
2012-03-02T03:54:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	already did just that. it is non-existant
2012-03-02T03:56:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	look for a /plugins directory in your chrome directory
2012-03-02T03:57:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	there aren't any
2012-03-02T03:58:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	yes
2012-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	yea how did you install flash? I recommend you install that flashplugin-installer package. look to see if /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so exists
2012-03-02T04:00:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	just look to see if it's there. you might be running flash through some gnash half-bakery and that might be the breakage. :P
2012-03-02T04:00:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	I try ;D
2012-03-02T04:01:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	guess I gotta install flashplugin-installer then
2012-03-02T04:05:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
2012-03-02T04:05:00.000Z	draeath	Zaitzev	it runs a small animation and tells you the version you are running
2012-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	i know, hehe
2012-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	Zaitzev	draeath	you are my hero of the day
