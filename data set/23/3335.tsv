2009-05-08T02:11:00.000Z	computa_mike		Got a question about monodevelop on Ibex...  Seems to not compile vb.net apps...  Anyone got any ideas?
2009-05-08T02:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	did you install the vb stuff for mono?
2009-05-08T02:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	like did you install mono-vbnc?
2009-05-08T02:13:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	: ahh - so that's what it's called... I was looking for vbnc...I shall install it now...
2009-05-08T02:24:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	Hi mgolisch - I've tried everywhere to find VBNC or some variation in the repositories...
2009-05-08T02:24:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	and?
2009-05-08T02:25:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	oh - and I agree - .net totally does suck ... but the company I work for are still using VB5, and they think that VB.NET will be a smoother transition...
2009-05-08T02:25:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	hm dotnet rocks, but all vb languages sucks due to their weird syntax
2009-05-08T02:26:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	to fill you in further : no VBNC in the repositories.
2009-05-08T02:26:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	it is for me, in the universe repo
2009-05-08T02:27:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	maybe its named differently before, or they use some old mono version where the vb.net part wasnt developed by an external party
2009-05-08T02:27:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	I'm still in Ibex... I'll make sure Universe is enabled...  Sorry I tool so long getting back...  At least I know that the reason it won't compile is : there is no compiler...  Sort of a matrix style "there is no spoon" thing going on.
2009-05-08T02:27:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	Personally - iprefer C# anyday.
2009-05-08T02:31:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	you might need to search for newer mono packages or maybe just build mono and related stuff from source
2009-05-08T02:31:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	i checked on packages.ubuntu.com, intrepid doenst seem to have that
2009-05-08T02:32:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	I am planning to upgrade to Jaunty - so that should (in theory) solve that problem
2009-05-08T02:32:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mono/+bug/129524
2009-05-08T02:34:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	Infact I feel rather bad for not upgrading almost instantly - I upgrade my brother's laptop from windows to Ibex, and he had upgraded himself all on his own without me having to prompt him.  Can I upgrade from the live CD?  If I boot from the live CD and install will it wreck my current install, or is it just best to let it dist-upgrade?
2009-05-08T02:35:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	i think you can only upgrade using the alternatecd but i might be wrong
2009-05-08T02:35:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	but maybe you can use the livecd as a installation source too
2009-05-08T02:36:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	an interesting idea - I'll try it.
2009-05-08T02:37:00.000Z	computa_mike	mgolisch	thanks for all the help - I just popped over to the pidgin forum becuase I was having such a terrible time trying to type users names, and they clued me in on the Tab auto complete function.  I feel like I've taken my first steps into a a larger world.
2009-05-08T02:38:00.000Z	mgolisch	computa_mike	hehe
