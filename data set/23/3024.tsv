2009-10-07T18:27:00.000Z	JuJuBee		 I did a apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade last night on my home desktop and now I cannot use it. After entering the username and password, I get a black screen with my mouse pointer and it never changes. I looked at dmesg but didn't notice anything obvious and I tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but still no luck. What else can I do?

2009-10-07T18:27:00.000Z	JuJuBee		sorry
2009-10-07T18:28:00.000Z	JuJuBee		didn't mean to do that twice
2009-10-07T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	does alt+f2 work?
2009-10-07T18:29:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	yes
2009-10-07T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	run nautilus ;)
2009-10-07T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	nautilus draws the desktop, so its probably not started
2009-10-07T18:30:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	I will try that when I get home later.  I am using kde mostly, but did install gnome
2009-10-23T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	the app is ready but the deps have not being made yet
2009-10-23T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	so you will get updates held back until they are ready
2009-10-23T16:37:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	 Oh, thanks.  I thought maybe I had something installed that I shouldnt have
2009-10-23T16:39:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	 The updates are for Linux-headers-generic-2.6.28.15.20(amd64) same for restricted-modules, generic and image-generic  is this normal?
2009-10-23T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	you can run: sudo apt-get install limux-image-2.6.28.15.20     if you really NEED the kernel. If your system is fine then you dont need it
2009-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	so it will be "unblocked" when the deps are finished?
2009-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	yeah, when its ready it will come down
2009-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	cool, thanks for the info
2009-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	I am currently running 64Bit on a core 2 duo 2.54  am I "really" benefiting by using 64 bit or is there not really much diff from 32 bit?
2009-10-23T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	how much ram do you have?
2009-10-23T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	apps like audio and video encoding / decoding benefit from 64bit
2009-10-23T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	you NEED 64bit as you have more than 3Gb RAM
2009-10-23T16:51:00.000Z	JuJuBee	ActionParsnip1	thanks for that
2009-10-23T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JuJuBee	max for 32bit + PAE is about 6Gb ram (i think) max for 64bit is 4 exabtytes
