2005-05-08T05:45:00.000Z	g14		rpm has an option to restore permissions. Does anyone know if dpkg has a similar option?
2005-05-08T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	^^
2005-05-08T05:47:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	You mean that deb doesn't store file permissions so he has to reinstall everything?
2005-05-08T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	there may be a way with dpkg, but this works for me :)
2005-05-08T05:47:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	It's pretty easy to fix that with an rpm based distro
2005-05-08T05:47:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	That is way overkill
2005-05-08T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	it retains my config files, so I'm happy
2005-05-28T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	is beagle in the colony disk?
2005-05-28T10:00:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	I got the newest version from apt. I don't believe so
2005-05-28T10:04:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	How does beagle compare to spotlight? I have wanted to play with that to see which is better
2005-05-28T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	I don't know, I wait for usable packages these days
2005-05-28T10:05:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	beagle is usable :)
2005-05-28T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	in hoary? I've been using hoary pretty conservatively, only adding things I actually use.
2005-05-28T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	the opposite of how I played with unstable
2005-05-28T10:06:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	no, nevermind beagle was a pain to get set up initially in hoary
2005-05-28T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	yeah, that's what I'd gathered, and right now I don't have time to play too much, except here
2005-05-28T14:46:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	I just read this yesterday :) http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NewDevelopersAndMaintainers
2005-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	Thanks
2005-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	g14	nickrud	Autonice daemon has saved me a few times when gamin went bezerk on fc3. I'm going to package it for ubuntu http://and.sourceforge.net/
2005-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	heh, all it does to me is stop working, and I think I've lost something :)
2005-05-31T06:11:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	lol
2005-05-31T06:12:00.000Z	nickrud	g14	web2by I came in a bit late, I'm sorry
