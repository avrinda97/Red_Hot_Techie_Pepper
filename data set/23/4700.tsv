2007-08-28T12:06:00.000Z	ramza3		can I go out on a limb and say that the gnome file manager/browser really sucks
2007-08-28T12:06:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	why does it suck?
2007-08-28T12:07:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	unresponsive on large files, doesnt follow symlinks
2007-08-28T12:07:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	i've never had those problems...
2007-08-28T12:08:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	i think you have to create a different type of link.. a relative link or something, if the folder is changing directions though
2007-08-28T12:08:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	open a large file (> 20MB) from the file browser.  Navigate to a directory with a bunch of large files, I dare you
2007-08-28T12:09:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	i've honestly never had those problems.. last night i dl'd a 120 mb high def trailer from the COD4 website and it opened fine from the file manager
2007-08-28T12:09:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	I only have 1.5Gb of ram, maybe that is just me
2007-08-28T12:09:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	i have 512 ram
2007-08-28T12:10:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	PC2700.. 266mhz
2007-08-28T12:10:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	here I have a picture; http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinbrown/750473492/
2007-08-28T12:12:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	interesting...
2007-08-28T12:12:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	happens all the time, and there is something in ubuntu/gnome that reads large files when refreshing a directory.  Basically, my file manager is useless
2007-08-28T12:15:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	the file manager in question is Nautilus... if you want a different one, there's Thunar, which is a lightweight, and Konquerer, KDE's file manager/web browser
2007-08-28T12:16:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	which one are you using
2007-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	Nautilus works for me... Konquerer is a bit clumsy, and thunar is good, but they come with extra libraries.
2007-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	I have konq, but don't use it.
2007-08-28T12:18:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	hmm, may go with Konq, do you know how to switch to the default
2007-08-28T12:21:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	I dunno... your whole desktop is controlled by konqueror... it may be harder than opening "Properties" for a folder and switching "Open With" to konq
2007-08-28T12:21:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	I bet I have some default nautilus setting that is causing me issues.  I will play with for a while more (but continue to make fun of it)
2007-08-28T12:22:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	possibly. have you skimmed through GConf-Editor?
2007-08-28T12:22:00.000Z	ramza3	DerangedDingo	nope
2007-08-28T12:23:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	ramza3	Alt + F2 "gconf-editor". Gconf is GNOME's way of keeping a registry for every setting for every application that you run. it can get complicated depending on what you're doing. most of the time it's OK though
