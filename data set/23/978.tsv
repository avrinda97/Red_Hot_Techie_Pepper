2010-11-05T18:32:00.000Z	camer0n_		Hey, just what is required to set up a minimalist mail server. I am wanting to be able to have my pc tell me when it performs something in a script
2010-11-05T18:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	a nullmailer like ssmptp or esmtp ?
2010-11-05T18:33:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	i wouldn't have any idea what either of those mean... i just want to be able to send an email :S
2010-11-05T18:36:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	can you use something like gmail/hotmail/etc with sSMTP? just having a read of it at the moment
2010-11-05T18:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	i know gmail works; the others should work too

2010-11-05T18:38:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	thanks, ssmtp seems like it will be good to use... just hope it doesn't use too much ram....
2010-11-05T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	ssmtp -s "nothing here" "$email" < msg.txt
2010-11-05T18:49:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	ssmtp works great! thanks
2010-11-05T18:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	no problem
2010-11-05T18:49:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	just have to work it into a script now :P
2010-11-05T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	should work
2010-11-05T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	email="email@address.com"
2010-11-05T18:56:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	tried that... it's kinda screwing up :P
2010-11-05T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	how is failing? give example
2010-11-05T18:57:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	script is stuck :S
2010-11-05T18:57:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	not responding. ctrl+c not killing
2010-11-05T18:58:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	i was trying to do the command: "ssmtp $email < msg.txt"
2010-11-05T19:00:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	awesome. will do that...
2010-11-05T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	check that the configuration is ok; it may be stuck in the authentification with gmail servers etc.
2010-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	i have a loop with a sleep command... i think that is the issue. will comment that out with testing :P
2010-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	camer0n_	erUSUL	maybe i do not :S
2010-11-05T19:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	camer0n_	try #bash; you may want to paste the script so we can take a look
