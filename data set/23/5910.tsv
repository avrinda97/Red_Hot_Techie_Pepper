2006-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	Dev05	Chris37879	Have you read my question up there? :)
2006-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	Chris37879	Dev05	no i missed it what do you need?
2006-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	Dev05	Chris37879	I made my Windows box talk to Linux via Ad-Hoc Wireless. Now, I need to set DHCP Server up so that it assigns Windows an IP Address. I've installed and gave some configuration to DHCP but it still won't answer Windows.
2006-08-19T15:31:00.000Z	Chris37879	Dev05	hmm... i know it is easy to tell windows to DHCP but instead why not jsut manually assign windows an IP

2006-08-19T15:33:00.000Z	Dev05	Chris37879	I wanted to share Linux's Internet Connection to Windows. It is stil possible with static IP's?
2006-08-19T15:34:00.000Z	Chris37879	Dev05	should be i dont see why not... can you get windows to read the shared folders off your linux box so that you know its working?
2006-08-19T15:35:00.000Z	Dev05	Chris37879	No, I can't even ping each other. Thay just "connect".

2006-08-19T15:37:00.000Z	Chris37879		One sec let me look
2006-08-19T15:38:00.000Z	Chris37879		Budda, if you right click the folder or file your trying to share (assuming you have ping connection) go to share folder/file then tell it to use SMB
2006-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	Chris37879		Budda, it will auto apt-get the stuff you need to do a SMB or NFS share
2006-08-19T15:42:00.000Z	Chris37879		what is the Gnome IRC channel?
2006-08-19T15:42:00.000Z	Dev05	Chris37879	It may be in GimpNET.
