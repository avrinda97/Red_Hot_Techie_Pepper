2008-08-10T19:10:00.000Z	dolo		Does anybody here using a bootsplash screen they made themselves?
2008-08-10T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	ive not made any but there should be a few around the gaff
2008-08-10T19:12:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	I have the page book marked was trying to find someone who has actaully made a working splash using that
2008-08-10T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	i dunno, i see splashes as pointless
2008-08-10T19:13:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	Most stuff is pointless like desktop effects but makes it look "cool"
2008-08-10T19:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	i use fluxbox, desktop effects != cool
2008-08-10T19:14:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	 see the effects are pointless but enjoyable
2008-08-10T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	i dont find them enjoyable, i want my system to do what i wat rather than do some song and dance then do it
2008-08-10T19:15:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	ya its a personal prefrence, for you the functionality is cooler
2008-08-10T19:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	indeed, some people love prettys and thats fine
2008-08-10T19:16:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	its not so much for the pretty factor its just when it boots it says ubuntu but i like art and would like to have my own art in that place
2008-08-10T19:19:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	I've even got a few ideas for a custom loading bar, granted its unnessary but to me it be more astecicly pleasing , part of what i like about ubuntu is its large ability for customization
2008-08-10T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	all linuxes have that level of customisation
2008-08-10T19:20:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	yes thats one of the things I really like about it
2008-08-10T19:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	gentoo goes further that you can customise what apps you install and compile them with custom options
2008-08-10T19:22:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	 I've got everything worked out just how I like it so far , basicly the last thing that I'd like to customize on it is the boot splash , after which its as close to perfect as I'd lke it to be
2008-08-10T19:22:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	The bootsplash be like the iceing on the cake for me
2008-08-10T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	id rather it load the app rather than a splash then th eapp, makes it load slower
2008-08-10T19:26:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	Its not for before the apps , you know when the pc first boots and we see scrolling text that shows the system starting up  well the splash screen is just above that scrolling text and I wanted to replace that default art with some of my own
2008-08-10T19:27:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	either way I have to wait for it to load but i figured some of my art be cooler than the orange ubuntu logo
2008-08-10T19:28:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	and by enabling text I could still monitor the scrolling text to see that everything booted ok
2008-08-10T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dolo	that is an advantage, i dont use my system for much and can troubleshoot when i get in. i dont reboot much so im ok :)
2008-08-10T19:30:00.000Z	dolo	ActionParsnip	I dont reboot much either but I been considering putting ubuntu on my laptop and think it would spiffy to have that last thing worked out before I setup the laptop
