2007-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	What is the problem now?
2007-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	Vince_	h1st0	Same problum I was h aving last night
2007-03-12T13:08:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	Okay well I don't remember so what is the problem?
2007-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	Did you check the CD for defects?
2007-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	Yes but have you run the check CD for defects on the boot menu?
2007-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	And what part of the install is hanging?
2007-03-12T13:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	First boot to any cd then select Check CD for defects on teh menu
2007-03-12T13:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	then if all the checksums come back okay  You know the CD is good.
2007-03-12T13:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	What sort of hardware do you have i.e. motherboard?
2007-03-12T13:13:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	Please check the CD for defects at the menu.  You may need to burn the iso at like 4x or it could be an issue with those cdr's and your drive etc...
2007-03-12T13:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	Okay well try booting with the nopcmcia option ssee if your cdrom is detected.
2007-03-12T13:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	You never said you ahve checked hte CD for defects only that you used multiple cds.
2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	boot to the alternate cd.  hit f6 and append nopcmcia to the end of the line
2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	press enter and continue to install.
2007-03-12T13:17:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	well if you don't want to listen to the solution nopcmcia then i guess nothign you can do.
2007-03-12T13:24:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	I have the exact same problem with my hardware.  the solution was to disable pcmcia on the install cd boot and it was able to detect the cdrom.
2007-03-12T13:24:00.000Z	Vince_	h1st0	Somebody had me doing that earlier it didn't work.
2007-03-12T13:26:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	When its trying to detect the cdrom you can hit ctrl+alt+F4 and see the output of what is going on.
2007-03-12T13:27:00.000Z	Vince_	h1st0	I'll try it agian and hit that to see whats up.
2007-03-12T13:27:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	also when you try it append nopcmcia even if you don't have pcmcia.  See what the output is.
2007-03-12T13:29:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	if you hit F7 or F8 at the main menu it will give you the exact option for disabling it.
2007-03-12T13:55:00.000Z	h1st0	Vince_	not if its been defragged
2007-03-12T13:56:00.000Z	Vince_	h1st0	Its a friesh install so it should be an issue.
