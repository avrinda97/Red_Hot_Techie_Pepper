2005-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	how about "sudo netstat -plunt | grep 631"?
2005-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	patchman	bob2	nothing
2005-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	that is very weird
2005-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	I assume that error in english was something like "Can't assign requested address"?
2005-06-29T09:22:00.000Z	patchman	bob2	yes ... but why?
2005-06-29T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	I don't know
2005-06-29T09:23:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	what does "uname -r" print out?
2005-06-29T09:23:00.000Z	patchman	bob2	2.6.10
2005-06-29T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	that's very odd
2005-06-29T09:31:00.000Z	patchman	bob2	there is something into the kernel related to CUPS?
2005-06-29T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	no
2005-06-29T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	patchman	I only asked about your kernel version on a vague guess you were using 2.6.12 or something
2005-06-29T09:33:00.000Z	patchman	bob2	ok
