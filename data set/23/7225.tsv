2005-09-28T11:47:00.000Z	NilXu		first question..  what is the quickest or best way to get extra speed out of an old box running ubuntu?
2005-09-28T11:47:00.000Z	NilXu		it is a pro 200/ 98meg ram
2005-09-28T11:47:00.000Z	NilXu		good
2005-09-28T11:48:00.000Z	NilXu		how about without embedding it on the face of the moon?
2005-09-28T11:48:00.000Z	NilXu		going to use it for a mail and web server if i can get it to respond well enough
2005-09-28T11:49:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	how about fluxbox as desktop, dillo for web and mutt/slrn for mail/news
2005-09-28T11:50:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	before adding extra memory check that your mb supports and, the most importantly, CAN CACHE MORE
2005-09-28T11:50:00.000Z	NilXu	TTilus	what is flux box?
2005-09-28T11:50:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	wm
2005-09-28T11:52:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	also check that you have dma enabled (and you can tweak with other htparm stuff too)
2005-09-28T11:52:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	test with readfile or bonnie++
2005-09-28T11:53:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	y
2005-09-28T11:54:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	if you use decent caching system in case of running dynamic website your hw will do more than fine
2005-09-28T11:54:00.000Z	NilXu	TTilus	where would i download fluxbox deb?
2005-09-28T11:55:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	forget about flux if you are not setting up a desktop system
2005-09-28T11:55:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	addition... do NOT run X on your webserver
2005-09-28T11:55:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	it only eats up your memory
2005-09-28T11:56:00.000Z	NilXu	TTilus	well untill i can get it configured and incase i want to change anything later... cause this is retarted right now
2005-09-28T11:56:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	stay out of Zope-based stuff and you'll do fine
2005-09-28T11:58:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	believe me, you really don't need X for configuring and maintaining server system
2005-09-28T11:58:00.000Z	NilXu	TTilus	i know, also i am getting a startup error abut a general console font?  wehre do i find that to fix it?
2005-09-28T11:59:00.000Z	TTilus	NilXu	uhh, dunno about that
2005-09-28T11:59:00.000Z	NilXu	TTilus	k, well thanks loads for everything else
