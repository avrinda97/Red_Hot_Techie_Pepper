2008-02-08T02:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	so now i wonder why you replied?
2008-02-08T02:10:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	because i did, but this is ot
2008-02-08T02:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	true,
2008-05-13T07:16:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	theoretically -- u could use sgd's menu to boot the sisela when choosen
2008-05-13T07:16:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	O.o? any clue how?
2008-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	erm,.,. no
2008-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	but in theory its doable
2008-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	ah, well thanks for telling me :) i will do some more research into GRUB then[bout time i did anyways :\]
2008-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	i suppose youd have to find ut what code is used to boot the disk, then duplicate that code into a menu item that gets redirected to a section on the disk
2008-05-13T07:18:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	simple enough, in theory at least >. >
2008-05-13T07:19:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	lol, or ,.,.just thinkin on my feet here,.,. somehow partition a cd into two partitions then grub could detect and run each one
2008-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	still wont be that easy >. >
2008-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	Bodsda	bluefoxx	nope ;~) thats half the fun
2008-05-13T07:23:00.000Z	bluefoxx	Bodsda	>D
