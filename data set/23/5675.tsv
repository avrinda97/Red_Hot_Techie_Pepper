2006-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke		With the LiveCD can I install without the first starting the liveCD?  I'm trying to get xubuntu on an older machine.. And I'm losing patience waiting for the cd to load.  Plus there isn't much mem, so the GUI is insanely slow.
2006-12-28T10:43:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	there's an alternative cd that (i'm pretty sure" has a non0gui install
2006-12-28T11:12:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	which version of windows>?
2006-12-28T11:16:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	on win98, right click on "my Computer" - and then go to properties
2006-12-28T11:16:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	mem is show there
2006-12-28T11:18:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	I've used DSL on an old laptop of mine - 120mhz with 32mb ram - runs great
2006-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	that would probably workl
2006-12-28T11:25:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	or flux
2006-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	try flux before you go back to win98
2006-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	goofey	 flux?
2006-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	fluxbox'

2006-12-28T12:14:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	goofey	 I can't seem to find a file manager thought.. What do you use?  Just CLI?
2006-12-28T12:15:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	that's all i use - there mightg be one for flux but I don't know what it is
2006-12-28T12:16:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	there is a #fluxbox channel - they would know
2006-12-28T12:18:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	goofey	 Well I got natulis to launch, but couldn't seem to find my way back.. restarted x
2006-12-28T12:18:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	i think un_operateur knows of a good file manager for flux
2006-12-28T12:21:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	you could try "rox" in the terminal
2006-12-28T12:24:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	goofey	didn't get anything in term for rox
2006-12-28T12:24:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	ok - un_operateur says it needs to be installed
2006-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	me neither - what browser?
2006-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	goofey	Gun_Smoke	you're going to hate my answer  my guess is the folks on #fluxbox will know...  :)
