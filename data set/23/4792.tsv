2007-05-02T11:33:00.000Z	psylem		hi guys, I've just installed ubuntu 7.04 I have an issue with my sound
2007-05-02T11:34:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	what sound card?
2007-05-02T11:35:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	open a terminal window, type alsamixer (press esc to close) ... use arrow keys and "m" to unmute
2007-05-02T11:37:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	volume is at max and not muted, I've checked that previously aswell but with the volume controls on my laptop which work quite well I'm pleased to say :)
2007-05-02T11:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	hmmm, what application are you using to try?
2007-05-02T11:39:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	try this... if you have not already... sudo aptitude install mpg123 and try to play a certain mp3 file from the console
2007-05-02T11:40:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	using ubunut or kubuntu? ... kubuntu open the mixer ...kmix
2007-05-02T11:46:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	nothing at all
2007-05-02T11:49:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	I have pasted it
2007-05-02T11:50:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	your link to the pasted text?
2007-05-02T11:52:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	looks ok to me...
2007-05-02T11:55:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	I'll try to boot from the CD and look at stuff and boot normally and look at stuff and see if I can see the difference
2007-05-02T11:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	hang on
2007-05-02T11:55:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	kk
2007-05-02T11:58:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	try this...  lsmod | grep snd | awk '{print $1}' | xargs modprobe -r
2007-05-02T11:58:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	then ... modprobe snd-intel-hda
2007-05-02T11:59:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	also let us see what kernel you are using... uname -r
2007-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	gotta run... sleep actually
2007-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	it didn't work, but thx for trying
2007-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	lsmod |grep intel
2007-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	that shorter command did something
2007-05-02T12:07:00.000Z	psylem	nomasteryoda	what do I do next?
2007-05-02T12:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	psylem	did you get down to it? ... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/105582/comments/29
