2010-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	alg		i'm trying to install Blender 2.5 alpha. It's a tar.bz2....It says to copy file to Unpack the distribution, copy the .blender directory from it to your home directory. Then run the Blender executable. I copied Nothing happend and there isn't a ".exe" so which would be the executable?
2010-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	It typically has an icon of a gear
2010-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	Try going to that directory and running "file --mime-type * | less" and see which file is "x-executable"
2010-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	no gears....just pages with a few numbers, folders, and .txt....?
2010-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	Or like this: "file --mime-type * | grep -i 'executable'"
2010-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	where di i go to run  "file --mime-type * | less"
2010-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	In the terminal. In that .blender folder
2010-05-29T13:19:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	...why not? :/
2010-05-29T13:19:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	Trust me, terminal is a mighty friend, you just have to know how to use it
2010-05-29T13:20:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	"cd '/path/to/blender/directory'" to change the folder
2010-05-29T13:20:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	so just type dir .blender like DOS
2010-05-29T13:20:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	"dir" is not a UNIX command... "ls" is the proper alternative
2010-05-29T13:27:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	 not working for me
2010-05-29T13:27:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	cd /path/to/blender/directory && file --mime-type * | grep -i executable
2010-05-29T13:28:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	k
2010-05-29T13:32:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	It says " the program blender is not installed. you can install by typing: sudo apt-get install blender.......I don't want that version. I have newer version I just downloaded. "
2010-05-29T13:32:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	Bleh dude... :/
2010-05-29T13:33:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	Which folder is blender located in, supposedly?
2010-05-29T13:34:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	downloads folder
2010-05-29T13:34:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	So, cd ~/Downloads/ - something like that
2010-05-29T13:39:00.000Z	alg	theadmin	can i send you the file i got? Would it help for you to see what it is. or just snapshot of the folder?
2010-05-29T13:39:00.000Z	theadmin	alg	I could help you remotely if you want allright, I can PM the details on how to connect
