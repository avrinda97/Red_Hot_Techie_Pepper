2011-02-12T00:46:00.000Z	sparkling		hi all
2011-02-12T00:47:00.000Z	sparkling		i would like to create a simple script that open a text file, search a pre-determinated string, and ubstitute that string with another one....can someone illumnate me? thanks
2011-02-12T00:47:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	so have a script that does cat filename.txt |grep "string"
2011-02-12T00:48:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	where i insert the old_string and the new_string?
2011-02-12T00:48:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	you would use sed to insert,
2011-02-12T00:49:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	sed -i 's/searchstring/change/g' ~/filename
2011-02-12T00:50:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	i tried sed but i have some problem: i mean the old_string is ['command']  the new string is ['/opt/bin/command']    when i use [ and ' i think it didn't work
2011-02-12T00:50:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	can you pastie your script?
2011-02-12T00:50:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	sure wait
2011-02-12T00:51:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	that is the script i launch sed 's/['tesseract']/['/opt/bin/tessearct']/g' captcha.py
2011-02-12T00:52:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	is captcha.py the file you are trying to change text in?
2011-02-12T00:52:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	yes
2011-02-12T00:53:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	would you mind telling me exactly what you are trying to change?
2011-02-12T00:54:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	as far as string
2011-02-12T00:54:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	ahahah ok i try
2011-02-12T00:54:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	if it makes more sense to show me on pastie please do that
2011-02-12T00:54:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	into py file there are a lot of "tesseract", but i want to change only the string where tesseract is inside []
2011-02-12T00:57:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	unfortunately py file is inside an open project on internet,daily i update the progect with hg mercurial...unfortunately that string works only for my particular situation..and project owners don't want to change it...so every time i update files i need to update that file before reboot my nas
2011-02-12T01:06:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	ahhh gotcha, well it should be easy enough to change it with sed
2011-02-12T01:07:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	don't worry now...i'm trying another way...i will wait for nas reboot...
2011-02-12T01:07:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	thanks anyway...if i have problems after the tests i return here ;-)
2011-02-12T01:07:00.000Z	evilsushi	sparkling	sed -i  is easy :)
2011-02-12T01:57:00.000Z	sparkling	evilsushi	probably..after some tests i solved without editing script.... i added PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin before launch my script  .... tesseract is in /opt/bin but /opt/bin isn't in $PATH so i added it...now i try to reboot nas
