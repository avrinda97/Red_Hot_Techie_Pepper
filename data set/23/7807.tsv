2006-12-27T12:29:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	look at ip addressos on other devices
2006-12-27T12:29:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	what other hosts do you have working on the same subnet?
2006-12-27T12:30:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	right... and nameserver addresses that get used?
2006-12-27T12:30:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	well.... the DHCP server may choose a range....   do your other hosts tend to get allocated an address 100 -upwards or something?
2006-12-27T12:30:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	i.e. what other ip addresses hdo other working hosts have as the machine address?
2006-12-27T12:31:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	that is odd... IP and gateway the same... sounds like connected directly to an isp thing
2006-12-27T12:31:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	is this on a PPP link adapter?
2006-12-27T12:32:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	ok try again ;-)
2006-12-27T12:32:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	subnet wask, ip address. default gateway  please
2006-12-27T12:34:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	looks like that in connected directly toa  cable provider
2006-12-27T12:34:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	hrrrm but this is on a network adapter
2006-12-27T12:34:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	what is the ethernet caxle connected to?
2006-12-27T12:35:00.000Z	enyc	Some_Person	hrrrm i suspect they will only allocate you 1 ip address nayway..... are you trying te reboot this same computer to run ubuntulinux on the same connectiod?
