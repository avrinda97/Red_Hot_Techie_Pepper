2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	debian is fine for desktop
2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	i didn't say it wasn't, i just said it was fine for servers
2006-02-27T12:26:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	done that :)
2006-02-27T12:26:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	ah :)
2006-02-27T12:28:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	that package is even smart enough to list module-assistant as a dependency (or recommend, not sure) ;)
2006-02-27T12:30:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	nice
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	debian stable is stable, debian unstable is not :)
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	er, yeah ;)
2006-02-28T17:51:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	problem is, most everyday programs are either KDE or Gnome apps. so in my opinion using a third desktop is nearly pointless, when you'll still have the KDE and Gnome libs (and all the features/quirks of Gnome and KDE) with you
2006-02-28T17:53:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	I prefer a light wm myself; as to libs, I tend to stick with gtk stuff - I don't use many X progs
2006-02-28T17:53:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	well, if you can stick to that sort of choice of apps, then yeah, you have a point
2006-02-28T17:54:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	ncurses is still my favorite windowing toolkit ;)
2006-02-28T17:55:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	mine is a punchcard reader :)
2006-02-28T17:55:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	heh, not toggle-switches?
2006-02-28T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	no, i don't like point-and-toggle interfaces, i am for real computing
2006-02-28T06:13:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	video=vga should use standard vga instead of fb
2006-02-28T06:14:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	i've tried "video=kyrofb:etcetc", which is the fb driver for my own card... now, the kyrofb module isn't in initrd, so the kernel ignores that straight. do you think it won't ignore video=vga?
2006-02-28T06:15:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	shouldn't do, I would expect bog-standard vga to be builtin
2006-02-28T06:15:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	otherwise, vga=ask perhaps
2006-02-28T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	ok, thanks.
2006-02-28T06:16:00.000Z	amphi	LjL	Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt otherwise
2006-02-28T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	yeah, perhaps i better give it a look before rebooting
2006-02-28T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	amphi	still insists on loading both vesafb and vga16fb (as well as other amenities) :\ perhaps i should try disabling usplash, maybe that's the thing that forces loading of those modules...?
