2009-01-29T18:03:00.000Z	prometheus77		hi, how to remove font "Courier 10 Pitch" on intrepid? Firefox uses it instead of "monospace" and it looks very unreadable and ugly? On which package is this Courier font?
2009-01-29T18:04:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	why not tell firefox to use monospace instead of courier then? sounds easier
2009-01-29T18:05:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	ive set up monospace in firefox but, it's not working, anyway this "Courier" font looks ugly everywhere so best for me is to remove package that contain it
2009-01-29T18:05:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	I don't think it has a package of it's own.. if you can find the font file you could symlink it to monospace instead.
2009-01-29T18:07:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	good idea, i will try , thanx
2009-01-29T18:07:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	locate couri.ttf might give you a location
2009-01-29T18:09:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	sorry.. "locate -r cour.*\.ttf" would be better.. there are variants
2009-01-29T18:13:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	no ttf fonts like this, ive tried without ttf extension and there is some pcf fonts courXXX.pcf.gz. Are they used by firefox? Or firefox uses only ttf fonts?
2009-01-29T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	hmm.. are you really sure firefox is using the courier font then?
2009-01-29T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	it's not using some other replacement font?
2009-01-29T18:18:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	i have font issue with this site http://api.cakephp.org/view_source/helper/ . CSS for this site uses courier and monospace fonts for code area and on my firefox this text looks barely visible. The only courier in my systemis Courier 10 Pitch. (This is not my site)
2009-01-29T18:20:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	hang on.. let me set something up for comparison
2009-01-29T18:20:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	ok
2009-01-29T18:33:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	ok.. try going to this site http://www.hisbest.se/courier.html
2009-01-29T18:34:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	the first paragraph is regular text, the second paragraph is an image of that same text.. do they look the same?
2009-01-29T18:35:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	no, text is smaller on image, i will try to adjust this
2009-01-29T18:36:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	that might just be your dpi setting.. or some firefox setting
2009-01-29T19:36:00.000Z	prometheus77	Slart	ive found that this ugly font is n022003l.pfb from gsfonts package and 'fc-match courier' gives me 'n022003l.pfb: "Nimbus Mono L" "Regular"'. Do you know how to change this n022003l.pfb to, for example DejaVu Sans Mono?
2009-01-29T19:38:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	hmm.. I have no idea if firefox uses anything other than truetype fonts..and I have no idea how to switch fonts around if they are not the same type
2009-02-03T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	gnome-xchat does support pms
2009-02-03T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	you can't blame the client for that, I think =)
2009-02-03T22:31:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	it's a compiz shortcut.. don't know when that was included
2009-02-03T22:31:00.000Z	Slart	prometheus77	if you're not registerd, and identified, you cant use pm's
