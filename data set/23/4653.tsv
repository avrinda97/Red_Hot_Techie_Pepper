2008-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	I don't have rdp access to it
2008-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	it's a hosting co's server, so i can only access by ms sql client or equivalent
2008-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	then I'm not sure how you'd do it.  I imagine you can with ODBC but I don't know exactly how.
2008-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	I'd ideally just like a console that i can type sql into :)
2008-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	similar to the one you get with postgres etc
2008-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	yep, I know what you mean, I regularily work with postgresql and mysql.
2008-03-10T15:45:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	I use sql server management studio express locally to work with it.  I wonder if that would work on wine?
2008-03-10T15:45:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	possibly, have you checked the appdb?
2008-03-10T15:46:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	not yet, only just thought of that.  But not sure right away what I would gain.  ODBC should be do-able and opens a wider range of uses
2008-03-10T15:47:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	certainly, I just don't know any solutions for that, but I've never looked.
2008-03-10T15:48:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	there is tdsodbc in the repos.  " ODBC driver for connecting to MS SQL and Sybase SQL server"
2008-03-10T15:49:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	just never used odbc before so shall have to grapple with dsn's etc
2008-03-10T15:49:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	yes, but I don't know if that provides a terminal shell you can work with or if it's strictly an application driver.
2008-03-10T15:53:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	I think you want unixODBC
2008-03-10T15:54:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	it comes with an isql utility, which, if my brief scanning of a few web pages is correct is similar to psql or mysql
2008-03-10T16:31:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	wo0t! It works!
2008-03-10T16:31:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	thanks for your help :)
2008-03-10T16:32:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	I forget, what did I tell you?
2008-03-10T16:32:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	lol.  np.  odbc/mssql/isql etc.
2008-03-10T16:32:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	ahhhh, cool
2008-03-10T16:37:00.000Z	VSpike	pajamian	I can now open it up in OOo or anything I like.  Very neat!
2008-03-10T16:37:00.000Z	pajamian	VSpike	very cool
