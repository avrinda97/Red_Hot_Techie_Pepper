2009-06-21T01:38:00.000Z	Haraken		how do i setup xorg.conf for headless vnc?
2009-06-21T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	I don't think you really need to set it up.. it will default to something small.. like 640x480 or so.. but it will work
2009-06-21T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	or you want higher resolutions?
2009-06-21T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	yes, you do
2009-06-21T01:40:00.000Z	Haraken	Slart	so I start it up with startx and this is what I get...
2009-06-21T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	x11vnc is different from all the other vnc servers in that it uses the currently running x session.
2009-06-21T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	did you have an error message?
2009-06-21T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	ok.. let me check something real quick
2009-06-21T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	have a look at my headless xorg.conf.. this is what I use for my small mini-itx server http://pastebin.com/f41997032
2009-06-21T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	the interesting parts are in the section Monitor.. lines 93 94 and section screen.. line 97 and onward
2009-06-21T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	hmm..that's odd
2009-06-21T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	yes.. that's what x11vnc does..connects to a running session
2009-06-21T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	was that the entire Xorg.0.log file you pastebinned before?
2009-06-21T01:53:00.000Z	Haraken	Slart	wow i think i almost got it
2009-06-21T01:53:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	oh?
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	Haraken	Slart	got it working, although vnc is much slower than freenx :(
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	Haraken	Slart	thanks for your help
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	indeed it is
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	you're welcome
2009-06-21T02:53:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	make sure you have the right keyboard layout
2009-06-21T02:53:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	system, preferences, keyboard
2009-06-21T02:54:00.000Z	Slart	Haraken	well.. if you have a US keyboard then sure.. select that
