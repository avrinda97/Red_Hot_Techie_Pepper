2008-01-23T02:39:00.000Z	joe_		My printer shows up in the window "Configure - KDE Control Module" and when I try to print a document, it shows up. Also there is a little printer up near my clock and it shows the status fo print jobs. BUT nothing prints even though the status windwo says its complete. what could be causing this?

2008-01-23T03:04:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	click, press delete
2008-01-23T03:04:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	from the printers dialog box
2008-01-23T03:04:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	I mean window
2008-01-23T03:04:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	I dont have a diaglog box :(
2008-01-23T03:05:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	azexian how do I get the printer dialog box back?
2008-01-23T03:07:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	is there a printer in the system tray?
2008-01-23T03:07:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	no sir
2008-01-23T03:07:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	ok then goto system menu, adminstration (i think), then printers
2008-01-23T03:09:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	ok I found that, is there some place there that I can tell it to show in system tray?
2008-01-23T03:09:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	no it's supposed to be there when it printing something or has an error
2008-01-23T03:10:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	and besides it comes up only when you print something
2008-01-23T03:10:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	I am not the brightest bulb in the box, and I accidently told it not to be in tray
2008-01-23T03:10:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	after that it disappears
2008-01-23T03:12:00.000Z	joe_	Flare183	and now when I try to print something like a test page, it says something along the lines of "test page submitted as job 9" (so far I have done it 9 times lol)
2008-01-23T03:13:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	then reinstall the printer
2008-01-23T03:14:00.000Z	Flare183	joe_	yeap
