2010-11-22T22:22:00.000Z	Primestone		Guys, I was wondering how I can make Launcher.exe and WoW.exe Executable? Every time I try to click the check box to make it run as one, it unchecks itself.
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	Primestone		I have tried chmod from the command line.
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	Primestone		I did.
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	Primestone		It unchecks itself.
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	i suppose this is on fat32 or ntfs?
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	Primestone		NTFS
2010-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	Primestone		It's on my external HDD.
2010-11-22T22:24:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	well, both of them do not know any kind of unix rights
2010-11-22T22:24:00.000Z	Primestone	sdx23	then how can I allow it to run as an exec'?
2010-11-22T22:25:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	mounting the partition with the right parameters. which in some cases may be a bad idea as well.
2010-11-22T22:25:00.000Z	Primestone	sdx23	or I have to make an EXT4 partition and copy it to it?
2010-11-22T22:26:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	you do not have to, but this may be sensible though.
2010-11-22T22:28:00.000Z	Primestone	sdx23	this was?
2010-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	hu?
2010-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	Primestone		You said this may be more sensible.
2010-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	Primestone		Were you referring to making an EXT4 partition on the NTFS Drive?
2010-11-22T22:31:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	copying it to a partition with a proper filesystem as e.g. ext3/4
2010-11-22T22:41:00.000Z	Primestone		If tomatos are fruit, doesn't that mean that ketchup is a smoothie?
2010-11-22T22:44:00.000Z	Primestone	sdx23	any reason why it's saying I don't have permission to copy to the EXT4 drive I just  made on this external HDD? Copying from NTFS->EXT4. Must I gksudo nautilis?
2010-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	Primestone		Anyone  reason why it's saying I don't have permission to copy to the EXT4 drive I just  made on this external HDD? Copying from NTFS->EXT4. Must I gksudo nautilis?
2010-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	sdx23	Primestone	i guess you're lacking write permission on the new partition.
2010-11-22T22:47:00.000Z	Primestone		ok
2010-11-22T22:50:00.000Z	Primestone	sdx23	I got it. Had to go to media and right click the drive and give permission.
