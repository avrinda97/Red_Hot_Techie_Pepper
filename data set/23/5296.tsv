2007-01-18T08:47:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	only download from ubuntu
2007-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	I found about 30 results for lame in the repo
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	lame - LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	kenthomson	mooky	there is nothing of the specific name libmp3lame.so
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	lame-extras - LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	of courses there is not - thats a lib - not a package
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	kenthomson	mooky	ok so libs are not named seperately?
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	kenthomson	mooky	you see i am new to all this
2007-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	no - they are part of packages, which is why I told you to search for the package name "lame"
2007-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	just find the correct package in the ubuntu repo and install it
2007-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	don't get it from an external site
2007-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	kenthomson	mooky	ok, i have the package installed but read my above post to thoreauputic
2007-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	mooky	kenthomson	that may not be the right package name
