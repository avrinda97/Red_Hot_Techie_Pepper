2009-06-21T00:45:00.000Z	usser	deagle	or xlock
2009-06-21T00:49:00.000Z	usser	deagle	just add it manually
2009-06-21T00:49:00.000Z	deagle	usser	o_O how do i do that?
2009-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	usser	deagle	/etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml
2009-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	usser	deagle	add an entry places where each command is something like nautilus --no-desktop --browser /home/user
2009-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	deagle	usser	but what entry do I add to have the gnome-panel's "Places" menu?
2009-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	usser	deagle	you cant have places in openbox
2009-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	usser	deagle	ie its a gnome thing
2009-06-21T00:51:00.000Z	deagle	usser	that's what I'm trying to figure out how to do
2009-06-21T00:51:00.000Z	usser	deagle	do you really need 'places'?
2009-06-21T00:52:00.000Z	usser	deagle	what are you using it for. once you go openbox, or fluxbox etc, you gotta make sacrifices
2009-06-21T00:52:00.000Z	deagle	usser	no, I just want a list of devices that are plugged in, so when i click on 'em, they mount and show up
2009-06-21T00:52:00.000Z	deagle	usser	this is linux... there's GOT to be a way :D
2009-06-21T00:52:00.000Z	usser	deagle	use pcmanfm as your file manager, it has a nice little panel that shows you all connected devices
2009-06-21T00:52:00.000Z	deagle	usser	i <3 rox-filer
2009-06-21T00:53:00.000Z	usser	deagle	oh
2009-06-21T00:54:00.000Z	usser	deagle	well actually there might be a way, openbox has something called pipe menus, dynamically generated menus, if you find a config file for gnome's places you can write a script that generates the menu on the fly
2009-06-21T00:56:00.000Z	usser	deagle	yep .gtk-bookmarks is the one, now all you need to do is read those entries using bash or python or somesuch wrap in an xml that openbox menu understands and create a menu with something like   <menu id="pipe-weather" label="Weather" execute="python /usr/local/bin/obweather Brooklyn" />
2009-06-21T00:56:00.000Z	usser	deagle	where obweather is the script that dynamically generates a menu
2009-06-21T00:57:00.000Z	deagle	usser	thanks! as soon as I find the gnome script that calls on udev, i'll use that :D
2009-06-21T00:57:00.000Z	usser	deagle	http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Openbox:Pipemenus
2009-06-21T00:57:00.000Z	deagle	usser	:o thanks!
2009-06-21T04:54:00.000Z	deagle	usser	still here?
