2005-08-31T10:57:00.000Z	drewfus		crap
2005-08-31T10:58:00.000Z	drewfus		what about tar or gz?
2005-08-31T10:58:00.000Z	drewfus		so dont use rpms period?
2005-08-31T10:59:00.000Z	drewfus		what about tar.gz
2005-08-31T10:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	you don't use rpms. ubuntu uses debs and they are installed through synaptic or apt-get (or aptitude). synaptic is a nice graphical installer. it's easy to use and there are thousands of choices of packages. you won't be dissapointed.
2005-08-31T10:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	tar.gz is just a compressed file like a zip
2005-08-31T11:01:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	did you search synaptic?
2005-08-31T11:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	ubuntu has armagetron
2005-08-31T11:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	armagetron, gltron, ktron etc.
2005-08-31T11:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	system > administration > synaptic package manager
2005-08-31T11:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	search for "tron"
2005-08-31T11:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	if you don't see the programs i mentioned you need to add the universe source
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	ubuntu has over 16,000 packages if you enable all components
2005-08-31T11:05:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	99% of software is in ubuntu and most likely everything you'll want or need
2005-08-31T11:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	you hit apply and then installed it
2005-08-31T11:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	look in applications > games
2005-08-31T11:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	what did you install?
2005-08-31T11:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	SMEG is very nice
2005-08-31T11:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	just add a menu entry with smeg or a desktop icon
2005-08-31T11:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	unfortunately gnome 2.10 has no menu editor. breezy will have gnome's menu editor AND smeg
2005-08-31T11:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	drewfus	october
