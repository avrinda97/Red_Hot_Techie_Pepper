2011-02-12T09:57:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	no software firewall and we are behind the same router
2011-02-12T09:58:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	unless there's a firewall feature im unaware of.. i dont think ive enabled anything
2011-02-12T09:58:00.000Z	gsp2009	Araxis	what about ports on the router? you using the router to control local network traffic? peer-to-peer or ad-hoc?
2011-02-12T09:58:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	im not sure about the ports, i haven't set anything to be open
2011-02-12T09:59:00.000Z	gsp2009	Araxis	you have firestarter installed?
2011-02-12T09:59:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	firestarter... i dont know, let me check
2011-02-12T10:00:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	no i dont have firestarter
2011-02-12T10:01:00.000Z	gsp2009	Araxis	firestarter is a firewall (iptables) gui. it is in the repos. it allows you to start/stop your firewall, and monitor traffic, etc.
2011-02-12T10:01:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	ill get that now!
2011-02-12T10:20:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	i got it working :) Thanks!
2011-02-12T10:20:00.000Z	gsp2009	Araxis	glad to hear it. Firewall blocking something?
2011-02-12T10:21:00.000Z	Araxis	gsp2009	I think I had some stupid setting in the remote desktop program, but the firewall helped me identify the issue
2011-02-12T10:21:00.000Z	gsp2009	Araxis	nice :)
