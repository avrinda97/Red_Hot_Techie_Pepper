2012-10-12T03:06:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		Hi everyone. Why does my headless Ubuntu 12.04 stays on resolution of 800*600? I can't change it anywhere. I even tried different resolution values in my VNC client/server but with no luck!
2012-10-12T03:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 what vncserver are you using?
2012-10-12T03:08:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	The standard vino-server. I tried x11vnc but with no luck either.
2012-10-12T03:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 if its headless theres no need to 'share the current visible desktop' thats how vino and x11vncserver work.. use a normal vnc server like 'tightvnc'
2012-10-12T03:09:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	I will give tightvnc a go. Thanks.
2012-10-12T03:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 vnc does not need to share the current visible desktop on linux. ;) unlike how it works on windows. You can have a dozen vnc 'hidden' desktops you connect to with just vnc clients.
2012-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	There seems to be only Windows version of tighvnc. The other one is Java based! Which one do you use? Is installation straight forward?
2012-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 the tightvnc server is in the repos.
2012-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	  vnc servers often have a java 'feature' where you can connect to them from a web browser.
2012-10-12T03:13:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	Gotchya. Downloading it now from the repo :)
2012-10-12T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 if the server is on the same local lan, you may want to check out the xdmcp/x forwareding features of SSH instead of running a whole vnc session.
2012-10-12T03:15:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	I'm fairly new to Linux so I can't really understand what you just mentioned above lol..
2012-10-12T03:15:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	How do I start tightvncserver, and how can I configure it? Where is the config file located at?
2012-10-12T03:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 differnt ways to  have remote apps.. if you have more then 1 linux/ubuntu machine on the lan. learning ssh is worth the time.
2012-10-12T03:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 run vncserver, then it puts files in .vnc you can alter .  check its docs/man pages also.   basically you run it. it gives the desktop #, you connect with a client.
2012-10-12T03:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 is this over the internet? or a local lan?
2012-10-12T03:17:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	LAN
2012-10-12T03:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 what is the OS of the other machiunes on the lan?
2012-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	  there may be ways to do X forwarding to the MAC that would let you run single apps and have them appear locally on the mac.
2012-10-12T03:33:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	I get this error message when I start the server "Please set correct fontPath in the tightvncserver script."
2012-10-12T03:34:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	Do you know where I can find the config file? the 'man' command doesn't really show where it is.
2012-10-12T03:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	GNS3Talk	 in the users .vnc directory
2012-10-12T03:34:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	dr_willis	Is it the .log or .pid file?
