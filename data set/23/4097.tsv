2007-11-30T18:33:00.000Z	mike32		hello
2007-11-30T18:34:00.000Z	mike32		i have ubuntu 7.04 and i have downloaded all the updates notification in the taskbar...can i roll off it back to the default?
2007-11-30T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	to a clean ubuntu install ?
2007-11-30T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	you can potentially, but it will be a reasonable ammount of effort
2007-11-30T18:37:00.000Z	mike32	ikonia	- i noticed that mozilla had change in a way that other flash windows cannot be displayed correctly
2007-11-30T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	thats nothing to do with the kernel
2007-11-30T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	again, thats a java/mozilla issue, rather than anything to do with the kernel
2007-11-30T18:38:00.000Z	mike32	ikonia	-is it ok to unistall mozilla
2007-11-30T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	uninstall it ? not the best move
2007-11-30T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	why do you want to re-install it ? that won't fix a problem
2007-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	yes, thats true, so why would uninstalling and re-install it change anything ?
2007-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	mike32	ikonia	-mozilla wont display the java link window in the page i often visit
2007-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	again, thats going to be a java issue, not mozzilla most probably
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	......java updates too
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	why would you re-install ?
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	what do you expect a re-install to do ? its the same package
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	use opera then
2007-11-30T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	your attempts to debug and fix are random. Use opera
2007-11-30T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	because you have a JAVA issue !
2007-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	your not asking, your not listening and just keep repeating the same thing
2007-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	no, you don't listen
2007-11-30T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	1.) no need for bad language 2.) its not my job 3.) I listened and told you the problem 3 times
2007-11-30T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mike32	bye
