2007-12-11T19:06:00.000Z	wam		Why does the nagios2 package depend on apache? This makes the whole package completely useless for me. I don't want apache and apache isn't required for nagios. Is there any reason why this isn't just a recommendation?
2007-12-11T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	nagios is required to view the results
2007-12-11T19:06:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	you mean apache?
2007-12-11T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	if you don't want a this to be a viewer, you'll not want the server package
2007-12-11T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	yes
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	the viewer is a webpage
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	no - any webserver with cgi-support will do
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	that is true, but ubuntu has built against apache
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	i don't understand this.
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	a dependency is a webserver, ubuntu has chosen apache
2007-12-11T19:07:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	so it would be clever to depend on a virtual package, which any webserver provides.
2007-12-11T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	no, ubuntu is calling out "to use this you need apache"
2007-12-11T19:08:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	right - i consider this a bug.
2007-12-11T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	then you consider wrong
2007-12-11T19:08:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	apache as a requirement is bullshit. As would gnome for xchat be.
2007-12-11T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	there is no need for that language
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	ubuntu choses the "prefered" dependencies, apache is a fine choice
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	there is no need for offensive language
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	offensive?
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	bad language and bad lanaguage abbrieviations
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	wam	ikonia	I didn't argue - I just say that this decision is stupid.
2007-12-11T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	thats your opinion
2007-12-11T19:10:00.000Z	ikonia	wam	your welcome to re-pacakge
