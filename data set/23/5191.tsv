2007-01-22T10:33:00.000Z	pbureau		silverfox, try typing iwconfig
2007-01-22T10:35:00.000Z	pbureau		Lynourne, really? been working on it for 4 days now without success.
2007-01-22T10:36:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	I've been using mine about 8 months now
2007-01-22T10:37:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	are you sure you are talking about networkmanager, not e.g. about wifimanager?
2007-01-22T10:38:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	and network-manager-gnome?
2007-01-22T10:38:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	If so, what are your symptoms?
2007-01-22T10:40:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	network-manager-gnome. I'm assuming you to be a Gnome user... (ubuntu instead of kubuntu)
2007-01-22T10:48:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	 okay about "network-manager-gnome" is that  in the synaptic database ?  (yes I a a gnome user)
2007-01-22T10:49:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	yes, I think it is
2007-01-22T10:51:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	I'll have to go now for an hour or so. If you cannot get it to see the devices, check http://tinyurl.com/ts8md for a common solution
2007-01-22T12:03:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	I'm back now. Did you get WPA working with networkmanager?
2007-01-22T12:03:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	 well I got the manager to work but only provide me with WEP selection no WPA choice
2007-01-22T12:04:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	That's weird.
2007-01-22T12:05:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	 yeah and I used symaptic to download/install supplicant/xsupplicant (which I cannot see teh x application of supplicant)
2007-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	 checking again for supplicant install...maybe it did not install after all...
2007-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	And you did start the network-manager-gnome applet instead of looking still at the old wifi manager? (Sorry, just ruling out the easy "oops" solutions)
2007-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	okay the wpagui wasnt installed installing now.
2007-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	 nah I know the difference.
2007-01-22T12:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	Yes, I think you do, but sometimes even smart people do silly things :)
2007-01-22T12:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	hmm, I'm surprised it was not a dependancy...
2007-01-22T12:09:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	true.... waitting for install to coomplete... well see in a bit
2007-01-22T12:11:00.000Z	pbureau	Lynoure	I wonder if I need to reboot for it to take (after installed)
2007-01-22T12:11:00.000Z	Lynoure	pbureau	actually, I do not seem to need wpagui on kubuntu (dapper)...
