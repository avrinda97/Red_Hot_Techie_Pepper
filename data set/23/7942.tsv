2006-12-15T17:42:00.000Z	ken		I have installed ubuntu, and am confronted with the same problem, namely refresh rates. Ubuntu simply puts my refresh rate at mind-hurting low rates. Someone please help me. I did "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", and set my monitor rates @ (HxV) 31-54x50-99.
2006-12-15T17:42:00.000Z	ken		And now in screen resolution, i get option for running 800x600 mode @ 86Hz, and the same for 640x480 modes
2006-12-15T17:43:00.000Z	ken		but whenever i select any of them ubuntu simply takes me back to the login screen
2006-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	ken		so now i am stuck at 1024x768 @ 61Hz. Someone please help. And now when i scroll any webpages its scrolls extremely slowly. This happened after i ran the reconfigure command
2006-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	ken		Someone please help
2006-12-15T17:45:00.000Z	ken		Someone willing to help me?
2006-12-15T17:45:00.000Z	ken		please?
2006-12-15T17:45:00.000Z	johns^	ken	what kind of graphics card
2006-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	johns^	ken	did you install nvidia-glx?
2006-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	johns^	ken	apt-get install nvidia-glx
2006-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	ken	johns^	no i left it blank
2006-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	johns^	ken	then try again
2006-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	johns^	ken	at the end, select 'medium' instead of advanced
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	ken	johns^	selecting medium doesn't help
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	johns^	ken	so you can select resolutions and refresh rates
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	johns^	ken	and adding the memory size?
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	ken	johns^	And manually entering my VxH refresh rates in "advanced" too doesn't help
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	johns^	ken	agiain: and adding the memory size?
2006-12-15T17:49:00.000Z	ken	johns^	from what i understand people with memory onboard the graphics card (mine has 128mb dedicated GPU memory) are supposed to keep it blank. SO i kept it blank
2006-12-15T17:49:00.000Z	johns^	ken	maybe, but i've got an fx 5200 with no problems up to 1600x1400 or something
2006-12-15T17:50:00.000Z	ken	johns^	but my monitorCRT can't support those resolutions
2006-12-15T17:51:00.000Z	ken	johns^	i simply want 800x600 @ 85Hz. which my monitor supports in Windows. I selected it in reconfiugre..."medium", as well as put the values in "advanced". but that doesn't help
2006-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	ken	johns^	Now, whenever i select 800x600 or 640x480, the screen resolution dialog box says (86Hz), whereas it actually should be 85Hz (my monitor can only support 85hz not more than that, how do i bring the value back to 85hz)
