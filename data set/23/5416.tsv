2006-12-05T11:46:00.000Z	fujiX		anyone know if 6.10 will support higher resolutions in an upcoming update?
2006-12-05T11:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	the resolutions you can use is dependant on you graphics driver. not ubuntu
2006-12-05T11:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	if you are just getting xga, you might be using vesa drivers. change that :)
2006-12-05T11:48:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	im running nvidia drivers...i think ^^
2006-12-05T11:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config'
2006-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	yeah
2006-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	if the last part doesnt work, run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select driver 'nvidia'
2006-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	then rerun 'nvidia-glx-config
2006-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	just cut and paste the commands :)
2006-12-05T11:51:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	well, everything seems to be ok. running xgl and all, its just that i cant change my res higher then 1024x768
2006-12-05T11:52:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	tried sud dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but doesnt work
2006-12-05T11:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	try 'lsmod | grep nvidia'
2006-12-05T11:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	what does it say?
2006-12-05T11:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	then i find it strange that you arent gett higher resolutions. have you checked your xorg.conf?
2006-12-05T11:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	youll be looking for screen resolutions :)
2006-12-05T11:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	they should be under the screen section
2006-12-05T11:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' <- in aterminal
2006-12-05T11:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	scroll down to the screen section and add the resolutions you want under modes under the subsection 'display' for all color depths
2006-12-05T12:01:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	weird. there are higher resolutions there but i still cant select them in prefs.
2006-12-05T12:01:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	but i suspect something isnt right in that file... problem is i dont know what
2006-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	use pastebin and link it. perhaps someone will be able to spot something
2006-12-05T12:04:00.000Z	fujiX	nolimitsoya	sry pastebin? :) and link it where?
2006-12-05T12:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fujiX	the standard is se :)
