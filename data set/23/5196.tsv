2007-06-06T09:04:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		Yo I am looking for a Diagramming program for ubuntu.  Is there anything out there that comes  close to OmniGraffle?
2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	what kind of kiagramming program.
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	aKKiLLa	Scunizi	well I like to wireframe for web development also some UML
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		but anything that makes making flowcharts and wireframes with nice iconset
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		well I don't even need nice icon set
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		just something that is clean and easy to work with
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	not sure what UML is but wireframe...Blender is the cats meow..if you're use to it.
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		haha the cats meow
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		the 3d tool?
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	yep
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		err... nah not 3d wireframe
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		like a website wirefram
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		these are common things that diagramming software is used for
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	not sure I know what the diff is...
2007-06-06T09:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	you mean like a diagram with imbedded notes etc..?
2007-06-06T09:08:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		a software to buidl flowcharts, uml digrams and website wireframes
2007-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	ah.. ok.. there's several.. hang on...
2007-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		I see DIA and Inkscape
2007-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		but they suck balls
2007-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	Vym, kdissert & freemind.. Personally I like Vym with branches & trees, imbedded links, notes, graphics etc.. It also outputs to xml or xhtml..but kdissert is more like a flowchart.
2007-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	I know them as mind mappers.
2007-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	aKKiLLa		wow nice Scunizi thanks looking into these now
2007-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	aKKiLLa	I use Vym to keep track of stuff like this....
