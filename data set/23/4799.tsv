2007-10-22T23:59:00.000Z	fr0nk		:)
2007-10-23T00:01:00.000Z	fr0nk		can somebody please help me getting vmware to work again after the update from feisty to gusty? After the update in the /var/log/vmware-serverd.log the messages: lease make sure that the kernel module `vmmon' is loaded." and Msg_Post: Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory. Thanks :)
2007-10-23T00:01:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	working on the same problem here ...
2007-10-23T00:01:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	ah ok :) i'm not the only one
2007-10-23T00:01:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	the reason is that the kernel version is a different one now .... 2.6.22 vs. 2.6.20 as it was before.
2007-10-23T00:02:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	yeahright, but: is it trut the vmmon is incompatible with the current kernel?
2007-10-23T00:02:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	I am trying to find if there is a repo for this ... there used to be a package which would auto-magically take care of this.
2007-10-23T00:02:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	you'd have to recompile the module ... it's not really "incompatible" ....
2007-10-23T00:02:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	uh, this sounds great, would you please /msg me if you found something?
2007-10-23T00:02:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	stay tuned ... I am checking what possibilities there are.
2007-10-23T00:07:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	Check this thread ,.,,,, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=579347&highlight=commercial+repo
2007-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	there is the vmware kernel package, i'll give that a try
2007-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	did you already test it?
2007-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	no ... I am considering what the other guy said ... Using "virtualbox".
2007-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	that one is nice too I hear
2007-10-23T00:09:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	apparently virtualbox can read VMware's virtual machine :-)   I will try that ...
2007-10-23T00:09:00.000Z	fr0nk	scorp123	hmm i should _REALLY_ use vmware since i'm focussing at getting a vmware certified trainer atm ;P
2007-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	still here?
2007-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	my system just crashed :-(
2007-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	scorp123	fr0nk	.... I am now going back to 7.04 .... 7.10 is making too much trouble for me, sorry to say so. :-/
