2009-08-01T01:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1dlg	yes it should be there in his home (you can ask if he saved anything out of his home )
2009-08-01T01:53:00.000Z	m1dlg	erUSUL	many thanks - ok he wouldn't have a clue! he is a noob in the politest sense, I'll just have to hope I saved everything! thank you for your help and your time. :)
