2006-05-05T10:43:00.000Z	Android_D		does ubuntu come with MySQL, and ffmpeg or Berkeley MPEG encoder (mpeg_encode)?
2006-05-05T10:45:00.000Z	Android_D		my linux box is not connected to the net either, will that cause a problem?
2006-05-05T10:46:00.000Z	Android_D		uargh. alright
2006-05-05T10:46:00.000Z	Android_D		packages.ubuntu.com should have what I need though?
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	manually istalling
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	Android_D		yeah
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	Android_D		manual install, since i don't have ubuntu connected to the net
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	manually installing packages is not for the faint of heart
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	Android_D		well, I have manually installed my webcam package and gcc-3.4 ...
2006-05-05T10:48:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	you're obviously on the 'net now, so why don't you connect your ubuntu box?
2006-05-05T10:49:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	I had troubles getting my onboard network card to connect with ubuntu
2006-05-05T10:49:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	and I don't have a router, so switching the line back and forth is a pain
2006-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	what mobo?
2006-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	can't remember off the top of my head, but it is the one that comes with a ShuttleX system
2006-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	I think it is an issue with my realtek network adapter actually
2006-05-05T10:54:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	oh, it's realtek? that shouldn't be any trouble
2006-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	just look for '8139too' in lsmod
2006-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	yeah, I have done all that
2006-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	sn9		was it there?
2006-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	I am sure it is something simple, I just haven't had the chance to look at it because of school. but I am done now so...
2006-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	Android_D		yeah, it is there
2006-05-05T10:56:00.000Z	sn9	Android_D	recently had trouble with a realtek onboard nic. flashing the bios fixed it
2006-05-05T10:57:00.000Z	Android_D	sn9	hmm. good call. I might just do that
