2011-12-29T13:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	why didnt the alternative installer work?
2011-12-29T13:19:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	hi man youve sugest me to try with the alternative installer about one hour ago,
2011-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	yeah, why didnt it work
2011-12-29T13:21:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	it just did the same thing, the screen goes off and there nothing hapening
2011-12-29T13:21:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	ifyour using the alternative installer.. then the nomodeset thing probably wont work
2011-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	okay but how the hell i can solve this lol :)
2011-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	cant solve it til we know whats wrong
2011-12-29T13:23:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	how can i tell you whats wrong, after i choose install it, there some whit text showing then the screen goes off, and when i choose to only try it, the same hapen, but i here the ubuntu sound playing
2011-12-29T13:24:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	it doesnt make sense that the alternative isntaller does that too when you do install, because its not loading an X server
2011-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	what i should do ??
2011-12-29T13:27:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	??
2011-12-29T13:27:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	I dont know what to tell you, but like I said, it makes no sense that the alternative installer fails when in a non X environment
2011-12-31T11:46:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	hi , if you remenber about 2days ago i have talked to you about that
2011-12-31T11:47:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	I thought I recognized your issue.. good.. im not any more crazy that I think I am
2011-12-31T11:47:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	XD
2011-12-31T12:11:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	thats a kernel boot parameter
2011-12-31T12:12:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	?? can you explan what you said lol like i said i am new to linux
2011-12-31T12:13:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	the Linux Kernel takes parameters when it boots to exec with different options, like single, ro, quiet, splash, etc. nomodeset is one of thos options
2011-12-31T12:13:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	okay but how can i set that, im not able to get into the installation
2011-12-31T12:14:00.000Z	DrPenguin	atvr	you can manipulate the kernel boot parameters when you go to boot for a one time deal
2011-12-31T12:15:00.000Z	atvr	DrPenguin	when i boot, i see that i can put some command or somthing, it says Boot: in the lower part of the screen so is it there that i have to put something
