2006-05-28T07:38:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	you installed ubuntu packages, or something off of nvidia.com?
2006-05-28T07:39:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	ah is that what you ment, i installed/kompiled drivers from nvidia, doesnt it work on ubunu?
2006-05-28T07:39:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	it does, but it's not supported here.  We prefer the ubuntu packages
2006-05-28T07:39:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	please read the wiki page re: nvidia, and use the ubuntu packages
2006-05-28T07:40:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	ok ok, ill look into it.... thanks, hope itll start orelese ill be back with same question :P later
2006-05-28T07:40:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	take it easy :)
2006-05-28T07:52:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	well i did exactly as it sad, when i restart xserver i get nvidia logo and then it crashes again
2006-05-28T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	have you looked at your /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2006-05-28T07:55:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
2006-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	which nvidia drivers did you install?  ubuntu packages?
2006-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	ubuntu packeges did not work at all, so i installed 8756 from nvidia and it works untill i reboot
2006-05-28T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	are you booting into a kernel other than what you built nvidia modules from?
2006-05-28T12:15:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	no kernel veresion is the same its nvidia module that changes to another after reboot
2006-05-28T12:16:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	as I mentioned earlier, ubuntu packages are preferred
2006-05-28T12:18:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	yes but the link you gave says: install nvidia-config (or something) and nvidia-glx, and i cant install both it uninstalls one of them so i can only have eather glx or config and when i proceed anyway with glx it installs but refuses to boot becouse module is missing or something i dont remember now
2006-05-28T12:19:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	the wiki page shouldn't suggest nvidia-config
2006-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	well maybee it wasnt config i dont remember now, but it was something that i can not have at the same time as glx but it did install anyway no problem there but when xconfig file is changed it refused to boot
2006-05-28T12:22:00.000Z	tritium	stasislove	what was the error/problem?
2006-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	stasislove	tritium	it was something with /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy missing
