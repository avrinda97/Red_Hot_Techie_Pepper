2006-03-30T12:10:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		Hi I could really use someone to help me with a few things - I am at the end of the line here folks - I have vowed to get my ubuntu installation working my noon or I forget the whole thing and my machines go back to windows - I could really use the help.
2006-03-30T12:11:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		BY NOON is had better work
2006-03-30T12:11:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		It's that simple
2006-03-30T12:11:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		I do mean that
2006-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		No Ubuntu is installed
2006-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		It's just getting it to do the simplist of things
2006-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		I could use someone 'personally' who can help me along the way when doing things
2006-03-30T12:13:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		So bollox to it
2006-03-30T12:13:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	what takes time is not the doing, it's the learning. don't put deadlines like that ;)
2006-03-30T12:30:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	dual boot. take your time to figure out linux. It took me a long time to adopt it fulltime
2006-03-30T13:19:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	try to be a little less "urgent" in your dealings. You might have better luck
2006-03-30T13:20:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	frank23	if you are not "urgent" as you say in this channel YOU GET IGNORED
2006-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	not really...  your CAPS usage might cause that though
2006-03-30T13:25:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	bot answers are for common things. If they exist, it's to not have to explain the exact same things over and over. Most people are happy to be pointed in the right direction
2006-04-02T10:10:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	if you actually a need of one of the new features, sure you can do it but I doubt that's the case
2006-04-02T10:11:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	frank23	- I do need one of the new features
2006-04-02T10:12:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	what? maybe you can just grab the dapper kernel. not sure if it's as easy as that though
2006-04-02T10:17:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	note that I don't actually know if this will work.   just change the sources.list lines  from breezy to dapper.   install the kernel (make sure you don't upgrade the whole system) and revert to the old sources.list
2006-04-02T10:24:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	frank23	- hey I installed the 2.6.15 one - but its not showing in the GRUB menu - do I need to add it ?
2006-04-02T10:25:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	it doesn't show up in grub? it should....   if not you might need to add it yourself to /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-04-02T10:25:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	what package did you install exactly?
2006-04-02T10:27:00.000Z	frank23	Cyorxamp	you upgraded  linux-686  or something like that?
2006-04-02T10:36:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	frank23	- ummm it's not in /boot
