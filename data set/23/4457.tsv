2008-10-14T00:14:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	i fixed my problem by adding something to synaptic.c and reinstalling it
2008-10-14T00:14:00.000Z	jrib	kaneda_	oh, you actually had to patch the driver?  eww

2009-11-06T21:14:00.000Z	jrib	kaneda_	just ask your actual question...
2009-11-06T21:14:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	i just did, no one answered
2009-11-06T21:14:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	way to be there
2009-11-06T21:14:00.000Z	jrib	kaneda_	well I read that instead of your question
2009-11-06T21:14:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	yes, it's a waste of space to repeat myself
2009-11-06T21:15:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	i'm trying to create a new XFS on a device
2009-11-06T21:15:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	i receive the error from dm_task_set_name that the device is not found
2009-11-06T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	kaneda_	no it's not, as I just pointed out.  1) New people join and 2) No one reads every line and may have missed the first time you asked it.  So instead of saying "Can anyone help with the above" (and thus making it difficult or impossible to know what you are talking about) or similar, just repeat the question after waiting a reasonable amount of time.
2009-11-06T21:16:00.000Z	kaneda_	jrib	so i'm guessing you missed the repeat question while typing that long response
2009-11-06T21:16:00.000Z	jrib	kaneda_	nope
