2008-12-01T01:22:00.000Z	n8tuser		alex_21-> alright, per what you pasted, you have two nic cards that are on the same lan,  you have to disable one of them and do a /etc/init.d/networking restart to fix your route table that has two gateway entries
2008-12-01T01:22:00.000Z	n8tuser		Al1-> you ready for that debootstrap install? you have a new partition right?
2008-12-01T01:23:00.000Z	n8tuser		alex_21-> you follow what am saying right? having two gateways, it confuses your system as to which gateway it will take
