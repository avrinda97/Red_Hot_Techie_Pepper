2010-04-07T23:27:00.000Z	h0dg3s		trying to run a bash script but it keeps saying permission denied
2010-04-07T23:27:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	you have to do chmod +x NAME on it
2010-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	Then you give the rights to execute it
2010-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	h0dg3s	Masteredu	Thanks
2010-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	youre welcome
2010-04-07T23:32:00.000Z	h0dg3s	Masteredu	The script runs sudo apt-get and then a list of programs.  If I paste it into a terminal it works fine, but the script says No such file or directory.  Any ideas?
2010-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	ehm what script?
2010-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	h0dg3s	Masteredu	I made one to grab the dependancies for Chromeos
2010-04-07T23:34:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	when it says that a directory is  not found, the path is wrong

2010-04-07T23:36:00.000Z	h0dg3s	Masteredu	Does that mean I should have something other than #!/bin/bash at the top?
2010-04-07T23:38:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	#! /bin/bash is right, but i use a space for this , i mean between ! and the /
2010-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	jeah it is right
2010-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	it must an other thing be

2010-04-07T23:41:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	the standard syntax is ./NAME , but only when you are in the right directory
2010-04-07T23:45:00.000Z	Masteredu	h0dg3s	sry, i cant find an wrong line too
