2011-01-03T19:23:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	so you are running ubuntu under vmware or vmware under ubuntu?
2011-01-03T19:24:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	are you running lvm?
2011-01-03T19:24:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	if so, you can enlarge partitions on fly
2011-01-03T19:25:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	pass sudo df -h to pastebin
2011-01-03T19:26:00.000Z	nio	gobbe	it is showing my partition information
2011-01-03T19:27:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	put it to pastebin
2011-01-03T19:28:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	and what does command sudo lvdisplay say

2011-01-03T19:35:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	and sudo /sbin/lvdisplay didn't return anything?
2011-01-03T19:36:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	ok, so you don't have lvm's
2011-01-03T19:36:00.000Z	gobbe	nio	then extending is much harder
