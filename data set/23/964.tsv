2011-03-29T08:24:00.000Z	New0		hi guys, hi set grub to be hidden from windows. now i need to change it back. how? i'm in windows maybe there is software?
2011-03-29T08:24:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	What makes it so you can't boot back into linux?
2011-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	Yes because now the GRUB menu is Hidden
2011-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	Press something as the system boots, say esc and press it repeatedly, grub shouldn't be THAT hidden unless it was wiped out..
2011-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	but for now it also not possible for me to boot with Live Cd
2011-03-29T08:26:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	 Why did you have a need to hide grub that deep anyway?
2011-03-29T08:28:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	becuaese my laptop did problems, and i called Sony Support and they say that someone will come to me to fix it. but my brother told me to hidded it so the tech guy whould not blem me
2011-03-29T08:29:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	i try it Esc but it didn't work. it say Grub is loading or something like it, and then windows keep load and not show me the grub menu
2011-03-29T08:30:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	Someone else recommended holding shift during boot (probably left shift)
2011-03-29T08:31:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	ok anyway i will try it another time now and i will see,,, hoo tnx didn't try it yet. anyway i will try it now and will be back. THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
2011-03-29T08:36:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	hey, i try it with Esc and Shift Right, Left , Both and didn't work
2011-03-29T08:37:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	You will need a liveCD/LiveUSB to changeg grub settings..
2011-03-29T08:37:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	ok this is the thing. i choose in grub to select win 7, then i choose timeout to 0
2011-03-29T08:38:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	yea i know tnx :). but right now i don't have one. so maybe it's possible from windows. i knnow there is a software that can read/write to/from EXT3
2011-03-29T08:41:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	The main issue is.... writting to ext3 isn't enough, you need to get to the the MBR..
2011-03-29T08:42:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	right... i forgot about update-grub :)
2011-03-29T08:44:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	ok man THANK YOU VERY MUCH for trying to help me. but i think that i need to solve it with LiveCD/USB and not stick my head to the gruond :) tnx
2011-03-29T08:49:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	by the way, after i'm loading LiveCD/USB, i only need to find GRUB change it back and update-grub command?
2011-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	Supposedly, yes
2011-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	Please remember to chroot into your hard drive!
2011-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	chroot what is it?
2011-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	New0	the chroot command when used properly makes the disable system look like the active system so you can do repairs on it while it won't boot
2011-03-29T09:02:00.000Z	New0	Diamondcite	ok i never use this command, but also i will not weste your time. and i will google it tnx :)
