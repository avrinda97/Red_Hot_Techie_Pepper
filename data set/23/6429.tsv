2006-04-14T11:08:00.000Z	ASDFG		hello
2006-04-14T11:08:00.000Z	ASDFG		i've tried to unmount my cdrom but i cant get the cd out
2006-04-14T11:08:00.000Z	ASDFG		any1 able to help
2006-04-14T11:08:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	command line or CD button?
2006-04-14T11:10:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	does   tail -f /var/log/syslog  give you any info?
2006-04-14T11:13:00.000Z	ASDFG	duelboot	thats not working either
2006-04-14T11:13:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	hold on...hmmmmmm
2006-04-14T11:14:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	what was the exact umount command you used?
2006-04-14T11:15:00.000Z	ASDFG	duelboot	unmount cdrom
2006-04-14T11:16:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	type    more /etc/fstab in terminal and tell me what it says for your cdrom entry
2006-04-14T11:16:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	your command is probably wrong
2006-04-14T11:16:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	you need to type   sudo umount /dev/hdc
2006-04-14T11:17:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	or you can type   sudo umount /media/cdrom0  either should work
2006-04-14T11:18:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	did it work?
2006-04-14T11:20:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	^^^
2006-04-14T11:20:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	you need to         sudo fuser /dev/hdc
2006-04-14T11:23:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	the only option *I* know right now is to logout and shutdown...on reboot you should be able to push your CD button and the CD should eject...no promises
2006-04-14T11:24:00.000Z	ASDFG	duelboot	so which commands should i use next time to mount and unmount
2006-04-14T11:25:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	^^^
2006-04-14T11:25:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	you may have other problems so it MAY not umount....
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	I did some reading and others with your problem....
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	duelboot	ASDFG	had a bad cdrom drive   :(
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	ASDFG	duelboot	its a sony dvdrw dl ive already returned one back to the shop
