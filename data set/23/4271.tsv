2008-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	Macports for OSX (intel), but getting a bit offtopic here
2008-05-23T03:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	aye, agreed but this is getting a bit offtopic
2008-05-23T03:20:00.000Z	Lanlost	bazhang	not really
2008-05-23T03:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	the driver does not support that sort of rendering; continuing on about here wont change that
2008-05-23T03:21:00.000Z	Lanlost	bazhang	but that's what I'm trying to figure out.. I'm trying to figure out WHAT doens't work about to see if there is a work around.. I was just told this very quickly.. installed and lost the link
2008-05-23T03:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	this is hardy or gutsy
2008-05-23T03:24:00.000Z	Lanlost	bazhang	the reason this isn't offtopic is my original question. How do I figure out what driver I'm using if it's autodetected since it's not stored in xorg.conf anymore
2008-05-23T03:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	this is hardy or gutsy
2008-05-23T03:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	the offtopic I refer to is all the editorial comments
2008-05-23T03:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	please take the chat elsewhere
2008-05-23T03:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	the best bet is to hear from a user/guru in compiz who comes in here name of crdl-b; he can sort that in about five seconds-
2008-05-23T03:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	PM please
2008-09-23T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	lose the caps
2010-04-04T15:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	stay on topic. support here chat in #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-01-16T11:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	whom are you addressing?
2011-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	Lanlost	bazhang	the internet
2011-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	please dont break it up as it is very hard to read that way
2011-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	Lanlost	bazhang	sorry. That's a bad habit of mine
2011-07-03T19:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Lanlost	thats enough
