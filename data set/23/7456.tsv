2005-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	kemik	Razor-X	 yes, and im just saying that your worst "leftist" are our worst "rightwing"
2005-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	Razor-X	kemik	left and right have nothing to do with it
2005-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	Razor-X	kemik	no, that's a worldwide fudgeover ;), the actual political compass makes a distinction
2005-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	kemik	well, I tend to make things universal, rather than cause these locale rifts?
2005-08-04T06:54:00.000Z	kemik	Razor-X	 sure, but i was trying to get a point across that things are not "universal"
2005-08-04T06:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	kemik	well, it's a Political Science type thing
2005-08-04T06:54:00.000Z	kemik	Razor-X	 ie; what you consider socialist is what alot of europeans would consider extreme capitalism
