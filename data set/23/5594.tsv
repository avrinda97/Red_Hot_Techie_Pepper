2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	I don't know the answer to your problem, but I can help you look... start searching for "pmount user permissions"
2006-11-10T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	can you tell me the output of the 'groups' command?
2006-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	mamonassassina	jrib	sure,but,where can i find that output?properties,permissions?
2006-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	open accessories > terminal, then type 'groups' without quotes, and press enter

2006-11-10T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	yes, it is probably related, but notice that that was fixed back in warty.  Where does your device get mounted to?
2006-11-10T07:18:00.000Z	mamonassassina	jrib	media/usbdisk
2006-11-10T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	ls -ld /media/usbdisk
2006-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	mamonassassina	jrib	done.let me try adding some file there
2006-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	nah, that won't do anything.  just gives you info.  What did it say?
2006-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	mamonassassina	jrib	hahahah

2006-11-10T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	mamonassassina	interesting... that means you should be able to write to it.  What does 'touch /media/usbdisk/test' say?  (this creates an empty file called test)
2006-11-10T07:21:00.000Z	mamonassassina	jrib	touch: no  possvel realizar touch sobre `/media/usbdisk/test': Sistema de arquivos somente-leitura
