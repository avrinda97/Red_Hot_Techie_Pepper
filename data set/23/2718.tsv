2008-12-17T15:35:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Are you asking about how to setup the access point? Or to use your laptop to browse the web? Is the access point working right now with another computer?
2008-12-17T15:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Is your wireless access point currently working with another computer?
2008-12-17T15:39:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Okay. Um, do you see an icon to the upper-right of your screen? Network icon?
2008-12-17T15:40:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Okay, good. Um, are you using the internet from your laptop *right* now?
2008-12-17T15:42:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Ah I understand now. Okay. Do you *know* the model of the wireless card which is *in* your laptop?
2008-12-17T15:42:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Okay, when you try to use the wireless card which is *in* your machine, what happens? Do you see the network icon?
2008-12-17T15:43:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Can you tell me the brand/model of your laptop please?
2008-12-17T15:44:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Thank you, hang on.
2008-12-17T15:46:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	According to this, your laptop doesn't come with an in-built wireless card. Thus, you're using the Softgate one right?
2008-12-17T15:46:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	Okay, could you provide me with the model of that card?
2008-12-17T15:47:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	My mistake, buddy. :-) Hang on.
2008-12-17T15:49:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=128864 <- According to this thread, that particular card isn't supported.
2008-12-17T15:51:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	I'll do some more digging then. :-) Hang on.
2008-12-17T15:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_part.php?brandname=Quetec <- I'm sorry, your card isn't supported.
2008-12-17T15:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	I'd advise you to get a supported card. :-)
2008-12-17T15:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	jseagle	http://linux-wless.passys.nl/ <- This site contains a comprehensive list of supported cards.
