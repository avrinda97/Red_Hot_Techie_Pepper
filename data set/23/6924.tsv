2006-09-08T06:03:00.000Z	sethk	`123	paste the url of the post again, please
2006-09-08T06:04:00.000Z	sethk	`123	unfortunately, that's a firmware bug
2006-09-08T06:05:00.000Z	sethk	`123	debian just announced that they were going to switch cd record programs, because ...
2006-09-08T06:05:00.000Z	sethk	`123	while the author of cdrecord is very good, he often says "bad firmware" or "kernel bug" instead of working around the problem
2006-09-08T06:05:00.000Z	sethk	`123	he's right that it's a firmware problem, but just saying to people "buy another drive" isn't helpful
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	sethk	`123	oh, yes, definitely
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	sethk	`123	try searching the archives of the cdrecord mailing list
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	sethk	`123	there are so many types of cd burners, nobody can remember the details of all of them.  At least, I can't.
2006-09-08T06:07:00.000Z	sethk	`123	because burn-free happens entirely within the drive under the control of the firmware
2006-09-08T06:07:00.000Z	sethk	`123	one thing that might help is to turn on scsi emulation for the burner and try it again
2006-09-08T06:07:00.000Z	sethk	`123	since kernel 2.6, scsi emulation is no longer required for an ide burner, but it can still be used.
2006-09-08T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	`123	nothing to lose by trying, except a cd blank.
2006-09-08T06:09:00.000Z	sethk	`123	odds are it will still fail, but blanks are cheap  :)
