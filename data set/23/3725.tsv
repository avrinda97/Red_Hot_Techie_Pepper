2008-02-07T10:03:00.000Z	zappitelli16		I'm having a hard time getting my wireless internet to work, I just configured the drivers and firmware using this website: http://www.waraey.com/blog/?p=10. I'm pretty desperate to get this to work can anyone help me? I have an Intel 2200BG Wireless card.
2008-02-07T10:04:00.000Z	zappitelli16		no I haven't used ndiswrapper, but I was under the impression that the drivers I used would work. no?
2008-02-07T10:04:00.000Z	zappitelli16		maybe they will work, but I have to access them through ndiswrapper??
2008-02-07T10:05:00.000Z	zappitelli16		thats what I thought. I don't know how to tell why it isn't working I've followed all the documentation and can't come to any conclusions. I do not have a device manager under administration though, if that makes a difference.
2008-02-07T10:06:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	try ndiswrapper and see how it goes
2008-02-07T10:07:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	Synaptic Package Manager should have it
2008-02-07T10:09:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	after installation, it should be under System->Administration->Windows Wireless Drivers
2008-02-07T10:10:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	did you install ndiswrapper from synaptic package manager?
2008-02-07T10:11:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	you also need ndisgtk
2008-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	is there an install cd for you wireless adapter?
2008-02-07T10:16:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	with or without ndisgtk, you still need the install disk for your wireless adapter. try google to find the files
2008-02-07T10:19:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	try for "install files for <insert name of adapter here>"
2008-02-07T10:20:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	so you just need to set up the drivers?
2008-02-07T10:21:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	in terminal, sudo lshw -C network
2008-02-07T10:22:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	is the driver there?
2008-02-07T10:25:00.000Z	zappitelli16	simps	this is what came up, I can't tell if the driver is there or not
2008-02-07T10:26:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	now in terminal type iwconfig
2008-02-07T10:28:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	i'm just reading from the help menu :P
2008-02-07T10:29:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	click the Help icon at the top and search for ndiswrapper and click the first link :s
2008-02-07T10:29:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	did you try that documentation?
2008-02-07T10:33:00.000Z	simps	zappitelli16	try step 3 under 3.2.5
