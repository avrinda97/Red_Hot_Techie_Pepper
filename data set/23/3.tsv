2004-11-19T09:26:00.000Z	hypa7ia		i think so weasello
2004-11-19T09:28:00.000Z	hypa7ia		hmm, schifo, i think that there isn't a kernel-source-2.6.8 pkg yet
2004-11-19T09:28:00.000Z	hypa7ia		i only have up to 2.6.7 in mine
2004-11-19T09:28:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	schifo: if you're looking for the kernel sources, they're in linux-source-2.6.8.1
2004-11-19T09:35:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	GnuHippy: please don't file bugs about software that isn't provided with Ubuntu
2004-11-19T09:41:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	more than 100,000?  that's awesome :-)
2004-11-19T10:58:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	ati has superior free drivers
2004-11-19T11:07:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	why did your desire for a laptop preclude using MacOS?
2004-11-19T11:08:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	because i wanted a tricked out laptop, and powerbooks were oiut of my budget range
2004-11-19T11:08:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	yeah, apple laptops hurt that way...but the same holds for their desktops
2004-11-19T11:13:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	what kind of stuff did you need to do to get everything working?  things we could fix for hoary?
2004-11-19T11:14:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	wel.  intel wireless 2200 is a big one.
2004-11-19T11:14:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	what did it need?  newer version of the driver?
2004-11-19T11:14:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	er, it's part of the default kernel :-)
2004-11-19T11:14:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	my laptop has intel 2200 wireless, and it works out of the box
2004-11-19T11:15:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	maybe it needs a newer version of the driver? :-)
2004-11-19T11:15:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	you got it working, building the module from source?
2004-11-19T11:16:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	nope, not yet
2004-11-19T11:16:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	oh, you said everything works
2004-11-19T11:17:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	well, it's not all working on /mine/ :-/
2004-11-19T11:18:00.000Z	mdz	hypa7ia	does the module get loaded?
2004-11-19T11:18:00.000Z	hypa7ia	mdz	there's a bug in the dsdt for my laptop apparenly and thus the battery status is not to be fount
