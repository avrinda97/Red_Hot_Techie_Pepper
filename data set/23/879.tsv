2010-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	mendelev	UnholyTerror	what's restart x mean
2010-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	it's a quick reboot without really rebooting.... it restarts the desktop/graphics system.
2010-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	mendelev		how do you do it
2010-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	if enabled CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
2010-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	you'lle end up back at the login screen.
2010-12-30T07:20:00.000Z	mendelev	UnholyTerror	ctrl alt backspace didn't do anything
2010-12-30T07:20:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	do you have a mouse to use?
2010-12-30T07:20:00.000Z	mendelev		soz maybe i should full reboot

2010-12-30T07:22:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	System->Preferences->Keyboard->Layout->Options->Key sequence to restart X
2010-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	mendelev	all the open programs will be closed so you'll have to come back here after...
