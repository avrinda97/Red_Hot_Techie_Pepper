2011-05-02T19:24:00.000Z	Arowana		are u behind proxy or direct connection
2011-05-02T19:26:00.000Z	Arowana		hi sipior, well masak, maybe he has got a point
2011-05-02T19:28:00.000Z	Arowana		and btw masak: are u using root user
2011-05-02T19:28:00.000Z	Arowana		y not use su
2011-05-02T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	because the root account is disabled so su will fail
2011-05-02T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	ok, what is the password for root considering I have never set the password and the account is disabled
2011-05-02T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	I am ready to type
2011-05-02T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	i tried my password which is the only account on my system and it didn't work
2011-05-02T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	in Ubuntu there is NO root password, the account is DISABLED. It doesn't work
2011-05-02T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	I am fully aware of HOW it's not advised nor supported nor necessary
2011-05-02T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	sticking to sudo gives control of whom can use admin access as they need adding to the group which gives sudo
2011-05-02T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	the ubuntu community advocates sudo and it is setup as such by Linux users who I am very sure know a lot more than you, think about it.
2011-05-02T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	you can set it on your own system if you want but enabling the account is not default, which is why su doesn't work
2011-05-02T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	you can also achieve the same root console with: sudo -i
2011-05-02T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	this keeps the root account securely disabled
2011-05-02T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	use:  sudo -i   and it will be just like you 'su'
2011-05-02T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Arowana	fine
