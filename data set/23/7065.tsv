2008-03-02T06:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bluefox83	 then it seems you have done what gparted said. :)
2008-03-02T06:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	Dr_willis	and yet it still eont let me remove that partition
2008-03-02T06:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bluefox83	 if its empty  - you could use the good old 'fdisk' command.
2008-03-02T06:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bluefox83	 ive also seen that after doing some partition changes. the system needs a reboot to see the changes.
2008-03-02T06:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	Dr_willis	it see's teh changes, i'm booted into the cd
2008-03-02T06:06:00.000Z	bluefox83	Dr_willis	i have a small partition of about 20 gigs i am trying to delete so i can resize another partition to take up it's space
2008-03-02T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bluefox83	 if its empty. I would fire up fdisk, and delete it.
