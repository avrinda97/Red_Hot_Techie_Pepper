2006-06-07T09:34:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	not afaik, pretty clean install
2006-06-07T09:34:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	maybe they start on different workspace? XD
2006-06-07T09:35:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	or maybe you've got second X server? try alt+f6,7,8,9
2006-06-07T09:36:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	alt+ctrl
2006-06-07T09:37:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	I do have another session in vt8, but they don't show there either :)
2006-06-07T09:37:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	are the processes all sleeping?
2006-06-07T09:37:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	starting new apps works fine there
2006-06-07T09:38:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	maybe try connecting with strace -p to one and see what it does...
2006-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	hmm, strace says "read(4, " and then nothing.
2006-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	use lsof to see what is descriptor 4 for that process
2006-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	it's a socket - not sure how to get more info
2006-06-07T09:43:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	probably gconfd
2006-06-07T09:43:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	are non-gnome apps working fine?
2006-06-07T09:44:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	xterm sounds non-gnome to me, and doesn't work :)
2006-06-07T09:45:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	no idea on how to proceed :(
2006-06-07T09:45:00.000Z	raboof_	TheSheep	hum, seems like something timed out, now everything I started suddenly pops up :)
2006-06-07T09:46:00.000Z	TheSheep	raboof_	using nfs maybe?
