2007-07-17T10:33:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	do you know why nvidia-glx-new isn't installed by default (what is it?)
2007-07-17T10:34:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	To be honest, I figured out the workaround I told Frawgie and stopped looking for why nvidia_legacy was getting loaded.
2007-07-17T10:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	well what is nvidia-glx-new
2007-07-17T10:34:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	Since it wasn't my box, and that solution worked, I wasn't in a position to bother to try and fix it.
2007-07-17T10:34:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	Obsolete already. :)
2007-07-17T10:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	??
2007-07-17T10:35:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	Alright, my memory is rusty so give me a minute to dig up the version numbers?
2007-07-17T10:36:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	In the beginning nVidia had a unified driver system, one driver package that worked for all their cards from the beginning of time to the present, and it was Good.
2007-07-17T10:36:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	ye
2007-07-17T10:36:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And then around the time of the 71xx drivers it got to be too bloody much of a pain to support the latest and greatest cards in the same driver as something that can barely do OpenGL.
2007-07-17T10:37:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And there was a great cry and gnashing of teeth as there was the Split, where one version of the driver was needed for older cards, and another for newer cards.  But all was well, as it could be labeled old, and all was good.
2007-07-17T10:38:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	But behold, there was still pain in the land of nVidia driver maintainers, and so there was another split in the time of 96xx, once more dropping support for older cards (but not as old as the 71xx drivers handle) in favor of newer cards.
2007-07-17T10:39:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	wow
2007-07-17T10:39:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And there was _great_ crying and ganshing of teeth among the distributions, for behold they now had to choose between _three_ different driver versions, and this caused much trouble for those that had called the 71xx driver old, for now there was another not quite as old.
2007-07-17T10:39:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And behold, there were support issues, and holes made in walls by the heads of distribution packagers.
2007-07-17T10:40:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	haha, I see.
2007-07-17T10:40:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And then there was the great renumbering, and drivers have become 100.14.n, and the potential for yet another Split.
2007-07-17T10:40:00.000Z	Eleaf	Mercury	there should be a messaging system that says if you have this card and up, upgrade to nvidia-glx-new.
2007-07-17T10:40:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And the distribution packagers started screaming and yelling and throwing things.
2007-07-17T10:41:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	IMHO, Ubuntu should adopt the same scheme that Debian nvidia package owner has done, calling them nvidia-legacy-71xx, nvidia-legacy-96xx, etc.
2007-07-17T10:41:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	No more of this old, current, new stuff.
2007-07-17T10:42:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	Anyhow, that is the tale of why we have nvidia-glx-new.
2007-07-17T10:42:00.000Z	Mercury	Eleaf	And why the people maintaining those packages don't want to answer email asking why right now. :)
