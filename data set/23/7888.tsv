2005-04-03T09:28:00.000Z	odie5533		Ah... I am actually interested in the best way to go about learning plain C++, not C# .net =/ I wish to program tools and applications... maybe games if I have time
2005-04-03T09:29:00.000Z	odie5533		thats not what they criticize for me ;D
2005-04-03T09:30:00.000Z	odie5533		And thats not what I'd say is the prob with it
2005-04-03T09:30:00.000Z	odie5533		C++ compared to java has few pre-loaded API libs, forcing you to use third party
2005-04-03T09:31:00.000Z	odie5533		Ok?I use them often, my panel is filled, but I don't know them
2005-04-03T09:32:00.000Z	odie5533		ok fine before I was born :(
2005-04-03T09:33:00.000Z	odie5533		Yeah that isn't entirely, but if your job is stable and you have extra time, go for game programing :D
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	odie5533		omg HKSDU me too!
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	odie5533		except the + is a -
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	AGREE!
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	cool...lol...
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	lol
2005-04-03T09:38:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	isn't that you configure your XF86Config-4 file for that refresh rate?
2005-04-03T09:43:00.000Z	odie5533	HKSDU	Java is nice, but the problems it has are not nice =/
2005-04-03T09:43:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	what problems it has?
2005-04-03T09:45:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	slow because of the developers.  Do a search on google, try to find all statistics.  There are many of them pointing out that Java is slower than C++ no more than 5% in many situations if you optimized for both(do not count swing please, I know it's slow in swing :P)
2005-04-03T09:46:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	if you are talking about standalone gui, of course it's slow.  The funny thing is that I guess it is faster to render a 3D menu using Java3D API than drawing with swing.
2005-04-03T09:47:00.000Z	odie5533	HKSDU	I think it is, I play a 3d java game daily, and its quite fast, 50fps and fully 3d, also it loads faster than my standalone java programs
2005-04-03T09:48:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	not fully but closely most
2005-04-03T09:53:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	no joking man, hate M$
2005-04-03T09:54:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	look at .NET and you will see how crappy their products are
2005-04-03T09:54:00.000Z	HKSDU	odie5533	.NET is a copy of Java, so you are saying Java is genius?
2005-04-03T09:55:00.000Z	odie5533	HKSDU	.net > java
