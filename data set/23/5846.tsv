2006-08-28T15:31:00.000Z	lupine_85		it won't show wlan until the driver is loaded
2006-08-28T15:32:00.000Z	lupine_85		yep, find the option to add the pciid/usbid to the database; do so; then ndiswrapper -l (inf-file)
2006-08-28T15:32:00.000Z	lupine_85		lspci -v /lsusb
2006-08-28T15:33:00.000Z	lupine_85		(andy: tab on your screen somewhere with "uboto! written on it)
2006-08-28T15:33:00.000Z	lupine_85		or disable it in the BIOS (what I did)
2006-08-28T15:34:00.000Z	lupine_85		you never have to reboot with linux!
2006-08-28T15:34:00.000Z	lupine_85		Once you've blacklisted the module, use rmmod to unload it
2006-08-28T15:35:00.000Z	lupine_85		presumably then, it's using the defaults. There's a line you can add to the xorg.conf to set the refresh rate (forget what it is - try man xorg.cong)
2006-08-28T15:36:00.000Z	lupine_85		add it to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist - e.g. "blacklist bcm43xx"
2006-08-28T15:36:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	horizsync & vertrefresh - there's caps somewhere
2006-09-11T15:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	as you seem to be able to run grub, get a grub prompt , then 'find /boot/grub/menu.lst'

2006-09-11T15:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	you can set the grub params manually & you should be able to get the box back up
2006-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	I'm so glad :D
2006-12-20T11:47:00.000Z	lupine_85	frogzoo	since when?
2006-12-20T11:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	since they know to try 'root' as an account name
2006-12-20T11:47:00.000Z	lupine_85	frogzoo	Since when did anyone with any sense enable logging in remotely as root?
2006-12-20T11:48:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	easiest to just leave it disable & require sudo
2006-12-20T11:48:00.000Z	lupine_85	frogzoo	even when sudo is inadequate? :p
2006-12-20T11:49:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	what can't you do with sudo that you need root access for?
2006-12-22T17:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	lupine_85	what is this, trivial pursuit?
2006-12-22T17:33:00.000Z	lupine_85	frogzoo	yeah, if you like
