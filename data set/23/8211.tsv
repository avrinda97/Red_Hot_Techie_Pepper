2004-11-30T13:34:00.000Z	f00fbug		maybe ill reinstall.. whatelse can you do with binary packages.. sigh
2004-11-30T13:35:00.000Z	f00fbug		its odd though
2004-11-30T13:35:00.000Z	f00fbug		it used to work until i messed up the profiles stuff
2004-11-30T13:36:00.000Z	f00fbug		then i tried to fix it and it started segfaulting :/
2004-11-30T13:36:00.000Z	f00fbug		now we are "loading the extensions datasource" from t=0 to inf
2004-11-30T13:37:00.000Z	Gwildor_	f00fbug	yeah, maye just try to re-install, so you can have default setting , and start over
