2007-05-23T05:14:00.000Z	DanR		hey
2007-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	DanR		im having majour issues with ubuntu permissions with writing to every folder except in the /home directory
2007-05-23T05:17:00.000Z	DanR		can anyone help with permissions?
2007-05-23T05:19:00.000Z	DanR		im trying to get the /opt folder to allow permissions, but even in root or in terminal su and chmod 666 it will not allow me to write, anyone have any ideas?
2007-05-23T05:20:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	How have you got it mounted, and what type of file system is it?
2007-05-23T05:21:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	I don't suppose you've got that file sytstem mounted read only?
2007-05-23T05:28:00.000Z	DanR	RAOF	file system is set to read only, can i change this with out a reinstall?
2007-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	How do you know it's set to read only?  Is it set to read only in /etc/fstab?
2007-05-23T05:31:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	But I thought you *could* write files to it with the terminal, yes?
2007-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Ok, so it's not that it's mounted read-only (since you can write to it :))
2007-05-23T05:35:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Incidentally, why do you want to be able to write to opt?
2007-05-23T05:35:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Why does xampp require you to be able to write to /opt (it shouldn't)
2007-05-23T05:37:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Right.  So, what *is* xampp, and can you pastebing the errors it spits out?
2007-05-23T05:41:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Ok, cool.  So, waht are the actual errors (pastebin *everything*) you get when you run, say "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start"?
2007-05-23T05:41:00.000Z	DanR	RAOF	that command does work
2007-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Ok, so pastebin the errors for something that doesn't :)
2007-05-23T05:44:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Ok.
2007-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	DanR	RAOF	here is the link - http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j201/Xtremewalker/Screenshot.png
2007-05-23T05:49:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Why are you trying to create a new folder there, again?
2007-05-23T05:51:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Yes, I know.  You don't have permissions.  But *why* are you tring to write stuff there?
2007-05-23T05:53:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Well, you can run "gksudo nautilus" in order to get a file manager with root permissions.
2007-05-23T05:53:00.000Z	RAOF	DanR	Or you could "sudo rm -r /opt/xampp" from a terminal, or whatever.
2007-05-23T05:55:00.000Z	DanR	RAOF	THANKS! worked first time, cheers again!
