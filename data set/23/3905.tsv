2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	MdL054		Sorry... didn't work :(  no change in result
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Damn!
2008-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	In theory yeah.
2008-01-11T09:03:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	I use ich6 and ich7
2008-01-11T09:04:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Yeah that would be pretty inconvenient. You could always bug intel?
2008-01-11T09:04:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Theyve got pretty good linux support, at least network wise. :p
2008-01-11T09:05:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	I dunno mate. :(
2008-01-11T09:06:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	I am seeing lots of google hits for your hardware and kernel 2.6.20; might be something useful buried there. Though all ive seen so far is more dma suggestions.
2008-01-11T09:07:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	hmm, someone hard-disky has to know about that if its been affecting kernels for so long.
2008-01-11T09:09:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Yeah, if its not just freezing at the "waiting for root fs" screen you usually see when you have no drivers for root=thing.
2008-01-11T09:09:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Then youve got something new. You tried mounting it manually in busybox?
2008-01-11T09:10:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Its got a fair amount of tools
2008-01-11T09:10:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	well sometimes it does at least.
2008-01-11T09:10:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	its just miniature sh, may even have tab completion.
2008-01-11T09:11:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	I use it for embedded systems instead of a normal system; its pretty slick.
2008-01-11T09:12:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	nope, but if you can mount it I'd be really confused. :D
2008-01-11T09:12:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Mgiht give you a better error.
2008-01-11T09:12:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	if its mounted you can sorta boot with a chroot call.
2008-01-11T09:13:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	chroot /mnt /sbin/init
2008-01-11T09:13:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	I'll be around
2008-01-11T09:37:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Alright then.
2008-01-11T09:37:00.000Z	Redf1sh	MdL054	Not to me yet.
2008-01-11T09:39:00.000Z	MdL054	Redf1sh	I'm going to try this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/104581/comments/25
