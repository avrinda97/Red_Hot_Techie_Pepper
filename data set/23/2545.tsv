2009-01-31T19:32:00.000Z	jared1		I was trying to install JRE so I could load OpenOffice templates and run java in Firefox -- and, without really knowing what I was doing, I blindly googled around some of the forums trying different things.  Long story short, now, I have no root access in terminal and when I try to access the Synaptic Package Manager, I receive this message: "E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2009-01-31T19:32:00.000Z	jared1		E: _cache->open() failed, please report."  Anybody?

2009-01-31T19:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jared1	Sounds like you added some repos to your list..
2009-01-31T19:55:00.000Z	jared1	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not sure what that means.
2009-01-31T20:11:00.000Z	jared1	Jack_Sparrow	am I doing something wrong WRT installing openoffice.org-java-common?  I googled and pulled the package off of packages.ubuntu.com.
2009-01-31T20:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jared1	Are you trying to get a newer version that from the repo for your release?
2009-01-31T20:16:00.000Z	jared1	Jack_Sparrow	after fresh installing Ubuntu 8.10 (last week), there was no java in the release.  I run OO and under tools, no JRE.  So that's where I'm at, essentially.
2009-01-31T20:23:00.000Z	jared1	Jack_Sparrow	-- I'm back.  Package Installer error "Dependency is not satisfiable: libjaxp 1.2-java"
