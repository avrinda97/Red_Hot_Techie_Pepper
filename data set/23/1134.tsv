2010-09-15T17:44:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		What frustrates me about X is they keep moving the location of the xorg.conf file in Ubuntu Linux, it's not in /etc/X11 now it's in /usr/lib/X11
2010-09-15T17:45:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		I have this file  xorg.conf.d  in my /usr/lib/X11 I dont know what it does
2010-09-15T17:46:00.000Z	philinux	Quantum_Ion	thats a directory
2010-09-15T17:46:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	okay
2010-09-15T17:47:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	When I look in the directory cd /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/ this is what I have now 05-evdev.conf  10-synaptics.conf  10-vmmouse.conf  10-wacom.conf
2010-09-15T17:48:00.000Z	philinux	Quantum_Ion	same here. No worries
2010-09-15T17:48:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	What happened to the old xorg.conf file ?
2010-09-15T17:49:00.000Z	philinux	Quantum_Ion	still in same place. But you might not have one at all.
2010-09-15T17:50:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	I used to use the Linux generated version of an xorg.conf file to use it on FreeBSD but I cannot do that anymore for my computer
2010-09-15T17:51:00.000Z	philinux	Quantum_Ion	just create one
2010-09-15T17:51:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	Ubuntu Linux uses something different to produce an X configuration file for all computers
2010-09-15T17:52:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	I ran X -configure on FreeBSD and the screen doesnt pop up like in Ubuntu Linux
2010-09-15T17:53:00.000Z	philinux	Quantum_Ion	does this help. http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-config.html

2010-09-15T17:55:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	philinux	They keep moving the X Configuration files around in Ubuntu Linux Files ending in *.conf in the /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory (NOTE: will be changed to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d for 10.10
2010-09-15T17:58:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		sipherdee, yes now I have to piece all the files in /usr/lib/xorg.conf.d into one xorg.conf file for FreeBSD to use X on my machine
