2009-11-03T21:38:00.000Z	hipy		lol
2009-11-03T21:40:00.000Z	hipy		bro it works just fine. What should be wrong with it?. Windows runs fine. i did diskchekcs wich didnt return errors
2009-11-03T21:42:00.000Z	philh	hipy	did you check that the iso you downloaded wasn't truncated in any way?
2009-11-03T21:43:00.000Z	hipy	philh	I didnt, I dont realy know how a shashum ( or something? ) to check that
2009-11-03T21:43:00.000Z	philh		!md5
2009-11-03T21:43:00.000Z	philh	hipy	^
2009-11-03T21:46:00.000Z	hipy	philh	I download from ubuntu site and the iso already worked on a virtual machine so is there still chance it could be corrupted?
2009-11-03T21:47:00.000Z	philh	hipy	possibly, but unlikely, have you tried the check disc option when you boot from the cd
2009-11-03T21:48:00.000Z	hipy	philh	yes it said there was an error. But i dont realy trust this since i got this problem on 3 pcs all saying it had bad sectors etc.
2009-11-03T21:48:00.000Z	philh	hipy	what are you checking, the CD or the HD?
2009-11-03T21:49:00.000Z	philh		if it's the CD, and you're checking the same CD on 3 machines and getting the same error, i'd say that's pretty conclusive
2009-11-03T21:49:00.000Z	hipy	philh	i pressed check disk. and then it said checking please wait and then it said an error was found
2009-11-03T21:49:00.000Z	philh	hipy	burn a fresh CD
2009-11-03T21:50:00.000Z	hipy	philh	already did
2009-11-03T21:50:00.000Z	philh	hipy	do it sanely and with slow burn speeds
2009-11-03T21:50:00.000Z	philh	hipy	exactly the same error when checking that one?
2009-11-03T21:50:00.000Z	hipy	philh	i didnt check that but all the bugs i experienced with the new cd were the same as the old cd.
2009-11-03T21:51:00.000Z	philh	hipy	then check it
2009-11-03T21:51:00.000Z	philh		and md5sum the iso, just to make sure
2009-11-03T21:51:00.000Z	hipy	philh	the md5sum returns on a match
