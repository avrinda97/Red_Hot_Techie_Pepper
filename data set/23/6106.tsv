2007-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	you want to upgrade from one version of ubuntu to another?
2008-11-09T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	see the comments in /etc/sudoers
2008-11-09T02:26:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	http://irssi.org/documentation/tips
2008-11-09T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	compiz is a window manager.  irssi is run from a terminal.  no idea what luvcview is
2009-06-17T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	tar cf foo.tar file1 file2 ...
2009-06-17T03:08:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	you probably want to pass z too to compress it?
2009-06-17T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	man page should say what switch to use to append
2009-06-17T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	there you go
2009-06-17T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	you probably don't want c.  And you can't have it compressed if you are appending iirc
2009-06-17T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	j2daosh	you can compress with gzip at the end of course
