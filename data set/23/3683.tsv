2008-03-12T23:40:00.000Z	reikalusikka		I removed kde and some libraries accidently, how do I get those libraries back?
2008-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	 sudo apt-get kde* ?
2008-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	sorry, sudo apt-get install kde*
2008-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	But I don't want to install kde
2008-03-12T23:42:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	what are you trying to do, I misunderstood then
2008-03-12T23:43:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	Some applications don't work now after I removed kde, they worked fine before installing kde
2008-03-12T23:43:00.000Z	reikalusikka		some web applications
2008-03-12T23:43:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	ok sudo apt-get build-dep name of package
2008-03-12T23:44:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	you most have dumped some libs you needed
2008-03-12T23:44:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	Yeah, but I don't know what I need
2008-03-12T23:44:00.000Z	reikalusikka		that's the problem
2008-03-12T23:45:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	it should tell you
2008-03-12T23:45:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	oh ok

2008-03-12T23:47:00.000Z	reikalusikka		E: Failed to process build dependencies
2008-03-12T23:47:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	ok, seems high, but you may have removed some key libraries while removing kde
2008-03-12T23:48:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	Might have, what should I do?
2008-03-12T23:48:00.000Z	zedster	reikalusikka	hit yes and install the 75 files
2008-03-12T23:49:00.000Z	reikalusikka	zedster	I can't that's the problem
