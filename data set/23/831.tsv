2011-01-19T06:04:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	and what is the goal? for why?
2011-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Depending on how you boot.  Boot it one way, and you can add packages, boot it another way, and you are safe from permanent changes made to the system.
2011-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	you should only be able to add files and remove only the files you added. I'm not 100% on this. But there will always be a recoverable trace.
2011-01-19T06:07:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	is the gaol to navigate the drive?
2011-01-19T06:08:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	The goal is to customize a thumb drive, and then be able to take it out "in the field" and boot the Thumb Drive read only and (ignore the hard drive).  This way if the system is compromised it is not permanent, and there isn't any trace of being there on the host computer (2 goals).
2011-01-19T06:09:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	so here is what you do disable the drive in the bios :p
2011-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	not an option (at least, not always)
2011-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	My understanding is that ubuntu will use the swap partition on the hard drive (if it finds one)
2011-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	It will also try to mount any drives that it finds.
2011-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Not cool
2011-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	For this application anyway
2011-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Am I wrong in assuming that ubuntu will try to use the swap on the hard drive?
2011-01-19T06:13:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	if its disabled in Bios
2011-01-19T06:13:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	I don't have access to BIOS in each case (or at least I can't assume that)
2011-01-19T06:14:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	sure you can
2011-01-19T06:14:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Ahh, wouldn't that be nice.  If I could assume that, I wouldn't be having this fine chat with you ;-)
2011-01-19T06:15:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	ither there is a battery, or a jumper on the motherboard.
2011-01-19T06:16:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Ripping off the cover of a computer isn't an option in these situations.  But thanks for trying
2011-01-19T06:18:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	would you take a look at my query's?
2011-01-19T06:19:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	Uhh, sure?
2011-01-19T06:19:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	there pm's private messages
2011-01-19T06:19:00.000Z	meway	ThOr101	you don't see them?
2011-01-19T06:20:00.000Z	ThOr101	meway	I'm using a new irc client, let me go find the server / messages window
