2006-09-30T11:10:00.000Z	shriphani		convert it to flac and then to m4a
2006-09-30T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	uh... but why?
2006-09-30T11:12:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	what variant said. FLAC, for all intent and purposes, can be considered as "no compression", since it doesn't alter the original bits. so it's just the same as piping the output of an MP3 decoder into the input of an OGG (or whatever) encoder, which *will* lose quality
2006-09-30T11:22:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	nope
2006-09-30T11:23:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	^^ (wrong nickname)
2006-09-30T11:23:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	on Ubuntu you mean?
2006-09-30T11:23:00.000Z	shriphani	LjL	yeah
2006-09-30T11:24:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	well, yes, you can try. but for that matter, you can try installing RPMs too (there's a tool for that), and .deb files on their turn are simple AR archives with some standard file structure.  however, it won't necessarily work, since you might have incompatible versions of some libraries on your system, or whatever...
2006-09-30T11:24:00.000Z	shriphani	LjL	you mean alien ?
2006-09-30T11:24:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	oh, note that the slackware tarballs are *not* source, but binary (generally)
2006-09-30T11:24:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	yes i mean alien
2006-09-30T11:25:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	(then i suppose slackware would have source-packages, just like debian has... but i don't really know)
2006-09-30T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	you need to use the "-f" option for tar to read stuff from a given file
2006-09-30T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	otherwise it'll just read from standard input
2006-09-30T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	if you want to extract a file and be verbose, yeah
2006-12-01T09:37:00.000Z	shriphani	LjL	thanks :)
2006-12-01T09:39:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	http://packages.ubuntu.com will probably be better for searching anyway
2006-12-01T09:39:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	vector graphics programs i know of are Inkscape, Sodipodi (Gnome), Karbon (KDE)
2006-12-01T09:41:00.000Z	shriphani	LjL	could you tell me why skype causes my box to hang ?
2006-12-01T09:41:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	never used it
2006-12-29T10:15:00.000Z	shriphani	LjL	i didnt see that in source o matic
2006-12-29T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	well, yeah, it misses -updates too for that matter. i think that should be fixed
2006-12-29T10:17:00.000Z	LjL	shriphani	well   deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy-security main restricted universe multiverse
