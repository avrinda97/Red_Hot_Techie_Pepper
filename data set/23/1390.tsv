2010-07-06T21:57:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	no coments nor notes in so you are on you on
2010-07-06T21:58:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	just an  advice, you might wanna comment out the modeline, they are specific to the size of the screen so my 12' inch ibook might not be having the same modeline as you X' inch creen
2010-07-06T21:58:00.000Z	tomatto_	nmvictor	do you know what driver is for intel gma950 for write it to xorg.conf?
2010-07-06T21:58:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	just use at
2010-07-06T21:58:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	but google to be sure
2010-07-06T22:00:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	said ati coz its a commin driver for most cards, do lspci } grep VGA , if you see anything like ati technologies then use ati, else {google(driver for ur card}
2010-07-06T22:01:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	lspci | grep VGA
2010-07-06T22:03:00.000Z	tomatto_	nmvictor	 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GME Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2010-07-06T22:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	well you had better found you driver through google or ask in this channel, the rest of the setting might work though, are you using lucid lynx?
2010-07-06T22:05:00.000Z	tomatto_	nmvictor	yes, lucid lynx
2010-07-06T22:08:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	lucid does not much require an xorg.conf unless its really needed like you case and my ibooks case
2010-07-06T22:09:00.000Z	nmvictor	tomatto_	lucid does not much require an xorg.conf unless its really needed like you case and my ibooks case, how about google?
