2004-11-16T09:18:00.000Z	jbiscont		yes it works
2004-11-16T09:18:00.000Z	jbiscont		but u must do few steps before use java directly from bash
2004-11-16T09:19:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	i am even failling on installing, how did you do it?
2004-11-16T09:19:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	I just sh *.bin
2004-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	what is the error message
2004-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	i tried chmod a+x jdk*; sudo ./jdk* ... well trying again...
2004-11-16T09:21:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	but the execution with the .bon worked wekk?
2004-11-16T09:23:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	nope, that was the problem. I tried the 1.5 too and get the same error:
2004-11-16T09:23:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	./jdk-1_5_0-linux-i586.bin: line 336: ./install.sfx.5220: cannot execute binary file
2004-11-16T09:26:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	try to write sh on the terminal
2004-11-16T09:26:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	just sh??
2004-11-16T09:26:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	yes to see if you can execute binary files from sh
2004-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	k, got sh (bash?!) shell
2004-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	no error
2004-11-16T09:28:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	ah, so are you sure you had downloaded the right .bin, I mean did you try to re-download it?
2004-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	I took the NOT rpm file
2004-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	if you want to try with an rpm it's (almost) the same if you want to make java prog
2004-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	ok, i'll try the rpm file then, how do I go about installing that, same thing just: sh *.bin?
2004-11-16T09:33:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	downloaded the file several times since I thought the binary might be corrupt
2004-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	sorry, but you must fix the problem by yourself
2004-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	cause I can't see how this happend
2004-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	jbiscont	yann__	sorry
2004-11-16T09:39:00.000Z	yann__	jbiscont	thx anyways
