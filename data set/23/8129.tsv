2005-01-14T14:57:00.000Z	bwb		hey..
2005-01-14T14:57:00.000Z	bwb		i updated to x.org from hoary... updated all x11 related version 4.3 packages to x.org's packages..
2005-01-14T14:57:00.000Z	bwb		but now whenever I use glxgears (or any other opengl program) the screen freezes
2005-01-14T14:57:00.000Z	bwb		any ideas?
2005-01-14T14:58:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	if you're running hoary, you need to check bugzilla
2005-01-14T14:58:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	only upgraded specific packages
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	what base are you running on then, warty?
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	still running mostly warty packages
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	yah
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	actually I first just upgraded the server to x.org's and everything worked fine
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	please check bugzilla for it
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	but then I decided to upgrade to x.org's libs and that's when it happened
2005-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	k, where is it at?
2005-01-14T15:00:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	linked from the ubuntu home page, of course :)
2005-01-14T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	I would say it's not unless you're comfortable debugging things
2005-01-14T15:06:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	yeah hmm..
2005-01-14T15:06:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	thinking it might be better if I just upgraded to hoary, and see if it still freezes
2005-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	btw I manually downgraded xlibmesa to 4.3.0 and no more freezing.. and yes I did file a bugzilla report
2005-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	err...
2005-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	what did you file?
2005-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	Hrm prolly not as specific as I should have been, but that when those files were upgraded X freezes
2005-03-23T15:46:00.000Z	crimsun	bwb	using what KDE app?
2005-03-23T15:47:00.000Z	bwb	crimsun	juk
