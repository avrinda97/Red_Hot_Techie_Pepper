2008-09-10T03:37:00.000Z	strategy		ah cool
2008-09-10T03:38:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	is this when you scroll with PgDown?
2008-09-10T03:39:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	that may be a workaround, then
2008-09-10T03:40:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	I can't seem to reproduce your problem here
2008-09-10T03:40:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	hm, even when you scroll really fast, a bunch of times?
2008-09-10T03:41:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	hm. it could also be a much larger problem, with my input device. that could be catastrophic..
2008-09-10T03:41:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	even when I hold the arrow keys to repeat
2008-09-10T03:41:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	hm! did the same thing in xchat, just much more mildly
2008-09-10T04:43:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	no, that's a fairly typical value on modern machines
2008-09-10T04:36:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	it should be reported somewhere in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-09-10T04:37:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	uhh, it's a pretty big file- searches for "ram" come up with nothing useful, do you know by chance any info about what its called or anything?
2008-09-10T04:37:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	sec
2008-09-10T04:37:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	oh, it's case sensitive *facepalm*
2008-09-10T04:37:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	thanks :)
2008-09-10T04:41:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	use 'less -i' or 'grep -i' for case-insensitive searching
2008-09-10T04:41:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	okay :)
2008-09-10T04:42:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	sorry to be such a massive bother, it says i have 131072KB of VideoRam.. isnt that somewhere around 131MB!!? I thought around 8MB was normal..
2008-09-10T04:43:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	wow.
2008-09-10T04:43:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	not that it's very useful, except in games, where videoram can be used to store textures for fast retrieval
2008-09-10T04:44:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	ah, ok. Someone said that low videoram could be causing my "queue"ing problem
2008-09-12T04:27:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	ty :p
2008-09-12T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	strategy	it must be possible. Someone has created all those themes, after all
2008-09-12T05:48:00.000Z	strategy	soundray	:p
