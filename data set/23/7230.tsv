2011-09-26T18:55:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	what was the command you used?
2011-09-26T18:56:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	alsa fouce-reload | pastebinit
2011-09-26T18:56:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	It says "see dmesg"
2011-09-26T18:57:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	ls /lib/modules/2.6.38-11-generic-pae/kernel/sound/pci/hda/snd-hda-intel.ko
2011-09-26T18:59:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	What did  ls /lib/modules/2.6.38-11-generic-pae/kernel/sound/pci/hda/snd-hda-intel.ko  say?
2011-09-26T18:59:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	So you are sure the file does in fact exist?  (Yes.  No.)
2011-09-26T19:00:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	dmesg | pastebinit
2011-09-26T19:01:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	 ls /lib/modules/2.6.38-11-generic-pae/kernel/sound/pci/hda/snd-hda-intel.ko | pastebinit
2011-09-26T19:03:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Maybe you should start by telling us why you are needing to do:   alsa force-reload
2011-09-26T19:04:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Ok it says SOMETHING then.  (It reports to you the file and it's path, therefore confirming to you that the file does, indeed, exist.)
2011-09-26T19:05:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Did you first run alsamixer to see if channels are turned down or muted?
2011-09-26T19:05:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	No M or MM  at bottom of collums?
2011-09-26T19:06:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	You reinstalled the OS?
2011-09-26T19:06:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Did you see your sound card's ID properly identified in the alsamixer window?
2011-09-26T19:07:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	 Do this:   cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp
2011-09-26T19:08:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	It should say  Card: Intel  on the first line and then  Chip: Realtek  on the second line. (In alsamixer window)
2011-09-26T19:09:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Open a terminal and run alsamixer
2011-09-26T19:09:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Do you see the sound card properly identified in upper left corner?
2011-09-26T19:10:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	If not, hit F6
2011-09-26T19:13:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	What do you mean it is only coming from the subwoofer?
2011-09-26T19:13:00.000Z	usr13	xbuntu	Oh well, I don't know.... but sorry, my time is up.  I must go.
