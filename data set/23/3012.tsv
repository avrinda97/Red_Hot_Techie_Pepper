2008-08-31T00:54:00.000Z	John0Neil		Why did I have less workspace on Ubuntu than I have at the same resolution with XP?
2008-08-31T00:55:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	Are you sure the resolution is the same?
2008-08-31T00:55:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	yes
2008-08-31T00:56:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	maybe I need the nvidia propeitary driver?
2008-08-31T00:56:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	That's what I'm using. If the resolutions are identical, there is the same amount of room.
2008-08-31T00:57:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	I will try with nvidia driver installed :) ty
2008-08-31T00:57:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	You might, as vyr said, have more than one toolbar or something that is taking up room.
2008-08-31T01:22:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	I'm not sure why a nvidia driver would disable your internet, I suspect something else happened.
2008-08-31T01:23:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	When I think to this, I have also installed XChat, maybe it have changed something. I will try to desinstall it
2008-08-31T01:24:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	Did you try looking at your network settings after the net didn't work?
2008-08-31T01:25:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	yes. manual setup don't change anything
2008-08-31T01:27:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	- wols_ : I will try to restart it, just find the command. Maybe it will correct the problem
2008-08-31T01:27:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	If the net settings are still the same, the nvidia driver or xchat didn't do anything. I would suggest a few internet specific checks, such as making the ethernet cable is plugged in, etc, unless it is dual boot with XP.
2008-08-31T01:28:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	Restarting is a good place to start.
2008-08-31T03:23:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	I meant to ask you this earlier, but how are you comparing sizes?
2008-08-31T03:24:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	number of item fitting in screen. simple as that. icons are bigger, I have less bookmarks for a given space in firefox, etc
2008-08-31T03:27:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	 Did you ever get your internet working again? Twinity may be right, it might be an incorrect DPI setting.
2008-08-31T03:28:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	yes the network is ok now. I have set off HPTE and Memory protection off in bios. I'm not sure if it is related. I will take a look at DPI
2008-08-31T03:40:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	I have changed the font size by 2 point to arrive to something equivalent. that's crazy to waste so much space by default
2008-08-31T03:42:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	So is the font equivalent to that in XP? I just messed with mine for the first time in a while and like the extra space I get.
2008-08-31T03:42:00.000Z	outbriber	John0Neil	But I'm running at 3200x1050 so it doesn't make so much difference for me.
2008-08-31T03:43:00.000Z	John0Neil	outbriber	ok. I don't know for sure about the font equivalent with XP. It's working and I'm happy with it :P. ty
