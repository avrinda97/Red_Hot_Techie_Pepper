2010-06-25T14:34:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	Need help building a deb from a svn trunk
2010-06-25T14:35:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	ah does it have build instructions, what errors do you get, what exactly are you doing
2010-06-25T14:37:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	theres no instructions to build a deb only to compile, compile runs ok but building deb i cannot various instructions alwys reqire a step and doesnt explain how to by a example
2010-06-25T14:37:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	with firefox deb, I put it to /usr/local/, then just ran the main file, might be same here
2010-06-25T14:38:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	get a reply from another user though, a second opinion
2010-06-25T14:38:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	I dont think placing a deb in /usr/local resolves my problem
2010-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	have to acually build the deb first
2010-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	and Building a deb is the actual problem as I idk how to all steps
2010-06-25T14:43:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	do you know how to build a deb from any svn trunk?
2010-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	HI?

2010-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	do you know how to build a deb from any svn trunk?
2010-06-25T14:49:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	1) download it from svn 2) extract to usr/lib/ 3) run it --- this is how I did with firefox deb - no guarantee that it can work for any deb though
2010-06-25T14:50:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	this svn trunk doesnt work like that
2010-06-25T14:50:00.000Z	X3	Gryllida	its xbmc svn trunk
2010-06-25T14:53:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	you have to download it first anyway, maybe try #svn
2010-06-25T14:55:00.000Z	Gryllida	X3	IDK, man make, extract it first, but if it doesn't have build instructions then it
