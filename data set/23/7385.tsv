2007-12-31T16:44:00.000Z	larson9999		so how do figure how much swap to make?  when i got 2gb ram i used 2gb swap.  on my 4 gb machine i have no swap.  but i have sooooo much disk space on that machine i wouldn't miss it.  but i just don't how to figure how much swap i need
2007-12-31T16:45:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	256MB of swap will do with 2GB+.
2007-12-31T16:45:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	and how did you get to that number?
2007-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	well, it's a nice power of two and probably still too much, but...
2007-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	the point is, you need *some*
2007-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	it depends entirely on what you do
2007-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	with laptops, you'll want at least the amount of RAM though.
2007-12-31T16:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	you can always add more swap later, though.
2007-12-31T16:48:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	well not having a method to determine the amount you need makes it kinda hard to determine how much to make.  and if us vets can't come up with anything better than what we've listed hear, how do you expect a noob not to  use a rule that's not good but at least is a rule?
2007-12-31T16:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	there is no "rule" in the first place.
2007-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	that's a problem, but it's something we can't really solve.
2007-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	the only rule is that you usually need *some* swap
2007-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	oh sure there is.  google how much swap do i need and you'll find lots of 'twice your ram is a good rule of thumb'
2007-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	but it's not
2007-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	i know cause i've been googling that for 10 years :)
2007-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	and my point is that a noob looking for the answer to how much swap do i need will see that and make double his ram.  i'd say it's a better rule for noobs than depends on what you do :)
2007-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	well, I suppose the noobs won't care about a gigabyte or two of wasted space
2007-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	IMO, though, they should just go with what the ubuntu installer tells them
2007-12-31T16:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	all this would be solved if ubuntu used dynamic swap like OS X, though.
2007-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	OS X creates more swap files as needed,
2007-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	larson9999	Chousuke	yeah.  i think some day linux will use dynamic swap.
2007-12-31T16:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	larson9999	it could do that already. someone just needs to write the swap-allocator daemon
