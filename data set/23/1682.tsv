2010-02-17T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Greendance: right click panel -> add item
2010-02-17T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!hcl
2010-02-17T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xjkx: the realtek may have compilable drivers for the chip
2010-02-17T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Greendance: could make a folder with the items in then add a folder view item to the bar with the folder as the viewed folder
2010-02-17T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xjkx: then grab a mildly old intel or atheros based one. Works great. Hcl will help you lots
2010-02-17T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Lostinspace_the disk won't be bootable if you burn it as files
2010-02-17T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Lostinspace_46: you can remaster the iso to customise it though
2010-02-17T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Kavinorium: what model aspire one?
2010-02-17T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Kavinorium: have you looked for guides based on the 532h?
2010-02-17T23:54:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	I had thought about that, but I am not sure how to do it.
2010-02-17T23:56:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	Do you have a link to that guide?
2010-02-18T12:47:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	Could I go online from the O/S?
2010-02-18T12:51:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	Not sure how to phrase this. How do I get control of the O/S? For instance, just opening folders I get a ton of "no permissions" messages.
2010-02-18T12:53:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	My home folder is one I believe
2010-02-18T12:54:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	Don't really understand your question
2010-02-18T12:55:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	Ahh home on internal drive
2010-02-18T12:56:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	I mispoke.../home/daniel
2010-02-18T13:00:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	ubuntu@ubuntu# gksudo nautilus /path/to file?
2010-02-18T13:05:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	That wont work. I have Broadcom wireless card
2010-02-18T13:10:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	The internet on the CD.Need to use ndiswrapper, my Win wlan drivers, blacklist 2 files, and run initramfs, then reboot to have wireless to work.
2010-02-18T13:13:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	That would entail changing the ISO on the CD, would it not?  And I thought you couldn't do that.
2010-02-18T13:32:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	ActionParsnip	 Jordan_U I type to slow to keep up..lol.  Umm why would b43 work in live env if it won't work in the O/S, and I pretty sure it won't. Had a hell of a time going wireless when I first got ubuntu.
