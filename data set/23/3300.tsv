2008-08-16T03:12:00.000Z	favro	perillux	shouldn't matter
2008-08-16T03:15:00.000Z	perillux	favro	Mecha25: I get this error in the log file "/home/jason/temp/radeon/radeon-20060403-linux.i386/drm/linux-core/drmP.h:44:26: error: linux/config.h: No such file or directory"

2008-08-16T03:21:00.000Z	favro	perillux	did you run install.sh again?
2008-08-16T03:23:00.000Z	perillux	favro	yes
2008-08-16T03:24:00.000Z	perillux	favro	so the log file said the file "linux/config.h" doesn't exist.  I went there, and I don't have it, but I DO have "linux/Config.in"
2008-08-16T03:25:00.000Z	perillux	favro	I've been looking up these files and I keep seeing things saying that "it's supposed to turn config.in into config.h
2008-08-16T03:25:00.000Z	favro	perillux	is there a readme which tells you how to uninstall it? - you might have to do that then run install.sh again

2008-08-16T03:33:00.000Z	perillux	favro	I do have a working driver.  It's just this one should improve performance.
2008-08-16T03:34:00.000Z	perillux	favro	it's ok...  Thanks for all your help.
