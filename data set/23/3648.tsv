2008-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	Gnea	hischild	i like my method better: open a terminal, issue a killall -9 firefox-bin
2008-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	hischild	Gnea	then it'll open the page again when he opens it up
2008-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	hischild	not if he presses up-arrow and enter really fast, one right after the other, after making sure that the terminal remains on top of all other applications
