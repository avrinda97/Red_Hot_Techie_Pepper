2006-11-22T13:51:00.000Z	afd_		hi! If I have a RAID array (2 drives) and the bios software didn't recognize one of the drives as part of the array, asked me if I wanted to include it, not wants to rebuild the array, do I lose the data as a result of rebuilding the array?
2006-11-22T13:52:00.000Z	iter	afd_	very likely
2006-11-22T13:52:00.000Z	iter	afd_	can you still see the array in windows?
2006-11-22T13:53:00.000Z	iter	afd_	is there data on the drives you can't lose
2006-11-22T13:53:00.000Z	afd_	iter	yes, I'd rather not lose the data
2006-11-22T13:54:00.000Z	iter	afd_	so you had this array setup in ubuntu previously right
2006-11-22T13:54:00.000Z	afd_	iter	yes
2006-11-22T13:55:00.000Z	iter	afd_	did you set the array up with mdadm or via bios
2006-11-22T13:55:00.000Z	afd_	iter	I haven't had it setup as anything in Ubuntu
2006-11-22T13:55:00.000Z	iter	afd_	so how is there data on it?
2006-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	afd_	iter	in ubuntu it appears as a single drive
2006-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	iter	afd_	ok so previously, you set it up in the bios, then installed to /dev/sdd
2006-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	iter	afd_	which is an array that appears to ubuntu as one drive
2006-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	iter	afd_	right?
2006-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	afd_	iter	exactly
2006-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	iter	afd_	then, what happened ?
2006-11-22T13:58:00.000Z	iter	afd_	right so you rebooted and now your bios is complaining that a drive is not part of the array?
2006-11-22T13:58:00.000Z	iter	afd_	if that's the case go ahead and tell the bios to rebuild the array
2006-11-22T13:58:00.000Z	afd_	iter	right. It asked me that drive 0 is not part of the array, and if I want to include it. I said yes, and then it said it wants to rebuild the array
2006-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	afd_	iter	what's gonna happen?
2006-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	iter	afd_	yep, rebuild it
2006-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	iter	afd_	it's going to sync disk 0 with disk 1
2006-11-22T13:59:00.000Z	iter	afd_	might take awhile, depending on size
