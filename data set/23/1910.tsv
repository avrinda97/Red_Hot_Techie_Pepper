2009-09-16T21:13:00.000Z	jeromel		but I think you cannot modifiy a pdf

2009-09-16T21:14:00.000Z	jeromel		but not with openoffice
2009-09-16T21:14:00.000Z	jeromel		that what I would say
2009-09-16T21:14:00.000Z	jeromel		someone for my resizing partition?
2009-09-16T21:16:00.000Z	jeromel		is it possible to resize all type of partition ?
2009-09-16T21:16:00.000Z	jeromel		I thought it is because it is a xfs partition
2009-09-16T21:17:00.000Z	jeromel		ok I want to grown of 18 Go
2009-09-16T21:17:00.000Z	jeromel		does the free space need to be after or before ?
2009-09-16T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 there may be some XFS tools package you need to install to let gparted have full features for xfs perhaps?
2009-09-16T21:18:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	 I don't know, I used the gparted tool on a USB boot device
2009-09-16T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 it proberly doswetn have the xfs tools installed by default
2009-09-16T21:19:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	 oki I succeed to move the partition
2009-09-16T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 also i recall there can be issues if the 'unallocated' space you are growing the filesystem into.. is not on the same partition 'type' (ie primary vs logical) you can get into issues
2009-09-16T21:48:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	 I cannot resize it even if I install xfsprogs
2009-09-16T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 is the empty space  inside a extended partition? or outside. alongside the primary parittions?
2009-09-16T21:52:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	I have 4primary paritions and  an empty space
2009-09-16T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 thats how i parititon also. Could be some quirk/limits with usign xfs. there may be some guides on resiuzing xfs maniually
2009-09-16T21:55:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	so Can I create a partition and change the mounting point ?
2009-09-16T22:05:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	I just saw that i can use xfs_growfs, can you explain me how to use it?
2009-09-16T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jeromel	 not a clue. i never yuse xfs
2009-09-16T22:48:00.000Z	jeromel	Dr_Willis	 I understood how to make with xfs_growfs, but the it is not possible ! It says to me that the actual size is the maximal size ='(((
