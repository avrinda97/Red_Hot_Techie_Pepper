2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	eilker: I have resized windows partitions before, using parted and even fdisk. Never had problems.
2006-11-24T17:22:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	sometimes it works.  but sometimes if fails.  i've seen both.
2006-11-24T17:22:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	eilker: make sure it'S defragmented first, and there's no data at the end of the partition. on next boot, windows will do a checkdisk. And yes, there'S no guarantee. Always make a backup.
2006-11-24T17:23:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	i agree.  you must be prepared for the loss and be pleasantly surprised if it works  :-)
2006-11-24T17:31:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	well, that requires quite a bit of knowledge and setup to do what he wants...
2006-11-24T17:32:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	apt-get install apache2; a2enmod userdir
2006-11-24T17:35:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	anyway... do you know anything abouit the new UUID based mounting mechanism in edgy? it misbehaves (doesn't mount vfat drives on boot).
2006-11-24T17:35:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	yes i've used uuid mounting for a while even before ubuntu used it
2006-11-24T17:36:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	uuid is just a feature of mount where you replace the device name with the uuid you which you can obtain with the blkid command
2006-11-24T17:37:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	well, when upgrading to edgy, it automatically converted all mounts in fstab to use uuids. it doesn't work as expected. I could just change it back, i guess, but i'd like to get some background...
2006-11-24T17:37:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	this way if you have multiple external usb drives for instance, they will always get mounted regardless of whether they show up as sda, sdb, sdc or whatever
2006-11-24T17:38:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	also, if i mount manually, the mount disappears when i close the session (which seems very strange to me). It kind of behaves like mounts for usp sticks - but it's a normal vfat partion, which should always be mounted.
2006-11-24T17:38:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	so, you are saying that the uuid-based mount is handy for removable drives, but doesn't make any difference for a build in device?
2006-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	i don't know, there's really weird stuff that goes on with ubuntu and automounting stuff, ignoring entries in fstab.  i actually can't figure it out
2006-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	yes
2006-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	grmbl. yea, thatS why i'm here, i guess.
2006-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	if the device names aren't going to change for your built in drives
2006-11-24T17:40:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	maybe on a server with multiple scsi bays or something where you'd add/remove disks then it could be a problem, but on a normal desktop its not
2006-11-24T17:41:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	i think devlabel is another way of handling the problem but i think a little more compllex.  uuid is nice because its simple and is already supported by mount
2006-11-24T17:44:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	thanks for the advice. devlabels have worked nicely for me in the past, and seem pretty streight forward.
2006-11-24T06:30:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	insmod nvidia failed because no module found
2006-11-24T06:31:00.000Z	oscar	Duesentrieb	if the module can't be insmoded then theres a more serious problem
2006-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	oscar	wrong version for the kernel, i guess...
