2007-12-09T12:46:00.000Z	PyChild		help X is frozen :(
2007-12-09T12:47:00.000Z	PyChild		im running ddrescue so i have my doubts about hard rebooting
2007-12-09T12:49:00.000Z	PyChild		so im basicaly here for three reasons, 1)knowung what damange i can get from hard rebooting while running ddrescue
2007-12-09T12:49:00.000Z	PyChild		2) asking why it frezzes up anyway
2007-12-09T12:49:00.000Z	PyChild		3) what else can i do when ctrl+alt+back fails?
2007-12-09T12:50:00.000Z	PyChild		the better is the 2nd one, why does it lock up anyway, linux should not do that!!!
2007-12-09T12:50:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	I guess it's locking up because the disk you're reading from is damaged - doesn't it eventually give up?
2007-12-09T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	I guess it won't cause any damage, if you're writing to a journalled fs
2007-12-09T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	did you try ctrl-alt-f1 and logging in there?
2007-12-09T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	(ctrl-alt-f7 or f8 or f9 to get back)
2007-12-09T12:53:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	sometimes I just have to hold the power button for 10 seconds 'til the laptop does a real power down.  it sometimes brands the power icon into my fingertip, 'cos it gets quite hot.  I guess that's another ubuntu bug I forgot - it doesn't scale the cpu frequencies down when idling
2007-12-09T12:53:00.000Z	PyChild	dooglus	doesn't scale the cpu frequencies down when idling <-- WOW explain futher please!!
2007-12-09T12:54:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	this laptop gets VERY hot, even if I leave it doing absolutely nothing for a few hours.
2007-12-09T12:54:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	if I do the same in Windows, the laptop cools down nicely
2007-12-09T12:54:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	I guess ubuntu should turn the speed of the cpus down or put them into a cooling idle loop or something, but it doesn't
2007-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	skype seems to be able to regularly crash x.org here
2007-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	PyChild	dooglus	that awful app, if it wasn't required by my employers...
2007-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	how do you video conference with vista users without skype?
2007-12-09T12:58:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	"man bash" and search for "ulimit" - that allows you to limit memory usage per process
2007-12-09T13:07:00.000Z	PyChild	dooglus	sorry im back, ok ill grep for ulimit
2007-12-09T13:07:00.000Z	PyChild	dooglus	so its hard reboot for me isn't it?
2007-12-09T13:08:00.000Z	dooglus	PyChild	"man bash" then type /ulimit and hit return to search the man page for ulimit
2007-12-09T13:09:00.000Z	PyChild	dooglus	iknow :P it was just an expression
