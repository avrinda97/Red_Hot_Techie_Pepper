2012-07-29T09:01:00.000Z	KillerFu		Hey guys I need some help with my audio.
2012-07-29T09:01:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	What's the issue? No sound?
2012-07-29T09:02:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	You tried this already? --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SurroundSound
2012-07-29T09:05:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Did you reboot after making changes?
2012-07-29T09:07:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Are you sure 6 is right?
2012-07-29T09:11:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Can't you change it in pavucontrol?
2012-07-29T09:11:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Configuration tab
2012-07-29T09:12:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Open a shell and type pavucontrol
2012-07-29T09:13:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Go to the button on the top left to search and search for terminal. That is what I mean by shell
2012-07-29T09:14:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	did you have a program called pavucontrol? The last tab entitled "Configuration" did not have drop down boxes?
2012-07-29T09:15:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Oh. So the drop down tab did not have an option for 5.1 ?
2012-07-29T09:16:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Try alsamixer maybe
2012-07-29T09:19:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	No clue. In alsamixer if I press F6 and pick my sound card it gives me the option for surround
2012-07-29T09:19:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Other than that I have no idea
2012-07-29T09:24:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	The semicolon means that the line is not read at all. It is invisible. So yeah you would
2012-07-29T09:24:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Same thing for --> #
2012-07-29T09:24:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	In most programs / scripts
2012-07-29T09:25:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	No problem. Hope it works for you
2012-07-29T09:47:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Still no good?
2012-07-29T09:47:00.000Z	KillerFu	bobo37773	Next question ubuntu won't shutdown correctly.  It hangs on the screen with dots underneath.
2012-07-29T09:47:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Someone else just asked this. Do you have multiple users on that system or just you?
2012-07-29T09:48:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	Ouch. Sounds pretty drastic. You could always just try a different distro if this one does not suit you
2012-07-29T09:52:00.000Z	bobo37773	KillerFu	This is not for Ubuntu. But maybe it can help you not sure --> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples
