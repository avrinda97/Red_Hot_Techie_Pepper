2008-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		new gutsy install / encrypted on a raid-five / 'error loading os'
2008-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		godmami - what's s/he doing that you're not?
2008-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		oh, well there's your problem goodmami - tell them to install the 4965
2008-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	I'm not sure why his computer loaded the ipw driver, since we did practically the same install
2008-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	it is installed... he's using the 2.6.22-14 kernel.  he can find it with locate
2008-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	how can he enable it?  I told him to try modprobe -r ipw3945 and modprobe iwl4965
2008-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	does the regular wireless ui allow you to choose a driver?  (going to check)
2008-01-23T10:52:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- i was thinking something like the restricted drivers manager
2008-01-23T10:53:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	we both have a Lenovo Thinkpad x61t.  I have more ram and the Intel Turbo Memory
2008-01-23T10:53:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	actually, he might have the wlan card... lemme ask
2008-01-23T10:54:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- it may be possible that he actually has *that* wireless card, and that is *actually* sucks
2008-01-23T10:56:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	would it be possible that he could disable that WLAN card (if he has it) and use the built-in card?
2008-01-23T10:56:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	the WLAN card was an add-on option
2008-01-23T10:57:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- wait, you think there are two wireless cards in the machine?
2008-01-23T10:58:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- what does he get on an iwconfig?
2008-01-23T10:58:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	excuse me.. i might have meant WWAN
2008-01-23T10:59:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- that makes more sense, but should not interfere
2008-01-23T11:01:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/5054
2008-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- well, that supports the assertion that there is only one wlan card, whether or not there is a wwan card
2008-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	so is it possible to get his machine to use the iwl driver instead of the ipw driver?
2008-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	goodmami	- i don't know
2008-01-23T11:03:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	heh... ok
2008-01-23T11:16:00.000Z	goodmami	StrangeCharm	yeah well no luck on the iwl4965 front.  thanks for all your help though
