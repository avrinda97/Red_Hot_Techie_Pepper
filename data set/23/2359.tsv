2010-11-20T06:41:00.000Z	Chr|s		I guess its going to be a long night trying to figure this out... anyone here run TeamSpeak 3 on amd64 computer?
2010-11-20T06:41:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	I do
2010-11-20T06:42:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	what sort of problems are you having with teamviewer?
2010-11-20T06:43:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 everything works fine except the mic, I talk into it, it goes through, but its not understandable. Very laggy choppy sounding
2010-11-20T06:43:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	oh wait, its TeamSpeak not Team Veiwer :)
2010-11-20T06:43:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	I use teamspeak as well
2010-11-20T06:44:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 alright, are you using TeamSpeak 3 on amd64 computer?
2010-11-20T06:44:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	yes
2010-11-20T06:45:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 how did you you get your headset to work with it? my mic doesn't work clearly
2010-11-20T06:45:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	configure it in sound preferences first. Left click on volume control then click sound preferences. Make sure it works in there first
2010-11-20T06:46:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 I tried every option in the sound preferences
2010-11-20T06:46:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	I noticed on my pc I had to mics listed for input and had to select the seconnd one. You should see the little leds light up as you talk.  Also check alsamixer and make sure nothing is muted.
2010-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 ok, I checked alsamixer, nothing was muted earlier
2010-11-20T06:48:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 when I talk, the input lvl moves like it is suppose too
2010-11-20T06:57:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 im not sure whats going on, hear everyone fine, but they say im cutting o ut, I went through sound preferences and checked everything out
2010-11-20T06:58:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	they can hear you but your cut out?  Then I would adjust your levels
2010-11-20T06:58:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 they can hear me cut out, its not understandable its choppy. I ajusted the lvls
2010-11-20T06:59:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	I don't know I have no issues like that. Running 10.10 amd64 and teamspeak 3. I would test the mic in a different app and see if there is an issue.
2010-11-20T07:05:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 im going to try to plug in my headset in the back to see if it works that way
2010-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	like I said check mic with another app. Confirm that teamspeak is the problem.
2010-11-20T07:07:00.000Z	Chr|s	histo	 yeah, I have, I installed and set up mumble fine
2010-11-20T07:07:00.000Z	histo	Chr|s	Dunno then perhaps the teamspeak forums?  Not really a ubuntu problem. Unless you've messed with pulse settings etc...
