2007-12-28T00:00:00.000Z	paratox	wols	source packages
2007-12-28T00:00:00.000Z	wols	paratox	then you most likely didn't compile it right
2007-12-28T00:00:00.000Z	wols	paratox	grep the sourcecode for g15r_ttfLoad and see where it is defined
2007-12-28T00:01:00.000Z	paratox	wols	thanx
2007-12-28T00:01:00.000Z	paratox	wols	i will have a look
2007-12-28T00:01:00.000Z	wols	paratox	most likely a lib is not where it should be
2007-12-28T00:01:00.000Z	wols	paratox	did you run ldconfig after installing?
