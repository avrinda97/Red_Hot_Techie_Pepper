2005-09-26T07:53:00.000Z	Ghotcom		is there a root passwd by default in ubuntu?
2005-09-26T07:53:00.000Z	Ghotcom		hi
2005-09-26T07:54:00.000Z	Ghotcom		what
2005-09-26T07:54:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	ignore what goo_ said, read what ubotu said :)
2005-09-26T07:55:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	ok
2005-09-26T07:55:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	he doesn't, what is asking him for it?
2005-09-26T07:56:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	the network admin
2005-09-26T07:57:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	that'll be his password then, if he reads the requestor closely he'll notice it says "please enter your password" (my emphesis)
2005-09-26T08:00:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	yu can configur ubuntuuising en user passwd?
2005-09-26T08:00:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	yes, you are supposed to :)
2005-09-26T08:00:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	scuzz i am writing with one hand :p
2005-09-26T08:03:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	oki the netowrk seems to be enabled
2005-09-26T08:03:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	now where does he has to go for downloading packages ?
2005-09-26T08:04:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	System->Administration->Synaptic
2005-09-26T08:04:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	what s the use of Install/Uninstall ?
2005-09-26T08:04:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	at the top of the menu
2005-09-26T08:04:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	the Add/Remove Programs in Applications->System Tools? That's just a really simple interface for installing applications, synaptic lists way more stuff
2005-09-26T08:05:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	if what he wants is in the Add/Remove Programs one then using that is fine too :)
2005-09-26T08:05:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	oki
2005-09-26T08:07:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	?
2005-09-26T08:08:00.000Z	Ghotcom	Ng	if Synaptic works then I can assume the network is up ?
2005-09-26T08:16:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	that would seem reasonable, yes, unless it's getting packages from the CD, which it may try to do by default
2005-09-26T08:16:00.000Z	Ng	Ghotcom	get him to try some web pages or something?
