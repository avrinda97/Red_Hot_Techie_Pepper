2010-11-09T23:06:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	 did you download the deb package listed there?
2010-11-09T23:07:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	yes, but that contains a possibly large tree of dependencies.
2010-11-09T23:07:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	(the difference between apt-get and dpkg)
2010-11-09T23:08:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	  did you open a terminal...cd to it's locations  and   sudp dpkg -i kicad_0.0.20100314-1build0.1_amd64.deb
2010-11-09T23:08:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	I already did that.
2010-11-09T23:08:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	 ok and was was the read out ?  pasbing.com the readout
2010-11-09T23:08:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	it then says some dependencies are missing.
2010-11-09T23:08:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	 ok  now try   sudo apt-get install -f
2010-11-09T23:09:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	that of course doesn't work, because the package didn't get installed.
2010-11-09T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	 well if you did the sudo dpkg -i   and it complained of dependencies...what was the depency read out?
2010-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	all kinds of packages that are available, but I don't want to install those manually.
2010-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	  I need to see the read out
2010-11-09T23:11:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	that's the relevant bit.

2010-11-09T23:11:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	install package foo and all its dependencies.
2010-11-09T23:12:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	just from a different place. Is there no way to do that?
2010-11-09T23:12:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	 ah ok   mm   well unless you get a different build of kicad  you will have to manually install the proper version of dependecies
2010-11-09T23:12:00.000Z	mgaas	coz_	I tried building it manually, but their C++ is not C++.
2010-11-09T23:13:00.000Z	coz_	mgaas	   is this particular cad application necessary for your work?
