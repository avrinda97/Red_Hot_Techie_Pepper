2007-06-18T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	python is very powerful and also very good for beginners as well as experts
2008-09-12T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	maybe ffmpeg
2008-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	what ubuntu version?
2008-12-04T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	you can install 2.5.2 from the hardy-backports repository
2008-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	I told you already that you need to install it from hardy-backports
2008-12-04T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	pastebin the output of: apt-cache policy pidgin
2008-12-04T07:06:00.000Z	mortuis99	jrib	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/80109/
2008-12-04T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	you don't have hardy-backports enabled.  Enable them in Software Sources
2008-12-04T07:09:00.000Z	mortuis99	jrib	it is enabled
2008-12-04T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	not according to what you pasted.  Pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list

2008-12-06T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	well, explain what you are trying to do (what permissions are you trying to set?) and what you have tried thus far (what commands?)
2008-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	mortuis99	jrib	i have a USB HD and am trying to set it so that i can read/write to it
2008-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	can you answer my question?
2008-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	mortuis99	jrib	i havent tried anything yet
2008-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	after reading the wiki page, you should be able to be a lot more precise about the permissions you want, even if you aren't sure what command would let you set them
2009-01-27T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	mortuis99	COMMAND > FILE
