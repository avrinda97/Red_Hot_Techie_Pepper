2010-07-20T17:11:00.000Z	dury		hi there channel :)
2010-07-20T17:13:00.000Z	dury		how do I remove the nonflashplugin that ubuntu has and install the adobe one
2010-07-20T17:13:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	don't remove it. Just install the Adobe one
2010-07-20T17:14:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	search "adobe linux download flash"
2010-07-20T17:15:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	how do I know which one is installed?
2010-07-20T17:16:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	you don't have any flash plugin installed
2010-07-20T17:17:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	I guess there is... but the question is how do I know which one is installed?
2010-07-20T17:17:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	by default there isn't Flash installed. If you have flash, you have Adobe Flash, but you installed it manually
2010-07-20T17:24:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	Adobe doesn't make 64 bit flashplayer for linux
2010-07-20T17:25:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	so what should I do, What you suggest me?
2010-07-20T17:26:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	i'm currently using GNash, the free, open source implementation for Flash, it's not as good as flash, but works on 64
2010-07-20T17:26:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	either that, or install the 32 bit libraries, and get 32 bit flash player
2010-07-20T17:27:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	what's the way to install 32 bit libraries?
2010-07-20T17:27:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	apt-get install ia32libs i believe, Google is your friend
2010-07-20T17:32:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	those libraries already installed
2010-07-20T17:33:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	I mean 32 bits ones
2010-07-20T17:33:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	great, now go install 32 bit flash player
2010-07-20T17:33:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	as normal?
2010-07-20T17:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	yeah, should work
2010-07-20T17:34:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	see what's happened
2010-07-20T17:39:00.000Z	dury	Beyecixramd	error processing install_flash_player_10_linux.deb (--install):
2010-07-20T17:39:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	DON'T DO THAT AGAIN
2010-07-20T17:39:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	dury	no idea how to do that then, sorry
