2005-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	NEURAL_NET		hello
2005-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	NEURAL_NET		root@host:/home/user/inird-root/dev# /dev/MAKEDEV null
2005-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	NEURAL_NET		/dev/MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "null"
2005-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	NEURAL_NET		:(
2005-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	don't use MAKEDEV
2005-12-17T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	what are you hoping to do with your initrd?
2005-12-17T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	why?
2005-12-17T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	it'd probably save us all a lot of time if you stopped what you're doing and told us what on earth your plan is
2005-12-17T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	why?
2005-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	no, stop
2005-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	explain what your actual goal is
2005-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	this has nothing to do with an initrd at all
2005-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	use an ubuntu kernel
2005-12-17T09:03:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	why are you trying to compile a custom kernel with an initrd?
2005-12-17T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	why are you trying to compile a custom kernel with an initrd?
2005-12-17T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	you're not really answering the question
2005-12-17T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	you do not need a custom kernel to test modules
2005-12-17T09:06:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	if you are using a custom kernel, you don't need an initrd
2005-12-17T09:06:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	so you're potentially doubly wasting your time
2005-12-17T09:07:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	ok, you appear to be too confused to help, so good luck
2005-12-17T09:08:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	then, first of all, make a kernel that boots
2005-12-17T09:08:00.000Z	bob2	NEURAL_NET	without an initrd
2005-12-17T09:10:00.000Z	NEURAL_NET	bob2	 is not first time that i make a kernel
