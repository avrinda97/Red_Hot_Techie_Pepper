2007-01-03T12:41:00.000Z	compaq		anyone know about my old ATI card? I don't know what driver to use, as the proprietary won't help me; my card's too old.
2007-01-03T12:41:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 Old radeons use the driver 'radeon' not any of the fgl ones.
2007-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	will that give me 3d?
2007-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 Yep.
2007-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 Well, it did for me.  YMMV.
2007-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 It doesn't work for all radeons, though.  What is yours?
2007-01-03T12:43:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 You need the xserver-xorg-video-ati package to get the radeon driver.\
2007-01-03T12:44:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 You might have to edit the xorg.conf yourself.
2007-01-03T12:44:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	thats no problem. i could have done this a million times for nvidia :)
2007-01-03T12:46:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	that package was not found. is it in non-free?
2007-01-03T12:47:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 Hmm.  I'm pretty sure it's free.  maybe the name is off.
2007-01-03T12:48:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 I'm showing it being called "xserver-xorg-video-ati" and it's got the little ubuntu icon, and was installed on my system despite not needing it (I bet it's automatic)
2007-01-03T12:49:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	how would i check?
2007-01-03T12:52:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	  I'd probably go 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati'.  It'll tell you if you have it and get it if you don't.
2007-01-03T12:54:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	is that available in breezy? the only references to that are on Edgy and I have not upgraded this box there yet,
2007-01-03T12:55:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 oh, I didn't think about that!  It's xserver-xorg-driver-ati for you.
2007-01-03T12:56:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	this will give me 3d? i only get ~200fps in glxgears
2007-01-03T12:56:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 I think so.  I'm sure using the radeon driver is a necessary step to getting 3d.
2007-01-03T12:58:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 What's it say?
2007-01-03T12:59:00.000Z	compaq	mitrovarr	what is it that you want to know? what does it say where
2007-01-03T12:59:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 When you try to run 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati' and 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-driver-ati'
2007-01-03T13:04:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 "xserver-xorg-driver-ati is already the newest version."
2007-01-03T13:04:00.000Z	mitrovarr	compaq	 Go into your xorg.conf and change your driver line to radeon
