2006-12-07T08:11:00.000Z	sergevn		Hello, does anyone has any experience running xubuntu on a Pentium 3 with 477 Mhz?
2006-12-07T08:11:00.000Z	sergevn		or anything around 477Mhz
2006-12-07T08:12:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	no, but I've got xubuntu on a Celeron 300
2006-12-07T08:13:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	you still need good amounts of RAM -- I've 192MB on that machine and it runs well enough
2006-12-07T08:13:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	ok i think that is my problem then, i only have 64meg of ram
2006-12-07T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	can you get your hands on some extra RAM? Shouldn't be too expensive these days...
2006-12-07T08:15:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	yep. I already ordered them on my work ( i work in a local hardware store) got 2 rigs of 256mb of ram for like 60 euro
2006-12-07T08:15:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	what do you mean?
2006-12-07T08:16:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	the alternate install CD won't be of any use to you
2006-12-07T08:16:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	ah yes. what window manager does that alternate cd have?
2006-12-07T08:17:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	it's for installing the non-graphical way -- it still provides a full gnome install with metacity by default
2006-12-07T08:18:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	i need the desktop environment, because it's on my laptop ( IBM Thinkpad 390x), doing light office work on it.
2006-12-07T08:18:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	only CLI wont do
2006-12-07T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	(dthacker, linux1) I take it all back -- there is an alternate Xubuntu install CD that works on machines with 64MB (http://www.xubuntu.org/get)
2006-12-07T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	"alternate" install means that only the installer is nongraphical. It still installs Gnome, Xfce or KDE, respectively
2006-12-07T08:22:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	hmm i had that problem, that it would install with the 'normal' ubuntu disc, then i tried the xubuntu and that worked.
2006-12-07T08:22:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	*would not
2006-12-07T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	oh, so you did manage to install Xubuntu? I misread your first question then.
2006-12-07T08:23:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	yes :D, im running it now atm. but with crappy memory :P
2006-12-07T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	well, the 256MB you're getting will remove that bottleneck.
2006-12-07T08:23:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	2x256 :D
2006-12-07T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	sergevn	all the better ;)
2006-12-07T08:25:00.000Z	sergevn	soundray	well im off, thanks for the help :)
