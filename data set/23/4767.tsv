2007-10-19T03:24:00.000Z	gi000		anyone uses amarok?
2007-10-19T03:24:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	me.
2007-10-19T03:25:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	what do you mean?
2007-10-19T03:26:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	there are no symbols at all
2007-10-19T03:27:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	that's weird... how'd you install it?
2007-10-19T03:27:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	except in the help section
2007-10-19T03:27:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	did you install it via source, or synaptic, or what?
2007-10-19T03:27:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	i installed it a long time ago and the close the release of gutsy came the less icons i had :)
2007-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	again, did you download the source? or did you install it via synaptic?
2007-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	via aptitude (so the binaries)
2007-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	that's weird; try uninstalling and reinstalling it?
2007-10-19T03:29:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	i will. but the rest of the systems is a bit like this too
2007-10-19T03:30:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	in the system preferences i have 8 icons for 18 options
2007-10-19T03:30:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	I can't think of why that would be. are you using the default theme?
2007-10-19T03:31:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	i'm not sure as i configured the system a long time ago
2007-10-19T03:32:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	it's the style "plastik"
2007-10-19T03:33:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	try using a different icon theme?
2007-10-19T03:33:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	i will try to "use another style in gtk applications"
2007-10-19T03:33:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	wait, you're running kde?
2007-10-19T03:33:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	yes
2007-10-19T03:34:00.000Z	Veinor	gi000	try asking in #kubuntu
2007-10-19T03:34:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	indeed, i should have tried this first
2007-10-19T03:38:00.000Z	gi000	Veinor	goodby
