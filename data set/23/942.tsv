2010-11-19T16:56:00.000Z	cs09aas		Hi, I have a dual booting machine and I can no longer see windows in the bootloader. How can I get it back?
2010-11-19T16:58:00.000Z	cs09aas		Was that an answer for me?
2010-11-19T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	sudo apt-get install os-prober; sudo os-prober; sudo update-grub
2010-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	should do it
2010-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	: many thanks I will try this and let you know of the outcome
2010-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	This is the output from sudo os-prober.. http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/11/the-path-to-social-network-tranquility-is-lined-by-50-friends/
2010-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	it's really not
2010-11-19T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	please use a pastebin for multiple lines of output
2010-11-19T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	ok then run: sudo update-grub    reboot to test
2010-11-19T17:05:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	many thanks for your advice, that worked perfectly. just ouf of interest do you know why this happens? its happened in the past and I just reinstalled the operating systems!
2010-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	no idea, i just know the fix. i dont use windows or dual boot personally
2010-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	what was the os-prober you suggested I downloaded?
2010-11-19T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	it scans the disks for OSes and puts them in /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober    afaik
2010-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	ah ok, then update grub puts the os's back into the grub folder then?
2010-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	update-grub reads all the grub confi files and eerates grub.cfg
2010-11-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree    and you'll haveit
2010-11-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	i use lubuntu too, its all I use these days
2010-11-19T17:11:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	thanks running that now, there is so much I need to learn about lubuntu, I put it on a SSD and it boots in 15 seconds!
2010-11-19T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	xpud boots in 3
2010-11-19T17:12:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	I am just having to google that to see what it is all about, first time I have heard of it!
2010-11-19T17:14:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	is xPud worth installing? have you had experience in using it?
2010-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cs09aas	it has about 6 apps, torrent client, browser, text editor and a few others, its very minimal and you will have to doa lot of manual config
2010-11-19T17:16:00.000Z	cs09aas	ActionParsnip	I think i will give it a go, sounds like a perfect 'instant boot' OS
