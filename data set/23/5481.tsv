2006-12-16T14:43:00.000Z	barata		hallo xipietotec.... nice to see you under Ubuntu
2006-12-16T14:44:00.000Z	barata		normally I see you bashing in #politics
2006-12-16T14:45:00.000Z	barata		what is a GUI disk encryption?
2006-12-16T14:45:00.000Z	barata		for encrypting the whole partition like Vista?
2006-12-16T14:45:00.000Z	barata		sound like Xen
2006-12-16T14:45:00.000Z	barata		have you tried that?
2006-12-16T14:46:00.000Z	barata		with Xen you can move about Lin & Win just like you move from Thunderbird to Firefox
2006-12-16T14:46:00.000Z	barata		I dont use it myself, but that's what the Xen users told me & what I read about it
2006-12-16T14:48:00.000Z	barata		one need to be (1) an Al-qaeda member or (2) a CIA agent to really use that
2006-12-16T14:48:00.000Z	barata		what is /mp3?
2006-12-16T14:48:00.000Z	Slart	barata	to make the curious work hard cracking useless stuff.. ;)
2006-12-16T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	barata	the folder where you keep all your, legally bought and converted to mp3, music =)
2006-12-16T14:51:00.000Z	barata	Slart	are you in Europe?
2006-12-16T14:51:00.000Z	Slart	barata	yes, why?
2006-12-16T14:51:00.000Z	Slart	barata	Sweden to be more precise
2006-12-16T14:52:00.000Z	Slart	barata	nah.. I dont encrypt my music.. can't be arsed.. but I understand if someone would want to
2006-12-16T14:53:00.000Z	Slart	barata	it's been a couple of years since we last had a military coup where they shot people in the streets for having "dangerous" documents on their computers.. =)
2006-12-16T15:04:00.000Z	Slart	barata	you becuase you can see that it's there doesn't mean you can read the contents
2006-12-16T15:05:00.000Z	Slart	barata	but with truecrypt (which is available on both) you can use the encrypted disk from both
2006-12-16T15:06:00.000Z	Slart	barata	encryption is not about hiding secrets.. except the key
2006-12-16T15:07:00.000Z	Slart	barata	it's a program that encrypts a hard drive.. if you want to use it you have to input a password.. no password. no files...
2006-12-16T15:08:00.000Z	Slart	barata	it's using well known encryption methods that you can read about in any book.. the strength of the encryption doesn't rely on the method being secret (which is usually bad)
2006-12-16T15:10:00.000Z	barata	Slart	that argument that the 'best encryption is the most open encryption" is interesting ... I'll read it more next time
