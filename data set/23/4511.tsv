2007-07-28T05:14:00.000Z	UbunVIA		I was searching the forums, and everyone talks about VIA not having Drivers for the Unichrome9, Well, on the 11th of this Month, they released them. The problem is that I cant deciper how do install it, and "develope" a kernel, there are other methods, but i dont really understand, im trying to get away from windows.. so any ideas?
