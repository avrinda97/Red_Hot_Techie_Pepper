2012-10-10T18:14:00.000Z	sasuke		hello guys, i removed compiz from my ubuntu and after restart i didnt see any windows-manager. Can anyone help me out.
2012-10-10T18:15:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	what do you see now?
2012-10-10T18:16:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	all i can see is only desktop.
2012-10-10T18:18:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	Only the wallpaper?
2012-10-10T18:18:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	all of my data is there
2012-10-10T18:19:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	Try alt+F2, and enter:  metacity --replace
2012-10-10T18:19:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	through terminal i can do everything
2012-10-10T18:20:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	try through terminal, only if you don't get a run box on pressing Alt+F2
2012-10-10T18:20:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	will it replace old lap
2012-10-10T18:21:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	i mean same as before removing the compiz
2012-10-10T18:21:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	why you removed compiz in the first place?
2012-10-10T18:22:00.000Z	sasuke		melvinc, i want to remove effects, dashhome, from my ubuntu version. i want menu bar which is like 10.04, 10.10.
2012-10-10T18:22:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	then just apt-get install gnome-panel
2012-10-10T18:23:00.000Z	melvincv		that will give you gnome classic interface similar to Gnome 2... well almost.
2012-10-10T18:23:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	through google i found  that if i remove compiz i will get menu bar. so i did it
2012-10-10T18:24:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	well, that will remove the animations, but will break your Unity desktop, because it runs as a Compiz plugin :(
2012-10-10T18:25:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	sudo apt=get install gnome-panel
2012-10-10T18:25:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	u mean so i cant get menu bar
2012-10-10T18:26:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	of course, you will get menus, but you won't be running Unity. (Is this what you asked for?)
2012-10-10T18:26:00.000Z	sasuke		yes
2012-10-10T18:28:00.000Z	melvincv	sasuke	Welcome to Ubuntu. Do remember to take backups before you experiment :)
2012-10-10T18:29:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	thanx for that i dont have anything for taking bckup.. I am leaning linux (new comer) :D
2012-10-10T18:31:00.000Z	sasuke	melvincv	i installed gnome-panel
