2005-03-16T10:12:00.000Z	sockler		i made two partitions on my box and installed ubuntu on the second one, windows XP on the first, how do i get the dual boot option every time i start up??
2005-03-16T10:14:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	edit /etc/grub/ment.lst
2005-03-16T10:15:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	comment out hiddenmenu
2005-03-16T10:16:00.000Z	sockler	GammaRay	i cant even get to ubuntu, windows XP boots first, i looked in setup but didnt see anything about partitions
2005-03-16T10:18:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	is ubuntu on a seperate hdd?
2005-03-16T10:27:00.000Z	sockler		Gamma: still with me?  no, ubuntu and windows XP is on the same hd
2005-03-16T10:28:00.000Z	sockler		the problem is that only windows boots, i want to be able to choose which one
2005-03-16T10:28:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	where did you install the ubuntu bootloader(grub)?
2005-03-16T10:29:00.000Z	sockler		where the first partition is
2005-03-16T10:29:00.000Z	sockler		wherever that is
2005-03-16T10:30:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	it should be installed on the MBR. that's what your bios loads
2005-03-16T10:31:00.000Z	sockler	GammaRay	when i get to the MBR, i should have to choice which OS to boot from?
2005-03-16T10:32:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	yes *if* you install the boot loader on the MBR, otherwise windows's bootloader is still there doing what it always did
2005-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	sockler		Gamma: well i installed ubuntu first, then XP second, so would the XP bootload overwrite GRUB??
2005-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	sockler		hmm so i guess i have to reinstall ubuntu...will GRUB overwrite the XP bootload?
2005-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	see this http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mako/ubuntu-traffic/u20041203_15.html#4
2005-03-16T10:37:00.000Z	sockler		Gamma: thank you very much, one last q: is my ubuntu root device a /?
2005-03-16T10:38:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	that depends on where it is on the ide cable, and which interface it's on
2005-03-16T10:38:00.000Z	sockler		how would i determine that?
2005-03-16T10:39:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	/dev/hda is primary master, hdb pri. slave, hdc secondary master, hdd sec. slave
2005-03-16T10:40:00.000Z	sockler		Gamma: alright mine would be hda then.... thanks a whole lot
2005-03-16T10:40:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	you also need the partiton number...
2005-03-16T10:40:00.000Z	GammaRay	sockler	/dev/hda1 would be the first partition
