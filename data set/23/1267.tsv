2010-06-08T04:56:00.000Z	SpazStatic		I'd really rather not waste everyone's time by posting my question repeatedly to thepoint that nobody reads what I say.
2010-06-08T04:58:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	it's considered good form (in this channel) to repeat a question about once every 15 minutes until you get a solution (or give up)....
2010-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Yeah, I know. You don't happen to remember me from a month or so ago with the major sound issues?
2010-06-08T05:00:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	name was probably Spaztic_One if not this
2010-06-08T05:00:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	my memory isn't best :-). Did we solve it?
2010-06-08T05:01:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	no, not really. But we unbroke it from when we did try and fix it and it all went to crap... and I think it was a little better as well. =)
2010-06-08T05:03:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	sound really is still a problem in most linuxes unfortunately...
2010-06-08T05:03:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Yeah, I know. It's not bugging me that much currently.
2010-06-08T05:09:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	welcome back anyway. Got a ubuntu question for us?
2010-06-08T05:23:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Yeah, monitor problems. Comp thinks that the max resolution is 640x480, which is below the minimum reported res on other computers (800x600).
2010-06-08T05:25:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	it's a new hardware setup?
2010-06-08T05:26:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	everything is the same except that I am now on Linx, and the monitor is different than the previous one.
2010-06-08T05:27:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	see if there's something in the above that helps...
2010-06-08T05:27:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Been given that 3 times before, not counting this one, or the time that I found the wiki page before I got on IRC.
2010-06-08T05:28:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	However, i'm not a very well versed Linux user. Perhaps if you were to lead me along while going through it?
2010-06-08T05:29:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	sounds like you need expert help. You need to put all stuff we've mentioned above into a single query and post it here every 15 minutes until Someone Who Knows shows up...
2010-06-08T05:30:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	I think its that I'm not entirely sure what all of the xrand and various things within the command are, or how to use them properly. I kind of get lost.
2010-06-08T05:33:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	Hmm. I just looked at the man page, xrandr *is* a complex beastie...
2010-06-08T05:33:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Yeah, have you any experience with it?
2010-06-08T05:33:00.000Z	Loshki	SpazStatic	none at all :-)
2010-06-08T05:34:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	So you wouldn't be likely to help me understand what its talking about, would you?
2010-06-08T05:45:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	Oh, ok, so I just figured something out. I "borrowed" a monitor from one of the other computers and hooked it up as well. It has a default res pf 1280x1024, and is identified as dell blah blah blah. The other monitor is identified as CRT-0, which signifies an error.
2010-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	SpazStatic	Loshki	hey, you there?
