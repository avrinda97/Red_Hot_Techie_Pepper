2007-04-01T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	bimberi	different from the Desktop CD, yes. But different from the server option on Alternate?
2007-04-01T06:02:00.000Z	bimberi	soundray	yes, for example the server install cd has apache on it.  alternate doesn't
2007-04-01T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	bimberi	okay, thanks. (Thomas` ^)
