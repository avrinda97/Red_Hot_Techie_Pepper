2007-01-05T17:02:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	you mean the folder where you store your webpage?
2007-01-05T17:05:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	that correct, in /var/www
2007-01-05T17:05:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	yes...
2007-01-05T17:05:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	but i cannot copy the file into it. i do not have the root permission
2007-01-05T17:06:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	try "sudo chmod +rw /var/www/"
2007-01-05T17:06:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	i know that i can use the sudo in terminal to copy a file into it.... but i want to open this permission for permanent
2007-01-05T17:07:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	that was it... it changes the permission so that it would have both - read and write for user, group and others...
2007-01-05T17:07:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	thanks, it work, i sudo chmod 777 /var/www/
2007-01-05T17:08:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	thanks you...
2007-01-05T17:08:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	it'd be enough to chmod to 666...
2007-01-05T17:08:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	ok... i change it to 666
2007-01-05T17:08:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	as you dont really need the execute permission...
2007-01-05T17:09:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	your names seems so familiar, are you a joomla member?
2007-01-05T17:09:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	no... what is joomla?
2007-01-05T17:10:00.000Z	kane77	smithveg	I see... no I'm not a joomla member...
2007-01-05T17:13:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	you a bit wrong le..
2007-01-05T17:14:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	if i change to 666, i can't even access any pages.. unless i make it to 777
2007-01-05T17:14:00.000Z	smithveg	kane77	are you there?
