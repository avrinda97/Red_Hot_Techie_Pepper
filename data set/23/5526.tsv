2007-10-23T08:08:00.000Z	beta		Hi, I'm having a weird problem. When I use the volume keys on my laptop, the OSD for the volume shows up and even slides up and down, but it doesn't actually change the volume. When I click on the volume slider by the clock it always stays the same. Why would this be?
2007-10-23T08:09:00.000Z	guru	beta	launch alsamixer and adjust your volume with your keyboard and see which mixer it's adjusting the volume for
2007-10-23T08:09:00.000Z	beta	guru	Oh, its modifying the mic... how strange. How could I change it to use the Master volume instead?
2007-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	guru	beta	that i'm afraid i'm not sure about. i don't know how to remap the mixers but you could override it by using xbindkeys
2007-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	guru	beta	you most likely want to control your pcm volume
2007-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	beta	guru	Alright, thanks. Its a step in the right way, now I have something to search for. I'll try to see what I can find. Thanks again =)
2007-10-23T08:11:00.000Z	guru	beta	no problem. stick around for a second and i'll see if i can find the link for xbindkeys that i used a while ago
2007-10-23T08:11:00.000Z	beta	guru	alright... thanks
2007-10-23T08:12:00.000Z	guru	beta	http://hocwp.free.fr/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html take a look at that and to find out what the scancodes are for your keyboard's keys you can run xev then press the buttons on your keyboard
2007-10-23T08:13:00.000Z	guru	beta	focus on the terminal and press Ctrl + C to kill xev when you're done (or close the terminal window)
2007-10-23T08:13:00.000Z	beta	guru	Alright, I remember doing this once. I just can't remember the program that outputted the pressed keys or something. I'll look around, again thank you so much
2007-10-23T08:13:00.000Z	beta	guru	oh nvm, didn't finish reading your message before posting haha
2007-10-23T08:13:00.000Z	guru	beta	no problem. i'll be around for a bit if you have any questions
2007-10-23T08:14:00.000Z	beta	guru	Thanks =)
2007-10-23T08:14:00.000Z	guru	beta	actually hang on and i'll paste my xbindkeysrc for you
2007-10-23T08:15:00.000Z	beta	guru	okay
2007-10-23T08:16:00.000Z	guru	beta	http://rafb.net/p/z86kfK22.html
2007-10-23T08:16:00.000Z	beta	guru	Thanks =)
2007-10-23T08:17:00.000Z	guru	beta	actually .Xmodmap might be the only one you need
2007-10-23T08:18:00.000Z	guru	beta	iirc mute is "XF86AudioMute" and i don't have that one in my .Xmodmap
2007-10-23T08:19:00.000Z	beta	guru	thanks
2007-10-23T08:19:00.000Z	guru	beta	no problem. keep in mind you might need to restart X afterwards
2007-10-23T08:20:00.000Z	beta	guru	alright makes sense
