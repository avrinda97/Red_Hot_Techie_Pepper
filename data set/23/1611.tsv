2010-02-27T09:50:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	nice one...
2010-03-02T05:18:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	in general, as long as there is *contiguous* free space, you can enlarge an existing partition, but I've only ever done it with ext3 and ntfs. In general, I would make an empty, larger partition first, and then copy the contents of the smaller partition to it, using tar, or dump, etc...
2010-03-19T05:39:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	are you registered? Some channels are now registered users only...
2010-03-19T05:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	I'll check again, thanks for the tip - thanks eirann  :)
2010-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	there's quite a lot of processing and negotiation goes on in ssh before you get to a password prompt. You should be able to see it happen by adding -v
2010-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	...you trainin' me???
2010-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	what else is a grease monkey for?
2010-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	actually, I'm just slow...:-)
2010-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	blakkheim: Yup...processing encryption, seems like it should run faster, but at least it works.
2010-03-25T07:52:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	encryption is very compute intensive & expensive...
2010-03-25T07:52:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	blabber, mostly...
2010-03-25T07:53:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	*public key* encryption is very compute intensive & expensive...
2010-03-25T07:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	It's worth it to be able to execute locally - from a remote location.
2010-03-25T08:43:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	as far as I know, swap files are fully supported...
2010-03-26T05:21:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	is making me blush again...
2010-03-27T09:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	I've used ghost to copy ntfs drives, seemed to work well. I have used dd to copy drives as well, same result. Don't both methods, dd and yours end up with a duplicated drive?
2010-03-27T09:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	I guess I'm looking for the reasoning?
2010-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	I'm sure dd will work if the two drive geometries are identical. I'm much less certain if it works when they are not. My way works for all geometries, and can even be used when going from a larger disk to a smaller one, or if you want to rearrange partitions. Of course, it's also more work...
2010-03-27T09:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	AND - you don't have to wonder if it's going to work when you're done! I get it :)
2010-04-16T07:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	bacula - if you want to commit the resources to it!
2010-04-16T07:09:00.000Z	Losha	greezmunkey	I prefer dump/restore myself, but each to their own...
2010-04-16T07:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Losha	yeah, I looked into bacula...I don't run a data center here, so rsync'n it!
