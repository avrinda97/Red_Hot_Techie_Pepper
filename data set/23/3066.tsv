2008-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	noob09		Hello, I am having issues with my harddrive partitioning. I have just installed Gutsy 64bit together with my Vista installation. I partitioned my HD so that my ubuntu partition would have 150gigs.. however, it is telling me I only have 1.6 gigs left of space!
2008-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	noob09		I have a screenshot of gparted with all the info

2008-09-20T00:38:00.000Z	noob09		well ok fogobogo, I recommend redtube
2008-09-20T00:39:00.000Z	noob09		yes, since it has all the info and describes the problem perfectly
2008-09-20T00:40:00.000Z	noob09		is gparted with disk usage analyzer... and in the analyzer it shows I am using only a couple of gigs... and in gparted it says i am using 150gigs O_O
