2007-11-04T13:30:00.000Z	scriptha		how do check for WoL on my network card?
2007-11-04T13:31:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	is it a add on network card?
2007-11-04T13:31:00.000Z	scriptha		No idea :$
2007-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	well usually wol is something you enable on the mother board unless you bought your network card as an add on card
2007-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	but these days most all motherboards come with Network cards so I would look in the bios
2007-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	scriptha	spine55	how do I know if it's an add on card? It's about 5 years old btw..
2007-11-04T13:34:00.000Z	scriptha		It's not one from these days xD
2007-11-04T13:34:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	 well open your pc and see if the network card is sticking out of a pci slot. I would think its a integrated card
2007-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	if its attached to your motherboard then you know its integrated and I would start looking in your bios for a Wake on Lan Setting
2007-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	scriptha		it's next to my printerport
2007-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	scriptha		and sound thingies
2007-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	what kind of pc is it? Brand name or home built
2007-11-04T13:36:00.000Z	scriptha		not home build, compaq :/
2007-11-04T13:36:00.000Z	spine55		then its integrated
2007-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	start looking in the bios
2007-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	scriptha		ok
2007-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	scriptha		I'll reboot
2007-11-04T13:45:00.000Z	scriptha	spine55	there was something called Network Service boot, could that be it?
2007-11-04T13:48:00.000Z	spine55		scripta hmm sounds like it
2007-11-04T13:49:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	did you see this as part of the boot sequence?
2007-11-04T13:55:00.000Z	scriptha	spine55	it works now ^^ thanks
2007-11-04T13:57:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	So what were you testing?
2007-11-04T13:57:00.000Z	spine55	scriptha	not to be nozy
