2010-09-04T22:34:00.000Z	BrianE		Hey
2010-09-04T22:34:00.000Z	BrianE		In Vista, my laptop achieves around 3.5 hours' battery life
2010-09-04T22:34:00.000Z	BrianE		In Ubuntu, I'm lucky if I can scrape 40 minutes out of it... Anyone got any solutions / explainations?
2010-09-04T22:35:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	I get 8 hours on my eeepc using xubuntu
2010-09-04T22:38:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	running any services ? active deamons you can live without
2010-09-04T22:39:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	Only nginx and a MySQL server, neither of which (due to their inactivity) would have much (if any) effect on the battery life
2010-09-04T22:41:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	mind paste a top output ?
2010-09-04T22:59:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	did you try powertop ?
2010-09-04T23:02:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	did you try powertop ?
2010-09-04T23:02:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	Sorry, lemme try now
2010-09-04T23:03:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	man for 'powertop' says it's for Intel-based laptops.. This has an AMD CPU / board, should it still work?
2010-09-04T23:04:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	it is meant to show you processes that wake
2010-09-04T23:04:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	interupts, file writes and such
2010-09-04T23:07:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	http://www.burn-blue.com/image/view/Qf97Rnxg/powertop.png
2010-09-04T23:10:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	No worries :)
2010-09-04T23:11:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	top power consumption is thus audio
2010-09-04T23:11:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	I'm not going without audio, heh
2010-09-04T23:12:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	may you can use some of the tips it is givving
2010-09-04T23:14:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	600 signals per 5 secs is a bit much
2010-09-04T23:14:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	maybe when you tweak hz it reduces that
2010-09-04T23:14:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	I was moving the mouse at the time of the screenshot, that would likely have increased the interrupts?
2010-09-04T23:16:00.000Z	UndiFineD	BrianE	this is my eeepc : http://paste.ubuntu.com/488398/
2010-09-04T23:18:00.000Z	BrianE	UndiFineD	I have no benchmark to go on, I don't know what it should / shouldn't be, sorry :P
