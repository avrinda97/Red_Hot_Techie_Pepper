2008-04-17T07:37:00.000Z	ColdBeer		hi Pelo
2008-04-17T07:38:00.000Z	ColdBeer	Pelo	do u know of a good irc program i can run from the bash terminal?
2008-04-17T07:40:00.000Z	genii	ColdBeer	 Frankly it matters not to me, the reason for asking on my part is that to create steps to accomplish a goal, knowing what the goal is makes it somewhat easier to lay out a set of steps towards it. Also there may be some entirely more appropriate way than using the commands you asked about.
2008-04-17T07:42:00.000Z	ColdBeer		genii - u r right i was just joking - im just learning how to navigate around bash
