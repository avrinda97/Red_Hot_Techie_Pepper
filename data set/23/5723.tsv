2011-07-31T18:23:00.000Z	wols	benedict	single line is not channel spam.
2011-07-31T18:23:00.000Z	wols	benedict	not a process but a kernel pseudeo process
2011-07-31T18:23:00.000Z	benedict	wols	how do you know?
2011-07-31T18:24:00.000Z	wols	benedict	the brackets, no memory used, etc
2011-07-31T18:24:00.000Z	benedict	wols	so anything i can do about it?
2011-07-31T18:24:00.000Z	wols	benedict	I just told you what you can do. but why do you want it gone?
2011-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	benedict	wols	it's strange that it comes up in my process list, although everything connected to bluetooth is removed
2011-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	wols	benedict	no it's not strange
2011-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	benedict	wols	i don'Ã„t use bluetooth... and got interested, after it was/is so difficult to remove...
2011-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	benedict	wols	did i miss something? how can i remaove it?
2011-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	wols	benedict	you can probably blacklist if you insist
2011-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	benedict	wols	hm ok... does it influence my system performance?
2011-07-31T18:30:00.000Z	benedict	wols	since ot seems like ths process is not doing anything (=reducing my avail. system ressource) i think i'll leave it--- i was merely worried that my system is f*ckd up in a way, because i still have ths process although i removed everything realated to it... thank you for your advice, help and patience
