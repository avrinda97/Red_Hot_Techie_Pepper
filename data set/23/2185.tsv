2011-04-12T06:13:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	you can get the weather from the clock? cool!
2011-04-12T06:14:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	Click the date/clock on youe desktop, under "Locations", click Edit. It should load clock preferences and in there there is a tab called Locations
2011-04-12T06:14:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	where does it show you the weather though?
2011-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	After you add your location, it will show it next to the date/time
2011-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	Don't be shy to try
2011-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	oh neat, i will investigate
2011-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	maybe you could put in your lat:long instead
2011-04-12T06:19:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	accordingto this link, apparently a poster has successfully retrieved correct weather by entering lon/lat but I don't believe that http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=799668
2011-04-12T06:19:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	you can try it and see -- google maps can tell you your lat:long
2011-04-12T06:20:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	you just have to enable it in labs
2011-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	what is 'labs'?
2011-04-12T06:24:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	lol you called me superlag. oh I know how to get long and lat. I'm trying to find out where gnome gets the weather from, then compare a listed city to a manually entered one
2011-04-12T06:25:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	oh that's a good question -- the thing to do then I guess would be search for GNOME's clock applet and see if their website says
2011-04-12T06:39:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	they get the weather from weather.noaa.gov ;)
2011-04-12T06:39:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	awesome! where did you find it?

2011-04-12T06:40:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	last post!
2011-04-12T08:28:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	what does it say if you type ifconfig into a terminal (please use pastebin :)
2011-04-12T08:29:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	http://paste.ubuntu.com/592943/
2011-04-12T08:29:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	that command gives information about your current connections, eth0 being the one we're interested in now
2011-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	semitones	Superstar	the symptoms are the same but I think the cause might be a little different. In your ifconfig readout, there seemed to be a eth0 connection listed
2011-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	Superstar	semitones	i know
