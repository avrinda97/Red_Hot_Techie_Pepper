2006-06-28T13:12:00.000Z	jolmash		hello all, could someone help me on configure SSH to use portfowarding? I mean, configure in my router some public port and use the private port 22
2006-06-28T13:12:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	I'll help
2006-06-28T13:13:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	thank you! how can I do that?
2006-06-28T13:13:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	make a .ssh/config file
2006-06-28T13:13:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	in my home?
2006-06-28T13:14:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	yes, ~/.ssh/config
2006-06-28T13:14:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	ok
2006-06-28T13:15:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	I have created the file? now?
2006-06-28T13:15:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	what specifically are you trying to forward?
2006-06-28T13:15:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	5060 to 22
2006-06-28T13:16:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	it's going through 22. you trying to forward port 5060 both ways.
2006-06-28T13:16:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	5060 as public port in my router (to access remotely) and forwarded to 22
2006-06-28T13:17:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	so you can get to port 22 on your machine? Sorry, it sounds a bit weird. Why not have sshd listen on port 5060?
2006-06-28T13:18:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	cause 22 it is a very know port
2006-06-28T13:18:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	I want to use 5060 external port due to security risk
2006-06-28T13:19:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	right, it's a pain to be pounded on port 22
2006-06-28T13:19:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	but I want to use 22 internal port, this way I don't need to change the port in all machines
2006-06-28T13:19:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	you can have sshd listen on both 22 and 5060
2006-06-28T13:21:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
2006-06-28T13:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	just have both Port 22 and Port 5060
2006-06-28T13:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jolmash	is this helpful?
2006-06-28T13:23:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	mmm, yes it may be works! two ports!
2006-06-28T13:26:00.000Z	jolmash	jimcooncat	thank you very much!! I just edited /etc7ssh/sshd_config and wrote down Port 5060 near Port 22
