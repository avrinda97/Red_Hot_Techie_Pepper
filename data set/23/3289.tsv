2008-10-02T07:06:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	I have GCJ
2008-10-02T07:03:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	Did you install the sun-java6-plugin?
2008-10-02T07:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	You're not going to be able to run most web apps with that. You'll need sun-java6-plugin from the repos.
2008-10-02T07:08:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	apt-get install sun-java6-plugin?
2008-10-02T07:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	yes
2008-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	computer says "sun-java6-plugin is already the newest version."
2008-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	What browser are you using?
2008-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	firefox 3.0.1
2008-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	system is fairly up to date
2008-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	Ubuntu's version or Mozilla's?
2008-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	installed to /opt?
2008-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	I dont have a /opt
2008-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	rather, its empty
2008-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	Okay, well, when you type about:plugins into firefox, does it show either the Java plugin or GCJ?
2008-10-02T07:14:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	Its a GCJ
2008-10-02T07:14:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	(using iced tea) FWIW
2008-10-02T07:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	In the terminal, type: sudo update-java-alternatives -l
2008-10-02T07:16:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	java-6-openjdk 1061 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
2008-10-02T07:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	Okay, now set java-6-sun 63 as the default. Same command as before, except -s java-6-sun (and maybe the 63, I don't remember)
2008-10-02T07:20:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	I get a lot of "No alternative ... " msgs
2008-10-02T07:21:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	is there a simple re-installation of a browser *with* java already installed route I could take??
2008-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	threedee	bobertdos	in case this gets too involved
2008-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	threedee	Well, Firefox handles things a little more naturally.
