2005-05-20T08:42:00.000Z	allyn	lmh	are the monitors identical?
2005-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	lmh	allyn	yes, two HP L2035 LCDs, but for one i used the DVI - in, with the other one the VGA - in
2005-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	allyn	lmh	ok i was just noticing that your config in xorg.conf the 2 monitors have different settings for refresh rates
2005-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	allyn		does either of thm work the way you want it?
2005-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	lmh	allyn	thats because the vga-in has different values to the dvi -in
