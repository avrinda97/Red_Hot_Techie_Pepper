2011-05-15T11:04:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	Basically, just ask your question. :P I seen the lines you sent, but I have no idea what you were asking with them.
2011-05-15T11:05:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	This, under regular Ubuntu (as in not Kubuntu or similar)?
2011-05-15T11:06:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	Ah, you must have upgraded, no?
2011-05-15T11:06:00.000Z	pegatino	djr013	no.
2011-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	Do you have any PPA's configured?
2011-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	And what Ubuntu version is this with?
2011-05-15T11:08:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	Oh, sorry, not sure about that version, I don't stick with the LTS releases. :/
2011-05-15T11:10:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	My best suggestion would be to install aptitude and try configuring the needed packages with that (it's what I use), but it's a somewhat complex tool.
2011-05-15T11:15:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	If I had 10.04 around, I might be able to help, but I don't. :(
2011-05-15T11:15:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	Someone else might though.
2011-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	djr013	pegatino	I noticed you were speaking Spanish. If you're better in that language, you may find #ubuntu-es more natural to ask for help in?
2011-05-15T11:26:00.000Z	pegatino	djr013	# ubuntu-it will never help me, I'm trying their luck here.
2011-05-15T11:29:00.000Z	pegatino	djr013	Check it simulates the installation of libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0.
