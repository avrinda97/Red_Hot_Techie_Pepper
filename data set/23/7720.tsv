2005-06-28T07:10:00.000Z	ekCo		ok thansk
2005-06-28T07:10:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	the sh installer doesn't use the debian packaging method. you'll need to manually remove those files.
2005-06-28T07:11:00.000Z	ekCo	delire	how can i do this
2005-06-28T07:11:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	'updatedb && locate nvidia' to see what's there. i imagine you have many nvidia files in /usr/X11R6/lib
2005-06-28T07:12:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	what do you want to do btw?
2005-06-28T07:12:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	the end goal.
2005-06-28T07:13:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	they both install to the same place, but install in different ways. so, you've tried to overwrite them with the new files but it didn't work?
2005-06-28T07:13:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	and you're using the *.sh ?
2005-06-28T07:15:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	right. i would make note of all the files the installer wants to overwrite, remove them and then run the installer again.
2005-06-28T07:15:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	though you'll need to be very careful in the process.
2005-06-28T07:15:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	this is why people use packaging systems ;)
2005-06-28T07:16:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	do you really need the latest driver? why are you not happy using the ubuntu/*.deb package?
2005-06-28T07:16:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	are you sure you had direct rendering in the first place? is this with glxgears?
2005-06-28T07:17:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	use the command 'glxinfo | grep direct' to find out.
2005-06-28T07:17:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	right..
2005-06-28T07:17:00.000Z	ekCo	delire	cant atm, leafb0x@ekCo:~$ glxinfo | grep direct
2005-06-28T07:20:00.000Z	ekCo	delire	anything i can now do?
2005-06-28T07:20:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	copy /var/log/Xorg.0.log to a pastebin
2005-06-28T07:22:00.000Z	ekCo	delire	^
2005-06-28T07:29:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	sudo
2005-06-28T07:29:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	ok
2005-06-28T07:29:00.000Z	delire	ekCo	when you run the nvidia installer script, do you get any errors? is there a log file we can look at?
