2009-07-20T05:41:00.000Z	marks256		I had a samba share sharing a folder across my network. it stopped working after i networked my printer. now my printer works over the network, but no more folder share. any help will be greatly appreciated.
2009-07-20T05:42:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	is it possible that you changed the workgroup in /etc/samba/smb.conf?
2009-07-20T05:42:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	nope workgroup has stayed the same.
2009-07-20T05:43:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	i set up the share by right clicking on the folder and doing sharing options though... where is the config file for that?
2009-07-20T05:46:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	im not sure, it looks like they are all handled by the package nautilus-share
2009-07-20T05:46:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	ok i'll look into that and see if there are any config files that may have been altered
2009-07-20T05:47:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	looks like they are added to samba @ /var/lib/samba/usershares
2009-07-20T05:49:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	yep they are there. wonder why they don't show on the network...
2009-07-20T05:49:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	dont know, can you access them from there?
2009-07-20T05:49:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	what do you mean?
2009-07-20T05:50:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	can you view the contents from within those folders?
2009-07-20T05:50:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	yes. the weird thing is, print$ doesn't even show up on the network... it is like my system has vanished, yet i can still use the print share?
2009-07-20T05:50:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	have you restarted since this all has started happening?
2009-07-20T05:51:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	yes. it stopped working a few weeks ago when i networked my printer
2009-07-20T05:51:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	i've just been putting my videos on a jump drive, but i'm tired of that and want my share back :)
2009-07-20T05:53:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	unfortunately im not too sure why thats happening to you
2009-07-20T05:54:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	darn :( well thanks for the help anyway :)
2009-07-20T05:54:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	np, if i think of something else ill let you know
2009-07-20T05:55:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	ok thanks. if i find the solution i'll be sure to let you know
2009-07-20T06:09:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	my system shows up on network now, but when i open it, there are no items in there. not even $print
2009-07-20T06:09:00.000Z	mattgyver	marks256	are you on 9.04, i have a similiar issue i believe on my laptop
2009-07-20T06:09:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	yes 9.04
2009-07-20T06:10:00.000Z	marks256	mattgyver	did it work at one time on your laptop?
