2005-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	karljp		but yes, to clarify, LVM setup is offered at install time with ubuntu 5.04
2005-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	karljp		except the security patch,
2005-05-04T13:02:00.000Z	karljp		cos the firelinking poc still works

2005-05-04T13:02:00.000Z	karljp		well :)
2005-05-04T13:02:00.000Z	karljp		whatever works for you you then
2005-05-04T13:04:00.000Z	karljp		seveas: are they dropping in gcc4?
2005-05-04T13:04:00.000Z	karljp		woo, I think I'm really going to like ubuntu
2005-05-04T13:04:00.000Z	karljp		debian was so smartly designed, but the world of living in sarge was just crap
2005-05-04T13:05:00.000Z	Seveas	karljp	indeed and ubuntu fills that gap :)
2005-05-04T13:16:00.000Z	Seveas	karljp	that's not completely true
