2005-02-17T16:11:00.000Z	FAST		anyone know why samba cant handle shared folders from an external firewire hard drive>
2005-02-17T16:12:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	what filesystem? this works for a 160G ext3 external firewire partition here...
2005-02-17T16:13:00.000Z	FAST	anti_	its a fat32 fs on the external
2005-02-17T16:13:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	ours mountable by nfs, smb.
2005-02-17T16:14:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	exactly what's the problem?
2005-02-17T16:18:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	hm.. the linux-side rights on the folder are ok?
2005-02-17T16:18:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	ls -ld  /media/sda1/folder
2005-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	FAST	anti_	looks like chmod on the firewire folder didn't work,   ls -ld shows no change! yikes
2005-02-17T16:38:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	hmm. but it has been mounted by pmount... so no fstab entry...
2005-02-17T16:44:00.000Z	FAST	anti_	do you think i can make a symbolic link to the folder ?
2005-02-17T16:44:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	I think I would umount the partition, create a mountpoint (/mnt/something) and remount it by hand.
2005-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	you could make a symlink, but that would not help you. as symlinks' filemodes are not looked at.
2005-02-17T16:47:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	"sudo lsof /media/sda1" shows the processes that are using the partition.
2005-02-17T16:47:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	stop those processes, and it ain't busy anymore.
2005-02-17T16:49:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	kill that famd instance.
2005-02-17T16:50:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	I'd first create the mountpoint, and try the mount by hand.
2005-02-17T16:52:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	"mkdir /mnt/fw; mount -t vfat -o  /mnt/fw /dev/sda1"
2005-02-17T16:53:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	then ls -ld /mnt/fw to see if the modes look better.
2005-02-17T16:55:00.000Z	FAST	anti_	im trying to 'sudo mount -t vfat -o /media/hermes /dev/sda1
2005-02-17T16:56:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	I wouldnt create the mountpoint in /media...
2005-02-17T17:07:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	you can now put a line in fstab to have your drive mounted at boot time.
2005-02-17T17:09:00.000Z	FAST	anti_	should the umask option have a value for it?
2005-02-17T17:11:00.000Z	anti_	FAST	default should do.
