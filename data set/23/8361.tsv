2004-10-19T09:45:00.000Z	Jaramin		LeeColletonL: is running as root under linux any worse than running as an admin on windows? if the answer is no, then that's fine with me :)
2004-10-19T09:45:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	your user has sudo privs
2004-10-19T09:48:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	ease of use, that's what I need. the ability to make a user do everything root can, without issuing any commands. I'm all for GUI, sorry if that's disturbing for you guys :P
2004-10-19T09:48:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	then just have the files open with gksudo gedit if you feel that way
2004-10-19T09:50:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	yeah, well that's waht I did with the shortcut to nautilus, but that effectively *makes* me root, so when I trash stuff, it goes into root's trash, not mine... see where I'm going?
2004-10-19T09:50:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	no it doesn't
2004-10-19T09:54:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	that is what sudo is
2004-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	it does, try it. I have changed my nautilus shortcut by adding gksudo. with that, I can open a nautilus window that will allow me to edit files right on the spot by double cliking. but, let's say I change folder from that window, and go delete some log files. well they end up in root's trash.
2004-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	no, not without using sudo
2004-10-19T10:09:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	*deception*
2004-10-19T10:09:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	not quite
2004-10-19T11:41:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	yes
2004-10-19T11:46:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	with a nautilus script yea. 
2004-10-19T11:46:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	cool, got any place to get me started?
2004-10-19T11:47:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	hmm yea just a sec
2004-10-19T11:52:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	it needs to be an executable to show up
2004-10-19T11:53:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
2004-10-19T11:57:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	yep, that's the right path
2004-10-19T12:08:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	googling stuff for scripts, found interesting stuff, script has to handle selction of multiple files with spaces in the file names...
2004-10-25T11:48:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	why don't you just get rid of the spaces while inside of the script
2004-10-25T11:50:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	can't because the spaces are actually the separators of the file names that Nautilus passes to the script :(
2004-10-25T11:55:00.000Z	joem	Jaramin	what is the purpose of the script?
2004-10-25T11:57:00.000Z	Jaramin	joem	to get the selected files and sudo move them to the trash bin
