2011-02-19T15:32:00.000Z	amit		some one tell me channel for fedora
2011-02-19T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	#fedora
2011-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	yes
2011-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	sure can
2011-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	plz explain how to is there is no problem
2011-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	it's a 64bit cpu, so you can use a 64bit version of ubuntu
2011-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	core 2 duo is 64 bit
2011-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	m using 32bit os now
2011-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	running dual linux distribtuions with ubuntu using grub2 is not an easy task due to the way it works and conflicts with other distros' grubs
2011-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	I would strongly advise you to keep both distros on seperate physical disks
2011-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	in what way
2011-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	it's complex to explain, but two distros' cannot share the same grub2 config due to how ubuntu has designed it's config,
2011-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	so there will always be a fight
2011-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	this never used to be a problem with grub and a shared /boot, but now grub2 uses /etc on the host computer which the other host cannot access, it is a problem
2011-07-08T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	passwwd -l root will lock the account again
2011-07-08T17:15:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	is it passwd -l root??
2011-07-08T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	yes
2011-07-08T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	if you are not root already, yes, you will
2011-07-08T17:16:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	when i try that it says passwd: password expiry information changed.
2011-07-08T17:16:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	ok, it's done
2011-07-08T17:16:00.000Z	amit	ikonia	ok
2011-07-08T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	amit	there are firefox plugins for it
