2010-11-26T01:01:00.000Z	fnmueller		hi, I would like to be able tu run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade" via sudo without a password for my user "fnmueller". So I created a bash file in /home/fnmueller/bin/scripts/system_update.sh which works perfectly if called manually. However, I wanted a shorter way to call the script, so I put "alias pcupdate='/home/fnmueller/bin/scripts/system_update.sh'" in my ~\.bashrc. So what do I have to do to make that work password
2010-11-26T01:01:00.000Z	fnmueller		less in combination with sudo?
2010-11-26T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	if you want to cron (schedule) the job, cron it as root and it won't need a password
2010-11-26T01:03:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	I don't want to cron my system update, I want to do it manually ;-)
2010-11-26T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	or you can mess with sudoers (risky) to make the command not need password (but will still need sudo)
2010-11-26T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	if you mess with sudoers and messit up, you will need to boot to rootrecovery mode to fix
2010-11-26T01:04:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	the only partthat I am missing is to get my .bashrc alias to work with sudo
2010-11-26T01:05:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	btw: I am not scared of a messed up sudoers file, which btw, I doubt will happen if I use visudo
2010-11-26T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	if you make a symlink to your script in /usr/bin then it will be usable in sudoers. I don't believe sudoers honours aliases
2010-11-26T01:07:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	grrr, I have somehting like a "running" home that replicates over many machines.... therefore, I will not be able to put aything into /usr/bin
2010-11-26T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	you could add your scripts folder to $PATH
2010-11-26T01:08:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	true, but would that change the sudo problem?
2010-11-26T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	btw, you don't need the .sh on the end of scripts. It doesn't tell the OS its a script
2010-11-26T01:09:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	I know, but that way I now in 10 years from now what I intended ;-)
2010-11-26T01:10:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	I don't like the script soluteoin btw, as it counteracts the sudo principle. I would rather just enable that update && upgrade command in sudo
2010-11-26T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	then the interpretter will find the commnd in the folder and run it, let's you execute it from anywhere, look into visudo and sudoers but tread carefully
2010-11-26T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	well, the command to enable would be apt-get but this will enable anyone and any malicious javascript to run apt-get
2010-11-26T01:12:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	well, I can split up apt-get to run just for one user, just I can't make it run scripted after that
2010-11-26T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	you should research. The sudoers file is extremely sensitive
2010-11-26T01:14:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	I did, that is why I came here, and as I said, my sudoers file works perfectly
2010-11-26T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	that's all I know, considering how the command is ran,afew. More keypresses can't hurt....
2010-11-26T01:15:00.000Z	fnmueller	ActionParsnip	well, I am nerd, I want it my keypress way
2010-11-26T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fnmueller	that's all I got
