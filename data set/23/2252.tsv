2009-05-17T06:19:00.000Z	EricJ1186		I am trying to update to this one driver I have on my desktop
2009-05-17T06:19:00.000Z	EricJ1186		it's called NVIDIA-Linux-x86-180.51-pkg1.run
2009-05-17T06:19:00.000Z	EricJ1186		how do I do that?
2009-05-17T06:20:00.000Z	EricJ1186		the Nvidia site said to simply run sh [file name]
2009-05-17T06:20:00.000Z	EricJ1186		so what do I need to do?
2009-05-17T06:22:00.000Z	EricJ1186		I type that all on one line, correct?
2009-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	EricJ1186		it loaded a bit then said "E: couldn't find package linux-headers-uname -r
2009-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	EricJ1186		I just installed my Creative X-Fi
2009-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	EricJ1186		wait what?
2009-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	EricJ1186		I was replying to pw-toxic
2009-05-17T06:24:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	can you  hear sound with your x-fi at the moment?
2009-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	EricJ1186	pw-toxic	I think I had that, what you have to do is once you install the drivers, select your sound card from the preferences>sound menu
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	maybe i misunderstood you, but i just told you that i tried the "test" button of the "preferences->sound" interface
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	EricJ1186	pw-toxic	correct, I had that same error
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	and how did you fix it? ;)
2009-05-17T07:10:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	but there is one very important point: i need to set all sound with low frequency to my subwoofer...  is there a possibliity to do this?
2009-05-17T07:11:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	i have no bass at all ;(
2009-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	do you know if there is 5.1 support with the linux driver of x-fi?
2009-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	german ubuntu forum says "no 5.1" ;(  it it seems that creative wont release further versions to support it ;(  damnit... do you know a good soundcard with 5.1 with good drivers and some options?
2009-05-17T07:19:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	anyway .. i watch blue rays and it is nearly impossible to watch real blue rays on linux (its possible.. but hard to achieve)
2009-05-17T07:19:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	so i will always need windows xp ;//
2009-05-17T07:20:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	but i can play world of warcraft and poker on ubuntu ;))
2009-05-17T07:35:00.000Z	pw-toxic	EricJ1186	do you have any experience with a microphone using your x-fi under ubuntu?
