2012-09-14T02:11:00.000Z	Offlein		I am using xbindkeys to rebind my audio play/pause key to send a custom command to a program that doesn't catch it by default. I also want it to do the original command as well, but I don't know how to make it send the "default" command -- does anyone know?
2012-09-14T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	what's the default command?
2012-09-14T02:13:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	I don't know. But it play/pauses all normal media players
2012-09-14T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	it's probably just some other daemon catching it
2012-09-14T02:14:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	Right! Is there any sort of way to trace down what is catching it?
2012-09-14T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	I don't know of a good way offhand.  But maybe try having your xbindkeys command emit that button press again (I think this will put it in some infinite loop, but hey might as well try)
2012-09-14T02:15:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	yeah I suspect that will happen. But maybe if I have it emit that key first! And then do the next command.
2012-09-14T02:15:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	I guess the next question is how to trigger a keyboard command via a script
2012-09-14T02:16:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	there are a few options.  You can use xmacroplay or xvkbd for example
2012-09-14T02:17:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	Right on. Thank you. Seems like there are a ton. I'll try it!
2012-09-14T02:17:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	an xvkbd example: /usr/bin/xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\[Control_L]\[Page_Up]    And an xmacroplay example: echo ButtonPress 2 | xmacroplay -d 0 :0.0   (I don't know if either will work for you)
2012-09-14T02:19:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	and yeah I'd be surprised if it doesn't start looping.  If it does the only thing I can think of doing is looking at all the running programs you have for your user, guess which one might be handling key presses, and then looking for documentation.  I haven't used unity/gnome in a while though, so I'm not sure.  It may even be cooked into the window manager or something which would make it more of a
2012-09-14T02:19:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	Understood. I bet it's cooked into Unity or Compiz.
2012-09-14T02:20:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	reading through http://wiki.videolan.org/DBus-spec might give some hints on the dbus front
2012-09-14T02:20:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	danke
2012-09-14T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	also, check out the mpris-remote package.  It may not be exactly how the media players are controlled now, but it may let you accomplish the same thing (control a bunch of media players in a uniform way (which is actually the goal of mpris))
2012-09-14T02:24:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	I think I may have it!
2012-09-14T02:24:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	I will look into that if not
2012-09-14T02:25:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	seemingly if I do this command: dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.PlayPause specifically Clementine will play/pause. So I may be able to work with this
2012-09-14T02:25:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1797848 script for controlling dbus that may give additional hints
2012-09-14T02:25:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	ok, I will stop spamming you now :)
2012-09-14T02:25:00.000Z	Offlein	jrib	.......Well this last script does 100% exactly what I wanted.
2012-09-14T02:26:00.000Z	jrib	Offlein	I'd still check out mpris-remote though
