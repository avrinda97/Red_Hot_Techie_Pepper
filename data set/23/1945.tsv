2009-08-27T02:15:00.000Z	DJCharlie		Can someone please help me configure my eth1 to run directly off my DSL modem?
2009-08-27T02:16:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	what does eth0 run off?
2009-08-27T02:16:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	eth0 is on my local lan.
2009-08-27T02:20:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	you need some iptables and firewall rules to protect your samba share on the lan
2009-08-27T02:23:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	you could add a line to that inet eth1 that says gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
2009-08-27T02:30:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	there is a command line option for --no-gateway    pump eth1 --no-gateway
2009-08-27T02:30:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	or    pump eth0 --no-gateway
2009-08-27T02:31:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	pump: no extra parameters are expected

2009-08-27T02:32:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	maybe   pump -i eth0 --no-gateway
2009-08-27T02:38:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	let me see if I can access your lan from here
2009-08-27T02:38:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	i'm on my lan with this ip.
2009-08-27T02:39:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	i'm kidding.. you should check it from a remote host if you can
2009-08-27T02:40:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	that's good security
2009-08-27T02:41:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	the whole reason behind this was that our net radio station has grown too large to share a connection with us. :)
2009-08-27T02:41:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	you're doing a good job
2009-08-27T02:42:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	ty. :)
2009-08-27T02:44:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	my dad lives in Maysville.. you're not my half brother are you?
2009-08-27T02:53:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	a favor please?
2009-08-27T02:54:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	my dad lives in Maysville.. you're not my half brother are you?
2009-08-27T02:54:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	not as far as I know. :)
2009-08-27T02:54:00.000Z	DJCharlie	bucky	can you try pinging kjsr.ath.cx please, and tell me the IP you get?
2009-08-27T02:56:00.000Z	bucky	DJCharlie	did you get that?
