2006-10-05T16:39:00.000Z	hockyhair		what is a cmd that will show all current remote connections?
2006-10-05T16:41:00.000Z	hockyhair		kthx
2006-10-05T16:41:00.000Z	hockyhair		happen to know of a volume applet i could use with pypanel
2006-10-05T16:42:00.000Z	hockyhair		any volume applet will work i just dont know the names, i want something i can control the vol with
2006-10-05T16:43:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	doesnt the homepage of pypanel got any list of applets ?
2006-10-05T16:43:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	no
2006-10-05T06:13:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	maybe cause they dont know what they are doing ?
2006-10-05T06:13:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	and its a lot easier to install from repo or from dapper deb package...
2006-10-05T06:14:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	ubuntu will keep kernel uptodate if you choose not to do it manually?
2006-10-05T06:15:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	yes... (uptodate = fixing bugs)
2006-10-05T06:16:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	and that "self compiling" doesn just mean ubuntu, an all distros its better to use their package managers, after all, thats why they where invented...
2006-10-05T06:17:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	but there are programs that dont have packages or are in repos for ubuntu, so there the only way is to compile by yourself (and it really aint rocket-science)
2006-10-05T06:18:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	what about as far as security, i noticed that the current kernel package after doing update/upgrade is still older than what's avail
2006-10-05T06:19:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	and what makes you think "older" is bad ?
2006-10-05T06:20:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	actually its otherway round, older is more secure, as more people has tested it (imho)
2006-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	and even that the kernel in ubuntu seems "older" than the vanilla kernel, there are many fixes in ubuntus kernel (i heard)
2006-10-05T06:23:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	or have you found a bug in dappers kernel ?
2006-10-05T06:25:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	thanks, i gotta run..
2006-10-11T16:23:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	one way could be adding "cd /where/you/want/to/go" to the end of ~/.bashrc
2006-10-11T16:24:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	ty!
2006-10-11T16:25:00.000Z	hockyhair	oskude	do you use gnome or better yet beryl by chance?
2006-10-11T16:26:00.000Z	oskude	hockyhair	beryl support is at #ubuntu-xgl (as ubotu told you)
