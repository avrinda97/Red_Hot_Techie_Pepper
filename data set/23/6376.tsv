2006-04-28T15:40:00.000Z	searunner		hey there I need to download the ubuntu5.10 kernel source to this winxp box, where can I find a web page with a link i can click on to download the kernel source
2006-04-28T15:41:00.000Z	graft	searunner	why do you need kernel source?
2006-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	graft	searunner	why don't you just install from a CD or something?
2006-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	graft	searunner	what're you going to do with the kernel source?
2006-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	graft	searunner	can you explain more fully what you're hoping to accomplish, here? so we can try and understand what your problem really is?
2006-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	graft	searunner	wtf are you going to do with the kernel source on a winxp box, without gcc, without gnu c libs, without anything you need to compile it?
2006-04-28T15:48:00.000Z	graft	searunner	you can download whatever debs you want from packages.ubuntu.com and put 'em on a CD
2006-04-28T15:57:00.000Z	graft	searunner	just search for the package you need via the normal search mechanism and download it from its package page
2006-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	graft	searunner	um. no it's not.
2006-04-29T16:00:00.000Z	graft	searunner	i mean the packages.ubuntu.com search page
2006-04-29T16:04:00.000Z	graft	searunner	what kernel are you running?
2006-04-29T16:14:00.000Z	searunner	graft	the kernel that comes with the edubuntu386 iso.  as a reminder im looking for which krenel pacakage to download.
2006-04-29T16:15:00.000Z	graft	searunner	type uname -r in the shell and let usknow what it says
2006-04-29T16:15:00.000Z	graft	searunner	um. can you run it?
2006-04-29T16:16:00.000Z	graft	searunner	wait... i thought you said the box had no network card?
2006-04-29T16:17:00.000Z	graft	searunner	what's the card? i'd be surprised if it wasn't supported
2006-04-29T16:19:00.000Z	graft	searunner	ah. so okay, i get it now. you want to enable your onboard nforce network card in ubuntu, and you need to build the driver for it. cool. thanks for making that clear so long ago
2006-04-29T16:21:00.000Z	searunner	graft	I thought when I entered that line 4 times it may have been clear
2006-04-29T16:23:00.000Z	searunner	graft	so now that you're clear on my problem and objective perhaps you have some info to make that happen
2006-04-29T16:25:00.000Z	graft	searunner	if you don't know what kernel you're running, this is going to be really difficult to tell you waht to download
2006-04-29T16:26:00.000Z	graft	searunner	but the standard breezy kernel is here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/devel/linux-source-2.6.12
2006-04-29T16:26:00.000Z	graft	searunner	and that ought to be all you need, yes
2006-04-29T16:27:00.000Z	graft	searunner	assuming you're using nvidia's tarball from their website
