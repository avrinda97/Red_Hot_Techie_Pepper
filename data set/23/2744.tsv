2009-02-14T23:36:00.000Z	Evilrick		I got a problem with 8.04 HH, as of a few weeks ago my removable media stopped automounting. MMC cards USB disks and the CD rom drive. I can still mount them manually with sudo mount so its not a hardware issue. If I log into Gnome as root then the automounting works. I have checked my settings in gconf-editor and the settings in my user administration tool. Any Ideas? here are my subsystem...
