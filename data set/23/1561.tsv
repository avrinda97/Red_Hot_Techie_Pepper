2011-05-12T08:23:00.000Z	mickey		can a vpn hide ur internet activity from a network administrator?
2011-05-12T08:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	well, aside from the fact that it will be obvious, yes.
2011-05-12T08:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	your network admin will be able to see lots of encrypted garbage traffic. It will be obvious that it's a SSH tunnel or VPN connection but they won't be able to see what you're doing.
2011-05-12T08:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	They can still also guess based on the bandwidth shape that you're streaming/torrenting but that would still be hard.
2011-05-12T08:27:00.000Z	mickey	magn3ts	do u know of a tutorial i could use to set that up?
2011-05-12T08:27:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	depends, exactly what are you triyng to do? There's lots of different ways of going about it.
2011-05-12T08:28:00.000Z	mickey	magn3ts	i'm trying to torrent annonymously and also hide internet activity
2011-05-12T08:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	Do you trust your endpoint?
2011-05-12T08:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	do you have a VPN provider in mind? Or do you have a PC at home that you trust as safe?
2011-05-12T08:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	to do a VPN, you need someone who's going to provide you with an endpoint, eventually your torrent has to connect to the wide internet.
2011-05-12T08:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	I think ThePirateBay runs a VPN, I don't know if it's any good or how expensive it is.
2011-05-12T08:30:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	is this making sense? I can try to find a picture if it would hlep.
2011-05-12T08:30:00.000Z	mickey	magn3ts	so i would set up my desktop at home as the client?
2011-05-12T08:31:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	What internet traffic are you trying to hide? Home Computer -> internet? Laptop->Internet? Phone->Internet?
2011-05-12T08:32:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	yes, but I'm not sure you understand how this works. Let me show you :)
2011-05-12T08:33:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	[Your Computer (96.255.210.90)] ----VPN---> [Ipredator account (1.2.3.4)]  -----> Internet.
2011-05-12T08:34:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	this way, all of your traffic to the Internet comes out of the IP Address 1.2.3.4. The "Internet" at large doesn't know where that traffic originally came from.
2011-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	it's not softare, it's a VPN account on a remote computer.
2011-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	if the software was on your computer, it would still come from your IP Address, and thus not be anonymous.
2011-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	the internet isn't an anonymous place. When content goes out to the Internet, it has to originate somewhere. It's basically like driving to another town to mail a package anonymously... You're sending your traffic to another server and then it sends it out and pretends to be the origin to hide your identity.
2011-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	the picture here isn't fantastic, but it might help: https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en
2011-05-12T08:38:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	if you make a VPN connection to an iPredator server, it MIGHT be encrypted... it depends on what type of VPN it is. I believe all are encrypted by default.
2011-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	mickey	can you PM me, or I will PM you, we need to take this out of #ubuntu
