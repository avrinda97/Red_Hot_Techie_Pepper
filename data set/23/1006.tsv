2010-10-13T16:26:00.000Z	pea[0]		how do you login to root to the gui?
2010-10-13T16:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	why?
2010-10-13T16:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	which files?
2010-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	files that are wehre?
2010-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	gksudo nautilus ,but be careful with that
2010-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	you don't want to delete stuff you shoudn't or move stuff in the wrong place for exmaple
2010-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	also permissions can be annoying yes, but they are there from a reason, to keep your system safe, and that does mean from you from the user as well
2010-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	if you do certain stupid things,  you might get some issue
2010-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	right, but even so
2010-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	if you move files around into the wrong places for example, depending on what they are, you might be able to mess your system up a little bit
2010-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	pea[0]	sebsebseb	yes, well as i said, this is linux, not windows
2010-10-13T16:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	also you don't really need to do anything,  except with /home  and maybe extenrlah ard disks
2010-10-13T16:30:00.000Z	pea[0]	sebsebseb	please don't spam me
2010-10-13T16:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	you should learn a bit about permissions, and probably about the file system a bit and how it works
2010-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	things can mess up with Ubuntu as well, things can mess up with any operating system when stupid stuff is done,  no operating system is 100% perfect
2010-10-13T16:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	that you can't do certain stuff just like that, with certain files and folders, is becsue of security, and that does mean, from you the user
2010-10-13T16:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	that you can't just do,  you can do stuff with those files though, if you know how, but there are ways to do stuff with those files, and ways not to as well
2010-10-13T16:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	 you the user,  are actsually the biggest risk to an operating system going wrong,  not malicious computer hackers/blackats (media call them hackers, that is wrong)
2010-10-13T16:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	thats blackhats I did a typo
2010-10-13T16:35:00.000Z	pea[0]	sebsebseb	i promise not to steal my own money when i hack into my own computer and steal my own credit card details
2010-10-13T16:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	no its not so much about that
2010-10-13T16:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	is about you moving files that you shoudn't for example, or accidently deleting them,  that you need for your Ubuntu install to work properly
2010-10-13T16:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pea[0]	however doing stuff with LAMP files,  will probably be ok yeah
