2011-05-25T11:43:00.000Z	vexati0n		okay.... at first i was afraid of Unity, then I was like 'hey this ain't so bad,' and now i hate the living crap out of it.
2011-05-25T11:43:00.000Z	vexati0n		somebody help me fix it
2011-05-25T11:44:00.000Z	vexati0n		no no, i like the idea of unity.... i just wish it would, you know, work right.
2011-05-25T11:44:00.000Z	vexati0n		i have 3 major issues with it....
2011-05-25T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	log off and log into gnome classic session, it will look and run just like maverick dide
2011-05-25T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	i've heard people with dual heads not liking unity
2011-05-25T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	what, because of a single feature which doesn't need to run. Doubt it
2011-05-25T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	look at the bug lists for windows my friend, you'll see its just as bad
2011-05-25T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	works flawlessly here for the last 6 years
2011-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	the 4 years before that were bumpy, but its pretty smooth now
2011-05-25T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	well yes but look at the money difference between the companies making the OS. As well as the support from manufacturers compared to Windows
2011-05-25T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	then use the clasic desktop and you will get that
2011-05-25T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	use something else, wifi-radar and wicd both exist
2011-05-25T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	then you don't even need it and you can just let it pick up dhcp naturally
2011-05-25T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	unless you have some vpn / special dns servers you want to use
2011-05-25T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	for wired connections I use /etc/network/interfaces file, its great if you need to edit the address of a system as you can edit the file and restart the networking service
2011-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	vexati0n	ActionParsnip	or I can just edit network-manager connections, and click on the right menu entry. way easier.
2011-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	super handy as you can do it over ssh too, rather than having to use bloated VNC or pysically attend the system
2011-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	i think its really oafish
2011-05-25T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	wicd also has an ncurses UI which you can run over ssh too
2011-05-25T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	shame
2011-05-25T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	its just slower
2011-05-25T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vexati0n	could use quicksynergy
