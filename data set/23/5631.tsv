2006-10-22T11:34:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	nolimitsoya	./Sigh. And here I thought I was going blind. xD
2006-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	nolimitsoya	I think I found a way. ^^
2006-12-19T12:19:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	no i cant :P i took a guess :)
2006-12-19T13:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	yes, it does :)
2006-12-19T13:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	that is... ive never seem a failed drive without smartlogs telling me there is some serious issues, but not all of them have been able to warn, since the problem struck like lightning
2006-12-19T13:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	of course, if you scratch up your discs with a headcrash, smart couldnt possibly have forseen that.
2006-12-21T13:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	anyone who is able to use it without doing rm -rf on / is to be considered "good at sudo" :)
2006-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	nolimitsoya	how would that read? 'I'd like to file a bug' 'With?' 'Ubuntu' 'What about Ubuntu' 'ALL of it.' ;P
2006-12-24T13:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Music_Shuffle	file a bug on naming, stating that its inconsistent and confusing. if noone likes the idea, itll be dropped. at least itll stirr up some debate
2006-12-24T13:20:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	nolimitsoya	not like I don't dream about being paid to offer my $.02 every few hours. ;P
