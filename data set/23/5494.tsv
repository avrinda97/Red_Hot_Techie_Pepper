2007-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	are you wanting to learn from the inside out or for casual use?
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	so you want to be able to count on your linux computer to do all the things you need to do, not just a secondary hobby desk
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	yeah, for home home use Ubuntu will be great.
2007-04-08T10:48:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	so I see what you are wanting to do. ubuntu will be perfect for you.
2007-04-08T10:48:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	ok know i noe how
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	yeah
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	that way it bleeps me when you hit me back...
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	it rocks
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	what distribution do you use
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	ubuntu 6.10
2007-04-08T10:50:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	and slackware 11
2007-04-08T10:51:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	i also try to use slackware but i had a hrd time trying to install it
2007-04-08T10:52:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	have you already installed ubuntu?
2007-04-08T10:52:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	yes, i am using the 7.04 version
2007-04-08T10:58:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	one piece of knowledge for you, Ubuntu comes "clean" and free. To enable AVI video playback, flash/mp3 encoding, and many other multi-media related abilities you will have to install non-free software, which means 1)enable unsupported (and sometimes dangerous) software downloads in /etc/apt/sources.list 2)sudo apt-get install...[non-free software titles here] 
2007-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	thanks i was looking for freeware version of the winamp, do you know about any  version for linux
2007-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	this is usually safe by and large, but my advice is to disable those non-free software sources when you have the basic stuff you need for a working multi-media system to keep your system as close to stable as possible. Thats all.
2007-04-08T11:01:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	By "version for linux" do you mean software that pretty much does all the same stuff?
2007-04-08T11:01:00.000Z	bingnet	josh_	You won't find it in a single program for linux, but Amarok or a fork from that project probably comes the closest
2007-04-08T11:02:00.000Z	josh_	bingnet	thanks
