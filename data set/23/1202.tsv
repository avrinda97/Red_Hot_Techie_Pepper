2010-07-09T05:14:00.000Z	lee__		Question, I deleted my linux partition in windows and when I reboot with the windows installation CD and select repair to fix the mbr it can't find the harddrive? But if I boot a live cd and look at Gparted I see the drive and the files right there. Anyone know what the problem can be?
2010-07-09T05:15:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	were you able to see the hdd using the windows cd before now?
2010-07-09T05:15:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	Didn't try
2010-07-09T05:16:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	if you're using a SATA hdd it's possible the windows cd doesn't have drivers for it - is it xp?
2010-07-09T05:16:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	 Yes
2010-07-09T05:17:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	 So i'm probably going to have to hook up maybe a usb floppy disk with drivers and press F6 right at the beginning of the windows cd startup
2010-07-09T05:17:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	you'll need to use something like nLite to slipstream the SATA drivers into a new cd - I haven't had too much success in the past
2010-07-09T05:18:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	 Oh that just sucks
2010-07-09T05:20:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	 So probably, when I first got my laptop if I had put in a windows XP cd, it would of told me it couldn't find the harddrive?
2010-07-09T05:21:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	or did this happen because I delete the linux partition?
2010-07-09T05:28:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	no it wouldnt've been due to you removing the linux part, it would've always happened
2010-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	Yea i'm reading about it now, this is crazy. This is the first time i'm trying this. the computer came with windows 7 but was downgraded to XP. I dual boot it with linux just messing around wanted to put windows back on it and now this problem.
2010-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	now you see why we use linux ;)
2010-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	Yep, this was a work computer. I just use linux at home.
2010-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	yeh try nLite - you may get lucky and the standard driver pack will support your hdd
2010-07-09T05:37:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	I'll try it tomorrow, Thanks. This is another problem with the Intel 82845G/GL/GE Chipset it doesn't work correctly with 10.04. All type of problems.
2010-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	does it flicker the screen when booting the livecd?
2010-07-09T05:40:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	thats whats interesting, the live cd works flawlessly, its once its installed. It never gets to the login screen, it show the cursor and then the cursors disappears and it just loops.
2010-07-09T05:41:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	you could try and boot with "nosplash nomodeset" and see if it gets you to a text login at least.
2010-07-09T05:43:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	I believed I tried that but that didn't work. I deleted the intel_drv.so driver then I was able to log on, problem was I couldn't change resolution. The highest was 1024x768.
2010-07-09T05:43:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	yeh it's painful, i'm trying to learn more about Xorg but it just doesn't seem to play nice with Ubuntu like it should
2010-07-09T05:44:00.000Z	acaire	lee__	might just have to keep asking the oracle (i.e. google ;))
2010-07-09T05:45:00.000Z	lee__	acaire	so the way i'm talking to you now, I downgraded and keep watch for a fix, but its just not the later version of ubuntu, it also happens in the latest version of fedora. Yep I checked here and there.
