2006-12-18T13:48:00.000Z	rajshekhar	kameron	:no its not on install cd
2006-12-18T13:49:00.000Z	kameron	rajshekhar	use apt-get to calculate dependencies for xmms. then download the binaries for xmms and any dependencies, put it on a medium and then to the other comp where you can install it.
2006-12-18T13:50:00.000Z	rajshekhar	kameron	: from where i can download xmms binaries
2006-12-18T13:51:00.000Z	kameron	rajshekhar	the binary is just the .deb file that ubuntu downloads when it installs it. are you on an ubuntu system now, or no?
2006-12-18T13:51:00.000Z	rajshekhar	kameron	 : yes
2006-12-18T13:52:00.000Z	kameron	rajshekhar	apt-get install xmms. then "locate xmms | grep deb" to find the deb for it. and i forget the command to just calculate dependencies for apt-get.. "man apt-get" to see what it is. i'm not on ubuntu right now or id check for oyu.

2006-12-18T13:59:00.000Z	kameron	rajshekhar	pastebin your "locate xmms | grep .deb" for me.
2006-12-18T14:01:00.000Z	kameron	rajshekhar	when i say "pastebin" i mean paste it on the paste website so we don't flood the channel. but anyways.
