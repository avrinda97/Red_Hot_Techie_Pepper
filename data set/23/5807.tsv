2006-10-15T07:19:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	(This for any network communication, you can't cloak your IP)
2006-10-15T07:20:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	Why can't I change my packages
2006-10-15T07:20:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	Huh?
2006-10-15T07:20:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	Change the headers of my packages
2006-10-15T07:20:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	How did we get from Telnet to packages?
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	Well, telnet has to send packages doesn't it?
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	packet
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	Yes, well doesn't the packet contain the IP of the original sender?
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	and why would you want to change the headers....
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	To mask my IP
2006-10-15T07:22:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	Your first problem is the fact that you are using Telnet
2006-10-15T07:23:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	How do
2006-10-15T07:23:00.000Z	Abst	Kyral	I still want to
2006-10-15T07:24:00.000Z	Kyral	Abst	Even if I knew how, I wouldn't tell you because then you'd be like "FECK! I'm not getting traffic! Now what!"
