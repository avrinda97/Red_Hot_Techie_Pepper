2008-05-02T20:38:00.000Z	jatt		is there a command to know which filesystem a given partition is using?
2008-05-02T20:39:00.000Z	fde	jatt	fdisk -l will tell you
2008-05-02T20:39:00.000Z	jatt	fde	thanks, I tried and I see:
2008-05-02T20:40:00.000Z	fde	jatt	cat /etc/mtab ... but don't edit that file ever.
2008-05-02T20:41:00.000Z	fde	jatt	any cutomizations to that file should be handled via /etc/fstab instead...
2008-05-02T20:42:00.000Z	jatt	fde	thanks! /etc/mtab is fine
2008-05-05T21:34:00.000Z	fde	jatt	that is supported by fglrx ... I had one, took back the box due to frustrations though.
2008-05-05T21:35:00.000Z	jatt	fde	cool will try the latest proprietary drivers!
2008-05-05T21:35:00.000Z	fde	jatt	There is of course no DRI support yet...
2008-05-05T21:35:00.000Z	fde	jatt	so you need to use the proprietary drivers...
2008-05-05T21:36:00.000Z	jatt	fde	what is DRI good for? I've never understood that. Can I have 3D without DRI?
2008-05-05T21:37:00.000Z	fde	jatt	DRI provides direct rendering... it is required to use the full capabilities of the hardware for any graphics card...
2008-05-05T21:37:00.000Z	fde	jatt	the fglrx and nvidia drivers support this... just make sure you load it via 'fglrx' in /etc/modules
2008-05-05T21:38:00.000Z	fde	jatt	but yeah... 'radeon' doesn't support your card because of the shared memory features of the 200M... they can't figure out what is accomplishing that...
2008-05-05T21:38:00.000Z	fde	jatt	It's lame, because the 200G works... heh
2008-05-05T21:38:00.000Z	jatt	fde	I see will try. The other problem I had with ati was hibernation... my laptop locked I briefly remember that had something to do with the graphics card. My next buy will have a nvidia card for sure :)
2008-05-05T21:39:00.000Z	fde	jatt	Probably you want to go through AMD actually, provided they've published their drivers by then... or Intel... Nvidia has no plans of opening anything.
2008-05-05T21:54:00.000Z	fde	jatt	Serves them right for allowing such connections.
2008-05-05T21:54:00.000Z	jatt	fde	hehe :)
2008-05-05T22:01:00.000Z	fde	jatt	hah
2008-05-06T20:16:00.000Z	fde	jatt	kinda overkill for a simple task... heh
2008-05-06T20:16:00.000Z	jatt	fde	I like gimp :)
2008-05-06T20:17:00.000Z	jatt	fde	but yes is an overkill only for screenshots, there is an applet to put in the panel I forgot the name though
