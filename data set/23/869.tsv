2011-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		Hey people! =D I'm new to ubuntu/linux and I have a few questions...
2011-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	ask away
2011-01-02T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	win7 can resize its own partitions, this will make unpartitioned space you can install ubuntu to and not use wubi
2011-01-02T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	also remember to MD5 test the ISO you download
2011-01-02T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	wubi makes a file in your ntfs partition and install ubuntu to that so it will be directly affected by the fragmentation which ntfs is very prone to
2011-01-02T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	if you read the screen then you will be fine#
2011-01-02T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	yep, it runs in wine
2011-01-02T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	same engine
2011-01-02T06:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	TFC was waaay better before all this steam nonesense, when counterstrike was a mod, more playable. Used to use uni connection and use 250Mb zip disks to transfer it :)
2011-01-02T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	you can usethe 1-2-3 usb installer from pendrivelinux or unetbootin to put the ISO on the USB to install with
2011-01-02T06:24:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	ActionParsnip	- Which is the preferred method if I'm to dual boot, though? or does it not matter?
2011-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	its an app to put ISOs on USB sticks and then makes them bootable
2011-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	still happens, depends on the distro if you ask me
2011-01-02T06:47:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	ActionParsnip	- I was using Debian.
2011-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	strange, they arent so bad. I used mandrake (back in the day) and they rocked :)
2011-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	ActionParsnip	- Cool! Did you ever try RedHat?
2011-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	yeah 5.0 for about 2 hours and hated it
2011-01-02T06:49:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	ActionParsnip	- Ah, I see. I heard pretty good things about it though.
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	steam runs well in wine
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	ActionParsnip	- is it really difficult to set up?
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	just install wine in software centre then run the installer for the game etc in wine
2011-01-02T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	your video chip will need to be abvle to run 3D accelleration under Linux (obviously)
2011-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Da_Rhyno	use the torrent, its faster
