2011-05-30T14:19:00.000Z	sklorpion		question - if i have system on /dev/sdc5 and i want to rebuild system to have only one new disk so it will be /dev/sdaX can i change this /dev/sdc5 to whatever i want?
2011-05-30T14:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 sdx5 would be the frst logical partition in the extended partition on the hard drive.. Primaries are 1-4, logicals are 5+
2011-05-30T15:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 you want sleep 20   then conky on the next line.. no & after sleep 20
2011-05-30T15:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 so perhaps   sleep 20           then  conky &
2011-05-30T15:15:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	i want that becouse of my problem with conky i found out that sometimes there might be some problems if u run conky during the start (i had diffrent window then when i run it manually), the answer was sleep 20 && conky but after this nothing happend
2011-05-30T15:16:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	so i want system to wait 20 sec and then start conky
2011-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 there should be no need to do 'sleep &&'
2011-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	i'll try to do simple script and put it in autostart of gnom
2011-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 'sleep 20'  should work.. sleep 20 &&  - runs the next command IF sleep returns a succss error code.
2011-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 sleep 20 &   -> is TOTALLY differnt.. it will run the command  and sleep in the background, then run the next command.. so sleep des nothing in that case
2011-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	yes but i cant solve my problem with out sleep. If conky starts with system/gnome it makes strange window not the same as if i start it manually
2011-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 i aways make a startconky.sjh script that  does sleep 20  then runs conky on the next line.
2011-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	all try to do mine then
2011-05-30T15:19:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	I'll*
2011-05-30T15:21:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	is it enought: #!/bin/bash
2011-05-30T15:27:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	works perfectly :]
2011-05-30T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 what does? :) I dont find recompiling stuff - worth the effort.
2011-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 i mentoned earlier that you dont need sleep 20 &&   unless you feel the need to have both commands on the same line..
2011-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	my script :] conky runs great!
2011-05-30T15:29:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	looks more pro :-) lol
2011-05-30T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sklorpion	 i doubt if you will gain much.. and spend a lot of time doing it..
2011-05-30T15:34:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	i found some info about it, ppl say that u can gain about 1-2% performerence :]
2011-05-30T15:50:00.000Z	sklorpion	Dr_Willis	is there some global log for errors/warnings from apllications? Those errors which are normally displeyed in terminal if u run them there.
