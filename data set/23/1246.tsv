2010-10-04T06:06:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx		I'm curios, if an audio cd is displayed as information about the cd and where each track starts (.cda) in windows, then how come it's a conveniently copyable .wav file in ubuntu? (and ready to convert with OggConvert and un-conveniently needed to re-name to .oga instead of ogg, hehe, lol, I'm drifting away in brackets!)
2010-10-04T06:08:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx		*sigh* any help?
2010-10-04T06:09:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 not sure exactly what your question is
2010-10-04T06:10:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 so are you asking why it's not a wav in windows, or why you have to encode it?
2010-10-04T06:11:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 no, i am not sure what your question actually is.
2010-10-04T06:12:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 re-pasting the original convoluted question will not help clarify.
2010-10-04T06:12:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 are you actually interested in figuring something out?
2010-10-04T06:13:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 you mentioned several different things in your question, so i'm not sure what to suggest.
2010-10-04T06:13:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 ubottu IS a bot
2010-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 you realize cddb is not the audio file format, right?
2010-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 cddb reads the disc layout.
2010-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 it does NOT read id3 tags and such.
2010-10-04T06:16:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 so your question is convoluted at best.
2010-10-04T06:16:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 start with wikipedia article on cddb
2010-10-04T06:16:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 you can encode the files with tags if format support them (e.g. mp3, ogg)
2010-10-04T06:17:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 but the two are not related in any way.
2010-10-04T06:17:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 if you can clarify what you are trying to do, or what your intent is, you may get more useful answers.
2010-10-04T06:24:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 you seem to want to fight bots. are you still working on the cd issue?
2010-10-04T06:25:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 you are trying to relate two things which are not related. cddb has nothing to do with audio file format.
2010-10-04T06:25:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 so what are you actually trying to do?
2010-10-04T06:25:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 there are trolls apparently.
2010-10-04T06:27:00.000Z	bobstro	xXEMO111Xx	 we'll settle for coherent, but yes please :)
2010-10-04T06:29:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx	bobstro	please pm me.
