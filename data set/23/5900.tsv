2006-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		Using dapper here: cannot login to gnome
2006-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		when I remove .gnome2 I can
2006-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		who's to blame?
2006-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		Ubuntu or Gnome?

2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	don't repeat
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	did it happen again?
2006-08-07T13:43:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	that's one of the reasons I don't use gnome. that has always happened for me from time to time for several years. gnome seems to dislike me
2006-08-07T13:43:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	mwe	i am starting to dislike gnome also
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	like if gnome crashed it wouldn't start normally again after that
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	unless I deleted the profile or some file in it
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	I forgot the name of the file to delete though
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	mwe	weird, gnome is indeed unstable
2006-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	I never figured why it kept happening to me. I didn't do anything to cause it as far as I can tell
2006-08-07T13:52:00.000Z	mwe	cs_DK_DK	ls -t will sort the output by modification time
2006-08-07T13:54:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	mwe	ok, thanks
2006-08-07T13:56:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	mwe	the keyrings directory is the sinner I think
2006-08-07T13:57:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	mwe	the weird thing is that I haven't added or changed any passwords
