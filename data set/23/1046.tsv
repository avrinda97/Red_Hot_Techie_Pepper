2011-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	how can i tell which flash I have?
2011-01-18T08:54:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	you installed flash through the ubuntu repos right?
2011-01-18T08:54:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	i believe so through flashplugin-installer
2011-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	then you have 32bit flash wrapped in nspluginwrapper
2011-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	here -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1414595
2011-01-18T08:58:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	i just removed then installed adobe x64 flash, but now it's saying I need to install flash
2011-01-18T08:59:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	you sure you have 64-bit ubuntu?

2011-01-18T09:01:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	is adobe flash in http://about:plugins ?
2011-01-18T09:02:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	chrome - no, firefox - no
2011-01-18T09:03:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	download this http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/flashplayer10_2_p3_64bit_linux_111710.tar.gz , unzip, and stick the file in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2011-01-18T09:05:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	okay, browsers play in windowed, but when trying to fullscreen, it crashed with the puzzle piece
2011-01-18T09:06:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	thats the best that flash can do. You tried in firefox?
2011-01-18T09:06:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	i never had this problem before
2011-01-18T09:06:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	anything major change?
2011-01-18T09:07:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	did you update any graphics drivers of any sofrt?
2011-01-18T09:08:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	hmm.  not in a bit, but now that you mention it, it seems like the same time frame since I last compiled them that i started seeing this error.  But 3d works, and so do games etc
2011-01-18T09:08:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	the problem with flash is that its quite finky, and breaks easily
2011-01-18T09:08:00.000Z	nikitis	sandyd	i'll try and redo my graphics drivers
2011-01-18T09:09:00.000Z	sandyd	nikitis	see if you can replicate what you had before you last compiled them
