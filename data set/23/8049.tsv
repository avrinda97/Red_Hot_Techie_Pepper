2008-04-04T05:26:00.000Z	bhsx		any ideas on how to start a full X session over ssh on another tty? (startx -- :1, for example, but over ssh)
2008-04-04T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 you can see the remote terminal from where you are sitting, and dont want to reach for its keyboard or what?
2008-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	bhsx	Dr_willis	 my daughter is using the desktop
2008-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	bhsx		i want to use it for bittorrent and some other stuff while she's using it
2008-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	bhsx		i'm on my laptop with wireless and a smaller disk
2008-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	bhsx		and dont want to use BT on the laptop
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 you can ssh -X remotemachine and run an app - it will appear locally.
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	bhsx	Dr_willis	gee thanks.....
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 or install vncserver, and have a remote desktop in a window on your current desktopp easially enough.
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	bhsx		let me repeat...
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	bhsx		any ideas on how to start a full X session over ssh on another tty? (startx -- :1, for example, but over ssh)
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	bhsx		i KNOW how to forward X
2008-04-04T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 that SOUNDS like you want a 2nd desktop to appear on HEr machine.. that will interfear with her using it...
2008-04-04T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 so what you are stating is not making sence to me.
2008-04-04T05:30:00.000Z	bhsx		i'm asking how to forward a FULL xsession to a second TTY on my laptop
2008-04-04T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 a full x session - use xdmcp.
2008-04-04T05:30:00.000Z	bhsx		yes, now how do i send that to -- :1?
2008-04-04T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	as a quick way to do somthing similer to that. Ive spawned a minimal X session on the local box, then in a single terminal, ssh -X remote, then run the window manager.
2008-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	bhsx	Dr_willis	not as smooth as I'd like,  but that'll work... i'm looking for a more elegant solution
2008-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 enable XDMCP on the desktop. the KDM/GDM login screen have a 'start remote session' feature
2008-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	but enabling tha will require you to restart X on her machine.
2008-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	bhsx	Dr_willis	yeah i'm very familiar with xdmcp from using LTSP for years
2008-04-04T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bhsx	 i keep my torrent client going inside a vncsedksop on my remote machine. that way it stays running
