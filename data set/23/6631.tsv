2006-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	dentist		but i'd like to do it anyhow
2006-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	dentist		so anyone, xfce4? i can see how to do it with gnome and kde, just not fxce4
2006-02-26T09:06:00.000Z	dentist		login as root on xfce4
2006-02-26T09:07:00.000Z	dentist		well kde has its own config file
2006-02-26T09:07:00.000Z	dentist		kdmrc
2006-02-26T09:08:00.000Z	dentist		i want to login using root to xfce
2006-02-26T09:08:00.000Z	dentist		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2006-02-26T09:09:00.000Z	dentist		thats not really an answer to my question.. i'm asking how to enable the root login, wheres the config
2006-02-26T09:09:00.000Z	dentist		im using gdm
2006-02-26T09:10:00.000Z	dentist		yes i know its a very bad idea.. its taboo etc etc etc
2006-02-26T09:11:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	judging from google, it seems there might be an "allowrootlogin" or something option in /etc/gdm/somewhere
2006-02-26T09:11:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	i would just grep for "allow" (use the "-i" option, since it's probably "Allow") into /etc/gdm/*
2006-02-26T09:11:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	i don't have gdm myself
2006-02-26T10:30:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	gtk-config is in libgtk1.2-dev
2006-02-26T10:37:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	yes, i do - but i have better advice
2006-02-26T10:37:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	install the "auto-apt" package, run "auto-apt update", and then "auto-apt search imlib-config" (and same for the others)
2006-02-26T10:40:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	auto-apt will find gnome-config. on the other hand, "gtk-pixbuf=config" doesn't quite look like a *file*
2006-02-26T10:40:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	it looks like a configuration option
2006-02-26T10:52:00.000Z	dentist	LjL	that worked nicely thx
2006-02-26T10:58:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	?
2006-02-26T10:59:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	let me try
2006-02-26T11:00:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	(anyway, i don't know much about perl, but it appears that GTK for perl is in the repositories)
2006-02-26T11:01:00.000Z	LjL	dentist	yep
