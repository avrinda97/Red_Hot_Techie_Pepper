2011-07-12T10:45:00.000Z	BKTech86		hi, I'm trying to configure grub with ubuntu on 1 hard drive and windows xp on a 2nd hard drive .. i had to remove the boot flag from the windows xp partition in order to get grub working again, but now if i try to boot the windows xp  partition it says bootmgr missing
2011-07-12T10:46:00.000Z	BKTech86		i just want grub to recognize that the windows xp partition is bootable, and list it in the grub menu, can anyone help pls?
2011-07-12T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	That's an error message from Windows, not from grub.
2011-07-12T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	For help fixing Windows try ##windows.
2011-07-12T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Once Windows is actually in a working state "sudo update-grub" will add an entry for it to the grub menu.
2011-07-12T10:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Did you install grub's boot sector to a partition rather than the mbr?
2011-07-12T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Then the boot flag on the Windows partition should't have made any difference as far as grub working.
2011-07-12T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Unless you have a buggy BIOS or there is more to the story than that.
2011-07-12T10:52:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	i know thats what someone else said when i installed windows7 on the same partition as that linux partition but it does make a difference
2011-07-12T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	What happens when you restore the boot flag to the XP partition?

2011-07-12T10:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Make sure sda is the first in the boot priority or install grub to sdb and sdc as well.
2011-07-12T11:00:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	make sure how
2011-07-12T11:00:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	do you know what boot-sector type is?
2011-07-12T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	The symptoms + boot info script output suggest otherwise. I'm betting if you select sda in a one time boot menu grub will load no matter what boot flags are where.
2011-07-12T11:01:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	ok but i already did that and i'm telling you it's not the case
2011-07-12T11:02:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	if that boot flag is on the windows xp partition it doesnt matter what drive i select in my bios
2011-07-12T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	How are you selecting a drive?
2011-07-12T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Sometimes some drives take longer to spin up or otherwise be recognised, that's why I mentioned a one time boot menu rather than just boot priority.
2011-07-12T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	Most BIOSs will show a message like "press F8 for a one time boot menu" (where F8 might be some other key) which will list all drives and allow you to select one to boot without changing the boot priority permanently.
2011-07-12T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	It means that the mbr of that drive contains Microsoft code which will search for the first active partition and load the code from the first sector of that partition.
2011-07-12T11:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BKTech86	If your BIOS were booting sda it would make no difference at all
2011-07-12T11:17:00.000Z	BKTech86	Jordan_U	now that i've turned on the boot flag for my sda ext4 partition, grub will come up
