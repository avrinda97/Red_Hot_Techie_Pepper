2008-08-28T00:17:00.000Z	kat		Hey everyone. I have a problem. If I'm playing music, emesene doesn't make any sounds. How do I fix this?
2008-08-28T00:19:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	your problem has most likely something to do with pulseaudio. Take a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio
2008-08-28T00:20:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	thanks. i know im using alsa though. so its weird that it has something to do with pulseaudio. but ill check it out
2008-08-28T00:25:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	its just a problem with emesene though.. firefox and banshee for example can play at the same time and vlc even
2008-08-28T00:26:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	ok. My problem was with Rhytmbox. When it was playing I had no sound for other applications.
2008-08-28T00:27:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	oh yea, i had that problem too but i fixed it after awhile
2008-08-28T00:29:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	Bucketface , im sure its related.. i just cant figure out how to configure sound in emesene
2008-08-28T00:31:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	look in options, plugin in the emesene menus
2008-08-28T00:33:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	yea i did.. pretty limited menu :P
2008-08-28T00:34:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	no idea how it is since I don't use emesene. I just googled for your problem and they mentioned that menu.
2008-08-28T00:35:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	well thanks anyway. if anyone knows the answer i hope to hear it :D
2008-08-28T00:36:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	have you considered other MSN clients?
2008-08-28T00:37:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	could try some others
2008-08-28T00:37:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	what do you use?
2008-08-28T00:39:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	I use pidgin but the main reason it's because aside msn I also use yahoo, aim and gtalk. With pidgin I get all in one. The new version will have support for offline chating and personal messages but not yet
2008-08-28T00:40:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	yea i guess pidgin will do =)
2008-08-28T00:41:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	aMSN is a dedicated MSN messenger which already has support for offline messaging and the like. Pidgin new version isn't in the repositories yet
2008-08-28T00:42:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	when will it be?
2008-08-28T00:42:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	I don't know if pidgin comes with all the plugins installed by default. If not, install guifications for toaster-like popups and plugin-pack for a lot of nice things like "psychic mode", "auto-reply" and "auto-replace"
2008-08-28T00:43:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	probably when 8.10 comes out, which is to say in October. You can try to compile it yourself or give the debian repositories a shot
2008-08-28T00:44:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	the other day i couldnt get wireless working. that was horrible. but i'll just try the different stuff. im not that picky actually
2008-08-28T00:44:00.000Z	kat	carandraug	thanks for your time =)
2008-08-28T00:44:00.000Z	carandraug	kat	you're welcome
