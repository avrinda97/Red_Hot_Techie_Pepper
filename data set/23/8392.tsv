2005-10-07T08:05:00.000Z	benh		some ubuntu X.org person around ?
2005-10-07T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	benh	just ask your question.  Hopefully someone can help
2005-10-07T08:09:00.000Z	tritium	benh	you have breezy installed on an iMac G5?
2005-10-07T08:10:00.000Z	benh	tritium	hoary actualy :) I'm about to upgrade it to breezy, but in the meantime, I'm tracking down a bug with nvidiafb which makes it break on the iMac
2005-10-07T08:10:00.000Z	tritium	benh	wow, I could not get hoary to install on my iMac (kernel panic issues)
2005-10-07T08:11:00.000Z	benh	tritium	I used a home built 64 bits kernel and stucked ubuntu initrd with it :)
2005-10-07T08:11:00.000Z	benh	tritium	I haven't tried breezy prerelease CD yet
2005-10-07T08:11:00.000Z	benh	tritium	I just finished thermal control for the machine so it's fairly useable now :)
2005-10-07T08:11:00.000Z	tritium	benh	oh, okay.  Good for you, dude :)
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	tritium	benh	I'd like to know how things go for you when you try breezy on your iMac, whenever that may be
2005-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	benh	tritium	i'll try to remember popping up here, I could try now but I left the CD at home =P
2005-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	benh	tritium	anyway, I just dist-upgraded hoary to breezy and so far the machine is still alive
2005-10-07T08:29:00.000Z	tritium	benh	cool, I'll keep an eye out for you :)
2005-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	benh	it's in gnome-system-tools
2005-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	benh	tritium	not the front-end for configuring
2005-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	benh	yeah...
2005-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	benh	tritium	the front-end at boot, instead of text mode, I get a gfx stuff with a progress bar
2005-10-07T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	benh	usplash?  sudo dpkg-reconfigure your linux-image
2005-10-07T09:48:00.000Z	benh	tritium	hrm... not sure if it's the kernel bootsplash, looked more like a front end on sysvinit
2005-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	benh	tritium	I'm using my own kernel, so that won't work :)
2005-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	benh	oh, that's right.  Not sure how you can enable it in that case.
2005-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	benh	tritium	breezy doesn't have fan control & working nvidiafb for that machine :)
2005-10-07T09:50:00.000Z	tritium	benh	yeah, your iMac G5, right?
