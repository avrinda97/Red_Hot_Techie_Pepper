2005-08-26T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	try hitting "f"
2007-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	linux uses as much memory as possible - this is a Good Thing (tm) - look at the "free" entry on the second line of the command output from   free -m  to see a more useful figure
2007-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	 free -m <enter>  in Apps - accessories - terminal :)
2007-08-02T09:22:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	yeah i see it uses a lot od my mem, i need to run a virtual machiune and with 1 gig its not working well
2007-08-02T09:23:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	Mem:          1011        606        404          0          7        442
2007-08-02T09:23:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	442 in caqche
2007-08-02T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	the second line ( buffers and cache - what is under the free column?
2007-08-02T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	no, how much is "free" in the second line? That 's the relevant figure
2007-08-02T09:24:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	855
2007-08-02T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	then you effectively have 855 MB free
2007-08-02T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	the rest is mostly biffers and cache
2007-08-02T09:25:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	so i can give my virtual machine a good chunk of that free space and still run linux smooth?
2007-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	yes, should work fine - probably up to 4 0r 500 MB should be safe enough for your virtual mcahine
2007-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	ubu	thoreauputic	thanks 4 the info, appreciated
2007-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	no worries :)
2007-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubu	of course virtual machines tend to be somewhat slower anyway, as you would realise
