2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	DefineByte		is there a console equivalent of xset dpms force off?
2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	that is a console command?
2008-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	I mean something that doesn't require X
2008-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	ah, i'm not sure in that case! you could enumerate the ACPI tree but i wouldn't know for sure
2008-12-20T17:47:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	I fear that would be beyond me. :( :)
2008-12-20T17:48:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	i'll have a quick google for you
2008-12-20T17:49:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	thanks. I've found 'setterm -powersave powerdown' but that doesn't appear to work. Maybe I'm misunderstanding its purpose
2008-12-20T17:50:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	ah, it doesn't turn your monitor off?
2008-12-20T17:51:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Unfortuately not.
2008-12-20T17:52:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	are you running it as root / would the -blank option suffice?
2008-12-20T17:53:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Freefull: root makes no difference. Blanking isn't really what I'm after.
2008-12-20T17:54:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	i'm afraid i don't know of any other option really, sorry
2008-12-20T17:55:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Is it the right command to use? If so I guess I'll just have to see what's going wrong.
2008-12-20T17:55:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	it looks to be, i must say i've never really bothered, all my servers have no monitors :p
2008-12-20T17:56:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Heh. Mine's not a server, just a very low powered desktop. :D
2008-12-20T17:56:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	that's gotta be pretty low power if you're limited to terminal only :o
2008-12-20T17:57:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Well, it's not \that\ low powered but I'm just trying to eek out everyting I can. It's an AMD Geode LX.
2008-12-20T17:58:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	i see, you'd be surprised how little load an X session with fluxbox adds, but it does very much depend on what you're doing
2008-12-20T17:59:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Thanks. I may well try X at some point but at the moment the terminal seems to be offering everything I need (apart from turning the monitor off!). :)
2008-12-20T18:00:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	sorry i couldn't help!
2008-12-20T18:00:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	A+ for effort. :D
2008-12-20T18:01:00.000Z	Winkie	DefineByte	i don't know enough about low level APM/ACPI :(
2008-12-20T18:02:00.000Z	DefineByte	Winkie	Nevermind. Thanks again. bye. :)
