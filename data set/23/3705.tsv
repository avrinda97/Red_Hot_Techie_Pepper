2008-02-13T12:38:00.000Z	joequincy		for a goup*
2008-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	yes it can access it, do you mean can it install and run off of it?
2008-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	yes
2008-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	to my knowledge no.. what for?
2008-02-13T12:41:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	well, the disc I DL'd tonight isn't working. Period. I'm thinking of using the XP install disc to reformat the drive and then try installing Ubuntu again
2008-02-13T12:42:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	Hmm.. do you want windows installed at all ie dualboot?
2008-02-13T12:43:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	nope. Just Ubuntu. It's basically going to be a web portal/printer station (maybe OOo) so I don't want the extra crap from Windows
2008-02-13T12:43:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	Plus, what disc did  you download and how is it not working... your should get a good copy of an install disc that works
2008-02-13T12:44:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	Ok well you COULD use windows to format the partitions.. but really you just need to get a working disc
2008-02-13T12:46:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	so what happens, why do  you say it doesn't work?
2008-02-13T12:50:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	I boot from CD, and it loads the options screen. I choose the default first option (Start or Install Ubuntu), and it goes to a progress bar. After about two minutes of that, the screen flicks on and off several times, before ending up off, but with the machine running. If I do nothing, it sits there forever. If I tap the power button, the screen flicks on long enough for me to see...
2008-02-13T12:51:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	hmm maybe try the alternate install cd
2008-02-13T12:51:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	ok, what are you referring to?
2008-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	There is an alternate install cd you can download that is text based.. you can try that cd.. alot of people seem to be having problems with the regular cd lately
2008-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	Will do. Is that at the main page?
2008-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	it should be
2008-02-13T12:53:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	just keep an eye and make sure it says alternate install
2008-02-13T12:53:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	I see the checkbox now. Thanks!
2008-02-13T12:54:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	I just hope this DL goes faster. :P
2008-02-13T12:54:00.000Z	badkitty	joequincy	hehe dont bet on it lol.. maybe try a closer server?
2008-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	uhm... hope I don't jinx myself here... but I'm getting ~250kbps off this server :D
2008-02-13T12:57:00.000Z	joequincy	badkitty	last one was at about 65kbps. Took two hours.
