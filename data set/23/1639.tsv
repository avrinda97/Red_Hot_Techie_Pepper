2011-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	so you have no ideas or guesses as to why you are having this problem?
2011-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	it's not my computer, I don't use ubuntu. Just wanna help my friend.
2011-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	ask friend then if he has no idea or guesses as to why
2011-11-05T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	what did your friend say?
2011-11-05T16:20:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	he really doesn't know what could it be. :D He isn't so experienced in linux and whole this stuff. :D
2011-11-05T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	ask him what he has done regarding the package system
2011-11-05T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	while you ask him that, pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list*
2011-11-05T16:25:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	the friend says that it's fresh linux install, yesterday installed
2011-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	sources -> http://paste.lugons.org/show/AIVHZlTnu40GeYgVto38/
2011-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ as well
2011-11-05T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	« apt-cache policy libhdf5-openmpi-1.8.4 libmed1 » as well
2011-11-05T16:38:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	still there?
2011-11-05T16:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	yap, waiting for the other side to acomplish the mission. -.-
2011-11-05T16:39:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	ok
2011-11-05T16:42:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	moving forward. Sorry, he's slow. :D http://paste.lugons.org/show/MuGGYMmZiUJLAZFIXCTH/
2011-11-05T16:42:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	did you ask about the contents of files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?
2011-11-05T16:43:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	yap, waiting for that. But I think that it's empty.
2011-11-05T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	Atlantic777	I didn't realize you were dealing with two packages.  Also pastebin: apt-cache policy gmsh
2011-11-05T16:53:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	here's apt-get policy gmsh, still waiting for sources.list.d http://paste.lugons.org/show/qFi1jquNG1kdrUSbDJH7/
2011-11-05T16:53:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	ok, sources.list.d/ is empty
2011-11-05T17:02:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jrib	ping
