2012-05-05T11:41:00.000Z	agronholm		any clues as to what I should do
2012-05-05T11:41:00.000Z	agronholm		?
2012-05-05T11:42:00.000Z	agronholm		yes, I'm sure
2012-05-05T11:43:00.000Z	agronholm		every one of those ends up with the same error message
2012-05-05T11:44:00.000Z	agronholm		yes.
2012-05-05T11:44:00.000Z	agronholm		it's a xeon e5504 cpu
2012-05-05T11:46:00.000Z	agronholm		that is, if I choose to boot from the "legacy only" boot device
2012-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	agronholm		integrated management module
2012-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	agronholm		allows me to remote control the machine
2012-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	i'm betting the device name changed in the newer kernels, try to net boot
2012-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	agronholm	mongo	what device name?
2012-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	agronholm the root block device
2012-05-05T11:49:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	yes but you have the bios device, which is remounted as the root device after the kernel bootstraps
2012-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	agronholm	mongo	so I'm hosed then? no way to do a remote install?
2012-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	pxe boot
2012-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	agronholm	mongo	I don't really know how to set that up
2012-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	if you can find what the new root device name is you could change it in grub
2012-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	agronholm	mongo	that would help if I could actually get grub to start
2012-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	you are pre standard ipmi
2012-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	basiclly it is standarized on newer hardware
2012-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	if you have a dhcp server on the network pxe is great, you can chain boot into ipxe and just give it a html url
2012-05-05T12:01:00.000Z	mongo	agronholm	if you get pxe boot going it works for any machine on that ethernet segment
