2011-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	milamber	AbhiJit	tomboy is the default sticky notes app in ubuntu
2011-01-10T10:27:00.000Z	AbhiJit	milamber	there are only three files with .note extension but in my 'sticky' not app i have loads of notes
2011-01-10T10:28:00.000Z	milamber	AbhiJit	what sticky app are you using (usually found in the menu under help >> about)
2011-01-10T10:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	milamber	the name of the application is only the 'sticky note' application
2011-01-10T10:32:00.000Z	milamber	AbhiJit	do alt + f2 and type this in: gedit ~/..gnome2/stickynotes_applet
2011-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	milamber	it opens a blank file
2011-01-10T10:36:00.000Z	AbhiJit	milamber	yah now i open that configuration file
2011-01-10T10:37:00.000Z	milamber	AbhiJit	all your notes should be in there. that's the file you need to back up
