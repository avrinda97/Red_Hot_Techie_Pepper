2005-04-21T10:36:00.000Z	smouche		it amazes me how much I can run on 512
2005-04-21T10:36:00.000Z	smouche		on linux, anyway!
2005-04-21T10:37:00.000Z	smouche		it's been very very hard for me to overcome the (windows) habit of rebooting on practically every software install!!
2005-04-21T10:37:00.000Z	smouche		heh, most of the time on here I don't even need to log-out!
2005-04-21T10:37:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	only thing I reboot for is hardlocks (been solved now) and new kernels :)
2005-04-23T16:01:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	I don't even have a floppy drive installed :P
2005-04-23T16:20:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	I think the main point here is..OSX makes people happy in their pants :P
2005-04-23T16:21:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	if I could afford a mac, I'd already be happy in my pants.
2005-04-23T16:21:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	we have a G4 at work .. I just sit there and minimise and maximise the windows :P
2005-04-23T16:22:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	to tell you the truth, I really don't like the mac gui at all.
2005-04-23T16:24:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	you must just love the bouncing cursors in kde!  first damn thing I turn off!
2005-04-23T16:29:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	so disable it :P
2005-04-23T16:29:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	I'm not complaining about it-- I like the quiet!
2005-04-27T07:49:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	my nforce sound card works great too, out of the box
2005-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	kubuntu has been more stable than gnome for me, but only after working around konqueror crashes
2005-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	how do you stop your konqueror crashing? :P
2005-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	opening konq in "simple browser mode" or "midnight commander" style helps too.
2005-04-27T08:00:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	aaah but krusader isn't a webbrowser :P
2005-04-27T08:00:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	for web browser I'm ok with firefox. (or konq - my crashes are only with file browsing) though it's annoying.
2005-04-27T08:01:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	I can't stand FF
2005-04-27T08:10:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	cos FF is dodgy :P
2005-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	smouche	membreya	which does, the  command line or gtranscode?
2005-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	membreya	smouche	the command line
