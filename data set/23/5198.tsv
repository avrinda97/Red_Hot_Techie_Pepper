2007-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	adamonline45		Can anyone recommend an application to add a GUI frontend to a script?
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	tk is simple (but not beautiful)
2007-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	if you just want "button1" or "button2" to chose an alternative then gmessage or zenity is ok
2007-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	That's pretty much what I want
2007-01-24T16:15:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	if installed on the MBR it will not be wiped. The MBR is always overwritten. If you install windows it will overwrite the MBR with a bootloader for windows. if you install Linux it will be overwritten with GRUB. if you installed GRUB on a bootpartition then formatting that partition gets rid of it.
2007-01-24T16:17:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	wait, if installed on the MBR it will not be wiped, but the next line says the MBR is always overwritten?  Do you mean that if I simply reformat a HD, it won't be erased, but if I install a new OS, it will be... ?
2007-01-24T16:17:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	that is correct.
2007-01-24T16:18:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	the MBR is not a part of any partition. so formatting it will not affect it.
2007-01-24T16:18:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	What happens if GRUB was already installed, and I install another OS that uses GRUB?  Will it be changed?  Will some settings not change okay?
2007-01-24T16:19:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	if you install another os that uses grub and you chose at install time to not re-install grub from that distro then the old grub will still be intact (but will probably not be able to boot your new system if your partition layout and kernel values have changed)
2007-01-24T16:21:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	for example, you can install ubuntu on partition 1 and have its grub. then you install slackware on partition 2 but do not install grub from its CD. instead you tell the grub that you use with ubuntu to boot slackware for you.
2007-01-24T16:22:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	Okay, I think that's my problem then...  I didn't get to choose though! =O  hehheh...  Do you happen to know if netBSD uses GRUB? That's what used to be on the hard drive in question...
2007-01-24T16:22:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	if you *do* install grub on that second linux installation then you must alter it in order for it to be able to boot your fist linux installation.
2007-01-24T16:23:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	which OS can you boot with grub now?
2007-01-24T16:23:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	None, it just hangs at "grub" with a blinking cursor
2007-01-24T16:24:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	I was hoping that my install would eliminate any traces or netbsd...
2007-01-24T16:28:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	Alright, i've loaded ubotu's link, I'll read it come morning.  I'm tired! hehheh...  Thanks for your help.  Do you think if that's where it's hanging, that a manual poking around in the grub confs, etc, could solve something?
2007-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	Oh well, I'm passing out =)  Good night everyone! thanks!
2007-01-24T16:30:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	I think it's a combination of a faulty config and that you also have to re-install grub manually.
2007-01-24T16:31:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	that first link ubotu gave you should help alot
2007-01-24T16:31:00.000Z	adamonline45	Jowi	alright, thanks.  Even though I didn't install Windows? I'll certainly check it out...  Thanks again!
2007-01-24T16:34:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	the procedure is the same
2007-02-01T16:33:00.000Z	Jowi	adamonline45	all users and groups are in /etc/passwd and /etc/group
