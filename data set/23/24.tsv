2012-11-13T02:09:00.000Z	amayer_		question: im on Ubuntu 12.04. I just check for updates and noticed that some of my updates arent checked. does this mean they arent needed?
2012-11-13T02:09:00.000Z	amayer_		example: ffmpen(checked), libav-tools(unchecked), libproxy1(checked), libswscale2(unchecked)
2012-11-13T02:11:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	open a term window and type: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade                  Is anything held back?
2012-11-13T02:12:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	what do you mean held back?
2012-11-13T02:12:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	the ones you mentioned
2012-11-13T02:16:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	it says there are packages held back, they are all the same packages.
2012-11-13T02:16:00.000Z	amayer_		what does this mean?
2012-11-13T02:16:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	can you pastebin.org the results?
2012-11-13T02:17:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	http://paste.debian.net/208708/
2012-11-13T02:18:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	that doesnt show what command you used
2012-11-13T02:19:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	like you said "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2012-11-13T02:21:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	thats rare when that happens. you might want to read this:   http://askubuntu.com/questions/216371/apt-get-dist-upgrade-doesnt-fix-the-following-packages-have-been-kept-back
2012-11-13T02:23:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	could these packages have been disabled when i installed Ubuntu-restricted extras and it had to remove libav* stuff
2012-11-13T02:23:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	did you use a different repo, and then truned off that repo?
2012-11-13T02:23:00.000Z	compdoc		turned off
2012-11-13T02:23:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	nope
2012-11-13T02:24:00.000Z	amayer_	compdoc	this is a work computer so i didnt do too much extra to it
2012-11-13T02:24:00.000Z	compdoc	amayer_	what happens if you type:  sudp apt-get autoremove    ?
