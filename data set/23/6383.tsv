2006-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	McNutella	DarkED	the live CD lets me choose higher, its just the install doesnt
2006-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	DarkED	McNutella	Ok, so it wont let you go higher in desktop properties yes?
2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	McNutella	DarkED	thats correct
2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	DarkED		I need to know what kinda hardware you are using

2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	DarkED		ok
2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	DarkED		have you tried to install new nvidia drivers?
2006-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	DarkED		i hear it isnt difficult
2006-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	McNutella	DarkED	oh the nvidia drivers seem to only want to display things on my TV, and turn off the monitor by default
2006-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	DarkED		i think if you upgraded drivers it would fix your resolution drivers
2006-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	DarkED		hmm that is weird
2006-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	McNutella		thats what I thought
