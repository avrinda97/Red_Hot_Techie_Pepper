2008-02-05T22:31:00.000Z	TangentBuntu		hey, I'd like to set up a proxy on my server so I can keep my traffic logged through my server and not from my school
2008-02-05T22:33:00.000Z	TangentBuntu		is it possible to set up a proxy server in ubuntu?
2008-02-05T22:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	what sort of proxy?
2008-02-05T22:34:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	I need to proxy port 80 so I can keep all my traffic logged from the server and not from the school
2008-02-05T22:35:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	squid
2008-02-05T22:39:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	it's telling me to "Set 'visible_hostname'"
2008-02-05T22:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	where? in the .conf?
2008-02-05T22:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	you need to edit the configuration file. it will be in /etc somewhere and end in .conf
2008-02-05T22:54:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	I think I'd rather set up a vpn
2008-02-05T22:59:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	what exactly are you trying to do?
2008-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	then, set up an ssh tunnel
2008-02-05T23:03:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	just google for ssh tunnel. there are hundreds of simple tutorials.
2008-02-05T23:06:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	I'm using a windows computer, there are no free ssh clients out there for windows afaik
2008-02-05T23:06:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	putty
2008-02-05T23:07:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	yes
2008-02-05T23:10:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	think about it very hard. it's confusing at first, but it will soon snap into place ;)
2008-02-05T23:12:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	I see nothing on tunneling port 80 through ssh putty agh, I'm gonna cry
2008-02-05T23:12:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	just open up putty, and set up a tunnel under the profile or whatever. also, i don't recommend you stay with putty, openssh is way superior.
2008-02-05T23:13:00.000Z	TangentBuntu	DRebellion	openssh isn't for windows
2008-02-05T23:13:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	there is a windows client
2008-02-05T23:14:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	since i last checked
2008-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	did you get it working?
2008-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	DRebellion	TangentBuntu	startx , i think. but you may have to do a bit of other magic i'm unaware of...
