2004-10-17T10:16:00.000Z	radioact1ve		Anyone find good docs to get ubuntu on a laptop?
2004-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	radioact1ve		Im going to try to config X by asking me some questions but if that doesnt work I dont know what else to do
2004-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	find out what's wrong by checking /var/log/XFree86.0.log
2004-10-17T10:22:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	I have set the modes in my xconfig to values that I know have worked fine on my laptop. With fedora and Suse
2004-10-17T10:23:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	Ill still give it another look when I get home! ;)
2004-10-17T10:24:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	did you nuke the install that had a working X? i'm kind of hoping you still have that file somewhere... :)
2004-10-17T10:25:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	yeah I have it saved and printed it out for me to look at
2004-10-17T10:25:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	besides that the working X that i had is gone
2004-10-17T10:26:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	are you positive you've got the right kernel modules and everything set up?
2004-10-17T10:27:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	well it's whatever ubuntu has at default
2004-10-17T10:27:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	can't you even get to a console?
2004-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	what exactly are you doing then? :P
2004-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	radioact1ve	ynef	well i can get text mode (no X) but Im very limited there.
2004-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	ah. gotcha. :(
2004-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	what graphics card do you have?
2004-10-17T10:29:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	then you need the nvidia driver, then...
2004-10-17T10:30:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	start a root shell (FYI: "sudo /bin/bash")
2004-10-17T10:30:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	now, type "lsmod" -- this'll tell you if you've got nvidia loaded
2004-10-17T10:30:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	you're supposed to use "nvidia"
2004-10-17T10:30:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	yeah, but it can be apt-getted... :)
2004-10-17T10:31:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	too bad you don't have a browser running ATM... there's a guide for doing this stuff at the wiki: http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/BinaryDriverHowto
2004-10-17T10:31:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	i'll read it out loud for ya... ;)
2004-10-17T10:32:00.000Z	ynef	radioact1ve	right then... shut down x first of all
