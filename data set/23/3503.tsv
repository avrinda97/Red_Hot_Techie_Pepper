2008-04-01T13:42:00.000Z	IAMSAM		I love the ubuntu versioning process :D
2008-04-01T13:43:00.000Z	IAMSAM		and remove the option for quiet and splash
2008-04-01T13:44:00.000Z	IAMSAM		the run sudo update-grub
2008-04-01T13:45:00.000Z	IAMSAM		smegzor, yes, you have to, or the changes don't take effect
2008-04-01T13:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	 souper: update-grub should not be needed
2008-04-01T13:46:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	but it says "program used to generate the menu.lst"
2008-04-01T13:47:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	hm, idk, when i add the options for data=writeback, the site said to run update-grub
2008-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	*shrugs* just looking at  man update-grub  it shouldn't be needed
2008-04-01T13:50:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	DistroJunkie hehe I like that name too ;)
2008-04-01T13:50:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	nope
2008-04-01T13:50:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	sry =/
2008-04-01T13:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	np :)
2008-04-01T13:51:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	i've noticed tremendous lag in read write, causing horrendous system lags... I reccomend against it :p
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	yeah, doesn't sound like a good idea
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	yeah, today's project will be a full reinstall of Hardy. btw, do you know when or if Hardy will ever get the mondo package to be installable?
2008-04-01T13:54:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	I may take a look at that package though as I am running Hardy atm. What's it for?
2008-04-01T13:55:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	it allows you to take basically an image of your computer in it's current state, and if (God forbid) your system dies, you can use that disk to nuke the partitions and set it up again just like it was, w. out the need to install individual packages again
2008-04-01T13:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	ahh, cool
2008-04-01T13:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	You may like to check out remastersys also then
2008-04-01T13:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	does the same, but makes a live CD
2008-04-01T13:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	fair enough
2008-04-01T14:01:00.000Z	IAMSAM	DistroJockey	I'm going to check out remastersys though, so I can get a copy of Ubuntu for my neighbors to use
2008-04-01T14:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	IAMSAM	:)
