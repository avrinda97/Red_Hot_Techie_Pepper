2007-12-18T20:43:00.000Z	strabes		does anyone have the nvidia geforce go 7900 GS?
2007-12-18T20:43:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	No, I have the nVidia GeForce Go 7400 from the same series.
2007-12-18T20:44:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	how does it work? Are you using the restricted drivers? Suspend/hibernate?
2007-12-18T20:45:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	I made the mistake of getting the ATI mobility x1400 and i'm trying to decide if switching the card is worth $360
2007-12-18T20:46:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	It works fine, yes I am using restricted drivers, suspend/hibernate is ok. The only problem is that it has a hard time getting correct resolutions for different monitors that I connect to it. But this problem was there even when I was using the unrestricted drivers, so I dont believe it to be related to the card.
2007-12-18T20:46:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	probably an ubuntu problem huh
2007-12-18T20:47:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	Perhaps , the legendary multiple monitor, xorg.conf issues.
2007-12-18T20:48:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	Why do you consider the ATI mobility a mistake?
2007-12-18T20:48:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	out of curiosity...
2007-12-18T20:49:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	really bad 3d performance, ATI's attitude towards linux, artifacts on the screen, no suspend/hibernate, etc
2007-12-18T20:50:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	they only got AIGLX support about 2 months ago; ridiculous
2007-12-18T20:50:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	but it's still really buggy; firefox lags like crazy w/ compiz enabled
2007-12-18T20:51:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	it's almost like a joke. like "ha ha we're going to 'provide' linux 'drivers'"
2007-12-18T20:51:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	Makes me wonder, the iMac uses ATI Mobility Radeon cards as well , and they seem to run well there
2007-12-18T20:51:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	yeah, but those aren't running ubuntu
2007-12-18T20:52:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	But it should exactly be difficult for them to code for Linux if they can code for BSD. It's a palicy thing, like you suggest.
2007-12-18T20:53:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	*policy
2007-12-18T20:53:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	That just makes it worse. They obviously do not care about linux at all. They only started doing ANYTHING after they were bought by AMD.
2007-12-18T20:54:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	and the drivers are still trash; i'm using mesa right now because fglrx is unusably buggy
2007-12-18T20:55:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	are you using gutsy? Do you use the Screens and Graphics Manager under System > Administration?
2007-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	Yes and yes respectively.
2007-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	strabes	protobion	and it doesn't work? not much of a surprise; projectors are a pain
2007-12-18T20:58:00.000Z	protobion	strabes	Oh well.
