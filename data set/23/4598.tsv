2008-06-15T06:54:00.000Z	eboyjr		I had it set to 1 month
2008-06-15T06:54:00.000Z	eboyjr		and it hasnt been 1 month
2008-06-15T06:54:00.000Z	eboyjr		hi!
2008-06-15T06:54:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	check /etc/X11/
2008-06-15T06:55:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	Sorry, I meant to say "to pastebin"
2008-06-15T06:55:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	you need to know your number
2008-06-15T06:55:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	Darn, thanks
2008-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	restart the livecd
2008-06-15T07:07:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	I mentioned Live CD because that's where the defaults come from.
2008-06-15T07:07:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	if you install then all the defaults are installed too
2008-06-15T07:08:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	I don't want to reinstall because I want all of my files.
2008-06-15T07:08:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	you want to default back, each application works different
2008-06-15T07:09:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	apps mostly revert back to default if you delete their .hiddenfolder in your home
2008-06-15T07:09:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	Do you know how to revert to default of Ubuntu's video drivers and setup only?
2008-06-15T07:09:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	For me, all that does is setup the keyboard stuff...
2008-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	sudo nvidia-settings if you have a nvidia card
2008-06-17T03:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	cheap mice tend to move in short bursts on their own.
2008-06-17T03:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	Uhmm... It's the same mouse that I've used for months... and it works in Windows
2008-06-17T03:44:00.000Z	HardDisk	eboyjr	I was just suggesting that's what cheap mice do, had loads that do that.
2008-06-17T03:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	Okay.. I'll restart
2008-06-17T03:48:00.000Z	eboyjr	HardDisk	To let you know: restarting the GDM didn't work... so I restarted the computer and it worked.
