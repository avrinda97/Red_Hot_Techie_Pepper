2008-03-26T08:57:00.000Z	brent113		lapinux:  no, but have you considered mounting it as cifs?
2008-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i'm not sure what it is....  i can see all my other network machines from this one but the windows machines cant see my shares
2008-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	would it be suitable for this situation?
2008-03-26T09:01:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i think it was swat?  that i used before
2008-03-26T09:02:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	a while back anyway, the last few times i just used the terminal to set it up, i think i remember how i did it :)
2008-03-26T09:03:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i will have to look at webmin, i've heard of it but have not used it
2008-03-26T09:03:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i used swat once, the other times i couldnt figure out why i couldnt access it
2008-03-26T09:04:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	what else does it do, would it be overkill if im just setting up shares for a local network?
2008-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	this is my personal desktop machine but i need 3 other machines to be able to acess the 1TB raid 5 array i have on it
2008-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	it does everything, but you can turn off the modules you don't need
2008-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	never hurts to have more
2008-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	well webmin also has mdadm support, network support, hardware support, and a ton of other iptables stuff and everything :)
2008-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i'm gonna see what google can tell me about webmin
2008-03-26T10:34:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	it may just need to configure it so it knows it's been activated, what happens if you allow it to install it?
2008-03-26T10:35:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	it installed, i just added a share, now to see if it worked or if i need to run "smbpasswd -a" again
2008-03-26T10:39:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	samba works, that was odd that it wanted to download and install again
2008-03-26T10:39:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	well, that's good it works
2008-03-26T10:40:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	yes, this time it was easy, i remembered to add my pass via "smbpasswd" this time
2008-03-26T10:40:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	last time i was like what the heck, why will this not work
2008-03-26T10:40:00.000Z	brent113	Lapinux	well I have good news, it only gets easier from here :)
2008-03-26T10:40:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	oh, i've done alot of this before, its just been a while
2008-03-26T10:41:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	i tried out vista for a while and like some of it and hated other parts, like sound issues after updates ;)
2008-03-26T10:42:00.000Z	Lapinux	brent113	needless to say i sold my copy and switched back to ubuntu
