2010-10-20T04:18:00.000Z	goltoof		how do i keep syntax colors on for vim ?
2010-10-20T04:19:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	over multiple uses, you mean?
2010-10-20T04:19:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	put "set syntax=on" in your ~/.vimrc
2010-10-20T04:20:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 there is no .vimrc
2010-10-20T04:20:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	so make one
2010-10-20T04:20:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 :)
2010-11-09T21:25:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	the question was a livecd of ubuntu server
2010-11-09T21:25:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	that'd just be a command line, and you can get to that from any ubuntu install c
2010-12-27T22:40:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	i dont think so.... the desktop environment maybe, but not he dm
2010-12-27T22:41:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 i go to system > prefs > monitors   .. it tells me to use my card vendor settings
2010-12-27T22:41:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	sorry, when you said "display manager" to me that meant like... GDM or KDM or XDM...
2010-12-27T22:42:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	ie, the login screen
2011-01-31T23:38:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	you dont get new versions of software, just bugfix/security-patches for old ones if you stick to LTS
2011-01-31T23:40:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 what do you mean new versions of software?  you mean software that's only compliant with new versions? i thought  software can be updated anyway.
2011-01-31T23:40:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	the only updates you get in a stable version of ubuntu are bugfixes and security patches. if upstream release something new, you dont get it without moving to the next version of ubuntu
2011-01-31T23:40:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	the exception is firefox
2011-01-31T23:42:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 but i imagine there are ways to get new software to use new packages without changing the os?  sorry, i'm still not clear on how all the packages, kernel modules, etc apply here.
2011-01-31T23:42:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	most software is in the repositories and they are mostly-frozen after the os is released
2011-01-31T23:43:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	new versions arent added to the repos after release
2011-01-31T23:43:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	you can get new versions from third parties, if you trust those third parties
2011-01-31T23:43:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 o ic
2011-01-31T23:44:00.000Z	maco	goltoof	there is a developer-run "ubuntu backports" repository that contains new versions of software, but those packages dont get maintained in the usual way (ie, they dont get bugfixes and security updates) or much testing, just... "if it builds, ship it"
2011-02-18T03:48:00.000Z	goltoof	maco	 wrong room :)
