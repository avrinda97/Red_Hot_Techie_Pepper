2006-11-07T12:52:00.000Z	unikuser		docgnome: copy ur home direcotry there. everything will be fine
2006-11-07T12:52:00.000Z	unikuser		docgnome: configs are stored in hidden dires .gtk*  .gnome ...
2006-11-07T12:54:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	what's wrong with ctrl + alt + D?
2006-11-07T12:55:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	there should be something under /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/
2006-11-07T12:55:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	in gconf
2006-11-07T12:57:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	you should just be able to use <Super>d, I think
2006-11-07T12:59:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	I got it working. open gconf, goto /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/show_desktop, change <Control><Alt>d to <Super>d
2006-11-07T12:59:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	which ap?
2006-11-07T13:02:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/music
2006-11-07T13:02:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	and the rest are in the same directory in gconf
2006-11-07T13:10:00.000Z	unikuser	GNeu	changed pause to <Super>c in /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/music. It took c and my c key is not working on my laptop now.
2006-11-07T13:11:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	your c key isn't working?
2006-11-07T13:13:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	hmm... I wonder why? What does it say is the gconf entry?
2006-11-07T13:16:00.000Z	unikuser	GNeu	In gconf entry it is <Super>c , but when I see it in keyboard-shortcuts gui, it shows as c. this happened to me many time. I wonder why.
2006-11-07T13:21:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	I trying to find what the hex of the key combo would be, I am just having a google of it so it might take a while
2006-11-07T13:24:00.000Z	unikuser	GNeu	what I understand from this is that it is working in metacity keybindings,but not in gnome-settings-daemon.
2006-11-07T13:26:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	from what I understand, gnome-settings... will only accept single key shortcuts for most of the keys
2006-11-07T13:26:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	and because when <Super>C was used it only read the last character, it tried to use c as the shortcut
2006-11-07T13:52:00.000Z	unikuser	GNeu	What I got in conclusion is that music shortcuts  are not working for me in total.What ever key I give for that will stop working. (Tried <ctrl><alt>b, b stopped working)
2006-11-07T13:53:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	from what I understand, gnome-settings... will only accept single key shortcuts for most of the keys
2006-11-07T13:53:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	and because when <Super>C was used it only read the last character, it tried to use c as the shortcut
2006-11-07T13:54:00.000Z	GNeu	unikuser	I think, there is probably some workaround
