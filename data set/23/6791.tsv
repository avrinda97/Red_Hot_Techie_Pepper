2005-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	I had the same problem, and I wrote up a mini-guide about it. See if that matches and/or helps your situation.
2005-12-31T15:01:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	Did you read the link I sent?
2005-12-31T15:15:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	What change did you make?
2005-12-31T15:16:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	That's ok, and you don't need to worry about GRUB until after the install finishes.
2005-12-31T15:17:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	Yes, when it reboots you will need to add 'irqpoll' to the /kernel line in GRUB.
2005-12-31T15:17:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	I mentioned that in the link I sent you.
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	iTune	crouton	is that hardly to work ? because i am a beginner ?
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	One moment, I'll make it more obvious
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	This line in GRUB: kernel  /vmlinuz-2.6.12-9-386 root=/dev/hda4 ro quiet splash irqpoll
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	Make sure that you press 'e' to edit and then 'b' to boot after you add the 'irqpoll'
2005-12-31T15:31:00.000Z	iTune	crouton	i have new problem linux irqpoll helping me to pass next but my computer freeze on 88% scanning /cdrom/pool/main/x...
2005-12-31T15:33:00.000Z	crouton	iTune	 Does it always freeze at the same point?
