2006-09-02T12:09:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	what chipset is your network card
2006-09-02T12:09:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	you could try ndiswrapper
2006-09-02T12:10:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	it allows you to use windows drivers for network cards with linux
2006-09-02T12:10:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	there are howtos on the forums that explain it better than i can, but basically you just download ndiswrapper, then you have to get a specific file off of your driver cd for it
2006-09-02T12:11:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	I think you can download ndiswrapper through synaptic
2006-09-02T12:11:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	synaptic is the add/remove program thing under applications
2006-09-02T12:12:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper for info on ndiswrapper
2006-09-02T12:12:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	whats your other question
2006-09-02T12:13:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	theres a way to extract the right file i think
2006-09-02T12:14:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	at least thats what ive heard, you could also install it on a windows box and get it from the isntall file
2006-09-02T12:14:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	that page i told you to look at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper should tell you the file extension you need
2006-09-02T12:16:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	you're welcome
2006-09-02T12:16:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	maybe, if not someone will help you im sure
2006-09-02T12:16:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	ndiswrapper is a common problem
2006-09-02T12:17:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	right
2006-09-02T12:21:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	i think it means it wont work while you are running the live cd
2006-09-02T12:21:00.000Z	Guitarhero11	ras	ive used it and i installed from the live cd
