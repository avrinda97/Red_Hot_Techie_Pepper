2006-08-28T09:07:00.000Z	Kaeles		What are the minimum reqs for an xubuntu box
2006-08-28T09:07:00.000Z	Kaeles		or is there a lighter version than even xubuntu?
2006-08-28T09:07:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	someone suggested to me to use Damn Small Linux.
2006-08-28T09:14:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	try apt-cache search xchat
2006-08-28T09:14:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	then type apt-get install whateverThePackageNameIs
2006-08-28T09:15:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	then apt-get install xchat-gnome
2006-08-28T09:15:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	thank you, its installing, but its asking for the xbunutu disc.. why?
2006-08-28T09:16:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	are you wanting the xchat on the command line or in the GUI system?
2006-08-28T09:16:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	I have no idea.
2006-08-28T09:17:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	I mean, in the windows system or in the text-based-command line thing?
2006-08-28T09:17:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	I'm using the terminal to install it because the GUI way won't work.
2006-08-28T09:18:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	thats because you have to be root to install things, your user account doesn't have the privelage to do so.
2006-08-28T09:18:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	thats why you type sudo, it runs whatever is after sudo as the root.
2006-08-28T09:18:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	so I just pretty much need to use sudo before each command?
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	no
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	only to use Apt-get
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	ok. I just got linux like 4 hours ago and I've been really lost since.
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	or any program like a server.
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	you have used windows?
2006-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	thats what I'm on right now.
2006-08-28T09:20:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	my xubuntu laptop is right next to me.
2006-08-28T09:20:00.000Z	Kaeles	Tomtheman70	ok, the Root account is alot like the Administrator account in windows
2006-08-28T09:20:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	Kaeles	well, I get that. :D
