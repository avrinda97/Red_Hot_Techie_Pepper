2008-04-02T16:07:00.000Z	raju		 how to copy the vfat files to desktop from usb
2008-04-02T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	drag and drop ?
2008-04-02T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	or just copy them from file system to file system, the actual file system underneith the command doesn't matter
2008-04-02T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	are you dragging and dropping or using a command line ?
2008-04-02T16:08:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	both i did but it shows err
2008-04-02T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	sounds like the usb drive is having an issue then
2008-04-02T16:09:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	i am not getting
2008-04-02T16:09:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	try copying to another location say /tmp
2008-04-02T16:09:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	yeah everything i did but it shows error cannot copy the whole files ,something is missing
2008-04-02T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	sounds like your usb drive is having issues
2008-04-02T16:10:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	if the actual size of the file is 68mb it is coming onl 31 mb
2008-04-02T16:11:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	sounds like iossue means
2008-04-02T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	because your getting an input/output error the file stops coping
2008-04-02T16:11:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	sounds like issue means
2008-04-02T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	I thought we'd discussed this, it looks like you have an i/o problem or your usb drive
2008-04-02T18:10:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	you are correct , we discussed
2008-04-02T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	the i/o errors you get during the copy suggest for some reason at %50 of the copy the data can't be read (hardware/driver error maybe)
2008-04-02T18:12:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	if it is hardware problem ., how it is mounting
2008-04-02T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	you can mount a damaged file system
2008-04-02T18:14:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	the mounted files i checked , i am not able to read the file name
2008-04-02T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	as I explained to you early
2008-04-02T18:14:00.000Z	raju	ikonia	it may be a problem by hardware
2008-04-02T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	raju	as I told you........
