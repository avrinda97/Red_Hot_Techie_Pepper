2009-11-26T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manas	ive ran 2003 in wine but realised that Abiword is a hell of a lot smaller and does exactly the same

2009-11-26T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manas	looks like it needs a bit of work but gets a silver rating so it will run but some stuff may be weird or not work
2009-11-26T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manas	yes, i gave you a link with the steps you need to take from the appdb which I also gave you a link to

2009-11-26T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manas	you dont just run the setup file, you can do it a billion times it will do the exact same thing. I gave you a link to the steps you need to take with a link, i even gave you a link to the appdb itself
