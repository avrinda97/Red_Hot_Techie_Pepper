2006-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	inglor		what would it say?
2006-09-16T09:11:00.000Z	inglor		PCI driver ipw2200 has a struct device_driver, please update!
2006-09-16T09:11:00.000Z	inglor		that might be it?
2006-09-16T09:11:00.000Z	inglor		wait, no, that's the built in card, not the usb one
2006-09-16T09:11:00.000Z	inglor		ipw2200: Radio Frequency Kill Switch is On
2006-09-16T09:12:00.000Z	inglor		Kill switch must be turned off for wireless networking to work
2006-09-16T09:12:00.000Z	inglor		how do I turn the kill switch off?
2006-09-16T09:12:00.000Z	inglor		that's still the integrated wireless card
2006-09-16T09:12:00.000Z	inglor		but now I found out there is a kill switch that I need to turn off, the question is how
2006-09-16T09:13:00.000Z	inglor		again, same message, kill switch must be turned off, HOW
2006-09-16T09:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	i've nevr heard of this kill switch
2006-09-17T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	no idea what camorama is
2006-09-17T11:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	that was the idea, he wanted unrar-free
2006-09-17T11:12:00.000Z	inglor	eyequeue	ok, didn't know :) I'm new to the convo
2006-09-17T11:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	no prob, thought i would catch you up :)
2006-09-17T11:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	curious, how long does the battery typically last?
2006-09-19T14:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	ssh to an ubuntu box and run irssi from there (under screen)
2006-09-19T14:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	#ubuntu-xgl
2006-09-19T14:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	xgl broke it you said, as it breaks everything
2006-09-19T14:13:00.000Z	inglor	eyequeue	can you just tell me how to set the key combo that toggles a language?
2006-09-19T14:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	no idea, i don't use xgl
2006-09-19T14:14:00.000Z	inglor	eyequeue	it's XGL under gnome, it's the same way you'd do it in normal ubuntu
2006-09-19T14:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	inglor	i'm not a gui guy really
