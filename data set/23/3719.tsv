2009-12-01T21:55:00.000Z	subichan		ok i could set different permission on a file but i need to make it executable through the web instead of making it downloadable, as it's a perl script.. how can I go about that?
2009-12-01T21:56:00.000Z	unop	subichan	where is the script placed now?
2009-12-01T21:56:00.000Z	subichan	unop	in my server directory
2009-12-01T21:56:00.000Z	subichan	unop	where other html files are
2009-12-01T21:57:00.000Z	unop	subichan	off course. but perl scripts (by default) are only executable when placed in the 'cgi' directory
2009-12-01T21:57:00.000Z	subichan	unop	ahhhh.. never knew that.. ok i'll try that. thanks man.. lemme see if i can make it work with that tip
2009-12-01T21:59:00.000Z	unop	subichan	the cgi-bin directory is possibly /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ # you can use this command to make sure    grep -inHR cgi-bin /etc/apache2/
2009-12-01T22:00:00.000Z	subichan	unop	ah so putting it inside var/www/html/cgi-bin won't work.. because it didn't work in fact
2009-12-01T22:01:00.000Z	unop	subichan	well, you can change the location of your cgi-bin to  /var/www/html/cgi-bin/  if you like - but it's probably simpler to use the default directory and place your script in there
2009-12-01T22:02:00.000Z	subichan	unop	yeah indeed it is but then what would the url become?? /cgi-bin/script.pl ?
2009-12-01T22:02:00.000Z	unop	subichan	yea.  http://yourhost/cgi-bin/script.pl
2009-12-01T22:04:00.000Z	subichan	unop	now unfortunately people have to type http://myhost/html/index.html and i wanted to get rid of that /html/ step in there.. where can one change all these directory settings?
2009-12-01T22:04:00.000Z	unop	subichan	it seems you have placed all your content in /var/www/html/  - why not just have it all in /var/www/ ??
2009-12-01T22:06:00.000Z	subichan	unop	i stepped up on an already existing admin position.. anyway people don't really have to type all that, they just type the host and then it's redirected to myhost/html/ somehow.. and i don't have a clue as to how i could change that, as i'm not really acquainted with linux
2009-12-01T22:07:00.000Z	unop	subichan	well, it's in the config file for this particular site .. look in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
2009-12-01T22:08:00.000Z	subichan	unop	besides, the script now reacts this way: The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
2009-12-01T22:08:00.000Z	subichan	unop	so i'll eventually have to tinker with the configuration files
2009-12-01T22:08:00.000Z	unop	subichan	what does this script do?
2009-12-01T22:09:00.000Z	subichan	unop	nothin, just #!/bin/perl print("hi");
2009-12-01T22:10:00.000Z	unop	subichan	well, as far as CGI is concerned this perl script is incomplete - it does not print out any headers to notify the browser of the content type
2009-12-01T22:10:00.000Z	unop	subichan	 the best thing to do is have another terminal open and run this to debug your script.    sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
2009-12-01T22:11:00.000Z	unop	subichan	my guess is that you need another line.    print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; # before print "hi";
2009-12-01T22:17:00.000Z	subichan	unop	i think perl isn't installed..
