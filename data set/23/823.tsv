2011-01-23T11:47:00.000Z	minixking		gnea: any ideas on my problem?
2011-01-23T11:47:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	and you're asking me because..?
2011-01-23T11:47:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	well, you're right about that, but I never saw your problem, plus I can only help so many people at a time.
2011-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	not as much as 10.04 is
2011-01-23T11:56:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	wubi, TBPH, sucks as far as a permanent install goes. if you like it enough, you should install it to its own partition
2011-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	also, I have no idea what caused your original error with the .iso file
2011-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	well what method are you using to install it?
2011-01-23T11:58:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	could you please be more specific?
2011-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	is your windows user account administrator?
2011-01-23T12:07:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	I would recommend 10.04, not 10.10 for your first install
2011-01-23T12:10:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	if you use wubi, it will create a virtual filesystem in windows and then install to that file
2011-01-23T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	do you have enough drive space? which version of windows?
2011-01-23T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	wubi should have the option to use a .iso already downloaded
2011-01-23T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	when you run wubi.exe, make sure you look at the whole thing and look at each option before checking 'next'
2011-01-23T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	what did you select for installation drive, size and desktop environment?
2011-01-23T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	what about the drive?
2011-01-23T12:34:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	do you have a cd/dvd drive?
2011-01-23T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	lol
2011-01-23T13:19:00.000Z	minixking	Gnea	even when i burn the iso to a disk and reboot to install i get errors
2011-01-23T13:20:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	the same permission errors?
2011-01-23T13:29:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	never seen it
2011-01-23T13:33:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	I doubt it... it's something silly but not easily seen
2011-01-23T13:40:00.000Z	Gnea	minixking	eh?
