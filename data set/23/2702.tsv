2008-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	no network
2008-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	well that is not ubuntus fault :D
2008-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	and using vlc should always be a last resort
2008-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	why? vlc is great
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	no, it's horrible
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	it barely manages to get everything working in the least elegant way
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	there's a better solution for just about every format
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	ok well i have never had any problems, its one of the first things i install
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	maybe for you, for me it is perfect :)
2008-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	also, i have yet to find support for ass subtitles
2008-12-12T16:02:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	ok, well that is a sort of particular feature
2008-12-12T16:02:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	it will at least play pretty much any video file thrown at it though
2008-12-12T16:03:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	again, inelegantly. as stated previously, it uses its own decoders
2008-12-12T16:03:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	i care alot more about whether it works or not, thats just my priority
2008-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	why are you on linux again?
2008-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	because it works!
2008-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	have you tried os x/windows yet?
2008-12-12T16:05:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	why are you some kind of windows fan?
2008-12-12T16:05:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	no. but i feel that if you're going to use windows, you've adopted the mentality that "it works" isn't good enough
2008-12-12T16:05:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	linux works well, thats why i use it, same goes for vlc
2008-12-12T16:07:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	if you ever have the misfortune to use windows you will see it does not work as reliably as linux does :)
2008-12-12T16:07:00.000Z	raylu	mchelen	i use it all the time for gaming
2008-12-12T16:08:00.000Z	mchelen	raylu	suit yourself, however my preference is the stability of linux
