2008-11-06T08:03:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny		Hey, I need help. I just installed 8.10, and everything seems to be fine except for the face that I can't find my wireless network. I can see everyone house around me, but just not mine. All other laptops in my house can connect to mine, but I can't even detect it. Any idea what is wrong?

2008-11-06T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	did you try just entering your details manually?
2008-11-06T08:10:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: I have tried letting it use the old info, tried entering it manually, and even deleted it from the list. It doesn't show up as a network around me
2008-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	all I can suggest is that you enter your wireless SSID and other details directly in System -> Preferences -> Network Configuration -> wireless
2008-11-06T08:12:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: What is SSID?
2008-11-06T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	the name your wireless network shows up as
2008-11-06T08:16:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Didn't work. It still doesn't show up as a wireless network :( Out of ideas?
2008-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	did you tell it to connect automatically in your network configuration?
2008-11-06T08:18:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Yes, I did. It seems like it can't even detect the network to even aoutomaticly connect
2008-11-06T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	what happens on reboot?  You don't get connected?
2008-11-06T08:19:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Nope. But it does detect all other wireless networks around except mine. I checked mine out, tested other laptops in the house, and reset the modem. Still will not show up on only my computer.
2008-11-06T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	after you added your network manually to network configuration and rebooted, it did not work?
2008-11-06T08:21:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: No, but I will try to reboot again and come back here if you think that would be a good shot to try again.
2008-11-06T08:21:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	give it a shot, I don't understand exactly how nm works
2008-11-06T08:22:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Ok, rebooting now.
2008-11-06T08:26:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Nope, still can't detect my network.
2008-11-06T08:26:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	don't know then
2008-11-06T08:27:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Yes, this is a duel core intel laptop
2008-11-06T08:29:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: Make sure what is turned on? If you mean the wireless network conection program, yes, it is. It connected imidiatly to my neighbor's wireless when I turned the laptop on
2008-11-06T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	that was SeaPhor
2008-11-06T08:30:00.000Z	Bigblackbunny	jrib	: What is SeaPhor?
2008-11-06T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	Bigblackbunny	he's a user of this channel trying to help you :)
