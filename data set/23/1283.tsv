2010-12-29T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	my method of veno security is that I enable and disable it over ssh with gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled false and gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true ,
2010-12-29T09:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	If you real paranoid and need more security you can connect through ssh as shown here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=475839
2010-12-29T09:31:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	have you heard of vino being unsecure? I had a password protected and found someone else controling my desktop. Now that machine is no longer connected to any network.
2010-12-29T09:41:00.000Z	mbrproblem10		Well, lets say that someone had Remote Desktop access to my ubuntu 10.10 for a unknown amount of time. I was also checking in on the machine and saw nothing unusual from my client. How do i tell if my ubunto 10.10 install is no longer secure?
2010-12-29T09:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	I assume you read this to add security to veno http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=475839
2010-12-29T09:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	you can see what ubuntu is listening on with sudo netstat -pant
2010-12-29T09:43:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	i am reading it now.
2010-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	to add security on ssh change the listen port to something other than port 22
2010-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	yeah, next time I go away, I will be using VNC over ssh and I will change the port. Currently, I need to figure out how to tell if my machine is compromized. I have already changed all of my important passwords, I am trying to decide if i need to do a clean wipe and reinstall of 10.10
2010-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	what makes you think it's compromized?
2010-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	someone was controling my computer via VNC.
2010-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	oh ok, and what account was it?  a sudo user?
2010-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	mbrproblem10		... good question.
2010-12-29T09:50:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	what ever default account ubuntu 10.10 has you create.
2010-12-29T09:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	well with only one account it must be sudo'ed
2010-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	well if it helps, i always have to sudo anything when i am at the command prompt.
2010-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	I know that occasionally after I sudo, a key appears as an icon in one of the task panals... but this icon is not normally there.
2010-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	if you know the date and time of the attack you could do a find  that searches for files modified after that window of attack
2010-12-29T09:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	also you can look at logs for /etc/var/auth.log  to see if sudo was accesed in that window of time
2010-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	I turned the server on and have been gone for the last 5 days. :< During my VNC sessions I did occasionally see "someone else is controlling the computer" but i assumed they ment Me. But today while i was local to my machine, I still had The server running and i got that message and someone really did start controling my computer.
2010-12-29T09:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	cool can you see what Ip address it was?
2010-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	sacarlson	Originally i came in here looking for a vino log. But its clear now that vino doesnt log anything. so No i did not.
2010-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	mbrproblem10	you must have a very weak password?
