2006-11-22T08:35:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	good luck.
2006-11-22T08:15:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	it's cached.
2006-11-22T08:15:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	Im not sure it is as my swap file isnt being used at all
2006-11-22T08:16:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	that's good... your swap shouldn't be getting used. if it is, then you need more RAM...  what you're seeing is cached RAM...
2006-11-22T08:17:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	it's okay... you just don't understand how Linux uses RAM yet...  you are fine.
2006-11-22T08:18:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	example:  You run firefox...  then close it...  it doesn't clear firefox from the RAM, it keeps it cahced so if you use it again.. it's already there... thus improving load time...  however; if that space is needed because you are using other apps, it will readily use that space without thinking.
2006-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	what is the problem?
2006-11-22T08:20:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	ive installed the exact same OS on two of exactly the same servers, both running as dns servers. they both fetch names just as quickly but the primary dns server takes up to five minutes to load a program in the gnome gui, yet does not seem to be processing or reading anything in this time.
2006-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	strange, perhaps a corruption during install? also... why are you running gnome on a DNS server?
2006-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	because Im a dunce and couldnt begin to setup NAMED without webmin :p
2006-11-22T08:22:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	webmin doesn't require X... it's web-based.. simply connect to it from another machine.  ;)
2006-11-22T08:25:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	have any more ideas as to what it might be?
2006-11-22T08:28:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	not really man... maybe something got corrupted during install??  does _any_ app take that long to load, or just certain ones?
2006-11-22T08:29:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	all of them take a while, except named and ubuntu itself, all startup code seems to run OK
2006-11-22T08:29:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	try to launch the gui app from a terminal and see if it gives any messages...
2006-11-22T08:30:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	what's an strace?
2006-11-22T08:31:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	sounds fuuun :p, thanks alot for your help anyway. I think it might actually be a hardware problem, since it's happened with two distros
2006-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	possible... hard drive may be dying.
2006-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	Ill stick in some new ram and see how it goes, lift the old stuff out
2006-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	I doubt it as it's scsi, not too old and it boots ubuntu fairly quickly
2006-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	quiet	Aberry	is this edgy or dapper?
2006-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	I cant remember, I think edgy, I know it's the newer distro with the shorter support length
2006-11-22T08:35:00.000Z	Aberry	quiet	ok thanks alot for your help anyhow, i'll have a fiddle see what it comes up with
