2009-04-23T14:25:00.000Z	bovv		I need to find where the option for disabling Compviz is... what is the command-line command for getting to it?  (even if it opens the window, that's fine...)
2009-04-23T14:26:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	I don't know command line. DOn't you have access to GUI?
2009-04-23T14:28:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	yeah, but I cannot find the option... :-(
2009-04-23T14:29:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	idea... can you open the option and tell me what process is running?
2009-04-23T14:29:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects
2009-04-23T14:29:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	It should be there, but I am running in Japanese... and the option is MISSING.
2009-04-23T14:31:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	that shouldn't be the case.
2009-04-23T14:31:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	it is.
2009-04-23T14:32:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	so...  could you do the "System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects" and tell me what it is running, please?
2009-04-23T14:36:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	I understand that it doesn't make sense to you, but this config is what it is... I still need to disable Compviz... and the option is not visible.  Not my fault tha somebody packaged things this way.  But I really do need to disable Compviz and it would be really helpful if somebody usijng an English locale would help out with only the process program name so I came fix things here.
2009-04-23T14:39:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	I wish I could help, but I do not know the command line
2009-04-23T14:40:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	OK... no prob... I will tell you the command you need to type. (I'm old school)
2009-04-23T14:41:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	FIRST, open up that Compviz thing.
2009-04-23T14:41:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	SECOND, open up a gnome-terminal
2009-04-23T14:42:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	THIRD, in the terminal type the following on the command line: ps -ef
2009-04-23T14:42:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	The last new lines should contain the Compviz thingy.
2009-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	That's it... got it?
2009-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	yes got it
2009-04-23T14:46:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	what did the "ps" show?
2009-04-23T14:46:00.000Z	slytherin	bovv	I am not using compiz. :-)
2009-04-23T14:47:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	you don't need to be... you do have the option in your menu don't you?
2009-04-23T14:48:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	just do a "System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects" and tell me what is the name of the program running, please?
2009-04-23T14:49:00.000Z	bovv	slytherin	Now I am not even asking you about Compviz.
