2006-06-30T14:44:00.000Z	Paladine		50 quid for a mouse?
2006-06-30T14:44:00.000Z	Paladine		my wireless keyboard and mouse cost me 12 quid
2006-06-30T14:45:00.000Z	Paladine		I wasn't criticising your purchase, I was criticising the price
2006-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Paladine		no offense intended but is it a microsoft mouse?
2006-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Paladine		it could be it simply isn't supported in linux
2006-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Paladine		like all 3 of my webcams for example
2006-06-30T14:48:00.000Z	Paladine		funky usb devices and linux don't play well together in my experience
2006-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	Paladine		djk, might be /etc/init.d/cupsys
2006-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	Paladine		yeah what judah said
2006-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	it is.
2006-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	then you have to sym link it to the run level you want it to start in.
2006-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	Paladine	judah	ahh
2006-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	/etc/rc2.d for run level two.
2006-06-30T15:15:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	i'm assuming that you're trying to get something to start on boot?
2006-06-30T15:15:00.000Z	Paladine	judah	not me, but yeah
2006-06-30T15:16:00.000Z	Paladine	judah	you seem pretty competent, can you help me fix my "Locale is not supported by Xlib" issue?
2006-06-30T15:17:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	if you're patient. i'm actually working on something right now that should take more attention than this channel ;)
2006-06-30T15:17:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	but i get distracted by it sometimes.
2006-06-30T15:17:00.000Z	Paladine	judah	Iam patient :)
2006-06-30T15:17:00.000Z	judah	Paladine	do you have a pastebin of your error?
2006-06-30T15:18:00.000Z	Paladine	judah	I will have in just a few seconds
