2011-07-27T12:31:00.000Z	OSInet		Hello. I have a problem on natty: files in /opt with mode 0755 are modified every night to 0655, and I cannot figure whence it comes. I have checked root's crontab and there is nothing in it to cause this. I did not identify any visible cause in /etc/cron.d[aily] either. Any suggestions ?
2011-07-27T12:32:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	One /usr?
2011-07-27T12:33:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	? this happens only on /opt
2011-07-27T12:34:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	Ok, I had a like error, it was multiple /usr thing. let me look at the boards....
2011-07-27T12:36:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	It is a Binary?
2011-07-27T12:38:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	OK, here is what I just found, is rather recent: http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2011/07/msg00122.html , am not sure about the Unity part of it .
2011-07-27T12:39:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	I'm not running unity but classic
2011-07-27T12:40:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	Then take a look at that link, is Debian, and it sorta addresses the question as stated.
2011-07-27T12:42:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	just did that, but I don't see how it applies: the suggested patch does not modify any chmod line, only chown
2011-07-27T12:42:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	Ok, on it still, I may be a moment,,,,
2011-07-27T12:45:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	srry, 755 and 777?
2011-07-27T12:46:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	yes, the executable script is 755 and every morning I find it reset to 655
2011-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	Scroll down to Strange Numbers: http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml
2011-07-27T12:51:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	yes, and ?
2011-07-27T12:52:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	Is that the error and possible remedy?
2011-07-27T12:53:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	sorry, but I just do not understand what you are trying to tell me: by pointing to the description of octal perms. In other words, the file is -rwxr-xr-x normally, but every morning it is reset to -rwr-xr-x, which is as useless a permission as can be IMHO
2011-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	I understand, that is why I posted that page, there are u.o.a. and other sys calls that can and do tangle those calls around.
2011-07-27T12:58:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	indeed, chown will reset bit 04000, for instance
2011-07-27T12:58:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	That is a start...
2011-07-27T13:00:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	That is what it sounded like from the go, time synch stuff,
2011-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	ok, till tomorrow, then
2011-07-27T13:02:00.000Z	gnewb	OSInet	And check your BIOS clock, just in case.
2011-07-27T13:02:00.000Z	OSInet	gnewb	nice idea
