2009-04-02T06:04:00.000Z	kitchenrange		is there any way i can change my default torrent application on the newest ubuntu
2009-04-02T06:05:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	right click on a torrent file and choose properties then go to the "open with" tab
2009-04-02T06:07:00.000Z	kitchenrange		hey Hammerjak ive done that, but for some reason, when i open the torrents with any other client, they will not download
2009-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	kitchenrange		 hey Hammerjak ive done that, but for some reason, when i open the torrents with any other client, they will not download
2009-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	so it opens in the correct application but then doesn't download?
2009-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	kitchenrange		exactly Hammerjak
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	kitchenrange		im not sure if it has anything to do with it being a private torrent site or not
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	which application is it not working with?
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	kitchenrange		ive tried a few...
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	kitchenrange		ktorrent
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	kitchenrange		and vuze
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	Hammerjak		are there any applications that work?
2009-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	kitchenrange		cant find the executable file for bittorrent though
2009-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	kitchenrange		the files download with the default client.  But the client is listed on the site as one not to use, because it has problems reporting the downloads and uploads
2009-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	kitchenrange		so i dont get credit for my seeding
2009-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	Hammerjak		ah
2009-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	Hammerjak		well, if it works in one application but not another then it must not be configured correctly
2009-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	Hammerjak		maybe wrong ports
2009-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	kitchenrange	Hammerjak	: ive tried randomizing the ports (a feature of ktorrent) but that didnt help.  Where would i look for the executable file for Bittorrent?
2009-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	'which bittorrent' ?
2009-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	from a terminal
2009-04-02T06:15:00.000Z	kitchenrange	Hammerjak	mind if we talk through private messages?
2009-04-02T06:15:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kitchenrange	 sure, but i'm not sure how much i'll be able to help
