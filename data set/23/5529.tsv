2006-11-07T10:58:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	it seems to be in the universe repository, at least in edgy
2006-11-07T11:00:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	nothlit	- it's not in dapper but it's supported, blah this is giving me a headache
2006-11-07T11:01:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	once you download it, navigate to its location in the console then type sudo dpkg -i <packagename>.deb
2006-11-07T11:02:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you should also be able to just double click on it and there should be deb installer program with a gui
2006-11-07T11:06:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you said download the <package> manually, anyways to compile from source extract the archive go into the directory type configure then make, then sudo make install
2006-11-07T11:06:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	 but you have to make sure the package build-essential is installed
2006-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	there should be a readme included with most source packages
2006-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you want to install from source correct?
2006-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	nothlit	- well.. what do I do..
2006-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you've downloaded the source 'package' correct?

2006-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	nothlit	okay >.>
2006-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	once you've downloaded it, find it in your file browser and double click it
2006-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	if its on that website, it should be in the universe repository
2006-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	nothlit	- uhm wifi-radar nor anything else is picking up a wireless signal.. It works because I have my windows system working with wireless, Im on my laptop which is wired to my pc, It has a internal wireless card, It had Windows on it before hand and worked fine with the wireless internet, eth1 is my wireless settings, and it is being detected, but yet no wireless networks, any idea why.
2006-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you should follow this guide to add the extra repositories if you want to inshttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu?highlight=%28repository%29tall stuff from the extra two repositories in the future
2006-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	sorry, the computers i've installed ubuntu on don't use wireless
2006-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	nothlit	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	you should ask people about ndiswrapper though, probably
