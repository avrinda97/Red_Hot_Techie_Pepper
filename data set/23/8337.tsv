2004-10-18T16:32:00.000Z	sap		yes, i have xp, ubuntu and debian on one disk
2004-10-18T13:51:00.000Z	slarti	sap	i'm guessing in the same area as most *nixes... device support.
2004-10-18T13:52:00.000Z	sap	slarti	right
2004-10-18T13:53:00.000Z	slarti	sap	for example, all the pieces are there to use the (now discontinued) intelplay q3x microscope, but there's no solid application for dealing with that particular device.
2004-10-18T13:54:00.000Z	slarti	sap	bad example, but the idea is there.
2004-10-18T13:56:00.000Z	sap	slarti	right, i need to buy some obscure hardware then ;)
2004-10-18T13:57:00.000Z	slarti	sap	What else would you use Ebay for?
2004-10-18T13:58:00.000Z	slarti	sap	are you looking for something to do today, or are you just curious about what needs to be done?
2004-10-18T14:02:00.000Z	sap	slarti	just curious i suppose ... would like to help if i could
2004-10-18T14:03:00.000Z	slarti	sap	see above
2004-10-18T14:08:00.000Z	slarti	sap	i think it would be great if ubuntu (gnome) had better network administration tools.
2004-10-18T14:10:00.000Z	sap	slarti	such as?
2004-10-18T14:13:00.000Z	sap	slarti	anyway, i'll keep using it and see how it goes ... i'm impressed so far though
2004-10-18T14:13:00.000Z	sap	slarti	thanks
2004-10-18T14:15:00.000Z	slarti	sap	my big concern right now is that the network admin tool freezes whenever a wireless device is enabled.
2004-10-18T14:17:00.000Z	sap	slarti	has this been reported as a bug?
2004-10-18T14:17:00.000Z	slarti	sap	yep... hang on a sec.
2004-10-18T14:19:00.000Z	slarti	sap	i think it's 1069
2004-10-18T14:20:00.000Z	sap	slarti	ok, got it
2004-10-18T14:30:00.000Z	slarti	sap	actually, i was looking into that bug when you came on.
2004-10-18T14:31:00.000Z	sap	slarti	heh, is it fixed then?
2004-10-18T14:31:00.000Z	slarti	sap	by looking into, i mean learning about ifconfig, ifup/down, ifstate, hotplug, etc.
2004-10-18T14:31:00.000Z	slarti	sap	by no means. :)
