2012-06-03T16:19:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	more a shot in the dark, as I haven't investigated further, recompiling also by modulassistant often brought up missing drivers, if you lauch alsamixergui, is your chip displayed in it's head ?
2012-06-03T16:20:00.000Z	DasEi		recompiling alsa*

2012-06-03T16:20:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	ah, good sign, and the speaker icons above the faders are green ? both main and pcm ?
2012-06-03T16:21:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	sudo apt-get install vlc pastebinit && pastebinit /var/log/syslog
2012-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	then launch vlc from terminal to see additional output
2012-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	uuser		i sais i have only alsamixer, so... no spearks icon... but it seems the controls (both main and pcm) reacts fine
2012-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	sudo apt-getinstall alsamixergui -y && alsamixergui
2012-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	uuser	DasEi	they should be similar...
2012-06-03T16:25:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	there shall be these icons for speakers in top of the faders, muted by default often (green or greyed)
2012-06-03T16:25:00.000Z	uuser		i'm installing vlc
2012-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	uuser	DasEi	vlc is playing an mp3 but no i hear no sound. lanched from terminal it doen't output any special info
2012-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	uuser		i got it!
2012-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	so still soundsystem , again, channels not muted ? for usual, once the gui shows correct chip and unmuted all is fine
2012-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	uuser	DasEi	it works now
2012-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	DasEi		!yay | uuser

2012-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	DasEi		:)
2012-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	uuser		but how to be able to do this globally?
2012-06-03T16:29:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	using unity ? will have to dig that out yourself, or second, I see if I find the command from my gnome, second
2012-06-03T16:29:00.000Z	uuser	DasEi	this way onyl vlc works...
2012-06-03T16:31:00.000Z	uuser	DasEi	i had to remove pulseaudio, does this make sense to you?
2012-06-03T16:33:00.000Z	DasEi	uuser	no, pulse is like a soundproxy, I 'think' it was asounconf-gtk or even gnome-volume-manager, found under system>sound, idk where unity left that setting
