2005-07-30T08:42:00.000Z	bob2		you just run fsck on it, that's all
2005-07-30T08:43:00.000Z	bob2		"loaded"?
2005-07-30T08:43:00.000Z	bob2		you mean the kernel didn't detect it at all?
2005-07-30T08:44:00.000Z	bob2		that's fine
2005-07-30T08:44:00.000Z	bob2		df only shows mounted filesystems
2005-07-30T08:44:00.000Z	bob2		so
2005-07-30T08:44:00.000Z	bob2		you need to point  fsck at the hard disk
2005-07-30T08:45:00.000Z	bob2		just as the help output says
2005-07-30T08:45:00.000Z	bob2		fsck /dev/whatever
2005-07-30T08:45:00.000Z	bob2		you need to go find out what device it is
2005-07-30T08:46:00.000Z	quad	bob2	is there a solution to the dhcp bug where it isn't able to get a lease on an ip from my router (someone else had the problem here http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=51242)
2005-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	quad	bob2	haha yeah, is there any other solution currently?
2005-07-30T08:48:00.000Z	quad	bob2	as in get a static ip?
2005-07-30T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	quad	no, as in configure it manually with dlicnet
2005-07-30T08:48:00.000Z	quad	bob2	ok, i will play with that
2005-07-31T09:08:00.000Z	bob2	quad	does setting it statically work?
2005-07-31T09:08:00.000Z	quad	bob2	my isp doesn't allow them
2005-07-31T09:09:00.000Z	bob2	quad	does "pump" instead of dhclient work?
2005-07-31T09:09:00.000Z	quad	bob2	lemme check pump, it is the default kernel
2005-07-31T09:09:00.000Z	quad	bob2	i don't have a program called pump
2005-07-31T09:10:00.000Z	quad	bob2	yeah, lemme see what i can do
2005-07-31T09:26:00.000Z	quad	bob2	i am trying to install pump, but my cdrom isn't mounting
2005-07-31T09:31:00.000Z	quad	bob2	pump worked
