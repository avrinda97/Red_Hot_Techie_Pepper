2011-06-10T12:12:00.000Z	woomla		I've mounted a windows share on server 10.04 and can read but cannot write, what can I do to enable write access?
2011-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	Using Samba? or NFS?
2011-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	I think samba
2011-06-10T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	And you're on Ubuntu trying to write to Windows? or on Windows trying to write to Ubuntu?
2011-06-10T12:16:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	I'm on ubuntu server trying to write to windows. I have an entry in fsab //server/share /mnt/share cifs exec,credentials=/etc/cifspw 0 0
2011-06-10T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	I believe you need to mount it with "uid=whatever-your-user-is", that makes you the owner, and able to modify
2011-06-10T12:21:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	In cifspw I have username=<myname> password=<my password>. And I'm able to read the contents and copy etc.
2011-06-10T12:21:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	That's the password for Windows, the uid=* is the UID for Linux
2011-06-10T12:22:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	(one tells you what to tell Windows who you are, the latter tells linux who to mount it as)
2011-06-10T12:22:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	So I put uid=root at the line in fstab?
2011-06-10T12:23:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	Probably uid=1000 (assuming you're the first user on the system)
2011-06-10T12:24:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	It's actually the second user. How again do I get this uid? (i'm rather new to linux)
2011-06-10T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	'id' will spit out a bunch of stuff, you're looking for the first bit "uid=1001(woomla)" or something similar, that number is your uid
2011-06-10T12:26:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	got it
2011-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	Works! I put uid=1002 in fstab, mount -a and now I can write to the share for this user.
2011-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	Glad to hear it
2011-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	Can i put more uid in fstab? I want other users to have access to.
2011-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/samba-fileserver.html might help if you're looking for more information, and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently (the latter breaks down each piece and explains it in the fstab options)
2011-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	thanx
2011-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	You can only specify one uid (because that becoems the "owner" of the files, but you *can* specify a gid (group ID), and then let that group have access.  But I imagine this problem is more common than just you, so someone may have a more elegant solution
2011-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	Seems the group thing is what this recommends: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently#Multiple%20Users  However, you might also try adding "noperm" instead of uid=*, see if that works.
2011-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	woomla	The latter suggestion comes from here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=283131 (search for samba), it is old though (2006), so that's why I'm not sure if it will work.  But we can try it!
2011-06-10T12:37:00.000Z	woomla	Flannel	I'll give it a try
