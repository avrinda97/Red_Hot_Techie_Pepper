2008-08-26T05:52:00.000Z	_Zeus_		hey i need some help.  my internet is messed up.  I can visit websites by IP, but not by name.  My /etc/resolv.conf file is empty, and resolvconf won't update it
2008-08-26T05:53:00.000Z	_Zeus_		you can download a .bin from the real website
2008-08-26T05:53:00.000Z	_Zeus_		it works just fine
2008-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	_Zeus_		i use it :-P
2008-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	_Zeus_		anyone know how to fix /etc/resolv.conf?
2008-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	do you connect to the net via a router?
2008-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	I'm behind a server and I have a static IP
2008-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	assumin you know that much, do you know what the DNS server is supposed to be? the IP?
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	yes, and i have it set.  I can visit sites by IP :-P
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	you have set it, and it blanks itself out?
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	no, i have internet
2008-08-26T05:59:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	you run something like sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf    and put nameserver 12.45.45.34 (the IP of DNS server) ?
2008-08-26T05:59:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	I haven't done that; /etc/resolv.conf says it shouldn't be edited by hand
2008-08-26T06:00:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	i know, normally dhclient3 fills it. however you can use the GUI instead
2008-08-26T06:00:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	what gui?
2008-08-26T06:00:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	in the top right hand cornor you have the network screen icon yes?
2008-08-26T06:00:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	dhclient3 fixed it.  thanks :-)
2008-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	cool. :)
2008-08-26T06:04:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	when i booted up, it was broken again, but i ran dhclient3 again and it works now.  Is it bad to put that in Sessions?
2008-08-26T06:05:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	this is to do with the static ip . dhcp uses dhclient3 to get ipaddress information from the network instead of applying it manually
2008-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	you can try the menu > System > Administration > Network"
2008-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	_Zeus_	bofh80	no, that's setup fine
2008-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	bofh80	_Zeus_	there is a tab to enter the DNS, you can set it manuall there yourself.
