2009-01-11T20:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	generally that key is supposed to send integers to /proc/acpi/toshiba/lcd (on my toshiba)
2009-01-11T20:52:00.000Z	RPS	outbackwifi	is there something I can try to wake it up?
2009-01-11T20:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	try sending echo 'brightness : 5 > /proc/acpi/toshiba/lcd
2009-01-11T20:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	replace toshiba with dell in your case (should work)
2009-01-11T20:54:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	 echo 'brightness : ' 5 > /proc/acpi/dell/lcd
2009-01-11T20:54:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	the second apostrophe also
2009-01-11T20:56:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	though on my asus laptop it is /proc/acpi/asus/brn
2009-01-11T20:58:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	just found  out that on my laptop it works  like this; sudo -i to  get into root shell and then echo 5 > /proc/acpi/asus/brn
2009-01-11T20:59:00.000Z	RPS	outbackwifi	try that last command with dell in place of asus
2009-01-11T20:59:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	i dont have a dell
2009-01-11T21:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	maybe your acpid isnt being passed that event anymore
2009-01-11T21:09:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	trying the manual way will at least tell you whether your backlight is ok
2009-01-11T21:11:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	can you tell me the contents of ls -l /proc/acpi/dell (pastebinit please)
2009-01-11T21:13:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	can you pastebin ls /proc/acpi
2009-01-11T21:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	pastebin it please dont flood here
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	thats funny our directories are similar except for the fact that you dont have a machine specific like dell (i have asus)
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	did anything change for this to happen?
2009-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	RPS	outbackwifi	are you working on a line of code for me?
2009-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	im trying to
2009-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	i just found out; the brightness control on the 620 is totally hardware controlled not OS. So you probably have to take it to dell for fixing
2009-01-11T21:28:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	its the up arrow  prolly
2009-01-11T21:42:00.000Z	RPS	outbackwifi	Jack_Sparrow uh a simple reboot fixed the whole screen brightness issue ...I'd be happy, but I'm too busy being embarrassed. LOL
2009-01-11T21:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	RPS	good for you :)
