2007-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	tyoc		but I need to know if it is already working masmota
2007-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	masmota	tyoc	 cant u just open sound recorder, and test it?
2007-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	tyoc		it doesnt work
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	when I hit play after "recording" there is no sound
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	thus I think micro isnt working
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	masmota		is your mic muted? ...check the volume settings on the tray?
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	I have: front mic, line in, and microphpone
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	masmota	tyoc	 none are muted?
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	all 3 are at high position
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	tyoc		and without the cross
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	yea, none muted
2007-11-03T03:29:00.000Z	masmota	tyoc	should be working then...theres not a mute button on the mic, right?  thats the only thing i can think of
2007-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	yea, in the list of recording are like 5 options
2007-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	digital, mic boost, front mic boost, etc
2007-11-03T03:31:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	or you know of a link htat I can give a try?
2007-11-03T03:32:00.000Z	masmota	tyoc	 sure dont... and im on my laptop now w/ no mic available to try it..
2007-11-03T03:33:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	I have added other controls to the list...
2007-11-03T03:34:00.000Z	tyoc		now when recording I only listen mess, not my voice
2007-11-03T03:34:00.000Z	tyoc	masmota	at less that is a step toward listen my voice :)
