2006-04-10T10:43:00.000Z	zezu		SDL
2006-04-10T10:43:00.000Z	zezu		I dont have hardware opengl support

2006-04-10T10:43:00.000Z	zezu		i want to use the "ati" driver which is the open source one, but has ok 2d support
2006-04-10T10:44:00.000Z	AngryElf	zezu	have you tried ati's version?
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	zezu	AngryElf	fglrx ? its absolute horseshit
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	zezu		it doesn't work here
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	zezu		at all
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	zezu		period
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	zezu		and believe me, i'd attempted it many many many times
2006-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	AngryElf	zezu	it's rockin my box right now

2006-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	zezu		anyways the target platform for what i'm writing is actually linux w/ no X
2006-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	zezu		and on an intel 865 chipset
2006-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	zezu		so i dont know how good of opengl support i can get w/ that
2006-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	zezu		does gl even work w/o X ?
2006-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	AngryElf		you've got to creat the .deb packages
2006-04-10T10:47:00.000Z	AngryElf		from the ati installer
2006-04-10T10:47:00.000Z	zezu	AngryElf	believe me i've gone more into detail than you w/ that
