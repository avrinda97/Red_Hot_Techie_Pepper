2006-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	rishi	tristanmike	yeah
2006-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	tristanmike	rishi	you will need to open them in your router
2006-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	rishi	tristanmike	they are open, the problem is the default port for bittorrent is 6881, which is blacklisted...how do i change that?
2006-04-08T05:48:00.000Z	tristanmike	rishi	wow, I've never used it, it has a very basic interface, would you use azureus ?
2006-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	rishi	tristanmike	yeah, i guess, i didn't want to go through all the install of java etc...i just don't know how to open the bittorrent gui
