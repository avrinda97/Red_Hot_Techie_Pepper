2007-07-31T13:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Anything you don't know keep default
2007-07-31T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Are you using fglrx?
2007-07-31T13:10:00.000Z	Meta4ical	Jordan_U	That's what's causing the black screen, I'm TRYING to use fglrx :P
2007-07-31T13:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Ademan_  AIGLX does not work with fglrx, that is what is causing the error "(EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable"
2007-07-31T13:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Have you tried dpkg-reconfigure instead of aticonfig?
2007-07-31T13:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Might as well just choose fglrx
2007-07-31T13:24:00.000Z	Meta4ical	Jordan_U	How do I know which bus identifier to use? I'm afraid the default might be for a second monitor
2007-07-31T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	I don't know, I am a single monitor man :(
2007-07-31T13:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Ok, I guess it doesn't work when you restart X ?
2007-07-31T13:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Meta4ical	Just keep the default
2007-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	Meta4ical	Jordan_U	fyrestrtr: What's next?
