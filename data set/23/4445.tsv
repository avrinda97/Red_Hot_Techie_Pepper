2008-03-21T00:02:00.000Z	matti_		ive only had ubuntu a day
2008-03-21T00:03:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	run   sudo apt-get install pidgin   in a terminal, and put the complete output (including the command) on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-03-21T00:05:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	I gave you the link to paste into
2008-03-21T00:08:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	you have getdeb stuff in your repository list?
2008-03-21T00:09:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	let me ask it this way: did you download pidgin from getdeb and try to install it?
2008-03-21T00:10:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	 dpkg -l *pidgin* | grep ^ii , delete those packages.
2008-03-21T00:11:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	  sudo apt-get remove <all those packages>
2008-03-21T00:12:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	that first command,   dpkg -l '*pidgin'* | grep ^ii   (copy and paste into a terminal)  will list the package names you put after remove
2008-03-21T00:12:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	erg, typo: dpkg -l '*pidgin*' | grep ^i  is correct
2008-03-21T00:15:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	something happened, it says something when you do that
2008-03-21T00:16:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	say yes
2008-03-21T00:17:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	then it will say something about removing  some packages, should have removed pidgin-data (and pidgin)
2008-03-21T00:17:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	it's a good bet
2008-03-21T00:18:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	read what it says, so you have a better understanding, then say yes :)
2008-03-21T00:19:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	no problem, you learn by doing (and paying attention to what you are doing :) Beginners are always welcom
2008-03-21T00:22:00.000Z	nikrud	matti_	that's ok, Lamego remembered that pidgin uses a silly name for the libs
