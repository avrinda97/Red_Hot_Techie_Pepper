2008-12-23T03:39:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	Thks a lot. Ive done that and will give it a try. Hope I have better luck this time round. Thks again
2008-12-23T03:42:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	I opened the localhost CUPS, but I couldnt find my pritner on it
2008-12-23T03:43:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	perhaps it's not installed
2008-12-23T03:44:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	But if I go to System - Admin - printing and type in new I can find it on the list
2008-12-23T03:46:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	It seems to have installed it now OK and automatically when I turned it on. I printed a test page and its OK
2008-12-23T03:47:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	cheers
2008-12-23T03:47:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	Whats been happening up til now is that I can print a few sheets black and then color all OK. When I ask for photo quality paper and photo quality this is when the trouble starts????
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	it depends what program you're printing from... different programs can sometimes use a different method of formatting text and images
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	Then can you guide me a little please?? What do you mean by what program I am printing from
2008-12-23T03:49:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	well, what program(s) are you trying to print from currently?
2008-12-23T03:49:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	I am using Ubuntu 8.10 desktop edition is that what you mean?
2008-12-23T03:50:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	no... what did you try printing before?
2008-12-23T03:50:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	Sorry . I was just printing some photos
2008-12-23T03:50:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	using what program? the gimp? firefox? paint? ?
2008-12-23T03:50:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	now my Printer configuration has blocked and I cant do turn it off
2008-12-23T03:51:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	I think it was Gnome. I just clicked on the photo and then file, print etc.,
2008-12-23T03:52:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	can you try to do it again? instead of file->print, how about help->about
2008-12-23T03:53:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	OK I will try again and see what happens. Hope the system doesnt go down again. See you later!!!
2008-12-23T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	good luck
2008-12-23T03:59:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	No luck. I tried to print what I wanted but its tellling me my printer isnt connected and it is?
2008-12-23T04:00:00.000Z	Gnea	david38840	you forgot a step: Help->About
2008-12-23T04:02:00.000Z	david38840	Gnea	I did this and it said eye of Gnome 2.24.1 does that help at all?
