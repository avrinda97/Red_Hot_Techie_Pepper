2010-03-18T03:30:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		Is there a way to install updates without needing to restart your computer; Karmic
2010-03-18T03:30:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	the only reason you'd need to restart is if it installs a new kernel
2010-03-18T03:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	yeah, rebooting isn't essential as it is in windows, but it can't hurt. you could also tell the system not to install upgrades as much.
2011-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	AFAIK yes, it's a dell precision 390 and I just hit F12 to set it as the device to boot from
2011-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	And it still isn't booting off of the USB?
2011-01-21T11:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	it BOOTS off of the USB, but Ubuntu *itself* refuses to accept the fact that the USB device itself is considered the CDROM device, so it never gets to the actual installation phase.
2011-01-21T11:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	it goes to detect the CDROM and it comes up and says "you don't have anything to install from, you are screwed."
2011-01-21T11:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	Yes, the ISO is on the usb drive, no, it's a flash memory stick.
2011-01-21T11:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	USB drive is a sandisk cruser
2011-01-21T11:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	I tried on a sandisk cruzer blade as well, same deal
2011-01-21T11:21:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	Heh, not entirely sure whats going on. But you could try to mount the ISO to /media/disk or something and then have the installer query for drives, perhaps?
2011-01-21T11:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	haven't tried that, one sec...
2011-01-21T11:21:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	I have no idea if that will work, though.
2011-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	negative, tried it on /media/disk and then on /media by itself, it's full of fail.
2011-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	Eh, was worth a shot I guess...
2011-01-21T11:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	indeed
2011-01-21T11:26:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	Wait, I think for it to be recognized as a cdrom drive, it needs to be /media/cdrom0 (or some other number, but 0 is a safe bet I think)
2011-01-21T11:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	k I'll give that a shot
2011-01-21T11:27:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	doing /media/drive was just putting it on the filesystem in that spot, but the cdrom0 should actually make it think its a drive. Again, I could be wrong....
2011-01-21T11:27:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Gnea	Sorry if I'm not so good at this help thing. xD
2011-01-21T11:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	from what I've observed on tty4, it actually tries to mount anything except for that one partition
2011-01-21T11:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	and no, /media/cdrom0 didn't work either :)
2011-01-21T11:32:00.000Z	Gnea	Spaztic_One	well, finding what else doesn't work helps determine what else might ;) later!
