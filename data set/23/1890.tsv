2009-11-20T00:06:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	cifs, nfs, ftp, sshfs, your choice
2009-11-20T01:16:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	[21:13:19] <guntbert> mataks: find / -name "yourfile" (for the whole filesystem) or find . -name "yourfile" for the current directory
2009-12-06T14:56:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	xev
2009-12-06T14:57:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	xev?
2009-12-06T14:57:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	xev, start it in a terminal
2010-01-15T21:37:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	clonezilla
2010-01-15T21:39:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	bs=4k  split the image into 4 GB chuncks?
2010-01-15T21:39:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	but on unix-filesystems, it's better to work file-wise than imaging whole disks/partitions imho
2010-01-15T21:39:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	blocksize
2010-01-15T21:40:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	if you have to split dd-images, pipe it through "split"
2011-02-16T18:18:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	add it to /etc/rc.local
2011-02-16T18:19:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	so if i add "/path/to/bin", will it run as su?
2011-02-16T18:19:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	yes
2011-02-16T18:20:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	will the script what for the binary to finish before continuing, or will it just "start it and leave it"? (or whatever its called)
2011-02-16T18:21:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	it just calls the script and continues.
2011-02-16T18:22:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	your script shouldn't be interactive...
2011-02-16T18:22:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	ok, thanks
2011-02-16T18:33:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	seems i need to put sudo (command)  for it to run as root in /etc/rc.local
2011-02-16T18:35:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	llutz	all i know is, i got noip2 configured for root only, and i ran "noip2", and it wouldnt run, then i changed to "sudo noip2" and it runs as expected :p
2012-03-23T14:18:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	grep -r thais /path/*
2012-03-23T14:20:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	grep -ri (man grep)
2012-03-23T14:23:00.000Z	llutz	Hans_Henrik	something like "grep -Eri '\bthais\b'  /path/*"  to make sure it finds only lines with "thais" as a word and not part of a longer word (if that matters)
