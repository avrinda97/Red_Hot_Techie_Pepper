2008-04-27T16:11:00.000Z	sixforty		Where can I find an i386 kernel and initrd for hardy?
2008-04-27T16:11:00.000Z	sixforty		(or i686)
2008-04-27T16:11:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	`apt-cache search linux-image-2.6.24-16-generic`
2008-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	asked and answered
2008-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	thx, but no soap with apt-cache
2008-04-27T16:30:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	"soap"?
2008-04-27T16:31:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	didn't work; no result
2008-04-27T16:32:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	`apt-cache show linux-image-386`
2008-04-27T16:35:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	I'm running an Xubuntu live CD. Ubuntu is mounted on /ubuntu.
2008-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	it's unclear what you're attempting to do and why
2008-04-27T16:38:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	I upgraded gutsy to hardy. It booted to memtest86. There's no kernel and no initrd.
2008-04-27T16:38:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	there's no kernel option in grub?
2008-04-27T16:39:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	No. I have the backup menu.lst I could alter, but there's no kernel or initrd I can find on the drive.
2008-04-27T16:41:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	none in /boot/ ?
2008-04-27T16:42:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	No. During upgrade there was a message like 'removing link vmlinuz - doesn't point to anything.'
2008-04-27T16:43:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	odd. `ln -s /boot/vmlinuz-* /vmlinuz` to restore the symlink?
2008-04-27T16:44:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	you'll need the `ln -s /boot/initrd.img-* /initrd.img` too?
2008-04-27T16:44:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	still wouldn't point anywhere.
2008-04-27T16:45:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	are you telling me you have no /boot/vmlinuz* and no /boot/initrd.img* ?
2008-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	right!
2008-04-27T16:47:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	sounds like your install is messed up.  larger problem.  mount+chroot+install_kernel sounds like the next repair step
2008-04-27T16:48:00.000Z	sixforty	tkooda	what's install_kernel involve?
2008-04-27T16:49:00.000Z	tkooda	sixforty	`apt-get install linux-image-386`
