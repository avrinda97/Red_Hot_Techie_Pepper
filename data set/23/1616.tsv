2010-01-01T22:59:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	you need this driver for your card 96.43.14 it is a legacy driver you can see if apt has it by doing aptitude search nvidia or get it from nvidias website
2010-01-01T22:59:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	thanks a lot man, i'll have a look
2010-01-01T23:00:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	your welcome
2010-01-01T23:10:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	ok I downloaded a .run file from the nvida site for my card. What do I do with this now though?
2010-01-01T23:11:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	you did not find it with aptitude?
2010-01-01T23:13:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	nope
2010-01-01T23:13:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	are you using gnome?
2010-01-01T23:17:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	ok read all this before doing anything. 1. press ctrl+alt=f1 2. run /etc/init.d/gdm stop 3. run sudo sh ./nameofdriver.run 4. answer the questions if you get a gcc version error just choose no. 5. after it is done reboot the computer
2010-01-01T23:20:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	what driver did yiou download from nvidia?
2010-01-01T23:22:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	http://www.nvidia.co.uk/page/geforce2mx.html
2010-01-01T23:25:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	ok just making sure you did not download the new driver
2010-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	this is the driver you want http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_96.43.14.html
2010-01-01T23:30:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	are you on the computer you are trying to install the driver to
2010-01-01T23:38:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	when it is done downloading you need to go into a tty but pressing the ctrl+alt+f1 keys this will bring you to the terminal tty1 then run this sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop then run the nvidia installer sudo sh ./name of driver.run when it is done reboot the computer
2010-01-01T23:49:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	still does not work?
2010-01-01T23:49:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	the driver installed fine, but now the screens all weird,
2010-01-01T23:52:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	maybe i need even older drivers? lol
2010-01-01T23:55:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	it should have worked try running this in a terminal and then reboot again or restart X    sudo nvidia-xconfig --force-generate
2010-01-01T23:56:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	sudo nvidia-xconfig --force-generate
2010-01-01T23:57:00.000Z	ntr_	ctmjr	ok i run that, and gonna login here whilst i reboot
2010-01-02T00:08:00.000Z	ctmjr	ntr_	your driver is corrupt for some reason can you paste your /var/Xorg.0.log
