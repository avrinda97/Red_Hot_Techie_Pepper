2010-07-27T02:55:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	can you be way more specific?
2010-07-27T02:55:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	just tell us the problem first
2010-07-27T02:57:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	unallocated simply means that you havent formatted or partitioned it yet. is that what you mean?
2010-07-27T02:59:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	what are you trying to do, is there an error you are trying to fix? or are you trying to use all of your hard drive?
2010-07-27T03:00:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	you would like to fix what?
2010-07-27T03:01:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	what is sayig that the drive is unallocated? ubuntu, windows?
2010-07-27T03:02:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	thank you. ok. how much is unallocated?>
2010-07-27T03:02:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	do you have a second disk? a storage disk?
2010-07-27T03:03:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	do you have 2 hard drives?
2010-07-27T03:04:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	so the pendrive is unallocated?
2010-07-27T03:04:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	so do you have ubuntu installed to the hard drive?
2010-07-27T03:06:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	do you want to install ubuntu permanently, or did you just want to format that drive? or did you want to fix a windows problem?
2010-07-27T03:09:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	this is the ubuntu server
2010-07-27T03:10:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	maybe it can. you get blue screen of death, hmm. have the original windows cd? or a backup on your hard disks?
2010-07-27T03:11:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	actually thats not that hard. first you need to install windows, then if the other od is ubuntu, it can do that for you automatically, making 2 partitions.
2010-07-27T03:12:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	this is a very nice guide on how to do that: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
2010-07-27T03:19:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	this guide might help you, it's a step by step... http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/483/xp_repair_fix_master_boot_record_recovery_console/
2010-07-27T03:20:00.000Z	uhantu	hylian	i've already done that
2010-07-27T03:24:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	so does windows boot now? im guessing not, hmm, so does it try to boot and then bsod?
2010-07-27T03:26:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	one thing you can try is to go through the motions of re-installing windows, when it gets to the partitions screen, choose the one windows is already in, then it will ask if you want to try and repair that version. it will go through the motions like it's installing it for the first time. this is at best a desperate act, but can repair a damaged file, sometimes saving the machine from having to be formatted and reinstalled, or are you tryi
2010-07-27T03:29:00.000Z	hylian	uhantu	i hope this helps, i dont think i was much help
