2008-05-09T12:34:00.000Z	Ollie		I'm trying to compile VirtualBox, but I'm missing "asound", or it can't find it... any suggestions? I've already downloaded libasound-dev
2008-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	Ollie		cos that version is old, and doesn't work
2008-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	Ollie		it's missing some kernel thing, so it won't actually let me start the VM
2008-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	Ollie		8.04
2008-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	Ollie		yes
2008-05-09T12:36:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	It works fine, there was an update today that fixed the kernel inconsistencies that broke it before.
2008-05-09T12:37:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	You had issues with vboxdrv before? It is fixed today.
2008-05-09T12:38:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	yes... it's fixed... try again.
2008-05-09T12:38:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade ... then log out and back in, and try virtualbox again
2008-05-09T12:38:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	(loading the vm...)
2008-05-09T12:39:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	do what I told you please.
2008-05-09T12:39:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	also ensure you're in the vboxdrv group
2008-05-09T12:53:00.000Z	Ollie	fde	are you still here?
2008-05-09T12:53:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	yup
2008-05-09T12:55:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade ... when that is done, add yourself to the vboxdrv group (just sudo gedit /etc/group and add your name to the end of that line) ... then log out and back in, and virtualbox should be working.
2008-05-09T12:56:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	yes... but after the bulk of what I said... I forgot that you needed to at first.
2008-05-09T12:59:00.000Z	Ollie	fde	thanks, it was the group that was causing the problem.
2008-05-09T13:00:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	glad the problem is fixed... if you'd said you wanted to run OpenSolaris or something, you wouldn't have gotten the types of responses you did, 1.6.0 basically seems to be a fix for Sun based software.
2008-05-09T13:01:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	as you may know, VirtualBox recently got acquired by Sun, but their software barely worked on Solaris... there is no other reason for 1.6.0 currently  :)
2008-05-09T13:01:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	Should do, yes.
2008-05-09T13:01:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	You might have issues getting any sort of effects though.

2008-05-09T13:08:00.000Z	fde	Ollie	hah... then there is your answer I suppose...
