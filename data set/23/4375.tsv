2007-08-31T13:42:00.000Z	shade_micro5		linux is so gay >.<
2007-08-31T13:42:00.000Z	shade_micro5		can't believe it
2007-08-31T13:43:00.000Z	shade_micro5		i heard it's quite good actually
2007-08-31T13:43:00.000Z	shade_micro5		apparently windows > linux :))
2007-08-31T13:43:00.000Z	shade_micro5		what do u mean by attitudes
2007-08-31T13:43:00.000Z	shade_micro5		?
2007-08-31T13:44:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	impersonating a software operating system specifies some mental instability
2007-08-31T13:48:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	do you have a wireless lan or wireful ?:)
2007-08-31T13:48:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	router or usb modem?
2007-08-31T13:49:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	router or usb modem?
2007-08-31T13:50:00.000Z	shade_micro5	savvas	usb modem
2007-08-31T13:50:00.000Z	shade_micro5	savvas	but i can connect it to my comp. using eth
2007-08-31T13:51:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	I'm not sure then, I use a router, which is quite easier :)
2007-08-31T13:52:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	because probably it needs better drivers, and its creators only have closed source? I'm just guessing here, you have to google it yourself to find any working drivers for your modem
2007-08-31T14:00:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	you just need a router, a $20-$50 hardware. no one forces you to use crappy linux :) everything can be connected if you pay up or if you read enough to understand it. rome wasn't built in a day, and no one is born with computer knowledge, you just have to read, search and ask in several forums or irc channels
2007-08-31T14:11:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	probably because they don't know linux and hate to read :)
2007-08-31T14:12:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	you would configure a router by now and would have internet
2007-08-31T14:13:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	where do you live?
2007-08-31T14:15:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	ask again for routers, they shouldn't be that expensive. and tell them a router/dsl modem, NOT wireless
2007-08-31T14:15:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	a router/dsl modem, not a usb dsl modem :)
2007-08-31T14:17:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	my isp gave me for 60 romanian leu a router
2007-08-31T14:19:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	then i'd suggest on killing dsl line and saving some money :)
2007-08-31T14:27:00.000Z	savvas	shade_micro5	never hurts to try :p
