2009-12-10T06:09:00.000Z	tzanger		this is a box that was 9.04 -> 9.10 dist-upgraded
2009-12-10T06:09:00.000Z	tzanger		it does work fine except for this recent thing
2009-12-10T06:09:00.000Z	tzanger		(the upgrade was last month I think)
2009-12-10T06:11:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	is that how you can upgrade just one package?
2009-12-27T05:24:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	what software did you use to install it?  have you tried synaptic?
2009-12-27T05:35:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	just using apt-get at the moment
2009-12-27T05:36:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	synaptic can't find it either
2009-12-27T05:36:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	not synaptic, sorry, aptitude
2009-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	synaptic doesn't see libgtk1.2-dev either
2009-12-27T05:42:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	enable back ports
2009-12-27T05:42:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	backports? ok
2009-12-27T05:43:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	so just add "backports" to the deb line that I have universe multiverse etc on?
2009-12-27T05:43:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	and then search for it using synaptic, i can't find it either on my machine, im using karmic, if it's an old library then hopefully it's included in backports
2009-12-27T05:43:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	add back ports to your config then do an update
2009-12-27T05:44:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	I understand what you're saying, but how does one add backports? there isn't a checkbox in synaptic
2009-12-27T05:44:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	software sources
2009-12-27T05:45:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	yes, again I undestand that but what do I add? synaptic does not have a checkbox for backports
2009-12-27T05:45:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	I think I found it
2009-12-27T05:45:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	the problem is your machine does not know where to get the software from, it doesnt not know the source
2009-12-27T05:47:00.000Z	tzanger	mMezquitale	damn, not there
2009-12-27T05:47:00.000Z	mMezquitale	tzanger	looks like youre  outta luck, it doesnt exist for karmic
