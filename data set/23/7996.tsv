2005-09-27T05:24:00.000Z	delire	Octane	if you have manually removed them they won't be upgraded or installed. when you say 'manually' do you mean apt-get remove or dpkg -P or using synaptic?
2005-09-27T05:25:00.000Z	Octane	delire	i did aptitude remove kopete, but now whenever i do a dist-upgrade it wants to install it again (Along with metapackage kubutnu-desktop)
2005-09-27T05:25:00.000Z	delire	Octane	ahah, do this 'dpkg -l | grep kopete'
2005-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	delire	Octane	see anything there?
2005-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	Octane	delire	rc  kopete                                          3.4.2-0ubuntu3                       instant messenger for KDE
2005-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	delire	Octane	hmm, see it wasnt removed. this time do this. 'sudo dpkg -P kopete'
2005-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	Octane	delire	i dont get why an aptitude remove didnt remove it
2005-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	delire	Octane	the -P flag means 'Purge' eg total cleanse.
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	delire	Octane	yes, that does seem strange. regardless, apt and aptitude are advanced, network friendly frontends to dpkg, the real package manager in debian systems.
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	Octane	delire	look! it's still there when i try to do a dist-upgrade: The following NEW packages will be installed: adept debtags kdebluetooth kdenetwork kopete kubuntu-desktop lib32gcj6...
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	Octane	delire	im not TOO much of a newbie :)
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	delire	Octane	something else is relying on kopete.
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	Octane	delire	only thing that's relying on kopete are metapackages kubuntu-desktop
2005-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	delire	Octane	kopete is a dependency of another package.. i would say it's kubuntu-desktop
2005-09-27T05:29:00.000Z	delire	Octane	are you using KDE?
2005-09-27T05:29:00.000Z	Octane	delire	kubuntu-desktop and kdenetwork are both metapackages
2005-09-27T05:29:00.000Z	delire	Octane	well dependencies are dependencies.. not much you can do about that without getting into some less useful territory.
2005-09-27T05:31:00.000Z	delire	Octane	personally i don't dist-upgrade, but i wouldn't advise Ubuntu users to do the same.
2005-09-27T05:32:00.000Z	delire	Octane	i use debian primarily, it's a habit i picked up..
2005-09-27T05:36:00.000Z	delire	Octane	AFAIK he wants to do this to his entire partition.
2005-09-27T05:36:00.000Z	delire	Octane	precis
