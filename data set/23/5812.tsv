2006-08-29T13:24:00.000Z	dmsantam	archaios	you loudly professed to be a professional kernel developer for windows and linux for fortune 500 companies. i think you should reconsider whether you've said something stupid. just a suggestion :)
2006-08-29T13:25:00.000Z	archaios	dmsantam	pardon? that's true, and you can speak to my clients if you wish :)

2006-08-29T13:25:00.000Z	dmsantam	archaios	what is your webpage?
2006-08-29T13:25:00.000Z	archaios	dmsantam	website? haha. I don't even have one... I don't need to advertise to reach business contacts, dmsantam, because I've been in the business for nigh on 15 years
2006-08-29T13:27:00.000Z	dmsantam	archaios	who is your biggest client?
2006-08-29T13:28:00.000Z	archaios	dmsantam	as of now, I'm doing a large amount of work for several start-ups. there is a rapidly diminishing market among larger corporations due to outsourcing, but I'm still in the business.

2006-08-29T13:29:00.000Z	archaios	dmsantam	I did contractual work for IBM Global Services Australia primarily for z/OS, on loan to a major telecommunications company
2006-08-29T13:30:00.000Z	archaios	dmsantam	if you wish to challenge my credentials, feel free to do it in private... it's clearly off-topic
