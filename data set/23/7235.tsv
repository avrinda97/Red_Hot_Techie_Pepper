2005-10-03T16:27:00.000Z	evian		how do I edit my "Places" menu at the top of the screen? I want to add a folder.
2005-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	evian		I've been trying to get skype to work in ubuntu for days. I've read a bunch of things on it, but nothing seems to work.
2005-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	tylo	evian	What's the problem?
2005-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	evian	tylo	no sound
2005-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	evian	tylo	I try echo123 test and hear nothing
2005-10-03T05:33:00.000Z	tylo	evian	I see. Do you have a music player running or open at the same time?
2005-10-03T05:33:00.000Z	evian	tylo	no
2005-10-03T05:33:00.000Z	tylo	evian	Hm. I see. Have you dealt with things such as ALSA and ESD yet?
2005-10-03T05:34:00.000Z	evian	tylo	I tried the stuff in the ubuntuguide, but it didn't seem to work, then Seveas told me not to use the ubuntuguide so I undid it.
2005-10-03T05:34:00.000Z	evian	tylo	I didn't know what I was doing, I just followed the instructions
2005-10-03T05:34:00.000Z	tylo	evian	There is a howto that worked for me. However, I believe sound may have been working for me out of the box.
2005-10-03T05:34:00.000Z	evian	tylo	I tried killing off esd
2005-10-03T05:35:00.000Z	evian	tylo	sound seems to work in other apps ok for me
2005-10-03T05:35:00.000Z	evian	tylo	was the howto on the wiki or somewhere else?
2005-10-03T05:36:00.000Z	tylo	evian	Try this guide http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=32063&pp=10&highlight=Failed+construct+test+pipeline
2005-10-03T05:37:00.000Z	evian	tylo	if I can't get it working in the next couple hours, I will have to do something drastic. Like boot into windows :)
2005-10-03T05:42:00.000Z	evian	tylo	yeah that guide is interesting, it is similar to the ubuntuguide suggestions but takes it a step or two further. I know it can work because skype used to work under Mandrake for me (which I removed)
2005-10-03T05:43:00.000Z	tylo	evian	Sweet. I went through a small bout with tryig to get Skype sound to work simultaneously with a music player. So I know of just about every guide out there. I ended up buying a sound card in the end since onboard sound doesn't support it.
2005-10-03T06:10:00.000Z	evian	tylo	hi again, I rebooted. now I can't play any sounds.
2005-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	evian	tylo	but I wonder, I don't see anything in the ps aux, when I grep for esd or alsa, I'm wondering shouldn't I have something like that running as a sound demon?
2005-10-03T06:13:00.000Z	tylo	evian	I think it is your asound.cond that is causing it.
2005-10-03T06:14:00.000Z	tylo	evian	Right, me too.
2005-10-03T06:47:00.000Z	evian	tylo	and crimsun: I went into the volume control and unmuted the microphone, now I can hear everything I speak echoed to me (with no app like skype even running.) And I can hear beeps in the terminal.
