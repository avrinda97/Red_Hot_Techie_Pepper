2006-04-09T09:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	your user is bliss1_  or biss1?
2006-04-09T09:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	then edit the command to be correct username :)
2006-04-09T09:29:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	yep my head to mch
2006-04-15T14:19:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	hi
2006-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	: enjoy
2006-04-16T08:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	can you paste your sources.list to pastebin?
2006-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	yes thanks
2006-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	the question is can you have http://ftp is this a incorrect format
2006-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	it all depends on what the ftp is pointing to I guess...most of the time if they arent ubuntu repos it's a bad idea
2006-04-16T08:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	you can use other repos but you may end up with a broken system and then you will be an unhappy ubuntu user who is gonna blame us and then I'll be forced to say I TOLD YOU SO!" :P
2006-04-16T08:28:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	ubuntu is just fine its another debian install on the same box
2006-04-16T08:31:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	try asking in that distro support channel if they have one about theyre repos
2006-04-16T08:31:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	god your so helpful, but also correct
2006-04-16T08:31:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	I became this way after I started using ubuntu and got some awsome support from it's users :)
2006-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	 well done and please to give back and enjoy your awsome time here as you seem to give grade A support
2006-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	bliss1_	I try but thank you
2006-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	bliss1_	IdleOne	In etc/hostnme is just the name of your machine that goes in there or is it a FQDN
