2010-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	DCGstudios		morning everyone, working on a bash script that manages media files which are all the exact same name with random endings.
2010-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	DCGstudios		Is there a way to determine filetpyes within CLI
2010-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 the 'file' command
2010-10-20T22:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 there are 'edit as root..' extensions you can add to the file manager.
2010-10-20T22:29:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	i really just want it so when i click my gedit icon, it doesnt run as 1000:1000 and limits my permissions..
2010-10-20T22:29:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	is it possible to do it via the shortcut
2010-10-20T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 err.. why do you want to do such an insecure thing? really how often are you ediing config files
2010-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 make  a launcher run 'gksudo gedit'
2010-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	hundreds of times a day, im CEH and CPT certified, security isnt my issue
2010-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 security is always an issue....
2010-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	lol
2010-10-20T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 i have to wonder what you are doing that you are editing 100;s of config files a day. :)
2010-10-20T22:31:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	scripting  =\
2010-10-20T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 the 'edit as root...' add on for nautuls is a safer idea. and thers a Compiz Extension that adds [ROOT] to the title of any window/app thats running as root...
2010-10-20T22:32:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	yea i think gksudo will work for this partition, just too used to backtrack and the convenience of always being root
2010-10-20T22:32:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	thnx for the help
2010-10-20T22:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 sounds like another reason to not use backtrack. :)
2010-10-20T22:33:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	heh, its as secure as your make it.
2010-10-20T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 I think you just contridicted yourself...  but whatever. :) every 'bt' user i see in here asking qwuestions normally seem to be the type of person that shouldent be usign BT.
2010-10-20T22:34:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	lol well its not like theres much choice for security experts
2010-10-20T22:34:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	considering the difference in python, a large amount of the programs are not compatable on the newer ubuntu distros
2010-10-20T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	DCGstudios	 Hmm...  security experts always running as root... seems.. an odd  thing. :)
2010-10-20T22:35:00.000Z	DCGstudios	Dr_Willis_	besides the fact that the root account having a password (hopefully a secure one) there really isnt much a security risk for most tasks.
