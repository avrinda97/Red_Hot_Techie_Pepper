2008-10-02T10:35:00.000Z	Anon9050		tritium what is the risk !!
2008-10-02T10:36:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	overwriting files under package-management is one.  That's the purpose of providing the /usr/local/ directory structure.
2008-10-02T10:45:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	did you configure the system sound to be that file?
2008-10-02T10:46:00.000Z	Anon9050	tritium	 Thank you very much.  I learned something new.  Thats always worth it for me.
2008-10-02T10:47:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	no problem :)
2008-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	Anon9050	tritium	 want to try a stab at my problem?  How do you rename the /home/username  directory
2008-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	if you do that, you'll have to chown all the files below it, and edit /etc/passwd to reflect the change in the user's $HOME
2008-10-02T10:53:00.000Z	Anon9050	tritium	 cd /home/username chown chgrp *
2008-10-02T10:58:00.000Z	Anon9050	tritium	 I took a look at tree and all the files have the new user name EXCEPT THE HOME DIRECTORY FILE !
2008-10-02T10:59:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	so you're going to rename the directory next?
2008-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	yes, you'd not want to run that command as that same user
2008-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	root, or using sudo as one of those two users?
2008-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	no need for all-caps.  You've enabled the root account?
2008-10-02T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	sorry, I don't recall
2008-10-02T11:20:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	~/.gnome2/ is also your own private settings in your home directory.
2008-10-02T11:21:00.000Z	tritium	Anon9050	~/ is your $HOME
2008-10-02T12:09:00.000Z	Anon9050	tritium	you still with it ?
