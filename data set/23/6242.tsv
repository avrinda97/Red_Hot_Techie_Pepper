2006-06-01T11:33:00.000Z	spikeh		good evening; Xserver is giving me an error because my graphics card is not supported
2006-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	spikeh		ATI X850
2006-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	spikeh		but this time, it doesn't
2006-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	spikeh		so I am not sure how I can configure my network adapter and download the ati xorgconf
2006-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	spikeh		ATI X850
2006-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	spikeh		I have answered the question :)
2006-06-01T11:36:00.000Z	spikeh		can someone please tell me how to get terminal up after xserver crashes
2006-06-01T11:38:00.000Z	spikeh		thank you; can someone please tell me how to configure a network in terminal? (setting the IP address, default gateway, subnet mask, and DNS server)
2006-06-01T11:39:00.000Z	spikeh		will a network adapter auto configure itself if DHCP is turned on?
2006-06-01T11:39:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	should
2006-06-01T11:40:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	how would I configure it manually? setting the IP, default gateway, subnet, and DNS server
2006-06-01T11:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	is it wlan0 or eth0
2006-06-01T11:40:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	eth0
2006-06-01T11:41:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	are you wired or wireless
2006-06-01T11:41:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	wired
2006-06-01T11:41:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	but DHCP is turned up
2006-06-01T11:41:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	it is a wireless router but my PC is connected via wire to it
2006-06-01T11:42:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	let me look up a command really quick
2006-06-01T11:46:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	try "ifconfig eth0 down" then "ifconfig eth0 up"  to see if itll wake up
2006-06-01T11:46:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	not sure if this command would work too "ifconfig eth0 -dynamic"  as in dynamic ip but its worth a try
2006-06-01T11:47:00.000Z	spikeh	SurfnKid	last time, there was a command to edit a file where I put in the DNS servers
2006-06-01T11:47:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	right, that one i dont know where it is
2006-06-01T11:49:00.000Z	SurfnKid	spikeh	maybe the configuration editor will point you to that, Im looking to see if the ethernet settings are there
