2006-11-20T11:28:00.000Z	ubd		thank you for your brilliant idea kmaynard. you may reinstall your windows
2006-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	what's with your attitude?
2006-11-20T11:30:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	why?
2006-11-20T11:33:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	what was your question, given i only joined while the discussion was already in progress?
2006-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	did you verify the CD?
2006-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	then it might be that your HD is broken, no?
2006-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	how do you know it's not broken?
2006-11-20T11:35:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	doesn't mean a thing. do you have SMART enabled in the BIOS?
2006-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	then boot from the Live CD, but don't start the installer - install the "smartmontools" package instead, and then run "sudo smartctl -A /dev/hda", assuming hda is your drive
2006-11-20T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	SMART in the BIOS doesn't report all possible problems.
2006-11-20T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	and you don't have any suspect (i.e. lower than 255, or than 100) values for things like Reallocated Sectors Count, or similar?
2006-11-20T11:39:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	did you select quick or full format in the CD installer (assuming there's such an option, i don't quite remember)?
2006-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	i'd try formatting manually using mkfs -c -v and seeing if it reports any problem
2006-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	with the -c option?
2006-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	-c checks for bad blocks. vanilla mkfs doesn't check of anything
2008-11-15T20:00:00.000Z	LjL	ubd	sure, add the "keyboard indicator" applet to your panel
