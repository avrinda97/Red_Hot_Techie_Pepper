2012-09-28T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	just ask the question
2012-09-28T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	open the package manager, search for sysstat package, click install
2012-09-28T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	you need to be precise with the error
2012-09-28T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	that is nothing to do with support
2012-09-28T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	post your error in a pastebin so we can resolve your issue
2012-09-28T11:24:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	got that error pastebin yet ?
2012-09-28T11:24:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	please type "sudo apt-get install sysstat" and pastebin the output if it's an error
2012-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	that's not what I asked
2012-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	I asked you to do "sudo apt-get install sysstat" and give me the output
2012-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	no, you've done something different, you've removed and done a force ??? that's not what I asked
2012-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	I can't be bothered to help you any more, if you don't give me the info I asked for and give me info you think I want
2012-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	no, you're not
2012-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	I asked for the output of "sudo apt-get install sysstat" - you have done a remove and a force, not what I asked.
2012-09-28T11:30:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	someone else I'm sure will help you
2012-09-28T11:33:00.000Z	adas	ikonia	did you get that?
2012-09-28T11:33:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	I told you, I'm not interested, someone else will help you
2012-09-28T11:33:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	that language is unacceptable
2012-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	I asked you for information, you did something else, you wasted my time so I don't want to progress it, I'm sure someone else will
2012-09-28T11:36:00.000Z	adas	ikonia	why are you so rude?
2012-09-28T11:37:00.000Z	ikonia	adas	please stop talking to me.
