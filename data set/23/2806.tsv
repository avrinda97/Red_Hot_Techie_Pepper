2008-12-14T01:46:00.000Z	dan__		zsquareplus, i have tried to just assign it an ip that i know it is not using, and i still could not ping even my gateway
2008-12-14T01:46:00.000Z	dan__		zsquareplus, rather an ip that is not in use.
2008-12-14T01:47:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	it sounds like a low level hardware problem. if you run sudo mii-diag. is it reporting errors, it the cable type correct?
2008-12-14T01:52:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	O wow i didnt know that!
2008-12-14T01:52:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	you ran that with root rights? i.e. "sudo mii-diag"?
2008-12-14T01:52:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	correct
2008-12-14T01:53:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	it is an onboard nic
2008-12-14T01:56:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	i just tried again - and i get the same thing " SIOCGMIIPHY on eth0 failed: Operation not supported"
2008-12-14T02:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	yea, i got that too without sudo. but maybe your network card is not supporting this operation. the tool would have helped to determine if the cable type and speed is correctly negotiated between pc and router/switch.
2008-12-14T02:01:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	yea, why not.  "sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.123" for example. with an IP from the private range you use
2008-12-14T02:02:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	so now it tells me that my inet has the ip specified, but i can still not acess the internet
2008-12-14T02:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	does the LED on the router blink if you do a ping of some IP?
2008-12-14T02:04:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	yes but i keep getting that the Destination Host is Unreachable
2008-12-14T02:07:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	sorry i just realized i didnt make sense there.  I have used this cable and port on the router on a different pc with no problem.   I have also used this computer with a winxp where it worked without connection issues
2008-12-14T02:13:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	hm.. well. if the LED on the router and PC is blinking on network traffic it would be a sing that the hardware has a connection. i've seen cases where auto negotiation failed so that router and network card could not communicate
2008-12-14T02:14:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	is there any place i can read up on work arounds for that?
2008-12-14T02:16:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	right now i have version 8.04 installed.  Would it help to move ti 8.10.
2008-12-14T02:18:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	i have the 8.10 release on cd already - i will go ahead and boot up in live first to try it out
2008-12-14T02:30:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	8.10 seems to be much the same as 8.04, if i try to force a static - it will connect but i dont seem to be able to even ping my gateway
2008-12-14T02:36:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	any last help you can give?  About to give up for today.
2008-12-14T02:38:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dan__	not really.. did you search google? maybe with the PCI-id (lspci gives you that one) of the card and linux or ubuntu as keywords?
2008-12-14T02:39:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	yeah i have been doing that without much luck which is why i was going to try here.  I might just pull a nic out of a separate computer to try
2008-12-14T02:40:00.000Z	dan__	zsquareplusc	thanks a lot for your help - ill have to tackle this agian tomorrow.  Have a good one.
