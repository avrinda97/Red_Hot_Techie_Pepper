2008-07-22T19:55:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	I've already asked, mate, that was just an expletive of sorts.  I asked where I could find an ext3-specific channel/forum since this is complicated.
2008-07-22T19:57:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	didn't see it, so it needs to be re-iterated every so often.
2008-07-22T19:58:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	well, the LKML would probably be a good place to look
2008-07-22T19:58:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	well, here's what I said earlier then, I guess since there's new blood it can't hurt to say it once more: histo: The first several gigabytes of my partition got overwritten by an errant program.  I've found alternative superblocks via `testdisk`'s "find alternative superblocks" function, but e2fsck complains that the magic number is wrong.  Even just to find documentation on ext2/3 would be better than nothing. :/  I _think_ that the m
2008-07-22T19:58:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Ah, okay, thanks.
2008-07-22T19:58:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	I wasn't sure if there was a separate place for ext3 (doesn't appear to be)
2008-07-22T19:59:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	so basically, something overwrote part of your partition and you're not sure if they're random writes or all in a row?
2008-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Ah, no, something overwrote part of the partition and I'm trying to recover the filesystem structure and the files thereof.
2008-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	oh! have you tried foremost?
2008-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Oooh . . . Foremost?  I'm not familiar.  I'll look into it.
2008-07-22T20:25:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Ah, crap, foremost is basically the same as photorec.  I actually found a reference to that the other day.  I already ran photorec and it did what it could, but it can only recover contiguous files and even in that case you lose the metadata. :(  Thanks, though!
2008-07-22T20:26:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Sorry.
2008-07-22T20:26:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	foremost isn't the same as photorec.
2008-07-22T20:27:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	quote from the internets: "Foremost (foremost.sourceforge.net) might help  too; it ignores the file system structure and just looks for beginning and endings  of files.  So it needs distinctive files (e.g. jpeg) and contiguous files. "
2008-07-22T20:27:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Maybe not the same, but to me it looks like the same idea with the same advantages and limitations
2008-07-22T20:27:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	so you haven't actually used it yet?
2008-07-22T20:28:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	Haven't used foremost?  No.  I've used photorec, but either way that's not what I'm interested in: I'm interested in using the filesystem structure data that I've already verified is on the disk.
2008-07-22T20:28:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	well, when you get some results (or no results), come talk to me.
2008-07-22T20:29:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	The thing is that if foremost requires contiguous files, it's not going to find anything that photorec hasn't already found.  I've already recovered what that class of utility can
2008-07-22T20:29:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	the point is that you haven't actually used it yet, and so you're just wasting time now.
2008-07-22T20:30:00.000Z	geppy	Gnea	I don't see how that's a logical conclusion.  According to the foremost project page, "  Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data  structures".  That isn't the class of utility that I'm looking for.
2008-07-22T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea	geppy	because you're basing an assumption, thus extrapolating the concept of 'assuming' to a whole new level, on what a website tells you, rather than making another attempt at obtaining the data that you require, over an unsaid fear or something.  You asked for help, I offered, now you're telling me that my help is no good.  Please, go elsewhere if you're looking for trouble.
