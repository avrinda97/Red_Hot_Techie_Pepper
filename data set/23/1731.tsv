2009-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	You can either use a windows install CD and "fixmbr" or if you don't have a widnows install CD you can use a tool called super grub disk
2009-11-11T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	Did you see my comment?
2009-11-11T11:25:00.000Z	Guest93280	Jordan_U	would I
2009-11-11T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	No
2009-11-11T11:26:00.000Z	Guest93280	Jordan_U	how would I do it?
2009-11-11T11:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	Do you have a windows install CD?
2009-11-11T11:26:00.000Z	Guest93280	Jordan_U	yes
2009-11-11T11:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	You need to get to the recovery shell and run "fixmbr". I haven't done it myself, you should try asking in ##windows and they can probably give better directions
2009-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	That won't get windoes booting again
2009-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	I can help you try to get grub working properly, and if noone in ##windows can help I can try to walk you through restoring the windows boot loader.
2009-11-11T11:30:00.000Z	Guest93280	Jordan_U	how would I get grub to work properly
2009-11-11T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	Boot from the LiveCD and try installing grub legacy, if you are willing to spend more time I can also try to figure out why grub2 isn't working, but installing grub legacy is fast and will likely get things working
2009-11-11T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Guest93280	If you aren't booted into a LiveCD now boot into one and join this channel from there
