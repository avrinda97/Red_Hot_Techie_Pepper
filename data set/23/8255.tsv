2004-11-06T12:58:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	it's in universe, yes
2004-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	darian2k	bob2	now im hot like chilli of ubuntu
2004-11-06T12:59:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	no, it's not like knoppix
2004-11-06T13:00:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	xfce4 is in ubuntu, yes
2004-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	darian2k	bob2	i have think that only gnome28 in ubuntu
2004-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	by default it usesd gnome, but you can install xfce4 if you want
2004-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	darian2k	bob2	n1ce
2004-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	ubuntu includes a full set of common server apps on the cd
2004-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	darian2k	bob2	 what is with usb devices - run that like red hat's core3 or core2
2004-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	right
2004-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	gnome-volume-manager does that
2004-11-06T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	I think it's a very big step towards a debian I could give my family to use
2004-11-06T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	you probablyl can, but you'd have to do some manual fiddling
2004-11-06T13:14:00.000Z	darian2k	bob2	thx
2004-11-06T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	darian2k	if you manually mount the drive, you should be able to install it
