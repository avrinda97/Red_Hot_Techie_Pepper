2005-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	ubuntu = debian with 'newer' desktop packages and a few things to make it easier, like sudo :)
2005-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	debian has sudo :P
2005-08-02T12:27:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	should be gdm in a default install
2005-08-02T12:27:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	sorry ...debian here
2005-08-02T12:28:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	i'm a bit sad with debian testing
2005-08-02T12:28:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	did they push the gcc4 changes into testing?
2005-08-02T12:28:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	and i'm considering a switch just because that, BUT, i'm afraid of losing all the customizability i have in debian by a bunch of scripts/wizards
2005-08-02T12:29:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	hell no, they're trying it in 'unstable' ...a whole breakage hell
2005-08-02T12:30:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	I knew they went crazy with sid finally, but I've been tracking sarge for most things for the last couple months before it went stable, so I've missed the fun :)
2005-08-02T12:30:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	sarge is very good for now, just a bit outdated as always
2005-08-02T12:30:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	unstable was very stable but then they started the abi change and bam, everything is breaking :)
2005-08-02T12:30:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	plus x.org being added ...iirc from a backported ubuntu package
2005-08-02T12:31:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	Sid 'was' pretty good, I was using it for the desktop until I went over here :D  Nice to see them back at work though
2005-08-02T12:31:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	if you got any debian migration questions, feel free to hit me up. There's a slight but non-zero chance I'll know :)
2005-08-02T12:34:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	i just wanna be able to do things the way i do in debian...i'm trying gentoo in a VMWare virtual box and it's very up-to-date but it isn't very concise and it's _strange_ ...specially when you're accustomed to doing things the debian way for years
2005-08-02T12:34:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	yeah, I like the 'debian' way....it's way easier, especially when you finally learn it :)
2005-08-02T12:35:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	i could easily use gentoo, but i don't know the way of doing things in that 'gentoo way'
2005-08-02T12:35:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	i couldn't handle it very well, i tried doing things manually and my changes got overriden by portage updates and things :'(
2005-08-02T12:35:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	ubuntu is totally debian underneath the desktop
2005-08-02T12:36:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	example, for adding a thing to your runlevel you use something like rc-update add <program> default..shitty
2005-08-02T12:36:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	i prefer the rcX.d and init.d approach....MUCH better
2005-08-02T12:36:00.000Z	cadu	hondje	in debian i just create a new program in init.d and link it using the [SK] nnPROGRAM link way...easy!
2005-08-02T12:37:00.000Z	hondje	cadu	using update-rc.d is even easier, saves a lot of typing :)
