2011-04-09T02:45:00.000Z	urgodfather		sorry for double post
2011-04-09T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	done
2012-01-07T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	run:  lspci    I assume its a pci device, use the line identifying the device to find guides
2012-01-07T10:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	ok, nice and generic
2012-01-07T10:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	you will find lots of guides for it
2012-01-07T10:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	search for:  Bt878 Video Capture ubuntu
2012-01-07T10:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	its not needed if you are using grub
2012-01-07T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	then add them in /etc/fstab
2012-01-07T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	I suggest you search for examples online, its well documented
2012-01-07T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	you'll need:  gksudo gedit /etc/fstab     too, it is owned by root
2012-01-07T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	the folder you mount to must exist and is an empty folder
2012-01-07T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	yes, folder. Like a windows folder, you mount partitions to folders
2012-01-07T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	the folder will then be the access point to the data on the partition, linux doesn't use restrictuive drive letters, it has a file structure and you simply attach data storages where you want
2012-01-07T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	its a lot more flexible
2012-01-07T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	/media/media is simply a folder created by udev, the partition is then mounted there so that when you access that folder you will be shown the contents of the partition you mounted
2012-01-07T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	if you have existing partitions, if you use the custom partitioning, you can specify the partition to be mounted and put in fstab during install (if memory serves)
2012-01-07T11:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	use UUIDs and you'll have fewer issues
2012-01-07T11:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	run:  sudo blkid     then look at your fstab file, you'll see what I mean ;)
2012-01-07T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	urgodfather	looks like a good how to, use UUIDs instead of raw device names.
2012-03-10T03:13:00.000Z	urgodfather	ActionParsnip	care to help me figure out how to install the proper gfx driver?
2012-03-10T03:13:00.000Z	urgodfather	ActionParsnip	VGA compatible controller: XGI Technology Inc. (eXtreme Graphics Innovation) Z7/Z9 (XG20 core)
