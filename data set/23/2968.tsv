2008-09-11T21:55:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	type /join #ubuntu-offtopic and ask your question there
2008-09-11T22:10:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	perhaps with wine
2008-09-11T22:10:00.000Z	nicoleamy	soundray	right ok, can you tell me the commands that i have to type to get this tomtom home onto the ubuntu desktop?
2008-09-11T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	it's not as straightforward as telling you a few commands. You will have to familiarize yourself with wine a bit
2008-09-11T22:13:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	when you've read the help page that ubottu gave you, insert the Tomtom Home CD, find the installer program and run it with wine.
2008-09-11T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	and Mac OS
2008-09-11T22:23:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	is your kernel current? What does 'uname -r' give you?
2008-09-11T22:23:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	open a terminal and run    uname -r
2008-09-11T22:34:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	please make at least an effort to understand what's being said on that page.
2008-09-11T22:44:00.000Z	nicoleamy	soundray	i need help
2008-09-11T22:45:00.000Z	nicoleamy	soundray	when i'm trying to shut down the pc, it gives me bunch of errors?
2008-09-11T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	Gnea gave you a link to a page. You must make an effort to understand and use the information there.
2008-09-11T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	nicoleamy	I'm having dinner now, I may be back later, then I'll check how you got on.
