2012-10-02T23:25:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	are you shooting in Raw?
2012-10-02T23:25:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	what is Raw?
2012-10-02T23:26:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	its on the camera if the images are stored in RAW format you need to find support for the file
2012-10-02T23:27:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	oddly enough so do mine on my Canon T4i but I shoot in RAW so I end up having to use my mac with lightroom and an extension
2012-10-02T23:28:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	this is bizarre. i just tried to open a photo to give you the error number and now they all open and i can switch images no problem. haha. its weird. how come??? how come it works now? and how can i count on it working the ext time
2012-10-02T23:40:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	it doesnt give me an error number, it only says somethig like this: "No images found in 'gphoto2://[usb:001,025]/DCIM/100CANON/IMG_0017.JPG'.", and this is while the picture is displayed as a thumbnail
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	Does your computer have a card reader?
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	no.
2012-10-02T23:42:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	can you import all the files using gPhoto ? check your cables it sounds like a lose connection between the camera and computer
2012-10-02T23:43:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	ok, ive tried two different cables.
2012-10-02T23:44:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	how old is the camera
2012-10-02T23:44:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	im not sure. its a friends. im guessing around 2 years
2012-10-02T23:45:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	you may just have to take it file by file.  If this is something you will be doing often you may want to run to walmart or like store and buy a memory card reader for like $15
2012-10-02T23:46:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	ctrl+N for a new window
2012-10-02T23:47:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	yes this opens up the home folder
2012-10-02T23:47:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	now make a temp folder and drag and drop the files
2012-10-02T23:47:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	ok
2012-10-02T23:49:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	L3mce ok this works. now this is my problem: it takes a couple of minutes for all the files to load and only then will it even let me drag and drop. why may this be?
2012-10-02T23:50:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	Camera maybe older then you thought or the computer is and is using usb 1.0
2012-10-02T23:50:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	what is usb 1.0? my computer is from 2005
2012-10-02T23:51:00.000Z	BinaryMaster	Siegel-	You can look into turning of thumbnail mode though not sure how myself
2012-10-02T23:53:00.000Z	Siegel-	BinaryMaster	thats i guess in "view", but is it possible that all this trouble is only because of my kind of "old" hardware and that it just takes a bit time because the connection isnt ideal? i mean, after a couple of minutes all the files display and when i drag 'n drop, it works fine
