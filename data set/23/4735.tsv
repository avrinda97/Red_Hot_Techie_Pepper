2007-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	you can't go through 2 subnet masks like that, what king of routers are they
2007-09-30T13:27:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	I'm using my adsl modem which doubles as a router and then that connects to another router which all the computers run off.
2007-09-30T13:28:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	yeah thats a tricky one, does your isp you ppoa or what, you need to change the modem mode to bridge mode
2007-09-30T13:29:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	then have the router do that authentication, but your router might not be able to do it
2007-09-30T13:29:00.000Z	gregshallard		ivc, the Wan type is PPPoA LLC
2007-09-30T13:30:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	will you router be able to do that kind of authentication?
2007-09-30T13:30:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	I'm pretty sure it can.
2007-09-30T13:31:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	what kind of router?
2007-09-30T13:32:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	the router the computers are connected to is a DLink DI-624
2007-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	whats the command I would use? I know the external facing Ip of the router, what would me the line i use?
2007-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	oh well i don't know about that, go into the web interface for you modem, change it to bridge mode, then go into router and switch the authentication to ppoa and enter passwort
2007-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	you need to mess with router/modem, not clients
2007-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	what would be the command  to connect if I was just connected to the modem?
2007-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	if is usually a web address
2007-09-30T13:36:00.000Z	gregshallard		jowi, it is a possibility to connect just through the one router, how would I do that using "ssh" the options I'd have to use?
2007-09-30T13:37:00.000Z	gregshallard		jowi, is it using -L?
2007-09-30T13:38:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	networking isn't easy, read this http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm and then you'll have a rough idea
2007-09-30T13:40:00.000Z	gregshallard		thanks ivc.
2007-09-30T13:41:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	if you want to make it easier, just get cable, it's faster anyway
2007-09-30T13:41:00.000Z	gregshallard		ivx**
2007-09-30T13:41:00.000Z	gregshallard	ivx	money lol. I'm only 16 still at home with no income!
2007-09-30T13:42:00.000Z	ivx	gregshallard	oh lol
