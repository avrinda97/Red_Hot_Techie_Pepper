2007-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	sudo apt-get install xchat
2007-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	not everything (not by a longshot) is in add/remove
2007-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	no reason to compile
2007-08-05T16:58:00.000Z	heffay	astro76	ok xchat installed. trying to connect to irc.freenode.net. seems to be hanging
2007-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	do you have internet connectivity otherwise on that computer? can you ping irc.freenode.net ?
2007-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	can you ping irc.freenode.net?
2007-08-05T05:11:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	I have no idea what could be wrong
2007-08-05T05:28:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	good luck finding that perfect distro :p
2007-08-05T05:37:00.000Z	astro76	heffay	did you try disabling ipv6 in xchat as someone suggested? that is a somewhat common problem as ubuntu added ipv6 by default recently
