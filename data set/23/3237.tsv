2008-06-08T11:44:00.000Z	behiimehii		I'm really disliking it ;/
2008-06-08T11:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	firefox 3.5 or firefox 3 beta 5?
2008-06-08T11:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	what are you trying to downgrade it to?
2008-06-08T11:45:00.000Z	behiimehii	Starnestommy	I'm not quite sure.  I can't remember what it used to be about three months back :/
2008-06-08T11:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	firefox 3 beta 4?
2008-06-08T12:07:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	I'm not sure, sorry
2008-06-08T12:07:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	wait, it may eb a bad DPI setting
2008-06-08T12:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	it's a kernel-based virtual machine based on qemu.  A KVM switch is used for multiplexing keyboards, video, and mice for servers
2008-06-08T12:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	kvm and a kvm switch are unrelated
2008-06-08T12:13:00.000Z	behiimehii	Starnestommy	how would I check if either one is installed?
2008-06-08T12:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	I'm not sure
2008-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	what do you mean by "funky"?
2008-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	check your dpi settings
2008-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	behiimehii	Starnestommy	how would I go about doing that, and what should I be looking for/
2008-06-08T12:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	system > preferences > appearance > fonts > details... > Resolution
2008-06-08T12:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	the "dots per inch" is your DPI setting
2008-06-08T14:01:00.000Z	behiimehii	Starnestommy	what is your DPI set to?
2008-06-08T14:02:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	96
2008-06-08T14:03:00.000Z	behiimehii	Starnestommy	and does the resolution look ok to you, or is it odd-looking?
2008-06-08T14:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	it looks OK for me
2008-06-08T14:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	I have 1440x900
2008-06-08T14:04:00.000Z	Starnestommy	behiimehii	so you may need something bigger for the DPI
