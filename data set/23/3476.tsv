2008-11-23T10:20:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=reset+mysql+root+password
2008-11-23T10:21:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	i remember my root password
2008-11-23T10:21:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	How are you logging into it?
2008-11-23T10:21:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	mysql -u root -p
2008-11-23T10:22:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	And what's it say?
2008-11-23T10:22:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	It's "mysql -uroot -p" by the way. It usually doesn't really matter, but it's just something to keep in mind
2008-11-23T10:23:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	iam getting this error http://paste.ubuntu.com/75852/
2008-11-23T10:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	I'm not entirely sure...I suggest resetting the password and trying to see if the new one works
2008-11-23T11:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	Did you reset the root password like I asked you earlier?
2008-11-23T11:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	And they can login?
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	Then something else is awry, are you hosting it?
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	Are you mediwiki and wordpress blogs working today?
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	But you can't connect in terminal?
2008-11-23T11:58:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	Are you sure you're connected to your server, and are you sure you're typing the password right, etc. etc.
2008-11-23T12:00:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	yes iam sure iam connected to the server and iam typing the right password
2008-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	can u help me or are u bussy?
2008-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	I haven't got a clue without being there to test, something is up and it sounds like you're doing something wrong
2008-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	krish_	dmsuperman	just let me know wat might have goine wrong?
2008-11-23T12:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	krish_	I offered my suggestions as to what might have gone wrong off the top of my head
