2006-10-13T13:06:00.000Z	lwizardl		anyone know if any of these nvidia cards are compatible with ubuntu fx5500, 6800, 7600, or 7800?
2006-10-13T13:07:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	any of these should work with nvidia's own driver.
2006-10-25T10:03:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2006-11-13T07:54:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	ubuntu comes with a firewall. Configure it with a tool like firestarter
2006-11-13T08:06:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	if your machine is connected to the internet, and no firewall restricts access, all IPs can ssh into your machine.
2007-02-04T14:33:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	there is no way to support NTFS "properly", because it is proprietary and poorly documented
2007-02-04T14:34:00.000Z	lwizardl	soundray	hmm ok becuase I have a usb 160gb drive that is ntfs that I would like to use on my ubuntu box
2007-02-04T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	reformat it with ext3, and use ext2fsd if you have to access it from Windows
2007-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	lwizardl	soundray	ok and that will let me use it from any windows pc?
2007-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	any Windows PC where you install ext2fsd. You could make a small FAT32 partition on it and store the installer on the disk.
2007-02-04T14:37:00.000Z	lwizardl	soundray	I can do that
2007-08-15T12:36:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	no, I reckon Enselic hasn't fully understood your question :)
2007-08-15T12:40:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	once you go over 16GB, you *may* have trouble
2007-08-15T12:42:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	but you can create ext3 filesystems with parameters such that a single file may be 64 terabytes.
2007-08-15T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	fstab doesn't hold drive names. It holds partition names. man fstab
2007-08-15T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	to create an ext3 for large files, use mke2fs -T largefile (man mke2fs)
2007-08-15T12:46:00.000Z	lwizardl	soundray	correct but it does list the mount like hdc. hdd,etc
2007-10-13T13:06:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	set a partition label
2007-10-13T13:08:00.000Z	lwizardl	soundray	I don't have an option for partition label just disk label
2007-10-13T13:09:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	that's something different though. Hold on, ubotu has a factoid...
2007-10-13T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	sorry, can't find it at the moment. What kind of filesystem are you creating on those partitions?
2007-10-13T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	for ext3 partitions, you set the volume label with 'sudo tune2fs -L foo /dev/sdb9' (replace foo and the devicename appropriately)
2007-10-13T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	lwizardl	check 'man tune2fs' for more info
