2009-04-10T14:23:00.000Z	reid		Does anyone know if nvidia supports jaunty properly?
2009-04-10T14:23:00.000Z	imachine	reid	works okay for my 7600go
2009-04-10T14:24:00.000Z	reid	imachine	ah ur running jaunty?
2009-04-10T14:24:00.000Z	imachine	reid	on two machines, yes
2009-04-10T14:24:00.000Z	reid	imachine	oh sweet, then I for SURE know that nvidia is ahead of the game hahah
2009-04-10T14:25:00.000Z	reid	imachine	ext4??? i hate you haha
2009-04-10T14:25:00.000Z	reid	imachine	you notice any benefits yet to ext4 FS?
2009-04-10T14:25:00.000Z	imachine	reid	yes.
2009-04-10T14:25:00.000Z	imachine	reid	it's insanely fast, compared to ext3.
2009-04-10T14:26:00.000Z	imachine	reid	both for read, small file operations and large file operations like unpacking many rars.
2009-04-10T14:26:00.000Z	reid	imachine	I could imagine when you dpkg -i *.deb for a folder with like 50 debs
2009-04-10T14:28:00.000Z	reid	imachine	the reiser thing that is
2009-04-10T14:28:00.000Z	imachine	reid	yes, back in the day
2009-04-10T14:28:00.000Z	imachine	reid	it was more a linux problem
2009-04-10T14:28:00.000Z	reid	imachine	I heard that reiser frags much less though... but then again I have never had a frag problem with ext3
2009-04-10T14:29:00.000Z	imachine	reid	it was a problem regarding linux mounting dirty fs.
2009-04-10T14:29:00.000Z	imachine	reid	which it shouldn't have done.
2009-04-10T14:29:00.000Z	imachine	reid	fscking later caused data loss.
2009-04-10T14:30:00.000Z	reid	imachine	yeah I stick to ext2 for boot, and ext3 for root/home, call me oldschool haha
2009-04-10T14:30:00.000Z	imachine	reid	it's a good combo
2009-04-10T14:30:00.000Z	imachine	reid	ZFS is something interesting too.
2009-04-10T14:30:00.000Z	imachine	reid	the FreeBSD people were all hyped about it.
2009-04-10T14:30:00.000Z	reid	imachine	yeah I tend to partition /boot, /, and /home
