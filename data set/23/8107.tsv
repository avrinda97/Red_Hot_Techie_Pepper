2005-01-20T16:56:00.000Z	HappyFool		try a different time server, maybe?
2005-01-20T16:57:00.000Z	HappyFool		i edited /etc/default/ntpdate and changed the timeserver entry
2005-01-20T16:57:00.000Z	HappyFool		then did sudo /etc/init.d/ntpdate restart
2005-01-20T16:57:00.000Z	HappyFool		err, tick.nml.csir.co.za
2005-01-20T16:58:00.000Z	HappyFool		i forget where there's a list of timeservers
2005-01-20T16:58:00.000Z	HappyFool		it was ntp.ubuntulinux.org
2005-01-20T16:58:00.000Z	HappyFool		which was not set by me, unless my memory is failing ;)
2005-01-20T06:02:00.000Z	HappyFool		well, i'm not gdb expert, but my libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0.400.10 is stripped. Hm. Come to think of it, how would the func be found by the linker then?
2005-01-20T06:03:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	Well, that's not a problem.
2005-01-20T06:03:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	The debugger nows the name of the functions, but not its parametrization.
2005-01-20T06:03:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	Have in mind that the names need to be known to do the linkage stuff.
2005-01-20T06:04:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	To ilustrate it, just try an objdump -T <some_stripped_so_lib>
2005-01-20T06:05:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	You should see the symbol names.
2005-01-20T06:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	SirFred	ah-ha.
2005-01-20T06:06:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	What you don't have is another debug info.
2005-01-20T06:06:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	Like the function parameters, source code link,...
2005-01-20T06:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	SirFred	cool, thanks. I've used nm to track down link errors in the past, but objdump looks more useful
2005-01-20T06:07:00.000Z	HappyFool		or at least, differently useful ;)
2005-01-20T06:08:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	objdump has a lot of other options. You can disassemble, for example.
2005-01-20T06:09:00.000Z	SirFred		What is the supposed way to setup ppp dialups in Ubuntu?
2005-01-20T06:09:00.000Z	SirFred		Better said: supported way
2005-01-20T06:09:00.000Z	HappyFool		the DialupHowto uses pppconfig
2005-01-20T06:10:00.000Z	SirFred	HappyFool	That's a text utility. I expected some expectacular gnome app, with lights and music.
