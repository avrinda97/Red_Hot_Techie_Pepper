2011-10-22T13:53:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	yes
2011-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	live cd looks like a normal installation
2011-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	open a terminal and type ls, that's how you use commands
2011-10-22T14:06:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	i was away from my desk, can you not even get in grub, the menu?
2011-10-22T14:31:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	acpi controls you're battery state (sort of)
2011-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	depends on what you want to do
2011-10-22T14:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	what screen are you in, right now?
2011-10-22T14:38:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	how are you here, you have more than one pc, are the two machines in the same network?
2011-10-22T14:39:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	and you don't get a gui?
2011-10-22T14:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	you say it IS a cd, now you say you CAN with a cd
2011-10-22T14:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	i have no further hints or tips, maybe someone else can help
2011-10-22T14:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Newbeeans	cannot say, try and you know
