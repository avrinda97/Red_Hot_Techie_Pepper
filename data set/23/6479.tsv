2008-12-31T02:48:00.000Z	jdolan		can anyone recommend a sound editor besides Audacity?
2008-12-31T02:48:00.000Z	jdolan		i get no sound output from Audacity.
2008-12-31T02:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	ah.. you need to fix that :)
2008-12-31T02:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	do you get sound output from anything?
2008-12-31T02:49:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	default Intrepid install.  all other apps work just fine.
2008-12-31T02:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	have you played with the audio device settings?
2008-12-31T02:49:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	at length, yes.  i can even record sounds from mic and line via the sound recorder applet.
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	do you get sound output from anything?
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	see above.
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	sound works in absolutely everything else.  even recording on both mic and line sources.
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	above you say you record things right?
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	I was asking about playing sound.. which app can play sound?
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	and is it using alsa or oss?
2008-12-31T02:51:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	have you got audacity using alsa or oss?
2008-12-31T02:51:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	i only have an option for the ALSA device in Audacity.  it says it's using Portaudio as well.
2008-12-31T02:52:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	no error messages anywhere?
2008-12-31T02:52:00.000Z	jdolan	lesshaste	no output from Audacity at all at the terminal.
2008-12-31T02:53:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	how annoying.. I see online that there are plenty of posts about "no sound" and audacity
2008-12-31T02:53:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	did you look at them alreadyy?
2008-12-31T02:54:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	well I don't know.. I would post on the audacity forum
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	no one knows
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	and the question is asked a fair amount
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	jdolan	people like to have different volume control per app...that's all anyone can think of
