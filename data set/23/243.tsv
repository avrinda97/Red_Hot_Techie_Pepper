2012-02-24T19:13:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	/etc/dhcp3-server/dhcpd.conf
2012-02-24T19:14:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	forget it, am reading what I want... not what is written..
2012-02-24T19:14:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	why are you mixing apache conf and dhcp conf?
2012-02-24T19:15:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	/etc/apache2.apache2.conf
2012-02-24T19:17:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	/etc/dhcp3-server/dhcpd.conf is also blank. what do you mean about mixing? well I have the file/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
2012-02-24T19:17:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	what are you trying to? configure a web server AND configure a dhcp server?
2012-02-24T19:18:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	i'm trying to setup fog server
2012-02-24T19:36:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	I assume a route is in place for both subnets to communicate?
2012-02-24T19:38:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	could you please rephrase that question?
2012-02-24T19:38:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	forget apache. from one machine, can you ping the other and vice versa?
2012-02-24T19:38:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	can they talk together?
2012-02-24T19:39:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	I can ping from ubuntu to xp, but not from xp to ubuntu
2012-02-24T19:42:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	make it easy for you to begin with. put both machines on the same subnet. install your soft and make sure it works. then you will play with different subnets.
2012-02-24T19:44:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	yea was starting to look into that, wanted to change the dhcpd.conf but it's blank, and it's there where I can make the ubuntu machine part of the same network. right?
2012-02-24T19:45:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	not at all. I believe you may have some things to learn before setting up any kind of servers...
2012-02-24T19:47:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	well i'm trying to learn :) i'm just new to the whole server thing. all i'm trying to do now is to setup a fog server to take care of image installing on PC's I have to format. wanted to be able to store the install image on a server and use the ethernet to setup the pc's
2012-02-24T19:48:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	have a look at clonezilla. might be easier for you to understand / put in place
2012-02-24T19:49:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	you gotta start somewhere right?
2012-02-24T19:50:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	wery well, i've gotten used to ppl giving up on me any way. i'll check that clonezilla
2012-02-24T19:50:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	not a problem of giving up on you. teaching networking and so on is not something you do over IRC
2012-02-24T19:51:00.000Z	bluefrog	playman	takes time to learn.
2012-02-24T19:53:00.000Z	playman	bluefrog	yeah I know. I was able to setup my own DHCP server on the ubuntu machine, so seting up the fog should not have been so much trouble, except it seems to have deleted all the settings i've made and left me in the dark.
