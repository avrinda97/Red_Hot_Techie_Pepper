2007-07-26T09:40:00.000Z	VSpike		Anyone know if strigi can index maildir++ ?
2007-07-26T09:40:00.000Z	VSpike		Or MS Word docs?
2007-07-26T09:40:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	you mean a dir with 1 file per mail? it can and also indexes all attachments
2007-07-26T09:42:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	yep, and nested folders.  Which usually start with a "."
2007-07-26T09:42:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	check
2007-07-26T09:43:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	most of them seem to be able to do maildir but not maildir++.  Beagle ignores anything starting with a "."
2007-07-26T09:43:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	maybe i should try it.  What about msword ... any idea?
2007-07-26T09:43:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	ah, i see, strigi does that by default too, but you can configure it
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	^
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	how can you configure it?  Can you use wildcards?
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	you mean gds?
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	yes wildcards like rsync
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	yeah google desktop linux
2007-07-26T09:45:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	they have a distro?
2007-07-26T09:45:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	because I have a lot of mail folders :) And adding them to an include list one at a time is not an option :)
2007-07-26T09:45:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	sorry .. probably bad terminology on my part. i just mean the desktop search tool for linux
2007-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	ok
2007-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	I noticed they refer to it internally as gdl
2007-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	lets hope they dont make a distro
2007-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	it installs some god-awful update script in your cron.hourly - totally unnecessary on an apt based system - which then dumps script output to your root email every tyime it runs
2007-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	vandenoever	VSpike	and it's closed source stuff from the internet search monopoly
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	true.  If it worked well, I could live with that until an open source alternative that worked for me was available
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	VSpike	vandenoever	will try strigi anyways
