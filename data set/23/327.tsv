2011-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	netninja		gogets: yes, you're right, so... what does that have to do with "what are you hibernating?"
2011-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	netninja		I know what sleep is
2011-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	netninja		I didn't say it writes to ram
2011-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	netninja		I said it writes ram to disk
2011-12-06T07:30:00.000Z	netninja		gogets: the only thing I'm not aware of is *where* it writes to disk (swap vs fs), which really, I don't care.
2011-12-06T07:31:00.000Z	netninja		I'm less concerned with the specifics of something indirectly related to the actual problem, as I am to fixing the problem.
2011-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	netninja		so getting hung up on where it writes to, I don't really care as much about as fixing the fact that it just *does* *not* *hibernate*
2011-12-06T07:33:00.000Z	netninja		so unless 8gig of ram plus 8gig of files running very few system files takes up more than 40gb, that's not the issue, I'm afraid
2011-12-06T07:33:00.000Z	netninja		yeah, humm :(
2011-12-06T07:34:00.000Z	netninja		again, this all works fine until I upgraded to 8gb of ram from 2; ram checked out fine
2011-12-06T07:36:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	did you do memtest after installing the ram?
2011-12-06T07:36:00.000Z	netninja		yes
2011-12-06T07:36:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	you let a whole pass go perfectly?
2011-12-06T07:36:00.000Z	netninja	Artemis3	just a few hours ago as well
2011-12-06T07:36:00.000Z	netninja	Artemis3	yes, took almost 3 hours
2011-12-06T07:37:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	actually i have 8g of ram and no swap so that shouldn't be a problem
2011-12-06T07:38:00.000Z	netninja		woah, crazy! - since blowing up my swap just a minute ago, now Hibernate isn't even an option any more
2011-12-06T07:38:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	ok, if you want to hibernate, as opposed to suspend, your swap must be a little bigger than your ram
2011-12-06T07:39:00.000Z	netninja	Artemis3	yes, I'm aware of that, and yet, people in this forum keep saying that and then the opposite of that; I've always believed that was true
2011-12-06T07:40:00.000Z	netninja	Artemis3	however, there are plenty of people in this channel that say this is not true with apparent self-examples :(
2011-12-06T07:40:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	you swap should something like 8,1g, or perhaps 8,01g
2011-12-06T07:41:00.000Z	netninja	Artemis3	I'm formatting it for swap now at 9gb.
2011-12-06T07:41:00.000Z	Artemis3	netninja	should do.
