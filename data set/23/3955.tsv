2007-12-30T01:15:00.000Z	devkid		hi, when i try to start compiz i get the following error: Checking for texture_from_pixmap: not present.
2007-12-30T01:15:00.000Z	devkid		but glxinfo says, this ext is present
2007-12-30T01:15:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	no it doesn't :)
2007-12-30T01:16:00.000Z	crdlb		glxinfo must list it three times for it to be present
2007-12-30T01:17:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	you mean in client, server and opengl extensions?
2007-12-30T01:18:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	server, client, and "GLX extensions"
2007-12-30T01:18:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	what video card do you have?
2007-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	ati radeon 9600 xt
2007-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	which driver are you using?
2007-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	devkid		fglrx
2007-12-30T01:20:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	its the driver from ubuntu's 'restricted drivers'
2007-12-30T01:20:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	you need to install xserver-xgl then
2007-12-30T01:21:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	does xgl support 3d acceleration?
2007-12-30T01:22:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	you'll lose direct rendering (although there's a workaround for that to let you run apps on the regular X server)
2007-12-30T01:22:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	what kind of workaround?
2007-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	you can run DISPLAY=:0 myawesomegame
2007-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	devkid		does it mean, that i have to start to x servers? one xorg and one xgl?
2007-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	that will happen anyway. It's how Xgl works
2007-12-30T01:25:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	thx, i'll try it
2007-12-30T01:25:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	you could also disable the restricted driver and use AIGLX
2007-12-30T01:25:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	but that's no good if you're a gamer
2007-12-30T01:27:00.000Z	devkid	crdlb	is it possible to write a little script that switches between the fglx and the ati driver and restarts the x-server afterwards?
2007-12-30T01:29:00.000Z	crdlb	devkid	I guess you could, although it's much easier to just reboot when switching
