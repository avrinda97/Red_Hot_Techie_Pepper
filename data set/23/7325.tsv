2005-09-05T13:49:00.000Z	WildFire`		hey
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	WildFire`		just got my unbutu cd's today
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	WildFire`		er
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	WildFire`		the free live cd cd
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	WildFire`		does it come with kde installed?
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	no
2005-09-05T13:50:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	ubuntu is only Gnome, if you want kde you want kubuntu
2005-09-05T13:51:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	gnome is something like kde but i think it's better
2005-09-05T13:53:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	what hd do you want to install it on?
2005-09-05T13:53:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	yes
2005-09-05T13:53:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	think that's hdc
2005-09-05T13:54:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	yes, that's the device-name
2005-09-05T13:54:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	in linux if you have 4 ide-devices they should be called hda, hdb, hdc and hdd
2005-09-05T13:54:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	in linux you don't have drive-letters
2005-09-05T13:55:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	and partitions are indicated with numbers.. if you have a disk on primary master with 2 partitions they will be called hda1 and hda2
2005-09-05T13:56:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	i THINK it should be hdb
2005-09-05T13:57:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	you can, with df, but that can be confusing
2005-09-05T13:58:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	that's a command
2005-09-05T14:12:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	depends on what internet you have
2005-09-05T14:13:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	do those still exist? :|
2005-09-05T14:14:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	i'm not sure if the live-cd of ubuntu comes with dial-up software
2005-09-05T14:15:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	i'm on broadband so i can't tell you much about that
2005-09-05T14:15:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	WildFire`	i was talking about hoary too
