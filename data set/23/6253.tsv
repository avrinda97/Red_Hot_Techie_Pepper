2007-02-26T07:00:00.000Z	abhay		ok. i have Windows Vista on my primary hdd, which is SATA. I just added a second hdd (IDE) onto which I have installed Ubuntu. I tried configuring grub so it would allow me to boot from Vista, but it ended up corrupting the volume. I had to reinstall Windows. How should I do this right?
2007-02-26T07:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	That should be an easy one...
2007-02-26T07:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	Point the BIOS to boot from the IDE drive first and let grub choose.
2007-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	That way you don't even touch the windows drive.
2007-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	abhay		but what do I put in the grub config file?
2007-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	Now that's a good question. I don't know if there is a Vista specific line needed.
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		I did this:
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		title Windows
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		map (hd0) (hd1)
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		map (hd1) (hd0)
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		rootnoverify (hd1,0)
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	abhay		chainloader +1
2007-02-26T07:04:00.000Z	abhay		but it messed up

2007-02-26T07:05:00.000Z	abhay	gyaresu	OK. Im new to this
2007-02-26T07:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	no problem. You probably need the grub entry to be sd0 or something as it's a serial drive...
2007-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	abhay	yeah. you do.
2007-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	abhay	gyaresu	I see. Where could I read more about this?
