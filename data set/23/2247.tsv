2009-05-17T08:17:00.000Z	Drewsef		Hello, I'm not getting any audio with 9.04 that I just installed.  Is there a way to trouble shoot this problem?
2009-05-17T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Try running "alsamixer -c 0" and make sure all of the levels are turned up
2009-05-17T08:20:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	They are all up into the red level
2009-05-17T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Any of them have "MM" at the bottom?
2009-05-17T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	That means they are muted, use the "M" key to unmute them
2009-05-17T08:22:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	Ok unmuted but no change
2009-05-17T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Do you get any error when you try the audio test in System > Preferences > Audio ?
2009-05-17T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Yes, remembered wrong :)
2009-05-17T08:25:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	Maybe I need some sound drivers that aren't provided with ubuntu?
2009-05-17T08:26:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	with AlsaMixer the headphone volume that was muted, I unmuted, but I can't turn it up like the rest
2009-05-17T08:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Possible, but Ubuntu seems to at least think it has drivers for your device or it wouldn't show controlls. Do you have more than one card? ( and I missed your answer about any erros from the sound test )
2009-05-17T08:28:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	 No, just on board sound.  I didn't see any errors with the test.  I wasn't sure which interfaces to test, or how long to wait though.
2009-05-17T08:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Ok, try alsmixer with no options ( which should show one channel, from pulseaudio )
2009-05-17T08:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	Try the audio test with "ALSA" selected instead of "Automatically Detected"
2009-05-17T08:34:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	 I started scrolling to the right more under the alsamixer, I see IEC958.  It has different options such as A/D conv, and AC link.  Is this important?
2009-05-17T08:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	I don't know
2009-05-17T08:35:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	ok testing.
2009-05-17T08:37:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	it isn't showing any errors, and its continuing to test indefinitely it seem.
2009-05-17T08:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	If there would be errors they would show up immediately, and if it worked you'd hear a tone
2009-05-17T08:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drewsef	I am not sure what the problem is, you might be able to find more information by running "lspci" and googling for the line pertaining to your sound card, sorry I couldn't be more help
2009-05-17T08:40:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	 Thanks I'll take a look.  :)
2009-05-17T08:42:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	: In case your interested. http://pastebin.com/m4a4bf77a
2009-05-17T08:46:00.000Z	Drewsef	Jordan_U	Looks like I may not be the only one with problems related to this audio chip
