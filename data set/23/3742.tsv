2008-07-19T04:27:00.000Z	wigren		hi all! i have a nvidia GForce 6100 that i'm not to fond of. I'm looking for a new graphics card. i don't need any thing special, just compiz and simple games. any suggestions?
2008-07-19T04:28:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	What's wrong with the one you have?
2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	compiz doesn't work on it. or i should say it does, but it makes my sound all distorted. and dvd play back is hit or miss
2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	That sounds more like a motherboard issue, tbh
2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	AGP card?
2008-07-19T04:30:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	(Sounds like it isn't allocating sufficient PCI bandwidth to the sound card, or dvd.. er, that takes a bit, but I doubt it's the card, at least not by itself
2008-07-19T04:30:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	to be honest i'm not sure. how can i tell with out taking it apart. i bought it in 2005.
2008-07-19T04:31:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	Run lspci, see how many different numbers there are on the very first column
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	00:00.0?
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	No, just 00:
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	It goes bus:device.subdevice
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	You presumably have more than one pci device, but I'd like to know how many busses there are
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	If it's /all/ 00, that means they're all on the same pci bus, and you've got a /pci/ gfx card - that would definitely be a problem. If everything but the card is 00: and the card is 01:, that means it's agp, pretty much. If there are lots of them, pci express.. or some more unusual pci setups, but those are mostly in laptops
2008-07-19T04:33:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	the last on e is 04
2008-07-19T04:33:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	Ah hmm. Can you type lspci -vv and paste the output somewhere?
2008-07-19T04:37:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	is this ok? http://www.mediafire.com/?ngtqkj1nmz0
2008-07-19T04:37:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	That's silly. Use a pastebin - rafb.net, maybe
2008-07-19T04:39:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	http://rafb.net/p/sbEheq35.html
2008-07-19T04:39:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	Ah heh. PCI Express.
2008-07-19T04:40:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	I don't know what may be causing the problems, then. I /guess/ going into your bios and resetting to "safe" setting might do something; you should try that
2008-07-19T04:40:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	But as for a replacement.. well, try to borrow one to make sure it isn't your mobo first
2008-07-19T04:40:00.000Z	wigren	Baughn	alright will do. thanks
2008-07-19T04:41:00.000Z	Baughn	wigren	Beyond that, ATI cards should be getting good support.. er, sometime next year, maybe. Old ones already work well with the open-source driver, but then we're talking 9800 or so.
