2010-08-30T01:46:00.000Z	timewriter	user_	, does nvidia offers drivers for linux on their website ?
2010-08-30T01:51:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	No :/
2010-08-30T01:52:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	And like i saw, There is Bug #298465 in linux (Ubuntu): “No digital out with VIA VT1708b”
2010-08-30T01:53:00.000Z	timewriter	user_	, im sorry for that
2010-08-30T01:53:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	 So, you think that, there is no way that i can fix my audio drivers?
2010-08-30T01:54:00.000Z	timewriter	user_	, maybe they will release a working driver
2010-08-30T01:55:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	There is no any other solution, for now?
2010-08-30T01:55:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	Because like i saw, there will be no resoultion for this audio driver. :| Huh ?
2010-08-30T01:55:00.000Z	timewriter	user_	, you can do some research on google , i dont know any solution for your problem
2010-08-30T01:55:00.000Z	user_	timewriter	Okay, timewriter. Thanks in advance! ^^
