2005-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	projectmayhem		nophasis: turst me, i'm a major noob
2005-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	projectmayhem		trust*
2005-02-09T09:49:00.000Z	projectmayhem		ok, but neither has any specific advantages?
2005-02-09T09:51:00.000Z	projectmayhem		ok, thanks everyone. jeese, the linux community is much more friendly than windows tech support!
2005-02-09T09:51:00.000Z	projectmayhem		yeah... i don't know what yum or apt is (is that installer stuff? i think i saw it in a tutorial somewhere..)
2005-02-09T09:52:00.000Z	projectmayhem		should i download warty or hoary?
2005-02-09T09:53:00.000Z	projectmayhem		i tried the hoary live CD last night and didn't seem to have any problems, it actually ran WAY faster than windows ever did on my 2.66 p4/ 512 mb ram
2005-02-09T09:54:00.000Z	projectmayhem		I love fight club :-D
2005-02-09T09:54:00.000Z	projectmayhem		best book / movie everrrrrr
2005-02-09T09:55:00.000Z	projectmayhem		also, i am in need of some security software- just antivirus and firewall as precautionary measures (the rest of my family is afraid i'll get a virus running linux, when they're the ones that use IE!)
2005-02-09T09:56:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	hehe
2005-02-09T09:57:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	if you haven't installed any server software since you installed ubuntu you don't need a firewall, by default nothing is available remotely
2005-02-09T09:57:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	as for anti-virus, there's clamav, but it's not like a windows anti-virus scanner in that it doesn't scan desktop crap
2005-02-09T09:58:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	installed clamav from universe then, but it doesn't have a pretty interface or anything
2005-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	it's mostly aimed at scanning for windows viruses ;)
2005-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	also, get your family using firefox instead of IE :)
2005-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	doh!
2005-02-09T10:00:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	they'll listen next time they get riddled with spyware and popups ;)
2005-02-09T10:01:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	no antispyware needed :)
2005-02-09T10:02:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	np :)
2005-02-09T10:03:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	the base install is pretty small, 20 gigs will be *plenty*
2005-02-09T10:04:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	I have loads of extra programming stuff installed on top of the base install and I'm using <3Gb
2005-02-09T10:06:00.000Z	Ng	projectmayhem	something like partition magic can resize windows and linux partitions. I think parted can on linux, but it's a little more complex
