2007-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	tatters		I thought if I navigated to a directory /media/music and in terminal typed chown user /* it would only act upon the directory I was in, however it appears to this is not the case I should have included the directory,,I let it run for about 15 mins till I realised it was running through my entire structure,,how much problem could this cause?
2007-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	did you use sudo?
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	no
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	were you in a root terminal?
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	or a standard one?
2007-04-28T05:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	....?
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	if I had used sudo would it be easily irrereversable?
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	ok so you were in a standard terminal and didn't use sudo or any root account?
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	if you used sudo then yuo should backup data and reinstall
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	correct
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	if you didn't then you should be fine.
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	however the solution you were trying to use is not the way to do things
2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	how so is this not good, if I want to own my NTFS external drive music folder how should I give myself the correct permission,,,,,,,the right way?
2007-04-28T06:02:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	the right way is by specifying the user id in /etc/fstab. However you say it is external... so it should be automounting with corect permissions unless you've broken something
2007-04-28T06:04:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	been using NTFS-3g at first could not access any file at all, then found that the drive had not been cleanly dismounted in windows and had to use ntfsfix from the ntfsprogs package to correct
2007-04-28T06:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	i'd always recommend using the windows tools to sort out ntfs drives instead of linux ones
2007-04-28T06:07:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	yup your probably right it recommended booting drive twice in windows for some reason else use force mount,I have no window OS after installing ubuntu sooooo took the force route
2007-04-28T06:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	I'm sorry I have to be off now though
2007-10-16T10:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	when it is ready.
2007-10-16T10:42:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	has ubuntu ever failed to deliver on proposed launch date before?
2007-10-16T10:42:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	no. And we won't this time.
2007-10-18T19:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	tatters	use the alternate cd.
2007-10-18T19:48:00.000Z	tatters	PriceChild	thnx I been using reguler cd, read somewhere this is possible know I know why I coiuldnt find the option, should be on the reguler cd though it sounds pretty usefull for laptops
