2007-08-03T05:09:00.000Z	korncob		and it gives me an error
2007-08-03T05:10:00.000Z	korncob		and the add/remove programs thing isn't working nor are sudo commands so i can't install it that way

2007-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	korncob		er i can't use sudo so apparently no
2007-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	korncob		because i remember trying to use sudo for that
2007-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	korncob	why cant you use sudo?
2007-08-03T05:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	korncob	try sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-08-03T05:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	korncob	sudo apt-get remove --purge virtualbox
2007-08-03T05:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	korncob	you need to be very specific with your answers

2007-08-03T05:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	korncob	open a terminal and type sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
