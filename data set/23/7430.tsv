2006-02-18T13:17:00.000Z	ilba7r		hi running an .rm file with totem-xine the pc hangs and i get kernel panic message when i look at dmesg? any ideas?
2006-02-18T13:17:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	dmesg gives you a kernel panic? or just shows you one?
2006-02-18T13:18:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	the pc hangs and the last thing i see on the screen is the kernel panic message
2006-02-18T13:18:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	any information from the kernel panic?
2006-02-18T13:18:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	let me check it out now. it was just a code with bunch of numbers
2006-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	oh, that won't help
2006-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	won't help me, anyway
2006-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	I get that sometimes playing movies over the network if I try to seek too fast
2006-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	the file is on my home dir
2006-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	and it just ran fine now with realplayer. only had this error consist with totem-xine
2006-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	do you have an ati card and running fglrx?
2006-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	not on the box that was giving me the trouble, but on the box I'm on now I do
2006-02-18T13:22:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	i suspect it might be the problem here. Thanx for you help though my firend
2006-02-18T13:22:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	I wouldn't expect so, if realplayer plays it without trouble
2006-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	if you have win32codecs totem would just be using realplayer's codecs
2006-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	what might it be then. ps trying dmesg now i have no message regarding the kernel message problem
2006-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	actually... DO you have w32codecs installed?
2006-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	yap
2006-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	if so, can mplayer play the file?
2006-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	totem start to play the file. then all of a sudden a black screen and the kernel panic message. Then the pc hangs
2006-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	trappist	ilba7r	right, but if you play it with mplayer...
2006-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	let me check
2006-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	ilba7r	trappist	plays though little bit crappy but plays
