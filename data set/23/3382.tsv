2008-05-01T18:05:00.000Z	ozfalcon		how do i resolve my eth0 error: "The interface does not exist"
2008-05-01T18:06:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	sudo ifconfig eth0 up
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	I'm using eth0 now to talk. But system says it doesn't exits. (Go figure)
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	it's probably eth1 then
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	So yeah it's up.
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	no. I only have one wired net connection.
2008-05-01T18:08:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	I want to config eth0, But systems says it doesn't exist when I try to config.
2008-05-01T18:08:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	pastebin the output of these commands:    "sudo ifconfig -a"  "cat /etc/network/interfaces"
2008-05-01T18:10:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	http://paste.ubuntu.com/9196/
2008-05-01T18:11:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	ok what about /etc/network/interfaces please
2008-05-01T18:11:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	and whatever command gives you the error
2008-05-01T18:12:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	http://paste.ubuntu.com/9197/
2008-05-01T18:14:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	Any ideas?
2008-05-01T18:15:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	should it be dhcp or what
2008-05-01T18:16:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	add to your /etc/network/interfaces file two lines    "auto eth0"    "iface eth0 inet dhcp"   that will load up the interface automatically on boot
2008-05-01T18:16:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	well, I'll be buggered if I know how it got 10.1.144.10 (My dhcp server is set to allocate 10.1.144.100+) [it was manualy set to 10.1.144.10 under fedora before i installed ubuntu
2008-05-01T18:18:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	did you pick to import the user preferences during the install?
2008-05-01T18:19:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	HOLD on....... I know why it's 10.1.144.10. (Static assignment by mac address). so yeah it's dhcp and ip assignment is  working correctly.
2008-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	 but I still can't config it on the ubuntu box. It does come up automaticaly on boot though.
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	No, I just erased the fedora partition. no importing - but thats not relevent. (because it's static assigned via mac address as I just mentioned)
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	hwilde	ozfalcon	add to your /etc/network/interfaces file two lines    "auto eth0"    "iface eth0 inet dhcp"   that will load up the interface automatically on boot
2008-05-01T18:23:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	it already works automaticaly on boot.
2008-05-01T18:23:00.000Z	ozfalcon	hwilde	I just can't config the stupid thing.
