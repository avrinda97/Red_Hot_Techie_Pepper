2008-08-20T11:55:00.000Z	tenlet		i was reading that if you install XP first then ubuntu will load by default
2008-08-20T11:56:00.000Z	tenlet		in GRUB?
2008-08-20T11:56:00.000Z	tenlet		ahh ok, so XP first it is then
2008-08-20T11:56:00.000Z	tenlet		during the XP setup, how much space should I leave for ubuntu?
2008-08-20T11:57:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	When I did it on my system, I only left 5GB and I ran out of disk space before I was done installing, so I'd suggest you need a bit more than that.
2008-08-20T11:58:00.000Z	tenlet	yinepuhotep	thanks
2008-08-20T11:58:00.000Z	tenlet		newbie question: is Xubuntu the GUI of ubuntu?
2008-08-20T11:59:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	Wish I could give you a better answer than that, but all I can say is, give it as much space as you can safely afford.
2008-08-20T11:59:00.000Z	tenlet		well got a 60gb HD to use
2008-08-20T11:59:00.000Z	tenlet		probably go with 40 for XP and 20 for ubuntu
2008-08-20T11:59:00.000Z	yinepuhotep		Good figure to start with, given how much of a hog XP is.
2008-08-20T12:00:00.000Z	tenlet		yine: you installed XP first right?
2008-08-20T12:01:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	I did. And once I had Ubuntu installed, I edited my Grub config to give me 10 seconds to choose an OS on boot. It's easy enough to do.
2008-08-20T12:01:00.000Z	tenlet		yine: nice that is what I want also.. can you change the default OS though?
2008-08-20T12:01:00.000Z	yinepuhotep		john: Should be. I installed my first system in a 333mhz P2.
2008-08-20T12:02:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	Yes, you can. Same config file lets you choose which OS to boot by default.
2008-08-20T12:02:00.000Z	tenlet		ok then.. I have XP installed but have been using it for a bit, a clean format is recommended for this right?
2008-08-20T12:03:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	Depends. Do you have empty space on your drive that XP doesn't already own?
2008-08-20T12:03:00.000Z	tenlet		yine: about 40/60 gb used at the moment
2008-08-20T12:03:00.000Z	yinepuhotep		If you don't, then it's easier to do a clean install, because you can never be sure your defrag will clean up the drive enough for parted to give you a good division.
2008-08-20T12:04:00.000Z	tenlet		eh whatever ill do a format
2008-08-20T12:04:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	tenlet	Sounds like you'll be safer that way. Less chance of losing things you want to keep.
