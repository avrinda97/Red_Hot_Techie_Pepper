2009-10-13T18:29:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	the current directory
2009-10-14T16:57:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	What is asking for that as a dependency?
2009-10-14T16:58:00.000Z	nic1	Pici	it is asking for libstartup-notification
2009-10-14T16:59:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	What is 'it'?
2009-10-14T16:59:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	Thats the answer I was looking for. You're trying to install awesome.
2009-10-14T17:00:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	Are you installing it from the repositories and if yes, what release of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-10-14T17:00:00.000Z	nic1	Pici	yes i am trying to install awesome from source, as i need to do dev work onthat
2009-10-14T17:01:00.000Z	nic1	Pici	do you have any idea about awesome?
2009-10-14T17:03:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	It may be prudent to ask in the official awesome support channel if you're trying to install it from source. its #awesome on irc.oftc.net
2009-10-14T18:14:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	You need to take a look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide if you're packaging something.
2009-10-20T18:50:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	What error?
2009-10-20T18:51:00.000Z	nic1	Pici	file2 is an extra operand it says
2009-10-20T18:51:00.000Z	Pici	nic1	does either filename have spaces in it?
