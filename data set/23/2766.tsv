2009-08-03T05:41:00.000Z	jlaroche		i was trying to change my username via instructions found on this website http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4968235 but now I am receiving a User's $HOME/.dmrc file is being ignored error. I have no other user names and can not get into my system. Any help would be appreciated.
2009-08-03T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 just delete the file... its just a 1 line file that has the last login/desktop setting..
2009-08-03T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 it will get remade next time you login
2009-08-03T05:44:00.000Z	jlaroche	Dr_Willis	- it won't let me log in, that error message is followed by a "Your session only lasted less than 10 seconds. Iff you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of diskspace. Try loggin in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem."
2009-08-03T05:44:00.000Z	jlaroche	Dr_Willis	- it then goes back to the login screen
2009-08-03T05:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 if that file is the problem. login at the alt-ctrl-f1 consoles and  delete it.
2009-08-03T05:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 then alt-ctrl-f7 to  get back to the login screen.. its possible you got some other permissions issues going on.
2009-08-03T05:46:00.000Z	jlaroche	Dr_Willis	- how do i change permissions to a folder in shell so that I have full permission over it
2009-08-03T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 you wish to change the usres home directory from /home/USERNAME to what exactly?
2009-08-03T06:13:00.000Z	jlaroche	Dr_Willis	- i changed my username but apparently my new username is linked to my old username's home folder. I want the new homefolder to be the same as the new username
2009-08-03T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 how did you change your username?  and why.
2009-08-03T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 sudo mkdir /home/newusername  and 'sudo chown username.username /home/username 'it to be owned by the new user  for starters i guess..
2009-08-03T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 i hope you properly changed the commands to be the new/old users names.. and  not 's_old_newg' like the examples show
2009-08-03T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 look in /home/ the users directory does exist? thats one thing to check.
2009-08-03T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 if it exists thats step 1 done.. Now to double check  /etc/passwd and /etc/group and /etc/shadow is the next thing.
2009-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 so there is no /home/CURRENTUSERNAME ?
2009-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 but you have sort of 'half way' switched to the new username?  you are logged in as the new username?
2009-08-03T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 so make a /home/newusername dir and make it owned by that user perhaps? if im understanding you right.
2009-08-03T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 so all the /etc/ Files check out..  just no /home/NewUserName directory?
2009-08-03T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 I would just make the new users home dir by hand (with sudo mkdir, and sudo chown whatever) and then copy all the old files from the old users dir over.. and fix their permissions.. or do like Flannel  says.
2009-08-03T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	 i always just add a new user. :) then move stuff over...
2009-08-03T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	  Im betting you did one of those commands wrong in the url you gave.
2009-08-03T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jlaroche	  the usermod -d /home/new  -m old    command SHOULD of made the new home dir..
