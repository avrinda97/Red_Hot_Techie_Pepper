2008-01-18T23:48:00.000Z	mrmonday		how do I disable networking before my PC boots?
2008-01-18T23:48:00.000Z	mrmonday		is there a file I can edit?
2008-01-18T23:48:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	pull out the cables ? :P
2008-01-18T23:49:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	tried that, it doesn't work
2008-01-18T23:49:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	not a clue myself i'm afraid, thats odd though. what happens?
2008-01-18T23:50:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	when i boot my PC it freezes when configuring the network
2008-01-18T23:51:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	where abouts does it freeze?
2008-01-18T23:52:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	It freezes when it tries to start the firewall (which can't start because of the ethernet interface not being configured properly)
2008-01-18T23:53:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	there is a file left over somewhere from a failed 'sudo ifdown eth0', which causes it not to be configured properly, but i can't remember which one
2008-01-18T23:53:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	try hitting ctrl+alt+f1 then logging in to the text terminal and then typing startx
2008-01-18T23:54:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	that doesn't solve the problem though :/
2008-01-18T23:54:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	no but you're at least in a normal environment :P
2008-01-18T23:55:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	i've no experience with configuring the eth card from there, but i'd say your best off trying to reconfigure from there, or from the alt+ctrl+f1 terminal
2008-01-18T23:56:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	if I don't know how to it isn't much use though is it? :P
2008-01-18T23:56:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	google :D im looking myself at the moment
2008-01-18T23:56:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	I'm alredy looking (I'm using a live CD)
2008-01-18T23:57:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	two heads n all that heh
2008-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	have you tried ethtool
2008-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	what's that?
2008-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	mrmonday	Pygmymath	link?
2008-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	its preinstalled with ubuntu, run ethtool -h in a terminal
2008-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	i dont know if it'll help but its for configuring ethernet devices
2008-01-19T00:15:00.000Z	Pygmymath	mrmonday	good luck!
