2010-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	sunson		any suggestions / recommendations for a decent, low-end graphics tablet that works well under ubuntu 9.10?

2010-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	nc
2010-05-24T10:42:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	on m1 do nc -l -p 6789 (or some such port)
2010-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	man nc
2010-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	thanks lol
2010-05-24T11:01:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	sorry I'm a bit confused about how this would help.  I need to make the named pipe on machine 1, and dump data into it through this script.  My problem is that machine 2 can't access that pipe.  I'm unsure how to use nc to help since I -have- to right to a "file" with this script.
2010-05-24T11:04:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	named pipes are only applicable _within_ the same host
2010-05-24T11:04:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	oh okay that's what I was afraid of.  I don't think there's any way for me to do this then
2010-05-24T11:04:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	if you're specific about having a _file_ on the remote machine (i see no reason why you need a file for this specific application), then you can use ssh
2010-05-24T11:05:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	on m1: cat file | ssh remotehost 'mencoder blah' will solve the problem actually
2010-05-24T11:05:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	simpler setup is to use nc
2010-05-24T11:07:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	you could still hack   around if you can tell your app to write to _some other file_
2010-05-24T11:08:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	which could be /dev/stdout ;)
2010-05-24T11:26:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	okay well editing the program is a bit above me, but thanks for the cat file | ssh machine2 'do stuff here' tip.  One question, I'll need a way to make that keep getting everything in my local pipe continuously right?  Would tail -f do the job, or am I way off base here?  Sorry if I'm bothering you.
2010-05-24T11:27:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	not edit the program - do a --help and see if it supports outputting to some other file. Then you can run the program as (on m1): prg --outfile /dev/stdout | ssh m2 mencoder blah blah
2010-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	and it will get "everything" that is coming from the first command
2010-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	OHHHHH
2010-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	I understand you now.  Sorry I'm a bit out of my element, but that makes sense.  I'll see if I can get that working, thanks.
2010-05-24T11:29:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	simplest example: cat /etc/passwd | ssh m2 'cat >/tmp/his_passwd'
2010-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	I did it with nc =D
2010-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	sunson	NimbleRabit	:) cool
2010-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	NimbleRabit	sunson	very slick.  Thanks a lot for all your help.  It turns out stdout was what I needed to learn about
