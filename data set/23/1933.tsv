2011-05-17T19:45:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Nah, I love Grsync; just wasn't aware of all that can be modified....It's what I love about *nix but, more importantly it's users shareing their infinate knowlege...
2011-05-30T17:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	They must be all getting coffee. :-)
2011-06-22T16:23:00.000Z	llutz	Sidewinder1	no need if his router does the connections and runs an own dns-server (as it apparently does)
2011-06-22T16:24:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	That makes sense but I've always used those givin by my ISP.
2011-06-22T16:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Then again my ISP supplies the router.
2011-06-22T16:25:00.000Z	llutz	Sidewinder1	will slow down dns-request if being behind a router with dns-proxy
2011-06-22T16:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Ans I believe it was already configured.
2011-06-22T16:26:00.000Z	llutz	Sidewinder1	it should be :) several ways to achieve a connection
2011-08-20T19:13:00.000Z	llutz	Sidewinder1	every ext-fs has an own "lost+found"
2011-10-09T17:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Thanks, I knew a CLI approach would be better; unfortunately, I'm CLI challenged.. :-(
2011-10-28T16:20:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Now, you've totally confused me. Not that that's that hard to do, these days..
2011-10-28T16:21:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Now, you try to place three of the same words, in a row and have it, them be grammatically correct.
2011-10-30T17:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Thanx.
2011-10-30T18:26:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	I beg your pardon.?
2011-10-30T18:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	No prob. :D
2011-12-11T19:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	'Twas ot; thought you might get a chuckle; if I was wrong, my humblest apologies; it'll NEVER happen again, trust me.
2011-12-11T19:59:00.000Z	llutz	Sidewinder1	whatever, i just don't read any unannounced pm
2011-12-11T20:00:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	NP.
2011-12-29T18:39:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Not really what I wanted to hear; but many thanks anyway..
2012-03-25T16:45:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Thought it was an ext. drive..
2012-03-25T16:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	Aster I guess I wasn't following closely enough. Very, very sorry. A thousand pardons.
2012-03-25T16:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	llutz	When you get a second, and just out of curiosity, what did I miss?
