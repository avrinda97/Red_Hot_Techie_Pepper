2007-05-16T12:50:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Don't bite the hand that feeds
2007-05-16T13:11:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	What did you do?
2007-05-16T13:13:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Hard to say.
2007-05-16T13:14:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	The entire purpose of the TestDisk is to get your HDD to recognize the correct partitions
2007-05-16T13:15:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Be very careful with the testdisk program. It is very easy to mess things up bad.
2007-05-16T13:17:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Well you can poke around with testdisk and just do analyze and don't 'write' anything unless yo uare absolutely sure it found the old partitions.
2007-05-16T13:22:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Look up ubcd, you'll have to compile one. You'll need a Win XP disk too.
2007-05-16T13:23:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Messed up partitions are no cake-walk if you want to get your stuff back, it takes time and effort.
2007-05-16T13:23:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	In what regard?
2007-05-16T13:24:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Honestly... Buy a new hdd and put the old hdd on backburner as a project
2007-05-16T13:26:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	try that.
2007-05-16T13:28:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	You'll likely have a better chance to view the files in a linux OS than Window
2007-05-16T13:29:00.000Z	Khrajin	BlackCow	Livecd, DSL, Knoppix etc
