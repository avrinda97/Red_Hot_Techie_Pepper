2006-10-12T11:42:00.000Z	XsesA		grub?
2006-10-12T11:42:00.000Z	XsesA		i understood that writing to ntfs can mess it up
2006-10-12T11:42:00.000Z	XsesA		it still beta
2006-10-12T11:43:00.000Z	XsesA		willster
2006-10-12T11:43:00.000Z	XsesA		i will use the fat32
2006-10-12T11:43:00.000Z	XsesA		just if i will download some music to the linux
2006-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	XsesA		so i will be able to hear it on windows too
2006-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	XsesA		how u write from windows to ext3?
2006-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	XsesA		from what i read, the windows can't even recognize this partition
2006-10-12T11:45:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	some software can do it
2006-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	how big is you HD?
2006-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	I would say, 10GB to Linux ext3, and 500 MB of swap
2006-10-12T12:02:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	gparted
2006-10-12T12:03:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	by default ubuntu does not make a /home partiton.  If I were I would learn more about partitions before doing so
2006-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	download gparted, burn it, then boot to it.  Resize NTFS partition then install Linux on unpartitioned space
2006-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	well having a /home partition is a good idea, but its not needed at all
2006-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	Like I said, if you give 10GB to Linux, and 1GB to swap you'll be fine
2006-10-12T12:06:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	how much you planning no downloading
2006-10-12T12:07:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	ok get gparted, resize your ntfs to 125GB and have 125GB linux
2006-10-12T12:08:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	3 (including swap)
2006-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	I thnk ubuntu installer makes swap by default
2006-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Shadow_mil2	XsesA	that will be fine
