2007-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	i don't know wheter X works in chroot, but try export DISPLAY="localhost:0"
2007-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	that didnt seem to help
2007-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	i guess it's just not possible...
2007-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	:( .. news i dont want to hear
2007-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	i want to lanch aptoncd so i can backup the apps that i have installed my harddrive wont boot any longer.. i can mount it though. and its making sounds (its dying)
2007-05-06T08:50:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	hmmm you can see if there are any packages left in /var/apt/cache
2007-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	yeah... not much is there.. i think
2007-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	checking now
2007-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	75 packages.. and must are just lib stuff..
2007-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	there is some list of installed software, second, i'll look where it should be
2007-05-06T08:55:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	you can use this to write out a list of installed software: "dpkg --get-selections > <somefile>"
2007-05-06T08:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	is there any way that i can differentiate the apps that were installed on ubuntu by default versus the apps that I installed..
2007-05-06T09:00:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	well you could compare it with the list on the livecd , or on a fresh install
2007-05-06T09:00:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	hmmm.. good point
2007-05-06T09:03:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	have you ever used aptoncd... ?? it just smart enough to know the apps that we instaled by me.. (*wonders how it works*)
2007-05-06T09:03:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	never even heard of it
2007-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	you can have a look in the manpage of dpkg
2007-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
2007-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	ok i will do that.. was there just a second ago
2007-05-06T09:14:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	seemingly nothing useful in the man pages dpkg
2007-05-06T09:15:00.000Z	jpjacobs	DShepherd	then i would try comparing them... diff should be able to cope with that
2007-05-06T09:19:00.000Z	DShepherd	jpjacobs	ok.. there maybe something in the .desktop files that can help me too.. I am going to give that a looksee
