2008-06-30T02:35:00.000Z	eftex		hi there
2008-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	eftex		i  just installed ubuntu 7.10 and updated to v8
2008-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	eftex		now i wanted to enable the compiz-stuff but it seems there is no graphics-card driver that works for me
2008-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	eftex		i have a GeForce 8800 GTS 512 ( the one which allready uses the G92 chip) and i chose the GeForce 8-Series driver but it seems not to work
2008-06-30T02:37:00.000Z	eftex		i allready googled but no help there :/
2008-06-30T02:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	are you using the restricted driver ?
2008-06-30T02:37:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	i just chose from that driver-dialog?
2008-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	should i download and compile the nvidia drivers from their ftp-site?
2008-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	yes, from the system, admin, hard drivers
2008-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	no, if you want the latest, use the envyng-gtk app
2008-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	it says that there are not special drivers needed f√ºr my system :-S
2008-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	ok, so just go with envyng
2008-06-30T02:39:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	its not in the repos? cant get it with apt-get ... so its some special script?
2008-06-30T02:40:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	wthell is universe? :D kk letme do some google-homework :D
2008-06-30T02:41:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	okay it seems to be one of the four main-repos
2008-06-30T02:43:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	okay thx... it seems i also have the univsere repo activated but i cant find the packet in a search via synaptic?
2008-06-30T02:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	from the terminal: apt-cache search envyng-gtk
2008-06-30T02:44:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	so the apt-get manager does not give me the same search-results as the synaptic? :( ok thx for that hint
2008-06-30T02:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	it does, i am just driving to the terminal to prevent any gui usage mistake :P
2008-06-30T02:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	you didn't update your package info after enabling the repository
2008-06-30T02:46:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	i did a apt-get update
2008-06-30T02:46:00.000Z	eftex	joaopinto	 and the repo was allready active
2008-06-30T02:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	eftex	so, you do not have the universe repository properly set
