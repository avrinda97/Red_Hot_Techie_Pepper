2008-11-11T18:48:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkestSoul	using the 173, though 177 is now recommended
2008-11-11T18:48:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: system freezes with 173 and 177
2008-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkestSoul	you sure it is the driver? seems it might be something else
2008-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: without any driver it works, but my graphic sucks
2008-11-11T18:50:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkestSoul	using compiz or not
2008-11-11T18:51:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: no

2008-11-11T18:52:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: restarting the computer
2008-11-11T18:52:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkestSoul	the only time it freezes is when you restart the computer? no other times?
2008-11-11T18:53:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: random freeze ... sometimes right after restart and sometimes later (like now)
2008-11-11T19:07:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: you said you have ibex 8,10 and geforce 7300 gs , too ?

2008-11-11T19:14:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	bazhang	: which driver do you use and how hot is your card?
2008-11-11T19:15:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkestSoul	its the 173; 177 is recommended now but I have not switched yet-->not hot afaik
