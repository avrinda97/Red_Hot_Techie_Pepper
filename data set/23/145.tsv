2012-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		!info  handbrake
2012-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		installed handbrake here the other day 12.04 with no issues
2012-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	LiquidEdge	dr_willis	Which ppa did you use?
2012-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		no idea LiquidEdge
2012-05-25T08:14:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		I tried the gtk one and that's when I got that error.
2012-05-25T08:14:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		I didn't use a ppa, came straight from the deb file
2012-05-25T08:14:00.000Z	dr_willis		i just rcall being annoyed that they still use the name 'ghb' for  the actual binary ;)  this is 2012  we can handle descripttive names..
2012-05-25T08:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiquidEdge	 you installed the  .deb how exactly?
2012-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		I dunno.  I double clicked on it and it opened the software center then I got that message.
2012-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	dr_willis		gdebi foo.deb    will install all needed deps. ;)
2012-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		Because the ppa didn't work, either.
2012-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		And #handbrake seems to only people in there if they're willing to idle.
2012-05-25T08:16:00.000Z	dr_willis		seems i used the stebbins ppa for handbrake
2012-05-25T08:16:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		I'm getting 404 on the stebbins ppa
2012-05-25T08:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiquidEdge	 worked for me like 3 days ago
2012-05-25T08:17:00.000Z	dr_willis		there are ppa search tools
2012-05-25T08:17:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		Anyone know of a better conversion client?
2012-05-25T08:17:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		That's GUI so my wife can use it.
2012-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis		theres tone of ways to convert stuff
2012-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		Just kidding, I need GUI.  I suck.
2012-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis		depends on the  details
2012-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		Just converting mts to avi
2012-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	LiquidEdge	 try arista, or winff
