2008-05-08T01:26:00.000Z	ejer		do others notice xorg using way more resources than in previous ubuntu versions
2008-05-08T01:26:00.000Z	ejer		my xorg uses constant 10% cpu no matter what
2008-05-08T01:27:00.000Z	ek	ejer	What CPU?
2008-05-08T01:27:00.000Z	ejer	ek	the third one : ) what do you mean what cpu
2008-05-08T01:27:00.000Z	ek	ejer	What type. Sorry. Should have been more specific.
2008-05-08T01:27:00.000Z	ejer	ek	core2quad
2008-05-08T01:28:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Hrm. Haven't seen anything like that at all.
2008-05-08T01:28:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Is this a fresh install, an updated version, etc...?
2008-05-08T01:29:00.000Z	ejer	ek	i have seen quite a few mentions, but it gets passed off as something eventually, I think there is a bug here. I am an experienced user... for your Q this was a fresh install of official release
2008-05-08T01:30:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Hrm. That is strange. Not sure why it would use so much CPU at idle. What is it specifically that is using the 10%? Xorg itself?
2008-05-08T01:30:00.000Z	ejer	ek	yep : 6559 root      20   0  563m 107m  21m R   19  1.3 140:57.11 Xorg (using 20% there)
2008-05-08T01:31:00.000Z	ejer	ek	it fluctuates ebtween 10-20% just idling
2008-05-08T01:31:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Hrm. That's poopy. Just out of curiousity, have you tried other variants of your video card's drivers?
2008-05-08T01:31:00.000Z	ek	ejer	IE: Tried the VESA driver and such?
2008-05-08T01:31:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Could be a problem with that.
2008-05-08T01:31:00.000Z	ejer	ek	nvidia 8500 using newest nvidia drivers, but yeah I have tried nv
2008-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	ejer	ek	i have seen posts in our lug on same subject... but very hard to track down what is going on
2008-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Yeah. I wouldn't think it would work any better. Figured it would be worth a shot.
2008-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Might need to take this to the forums or mailing lists.
2008-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Chances of getting help in this bloated channel is slim to none. :P
2008-05-08T01:37:00.000Z	ek	ejer	However, I wouldn't give up on finding out what is causing the CPU usage.
2008-05-08T01:37:00.000Z	ejer	ek	I won't I am stubborn
2008-05-08T01:37:00.000Z	ek	ejer	Chances are you can get it down to 0-1 if you find out what it is. :P
