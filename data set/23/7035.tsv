2005-11-03T09:17:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list onto paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-11-03T09:19:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	its posted...i think this is the link: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3775
2005-11-03T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	please ''sudo aptitude update''
2005-11-03T09:23:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	i did it and tried to install and i'm getting the same error

2005-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3776
2005-11-03T09:28:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	what's the error from ''sudo aptitude install libc6-dev''?
2005-11-03T09:31:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3777
2005-11-03T09:35:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	I think I installed a newer version of libc6 for engage or eutils or some e17 related app...I think it was from a debian repo
2005-11-03T09:35:00.000Z	jmoney	crimsun	is this causing the broken package?
2005-11-03T09:35:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	ouch, you'll have to forcibly downgrade libc6 then
2005-11-03T09:35:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	absolutely.
2005-11-03T09:36:00.000Z	crimsun	jmoney	that's the danger of using non-Ubuntu repos
