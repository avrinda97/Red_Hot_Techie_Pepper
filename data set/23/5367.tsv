2006-12-14T06:33:00.000Z	iltomee	jrib	yeah, probably i did, i installed ubuntu 4 the 1. time a couple of month ago, and i was just messing around :(

2006-12-14T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	iltomee	ok, lets see if we can get to the root of the problem, join me in #ubuntu-classroom and we'll try a few commands

2007-03-29T16:20:00.000Z	iltomee	jrib	ok, sorry, found it before the posts... it was stupid to ask...
