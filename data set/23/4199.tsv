2008-06-03T04:42:00.000Z	Gohalien		when I burn a dvd with brasero, at 99% it give me an error, it burns it ok, i checked also in another computer the dvd and all data is ok, I just missed the copy/paste of the error, any idea what can it be ?
2008-06-03T04:43:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	Must be the closing session part on your burning process
2008-06-03T04:46:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I am sure that is the problem, but I have no idea how to solve it
2008-06-03T04:46:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	try to wait for it to finish... takes a while specially if its dvd...
2008-06-03T04:48:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I wait until it is finished, the error pops up, I will burn one now to show you
2008-06-03T04:58:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	burning now ^^ i set it up to leave the session open
2008-06-03T04:58:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I will tell you in a few mins if error
2008-06-03T04:59:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	 Okay...
2008-06-03T05:00:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I really dont think it is the cd burner rom, it is new it burns it ok, brasero just doesn't close it
2008-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	without closing the session, the dvd burns with no error
2008-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	try burning some stuff in windows if it closes ok
2008-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	Honestly, i dont trust brasero Lol
2008-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I burned a dvd in windows and closed the dvd with no problem
2008-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	It is a brasero issue for sure
2008-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	I wish i can help you more... but maybe somebody else can help you on why brasero is not closing your session properly...
2008-06-03T05:32:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	there is another cd burner ?
2008-06-03T05:33:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	i just use brasero, and when it messed up burning tinyxp installer at x1, i decided to burn stuff from windows (ubuntu and xubuntu boot disks) :)
2008-06-03T05:34:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	is sad to know there are not many options to burn dvd from linux, I will try K3b
2008-06-03T05:34:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	good luck, keep us posted if its any better than brasero
2008-06-03T05:35:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I wont install it, it is asking for a lot of kde libs that I dont want to install
2008-06-03T05:36:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	any idea where logs are saved in brasero ?
2008-06-03T05:36:00.000Z	nantax	Gohalien	sorry mate i don't know
2008-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Gohalien	nantax	I will try gnomebaker
