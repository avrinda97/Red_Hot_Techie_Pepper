2009-04-02T04:55:00.000Z	Roasted		Is there network cloning software for Ubuntu? Like with Ghost/Windows, but with Ubuntu with the same capabilities that Ghost has?
2009-04-02T04:55:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	G4L.  Ghost4Linux
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Roasted	infomomo	- I spent 4 months trying to get clonezilla right. That product doesnt do the job like I thought it would.
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	Ghost4Linux.
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	just google 'g4l' and you'll find it
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - all right, I'll try that. Is that an open so urce product that has a decent userbase? like with a forum and all?
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Huufarted		yes, Roasted.
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - have you used it?
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Huufarted		Not much to talk about, though.  It does its work well
2009-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	yes.
2009-04-02T04:57:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - have you used clonezilla server?
2009-04-02T04:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	took a 160 GB Laptop HDD dual boot with Windows, moved it to a 500 GB drive, removed the NTFS, moved the Ext3, moved the SWAP part, extended my /home part and it worked PERFECTLY.
2009-04-02T04:57:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - with G4L or CZ Server?
2009-04-02T04:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	G4L
2009-04-02T04:58:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - good stuff. Does G4L support windows at all, or is it linux only?
2009-04-02T04:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	it uses 'dd' so it works on ANY partition.  It moves byte-for-byte.  Doesn't care what partition.
2009-04-02T04:58:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - good stuff. Have you used FOG?
2009-04-02T04:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	sorry.  never heard of it.
2009-04-02T04:59:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - check it out. Open source, free, runs on top of Ubuntu... I have been using ita t work and it works so great, I'm so thankful that I found it. It's primarily gauged towards educational and government purposes, which is up my alley since Im a tech @ a school district. Only thing is, it's geared more for Windows workstations, even though it's linux based. But I got to thinking, if FOG works great with Ubuntu (as the server)
2009-04-02T04:59:00.000Z	Roasted		 and Windows (as the clients), what would happen if I had 1800 Ubuntu machines instead of 1800 XP machines? Hence my question...
2009-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	 You haven't said what it does.
2009-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	Roasted		huufarted - just like Ghost, man.
2009-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	Huufarted	Roasted	gotcha.
