2011-05-14T10:35:00.000Z	kaynos		or just what's in ubuntu folder?
2011-05-14T10:36:00.000Z	kaynos		drive is empty otherwise
2011-05-14T10:36:00.000Z	kaynos		had 600gb of data on drive..
2011-05-14T10:37:00.000Z	kaynos		os was on different drive.. seems fine..
2011-05-14T10:37:00.000Z	kaynos		this was data only drive
2011-05-14T10:38:00.000Z	kaynos		ok.  well there must be a bug.
2011-05-14T10:38:00.000Z	kaynos		drive is empty except for 10gb or so in ubuntu folder
2011-05-14T10:40:00.000Z	kaynos		Ubuntu installed and worked great.  When I booted back into Windows 7, D drive was empty except for a single ubuntu folder.
2011-05-14T10:41:00.000Z	kaynos		to wipe a drive?
2011-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	kaynos		no actually, but first attempt at installing inside windows on ntfs partition..
2011-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaynos	drive D is where ubuntu go installed to, and I'm sure you wiped the drive to do so
2011-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaynos	thats why wubi is generally a BAD idea
2011-05-14T10:43:00.000Z	syrinx_		and if the drive *became* ext, you lost everything
2011-05-14T10:43:00.000Z	kaynos		it's still readable by windows.  has ubuntu/disks/.fuse_hidden00000blah..  10gb file
2011-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	kaynos		however, the rest of my data is missing.. gone..
2011-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	kaynos		which obviosuly was unexpected.
2011-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	kaynos		so much for windows install like a program, safe..
2011-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	kaynos		sure.. that worked fine.. ubuntu still boots, but it deleted the rest of the partition.
2011-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	kaynos		data wise
2011-05-14T10:46:00.000Z	kaynos		hehe..  nice guys..  I've learned nothing except that ubuntu is false advertising wubi..
2011-05-14T10:46:00.000Z	kaynos	quick	that's what I thought..
2011-05-14T10:46:00.000Z	kaynos		except in practice doesn't do that..
2011-05-14T10:46:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaynos	or run the livecd/usb for a while
