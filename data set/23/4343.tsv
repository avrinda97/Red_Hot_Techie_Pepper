2009-12-12T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	well did you check if the uuid's changed?
2009-12-12T19:48:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	the UUID's for / were simply missing
2009-12-12T19:48:00.000Z	BeerSerc		no uuid at all
2009-12-12T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	how did you ascertain that?
2009-12-12T19:50:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/
2009-12-12T19:50:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	have you set one now?
2009-12-12T19:50:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	both systems have 3 partitions, and in both cases there was none for root anymore
2009-12-12T19:50:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	nope, I changed grub's setup to use /dev/sda1 again
2009-12-12T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	does blkid also not return a uuid for /@
2009-12-12T19:52:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	I dont live where those pc's are, so I cannot tell you, and I think by now, theres an UUID again in /dev/disk, but it wasnt there once, so the system did not boot at all
2009-12-12T19:53:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	have you checked bugs.ubuntu.com ?
2009-12-12T19:53:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	that is, even after rebooting several times ....
2009-12-12T19:53:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	I googled it
2009-12-12T19:54:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	I can also try and see if its on bugs.ubuntu.com, but even if it is, I have never seen a bug fixed there, it's always: "wait for next release" and marked fixed ...
2009-12-12T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	that's generally how stable releases work unless it's a major bug or security issue
2009-12-12T19:55:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	aye, but not booting is only stable or major if you have a very interesting definition of stable and major ...
2009-12-12T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	I was merely responding to your comment about bugs in general
2009-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	I know. I also see that it has to be like that in some cases, for stable releases. but I have seen a lot of people revert to windows after an standard upgrade broke their wpa on ubuntu on eees, and it wasnt fixed. so the regression was an update, but no update to fix it?
2009-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	BeerSerc		for example
2009-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	I don't know the specifics, but most of the time a kernel update breaks something it's because users built the drivers themselves instead of using the repositories
2009-12-12T19:58:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	anyway, I would check if the disk actually has a uuid or not so you can know if the issue is that the uuid got blanked somehow or the disk had the uuid but the kernel couldn't find it by uuid for some reason
2009-12-12T19:59:00.000Z	BeerSerc	jrib	I will do so when I am home next time. but nevertheless, it's quite shining a very bad light on linux for outsiders and ubuntu for insiders imho, that 2 different systems died the same way within weeks, on a stable distribution...
2009-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	BeerSerc	bugs happen, all you can do is fix them and move on
