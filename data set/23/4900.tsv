2010-01-24T12:27:00.000Z	drazak		Hello there, I'm running 9.10 with linux-server on a 32bit machine and have 4 gig of memory installed, PAE and HIGHMEM64G are definitely on, any idea why I still cannot access the last gig of memory?
2010-01-24T12:28:00.000Z	drazak		I see all 4gig of memory in the bios
2010-01-24T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 some of the memory is resergved for the hardware to use - if i recall corrctly.
2010-01-24T12:30:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	that's rediculous, even with the 128 for video there should be another 894 meg floating around
2010-01-24T12:30:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	that's a hell of a lot to go missing
2010-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 ive read up on this topic befor. so im not sure where it all goes.. but SOME is defaintly taken/reserved for hardware
2010-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	so have I, and I have a machine in the other room where I have 3.75gb
2010-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 all ic an say is that it could be due to bios's not being set up to allow for the larger ram
2010-01-24T12:33:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	I checked around in there, didn't see anything
2010-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 ive seen lots of articals on it. but it also depends on the different OS's .  heres one mentining windows that enabled 3gb of 'user mode memory'  but ive no idea on how pae/highmem affects things.
2010-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 i did see some benchmakrs on 64bit vs 32bit + PAE and so on.. i think their summary was 'use 64bit' at the end
2010-01-24T12:35:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	except I can't use a 64 bit kernel with 32bit hardware, I assume
2010-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 this 'part of the 4gb reserved; i think is why a few yrs back many windows machines did not bother with 4gb but stopped at 3gb. there was to much just getting lost.
2010-01-24T12:37:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	so then the question is, can I run a 64bit kernel on 32bit hardware
2010-01-24T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 proberly not
2010-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 whats your exct cpu?
2010-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	Intel Core 2 T5600
2010-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	Hmm.. you SURE thats not a 64bit cpu?
2010-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 i was about to ask how old that thing is..  even my 4 yr old box is 64bit
2010-01-24T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 quote from the artical url i posted --> the Ubuntu 64-bit kernel that often ended up being leaps and bounds better than the 32-bit kernel.
2010-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	I'm going to switch to 64 bit
2010-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	drazak	Dr_Willis	I'm just wondering if there's a way to do it without burning another cd
2010-01-24T13:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drazak	 bios/hardware/reserved from what i gather.. sadly.   and yes ive seen others in here over the last few months with same issues.
