2005-09-16T12:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	it's a command-line app; try 'nc -h' for help
2005-10-10T14:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	please don't repeat yourself. it looks like it's in 'main'
2005-10-10T14:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	sorry, scrap that
2005-10-10T14:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	looks like i have an old version from marillat. maybe it's on hoary-extras?

2005-10-10T14:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	sorry, i barely remember installing it
2005-10-11T13:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	do you get an error message? if so, what is it?

2005-10-11T13:36:00.000Z	Cryptid	HappyFool	i used rm -d but it was useless
2005-10-11T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	you still haven't told us what you're trying to achieve ;)
2005-10-22T13:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	take a look here: http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/coasterless.htm  -- has some good tips on ripping/burning cds
2005-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	Cryptid	HappyFool	yes
2005-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	you mean upgrade a hoary to breezy?
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	Cryptid	HappyFool	do have an idea on how i can mount and .iso file as a cd-rom drive and use that drive to update hoary to breezy
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	oh, sorry
2005-11-04T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	to mount use 'mount -o loop filename.iso /mnt/cdrom' (/mnt/cdrom can be somewhere else)
2005-11-04T12:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	maybe it hasn't been created yet
2005-11-04T12:12:00.000Z	Cryptid	HappyFool	yes it does but only .tar.gz from and i dunno how to install them
2005-11-04T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	double click on the tar file in nautilus to look inside
2005-11-04T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	look for a file like 'README' or 'INSTALL' for instructions
2005-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	Cryptid	HappyFool	ok i will try searching for download managers
2005-11-04T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	Cryptid	tar xjf file.tar.bz2   (or xjvf)
