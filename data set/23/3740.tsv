2008-02-03T09:59:00.000Z	dhanar10	voice	what's your computer/laptop?
2008-02-03T09:59:00.000Z	voice		then i goes into the bootbox (or somehting like that)
2008-02-03T10:00:00.000Z	voice		i can list you the specs of my pc
2008-02-03T10:00:00.000Z	dhanar10		ok
2008-02-03T10:00:00.000Z	voice		intel e2140 proc, abit ip35 mobo (p35 chipset), 2gb ddr2 ram, 250gb harddrive
2008-02-03T10:04:00.000Z	dhanar10	voice	i think ur problem is related to the P35 chipset....
2008-02-03T10:04:00.000Z	voice		is there anything i can do to fix it?
2008-02-03T10:06:00.000Z	dhanar10	voice	try reading http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=597252
2008-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	voice		thanks dhanar10, but there doesn't seem to be anything on there that helps me
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		i suppose i could try setting my harddrive to ide, but i dont know how to set acpi=off, and apparently that isn't really a fix anyway
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	dhanar10	voice	ok, just be patient for now... wait for next release in april...
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		:(
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		but i really want to try ubuntu!
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		:P
2008-02-03T10:13:00.000Z	voice		i tried using the latest alpha of 8.04 too, and that started throwing errors at me
2008-02-03T10:13:00.000Z	dhanar10	voice	based on my experience, linux is always problematic with newer hardware....
