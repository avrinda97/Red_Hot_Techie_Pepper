2005-04-26T06:17:00.000Z	revelater	toresbe	yah, well ain't isn't supposedly a word and its in the dict
2005-04-26T06:17:00.000Z	toresbe	revelater	ain't is a word, and your example sucks :P
2005-04-26T06:18:00.000Z	revelater	toresbe	what about the hundreds of lingo words that they add on, not technically words, but they put them their with the most comon spelling, whether or not its correct.
2005-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	revelater	toresbe	3 years ago, when i first started using this nick, it wasn't in any dictionary, so i had first dibs anyways
2005-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	toresbe	revelater	well, then they attempt to standardize it. and "revalator" is most certainly not slang
