2006-09-24T14:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Not bad.  Pondering buying a spare computer and wondering about some components.
2006-09-24T14:20:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	got one here you can buy, what you looking for?
2006-09-24T14:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Something decently spec'd but under $150.
2006-09-24T14:21:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	^
2006-09-24T14:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	At least 256MB RAM, 512 preferred, >1GHz processor, >20G hard drive or so.
2006-09-24T14:24:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	all but the processor I ave
2006-09-24T14:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Possibly intriguing.  Feel free to link to, e-mail, or ##tonyyarusso details and/or pics and I'll add it to those I'm considering.
2006-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	nothing much to look at, ill give you the specs
2006-09-24T14:30:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	really the last line of whT i pasted is the important stuff
2006-09-24T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	All right, I'll save that and get back to you.  Thanks.  (btw, any idea on shipping if I were to get it?)  What do you think you'd be asking for it?
2006-09-24T14:34:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	tell me in there your zip code, and Ill get you a price,
2006-09-24T14:47:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	let me know if you dont get that email
2006-09-24T14:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	It's here.
2006-09-25T16:10:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	probably wants all the config files backed up too
2006-09-27T09:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Hey.
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	do you know how I would go about setting up 1 nic so that it doesnt listen to any ports, but the other one does?
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Can't say I do.
2006-09-27T09:15:00.000Z	Arrick	tonyyarusso	what I am trying to do, ist set up this ubuntu box so that all incoming and outgoing on one connection is allowed (network side) and all incoming from the other is blocked except what i specify (internet side)
2006-09-27T09:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Makes sense, and a good idea.  If you work it out, a wiki page on the subject would be good (I assume you've already checked for one).  Good luck!
2007-04-06T05:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Arrick	Been busy, but okay.  -offtopic?
