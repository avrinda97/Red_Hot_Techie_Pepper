2005-06-25T07:01:00.000Z	djjason		has anyone heard of this problem I am having on my laptop running hoary, after some X amount of time running on battery (this never happens when on AC) the computer freezes...so completly that I have to shut it down....usually this happens when I am using the touchpad
2005-06-25T07:02:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	acpi standby locks my laptop up since I installed the fglrx driver
2005-06-25T07:04:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	really.....I recently also installed fglrx
2005-06-25T07:05:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	have you solved the problem by removing it or?
2005-06-25T07:05:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	your touchpad may not be queried by acpi properly and you system goes into standby, thus locking it
2005-06-25T07:05:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	no, I disabled standby
2005-06-25T07:06:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	how would I go about fixing that...do you know?
2005-06-25T07:06:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	at 1920x1200 resolutions the binary drivers make a big difference, it was a trade off
2005-06-25T07:07:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	I see..
2005-06-25T07:07:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	I'm hear that acpi standby/suspend won't work with the binary drivers
2005-06-25T07:08:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	well I aint using the driver now its just installed
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	xorg isn't configured for it?
2005-06-25T07:11:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	no I dont think so
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	'cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep fglrx' will tell you
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	if not configured then that command will return nothing
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	yeah ...nothing
2005-06-25T07:15:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	does it happen when your machine is left idle too or just when using touchpad?
2005-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	it only happens when I am on battery.....and It happens while I am working on it......all of a sudden it freezes completle...the hdd lights it lid constantly and I have to brutaly shut it down
2005-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	I'd say that acpi would be an obvious culprit
2005-06-25T07:20:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	do you have any other battery monitor tools installed?
2005-06-25T07:20:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	nope....nothing extra
2005-06-25T07:22:00.000Z	anto9us	djjason	what's the make and model of your laptop?
2005-06-25T07:22:00.000Z	djjason	anto9us	Compaq X1000
