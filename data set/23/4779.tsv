2009-04-29T05:30:00.000Z	dylnuge		Writing this from a LiveCD. 9.04 upgrade got very messed up, I was having problems so I'm going to reinstall. Before I do that I was trying to copy stuff from my /home partition onto a server on my network as a backup. I've mounted the partition and everything, but for whatever reason, whenever I try to copy, I get an access error about some of the folders in my home directory. ls -l doesn't show them as having any properties different from the oth
2009-04-29T05:30:00.000Z	dylnuge		ers, any idea why I can't copy them all?
2009-04-29T05:32:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	try as root?
2009-04-29T05:33:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	Yeah, I tried running nautilus as root, didn't help. I would use cp from the terminal with sudo, but I don't know how to reference this folder right: smb://hd-hlan021/share/homeCopy
2009-04-29T05:34:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	odd.  Could you scp in the files over instead than using smb?
2009-04-29T05:35:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	How do I do that?
2009-04-29T05:35:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	what os is the server running?
2009-04-29T05:36:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	It's a shared hard drive type device, not really sure.
2009-04-29T05:36:00.000Z	dylnuge		!audio
2009-04-29T05:37:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	no then, if you don't have access to set it up, scp won't work unless a ssh-server is already running on the server.  Have you tried using something other than gnome/nautilus?
2009-04-29T05:37:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	understandibly that is harder from a livecd
2009-04-29T05:37:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	Nope. Like I said, I was considering using "sudo cp -r /home/dnugent smb://hd-hlan021/share/homeCopy" but I don't think smb://... is a directory.
2009-04-29T05:38:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	but if the computer does allow ssh, the command is scp -r path/to/files/* username@ip:path/to/location/on/server
2009-04-29T05:38:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	yes smb:// wouldn't help you.
2009-04-29T05:39:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	Is there a way to mount the network drive then?
2009-04-29T05:39:00.000Z	jdu		Does anyone know if samba shares are mounted anywhere particularly?
2009-04-29T05:39:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	depends on what the server is running.  I have one that provides nfs, which is designed to be mounted as if it is a local filesystem.
2009-04-29T05:40:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	unfortunately, my experience is limited with samba
2009-04-29T05:40:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	No problem, thanks for your help. Theoretically, if I reinstall I don't need to reformat or install over the /home partition anyway, right?
2009-04-29T05:41:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	correct
2009-04-29T05:41:00.000Z	jdu	dylnuge	just install over / and then add /home in /etc/fstab
2009-04-29T05:41:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	Thanks. I'm going to go ahead and copy what I can. Not sure why some of the files and folders don't want to copy though.
2009-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	dylnuge	jdu	So do I need to instruct the installer to place /home anywhere else, or just replace the fstab and let it put home with / for the time being?
