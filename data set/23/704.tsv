2011-03-23T16:22:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	"Mount as" <-
2011-03-23T16:25:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	go back into the partition edit screen and choose the mount point
2011-03-23T16:26:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	You seem to have skipped this step
2011-03-23T16:28:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	: i made a partition as ext4 from the partition program witch i cant recall the name, its on the live cd
2011-03-23T16:28:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	then i reentered the installation and i am getting the same message
2011-03-23T16:28:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	Yes, and in the same dialog box that you tell it the File System type is a box to enter the MOUNT POINT
2011-03-23T16:28:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	This is essential.  Go back and fill it in
2011-03-23T16:29:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	whats the mount point?
2011-03-23T16:30:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	"/"

2011-03-23T16:31:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	It's right there
2011-03-23T16:31:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	: oh i see, so i need to add a "/"
2011-03-23T16:32:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	You need to tell Ubuntu to USE it and at what point in the filesystem to mount it.
2011-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	on the gparted i want to create a swap partition, am i creating a partition and then changing its file system to linux-swap?
2011-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	When you create the partition you tell it the type.  Yuo don't do it as A and then change it to B after
2011-03-23T17:00:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	: something last, what's the "/" i added and does the partition i created as linux-swap gonna be for the purpose of swap or i did something wrong?
2011-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	blackguard-	"/" means that partition is the base of your OS install, and there is no mount point for linux-swap.
2011-03-23T17:05:00.000Z	blackguard-	[TK]D-Fender	thanks alot man
