2011-05-08T00:06:00.000Z	LinuxFetus		Can anyone tell me where I should go for Fake RAID help?  I'm guessing from the lack of response here that no one knows how to help me.  I restored the Windows MBR and cannot use Linux on my computer until I get this figured out.
2011-05-08T00:06:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	Is it one provided by the bios ?
2011-05-08T00:07:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	I believe so.  There are RAID configuration options provided in the BIOS setup.
2011-05-08T00:07:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	And what does Linux see?
2011-05-08T00:09:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	Linux sees the 3 partitions the windowss computer came with (OS, and two recovery partitions) when Ubuntu 11.04 boots up.  However, when I try to resize the OS partition, make an extended partition and then two partitions - ext4 and swap - and then install Ubuntu, I get a grub error upon restart and booting from the live CD will show that my extended partition is completely gone.
2011-05-08T00:10:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	Additionally, if I only create the two partitions and restart without installing ubuntu and boot again fro mthe live CD, I get a magic number error on the ext4 partition.
2011-05-08T00:10:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	Have you tried doing the partitioning from Windows?
2011-05-08T00:10:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	No.
2011-05-08T00:10:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	The fact that Linux can see the partitions is a good sign I think
2011-05-08T00:11:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	I know linux cannot resize its own partition from within itself.  Could windows do that?
2011-05-08T00:11:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	Well maybe linux can, but I've never been able to do tha.t
2011-05-08T00:12:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	I think there are tools on Windows but I'm not a windows guy, so just go back a step - remind me what partitions you currently have?
2011-05-08T00:12:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	two restore partitions, one windows os partition, one extended partition which has two partitions: an ext4 one and a linux swap one.
2011-05-08T00:13:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	OK - that's your current state?
2011-05-08T00:15:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	No. I didn't recieve a useful reply from anyone here after a few times last night and 2 this morning, so I went ahead and used ms-sys to restore the Windows MBR and started restoring my computer to factory settings.  When that's done, I can try to re-setup the extended parition again.  However, even when those two partitions were setup, the ext4 one had an error, like I described.
2011-05-08T00:16:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	OK, so after you've done this factory restor what will you have - the restore partition and the windows partition?
2011-05-08T00:16:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	I'm not sure if windows will resize my OS partition to overwrite the ext4 and swap partitions, or not.
2011-05-08T00:18:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	Hmm OK; so I'd make one partition change at a time and check it's happy - you might also want to check what dmraid in linux says, I think it should be able to tell you LInux's view of the fake reaid
2011-05-08T00:19:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	I did make 1 partition change at a time while I was doing that.  But it's still "configuring my desktop."  I suspect it has less than 5 minutes left since I've done this before.
2011-05-08T00:20:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	I have heard of the dmraid package.  What exactly do you mean to check what it says?  Read the documentation online or something?
2011-05-08T00:20:00.000Z	penguin42	LinuxFetus	There is a command dmraid and I think it can tell you about the configuration of fake raid
2011-05-08T00:23:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	Yes, it looks like Windows removed the extended partition because the C:\ drive is 1.35 TB again.
2011-05-08T00:23:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	penguin42	Did you want me to "man dmraid"
