2010-07-06T07:57:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	you mean delete the operating system? run a livecd on boot.. run gparted and delete the partition
2010-07-06T07:58:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	yes
2010-07-06T07:58:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	run the livecd.. then go to gparted under applications and just delete the partition
2010-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	i dont have partitions
2010-07-06T08:00:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	...... you HAVE to have at least the main partition and the swap lol
2010-07-06T08:00:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	the hard drive itself is a partition.. a single one with a separate swap partition
2010-07-06T08:01:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	i know that i can't run and install vista
2010-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	you want to dual boot? i recommend 7 not vista..
2010-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	thanks but how
2010-07-06T08:03:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	you have to resize your partition and then set up a separate partition for vista
2010-07-06T08:04:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	my pc is a ubuntu based pc and i have no, partitions ..... and i want to install 7
2010-07-06T08:05:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	yes i thought that it was.. you have to go into gparted and resize the partition.. your computer has to have one partition on the hard drive. otherwise it would not allow installing of ubuntu..
2010-07-06T08:05:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	you have an ext3 partition.. hyou need to make one that is itfs
2010-07-06T08:06:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	i mean ntfs
2010-07-06T08:07:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	if you are wanting 7 to run certain programs why not try Wine or Wine-Doors
2010-07-06T08:07:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	you could also just look for an alternative program to the windows oneyou want
2010-07-06T08:08:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	i know about wine but what is wine-doors
2010-07-06T08:09:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	is there any way to install 64bit using a 32 bit ubuntu
2010-07-06T08:09:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	winedoors is a more gui based wine.. has some single click installation such as for running WoW (i dont play it myself) or things that are dependant on windows applications
2010-07-06T08:09:00.000Z	sean-laptop	muni	i have no clue. i own nothing with 64 bit architecture
2010-07-06T08:10:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	can i report my prblm
2010-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	muni	sean-laptop	no that's the problem its not loading when i restart my pc
