2012-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	maxflax		strange thing.. my computer wont start but I can log into it with ssh.. but I see nothing in the dmesg logs and so on.. but I can clearly see on the tv that its trying to start up
2012-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	basically your video output isn't reaching the tv.. probably it can't get the resolutions for X from the tv
2012-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	it's something else aswell... but I can't see crap in the logs.. very frustrating
2012-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	well, if the x server can't get resolutions, you would ONLY see it in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log (or whatever)
2012-09-23T06:04:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	have looked in Xorg log file.. what should I be looking for telling me it's like your stating?
2012-09-23T06:04:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	fling it up on pastie or pastebot or.. someplace
2012-09-23T06:07:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	here is the log http://pastebin.com/q95xv0aH
2012-09-23T06:08:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	danke.. let me take a look see
2012-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	I am curious.. if you boot using a live cd/iso .. do you get a picture ?
2012-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	did you also terminate the X server perchance in that logfile or is the machine still running ?
2012-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	it's running
2012-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	then google that last line ; ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log
2012-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	I would try a live cd/iso of ubuntu next, as that defaults to REALLY very safe defaults
2012-09-23T06:15:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	Got this problem after a update i did before.. rebooted and this happend. Wondering if it has something to do with me having a autologin program running.. can't remember what the name was though
2012-09-23T08:11:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	Solved it.. *sign* finally
2012-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	what was it ?
2012-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	sorry, I was away in xen hell :D
2012-09-23T08:36:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	found the problem  in my xsesssion-errors - Was a missing opengl file.. libGLEW 1.5 I think.. the update must have removed that thinking it was something useless
2012-09-23T08:37:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	that's.. beyond.. huh ?!
2012-09-23T08:37:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	yeah.. I know
2012-09-23T08:38:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	I don't even know what libglew -is- .. and I have done xlib programming! sheesh
2012-09-23T08:39:00.000Z	maxflax	zodiak	it's something xbmc uses anyway.. was on my htpc this problem arised
2012-09-23T08:40:00.000Z	zodiak	maxflax	well.. good to 'know' I guess. glad you got it sorted.
