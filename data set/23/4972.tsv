2007-05-12T13:48:00.000Z	Huffalump		How do I access a shared folder?  On one Ubuntu box, I set a folder to be shared (NFS).  On another Ubuntu box, I went to Places > Network... but there was no listing of the shared folder.
2007-05-12T13:50:00.000Z	Huffalump		How do I access a shared folder from another Ubuntu computer on the LAN?  Both are Ubuntu.  One has a folder shared on NFS for my IP.  But I cannot figure out how to see it.
2007-05-12T13:51:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	try entering smb://<ip> in nautilus's address bar
2007-05-12T13:53:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	I'll keep that in mind for smb, thanks!
2007-05-12T13:55:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	refer to the samba section at ubuntuguide.org
2007-05-12T13:56:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	I'll go read that now in hopes Samba is easier.  I had no idea it would be such a complex task.
2007-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	both/all computers need to install samba in order for it to work?  Not just the "server"?
2007-05-12T14:00:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	only the server needs samba.. samba client is built into nautilus
2007-05-12T14:00:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	its actually very easy.. once you read up ubuntuguide :)
2007-05-12T14:04:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	easy is a relative thing :] 
2007-05-12T14:04:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	hehe yeah.. just try it out.. and come back if you face any issues :)
2007-05-12T14:06:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	the server's ip is 0.0.0.0?
2007-05-12T14:07:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	for illustrative purposes... yes.  It's a LAN ip (192.x.x.x)
2007-05-12T14:07:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	hmm.. just try smb://0.0.0.0
2007-05-12T14:09:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	if I do it  as smb://x.x.x.x/ the nothing happens at all (no feedback)
2007-05-12T14:09:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	just verified the machines can ping one another.
2007-05-12T14:10:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	try issuing sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart on the server
2007-05-12T14:11:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	and make sure that no firewall is blocking smb on the server
2007-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	same results (sharename results in "could not be displayed" and without is no feedback)
2007-05-12T14:13:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	did you add a samba user, following ubuntuguide?
2007-05-12T14:13:00.000Z	Huffalump	kalpik	no I didn't see that.  Here's what I read -> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_share_folders_the_easy_way (which does not mention anyting about Samba users)
2007-05-12T14:15:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	follow http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_install_Samba_Server_for_files.2Ffolders_sharing_service
2007-05-12T14:20:00.000Z	kalpik	Huffalump	sure! Do try it out though! :)
