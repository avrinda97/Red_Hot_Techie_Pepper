2006-04-15T07:21:00.000Z	GotUbuntued		 ....i'm not seeing that file
2006-04-15T05:14:00.000Z	GotUbuntued		Please help. I've install the latest jre1.5.0_06 and firefox 1.5.0.1 and linked the plugins. Why does'nt firefox show java ? Just says "install plugin"
2006-04-15T05:15:00.000Z	holycow	GotUbuntued	because either you didn't install it right or didn't link it right.  did you check either of these variables?
2006-04-15T05:16:00.000Z	GotUbuntued	holycow	: I've check the firefox plugin directory. The java files are there. Any idea?
2006-04-15T05:16:00.000Z	holycow	GotUbuntued	well symlinks might be there, do they actually point to the right dir?  are theere any files in the dir they are pointing to? are they pointing to correctly named files?
2006-04-15T05:17:00.000Z	GotUbuntued	holycow	: And how do I check it? I'm sure that they link to the right dir
2006-04-15T05:17:00.000Z	holycow	GotUbuntued	symlinks are the right way to do it, but you can copy/paste the files directly to the firefox plugins dir
2006-04-15T05:18:00.000Z	GotUbuntued	holycow	: how do I do it because I can't do it in the file browser because of the permissions
2006-04-15T05:18:00.000Z	holycow	GotUbuntued	i'm a wee bit tired to run you through the details of that ...  backtrack your steps as per wiki, you will need to know a bit of command line stuff to do so
