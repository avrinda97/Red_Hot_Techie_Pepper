2007-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	if you are looking for block devices then it is "mount" if you are looking for pci devices, then its "lspci" if you are looking for usbdevs "lsusb" HTH
2007-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	or are you looking for "ls -l /dev" ?
2007-06-05T15:18:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Spliffster	no, something beginning with cat
2007-06-05T15:19:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Spliffster	any way you can think of using it to get the devices output then?
2007-06-05T15:20:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	cat /dev/random # for example ... but this doesn't do anything usefull
2007-06-05T15:20:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Spliffster	found it : "cat /proc/bus/input/devices"
2007-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Spliffster	sorry, it doesn't give the path in /dev
2007-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	great :)
2007-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Spliffster	but still that is what I was looking for :P
2007-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	also check out "lspci"
2007-06-05T15:32:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	unless oyu have vmware-tools in the vm instaled, the mouse is slow
2007-06-05T15:33:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	that's the problem
2007-06-05T15:35:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	you must do it while the guest is running!
2007-06-05T16:30:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	if your feisty desktop runs in a vmware vm, then install vmware toosl, the'll adjust the screen automaticly trough their vid driver
2007-06-05T16:32:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	oh, then install vmware tols in the windows guest, it will automaticly adjus the windows screen size to your vm window size
2007-06-05T16:33:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	there should be another option (assuming you have arecent vmware version)
2007-06-05T16:33:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	i am sure it works that way, doing it here. but you _must install_ vmware tools in the guest
2007-06-05T16:35:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	do you want to adjust the local xservers resolution or the resolution of a guest os ?
2007-06-05T16:36:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	are you running vmware server 1.0.2 and have vmware tools installed (and running) in your windows guest?
2007-06-05T16:37:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	if you then select "autofit guest" in View (vmware console) windows screensize should be adjusted to the guest's windows size. if not, it's a bug or misconfiguration.
2007-06-05T16:41:00.000Z	Spliffster	aMMuNix	"auto fit window" is off here "autofit guest" is on.
