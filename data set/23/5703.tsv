2006-10-03T15:19:00.000Z	odyssevs		Greetings chaps. Small problem here with the Ubuntu server - have set up dhcp3-server and configured it properly, along with /etc/network/interfaces. Clients are being issued a dhcp IP.
2006-10-03T15:20:00.000Z	odyssevs		I've also run my usual iptables firewall script... to allow the clients to access the internet. However the only programme on any of the clients which connects is Skype. Nothing else. Any clues?
2006-10-03T15:20:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	check to ensure the script is dfoing what you think it should be doing?
2006-10-03T15:21:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	well now, in 3 years on a Debian server it hasn't let me down..
2006-10-03T15:21:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	ok, then don't.
2006-10-03T15:22:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	sorry, getting swamped here
2006-10-03T15:22:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	no no, this is in meatspace
2006-10-03T15:25:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	right, perhaps it's time to investigate the iptables.. is there a config or source or soemthing with a vanilla ubuntu server install which I can examine?
2006-10-03T15:26:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	you should be able to pick apart the iptables .deb and get the vanilla conf.
2006-10-07T10:03:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	GRUB didn't do a runner. the NT bootloader overwrote it without prompting. that's what it does.
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	a little bit of skullduggery on MS's part. If I re-run the ubuntu installation do you suppose I'll be sorted?
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	there are different restore methods. this one is straightforward. - http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Restore_Grub
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	when i said "that's what it does" i meant exactly that. Windows overwrites the MBR. period.
2006-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	VPI/VCI?
2006-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	yep.. found a page on ubuntu for doing a speedtouch 330 adsl modem. All I need now is the VP/VC value - ISP is mum.
2006-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	they are not in the least universal.
2006-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	sucks. but you have to get that from the ISP (or someone else who knows how they throw packets around).
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	short of hunting down one of their techies, I figured if there were a handful of 'usual suspects' it would be worth trying.
2006-10-07T10:18:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	how do you get into the exim4 spoon-fed config setup?
2006-10-07T10:18:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	you know, when initially installing exim it gives you a bunch of questions to configure it.
2006-10-07T10:19:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	i know of what you speak, but haven't futzed with Exim on Ubuntu
2006-10-07T10:20:00.000Z	mneptok	odyssevs	*might* be sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4
2006-10-07T10:49:00.000Z	odyssevs	mneptok	so you know, 0,38 is a fairly standard vpi/vci in the UK.
