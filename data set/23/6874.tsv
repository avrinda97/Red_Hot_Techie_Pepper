2006-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	that's great, I hope they will do hsfmodem too :(
2006-03-08T07:30:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	neither Debian nor Ubuntu package the hsfmodem drivers. They are decidedly non-free.
2006-03-08T07:31:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	debian stays close to free, but I thought ubuntu would be more user friendly
2006-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	keep in mind both Debian and Ubuntu offer slmodem package variants
2006-03-08T07:35:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	would slmodem drivers an hsf?
2006-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	what took you so long :(
2006-05-14T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	there's no need to. See what I just pasted.
2006-05-14T16:18:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	each supported CPU adds  approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel
2006-05-14T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	which is completely negligible
2006-05-14T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	if 8 KB is an issue, you wouldn't be using our config regardless.
2006-05-14T16:19:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	you can always rebuild the kernel
2006-05-14T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	yes, I know.
2006-05-14T16:21:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	will ubuntu support reiser4fs? looks like ext3 is the default
2006-05-14T16:21:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	not out of the box.
2006-05-14T16:22:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	ext3 is the default; use expert mode in the text installer to choose another fs.
2006-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	do you know a how to make an ubuntu liveUSB?
2006-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	not off the top of my head, no
2006-05-28T14:52:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	okay, I can make mine
2006-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	why "restart" alsa-utils? That only resets volumes.
2006-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	to make sure it's up
2006-06-29T16:47:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	no.
2006-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	dli	crimsun	you don't even know whether he uses initrd
2006-07-26T15:28:00.000Z	crimsun	dli	I asked him that earlier.
