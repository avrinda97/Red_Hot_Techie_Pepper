2006-09-10T05:42:00.000Z	iceman		anyone got any good desktop screenshots ?
2006-09-10T05:43:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	by good, you mean clear?  you mean unusual?  what?
2006-09-10T05:44:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	Different, Unique, Unusual. Out side the box. well configured
2006-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	what's the nvidia problem?
2006-09-11T15:15:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	installed following the howto twice, but on reboot and reseting the bios teh system hangs and the system will not boot at all.
2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	this is after installing nvidia drivers?
2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	got to install "Ubuntu" to the Onboard, then reconfigure the system to use teh nvidia drivers,
2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	yes, i install the drivers, but then reboot, and the Systems trashed.
2006-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	we're talking about video drivers now, right, not nvidia cpu etc.?
2006-09-11T15:18:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	yes, the !nvidia url that the bot gives, but the install there is not reconfiguring the xorg.config file, so the onboard is used, not the nv drivers
2006-09-11T15:19:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	let me make sure I understand this
2006-09-11T15:19:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	you install ubuntu from scratch, and everything works.
2006-09-11T15:19:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	then you can no longer boot the system.
2006-09-11T15:20:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	now, if xorg.conf is not changed, you must not have completed the nvidia video driver install.
2006-09-11T15:20:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	do you get any error messages?  what happens?
2006-09-11T15:20:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	ok, Compaq Motherboard, no jumper for Bios "Onbaord video, I am forced to install to teh onboard video, then install the NVidia drivers after a Install. but the How-to fails to reconfigure the Drivers
2006-09-11T15:21:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	by "no jumper" you mean no way to disable the on board video?  these days that is done with the BIOS setup, not with a jumper.
2006-09-11T15:21:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	did you check the BIOS setup for an option to turn off the video?
2006-09-11T15:21:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	only ability is in bios setting to boot to the PCI slot of the Onboard. Ubuntu will bypass the bios and use the onboard no matter waht tell i reconfigure a install to use teh nvidia drivers
2006-09-11T15:21:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	do a text mode install from the alternate install cd
2006-09-11T15:22:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	Ubuntu is to smart for teh Hardware, and auto detects teh Onboard reguardless of the Bios settings
2006-09-11T15:22:00.000Z	sethk	iceman	I'd say that the compaq bios is dumb and doesn't have the right ability, but the effect is the same.  :)
2006-09-11T15:23:00.000Z	iceman	sethk	had this same issue in the last release of ubuntu with a Dell system, but the HOW-To for the Nvidia drivers worked. DELL and Compaq seem alike in the bios
