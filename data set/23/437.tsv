2011-09-19T19:16:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	modify your appearance, and make sure you select something that modifies the buttons too
2011-09-19T19:17:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	yes, I am selecting something that modifies buttons but buttons are not mofified in those apps
2011-09-19T19:17:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	so, it's the Gnome environment, and not KDE
2011-09-19T19:18:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	have you tried the "High Contrast Large Print Inverse" theme?
2011-09-19T19:18:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	Yes, I did try that one
2011-09-19T19:18:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	and no change to the inside of windows like chrome/firefox?
2011-09-19T19:18:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	no, it does not change anything inside windows except for 'appearance' window itself
2011-09-19T19:18:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	exactly
2011-09-19T19:30:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	just save to desktop, and upload to imgur.com since you have chrome/firefox working
2011-09-19T19:23:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	got that image?
2011-09-19T19:24:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	what image?
2011-09-19T19:25:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	we wanted to see the effect of changing themes and your chrome wrench menu
2011-09-19T19:27:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	they look exactly like raleigh default gnome buttons as Gentoo64 said
2011-09-19T19:28:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	wrench buttons is raleigh, wrench menu is the default gnome menu that looks ok.. pretty sure also raleigh. basically only buttons and similar controls look ugly
2011-09-19T19:28:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	got that screen shot we asked for?
2011-09-19T19:28:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	I don't have any image app installed and I don't understand why you need a screenshot when appearance panel / customize will show you exactly what I have
2011-09-19T19:29:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	and then how do I create the img?
2011-09-19T19:30:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	did you press print screen or not?
2011-09-19T19:30:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	yes
2011-09-19T19:31:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	it doesn't create the image for me when I press print screen
2011-09-19T19:32:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	I'll try reboot as Gentoo64 suggested, come back in a bit
2011-09-19T19:55:00.000Z	Tonisius	Rainy-day	so, got that screenshot?
2011-09-19T19:55:00.000Z	Rainy-day	Tonisius	it got fixed after a reboot
