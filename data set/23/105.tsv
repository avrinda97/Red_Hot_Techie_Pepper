2012-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	chrisward		anyone have any clue as to why I can connect to a remote samba server running ubuntu, but it seems no one else can?
2012-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	no one else on the same network?
2012-07-09T12:30:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	it's connections accross the internet, server's in france, I'm in australia and connect fine, there are other people on entirely separate networks who cannot connect. I am not using a VPN etc.
2012-07-09T12:31:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	is this your samba server ?
2012-07-09T12:31:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	yes
2012-07-09T12:31:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	check the smb.allow and smb.config to see if the users are allowed and if there are any ip filters
2012-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	I can't find an smb.allow file and there doesn't appear to be any IP filters
2012-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	sorry I meant hosts.allow/hosts.deny
2012-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	where can I find them?
2012-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	/etc
2012-07-09T12:34:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	both appear to be empty (apart from instructional comments)
2012-07-09T12:35:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	are you using a firewall?
2012-07-09T12:36:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	maybe the router is also blocking those ips
2012-07-09T12:36:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	server. but if the users are on a corporate network it could also be blocking outgoing requests
2012-07-09T12:37:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	it's a dedicated machine I'm renting from a server host.... I doubt they'd be filtering smb traffic..
2012-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	you sure they don't just allow access from your ip?
2012-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	I wouldn't imagine so, as I installed SMB myself
2012-07-09T12:39:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	have a look at the iptables for the server
2012-07-09T12:40:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	I assume you're giving another username to these other people?
2012-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	are you allowing those users in smb.conf
2012-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	chrisward	vampirnata	yes, though they never make it to the password prompt; connection refused
2012-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	that sounds like a firewall problem
2012-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	vampirnata	chrisward	I can try and connect from here if you msg me the ip
