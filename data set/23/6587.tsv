2006-05-11T08:03:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Well if you are sure that www.linuxprinting.org has your printer listed with a *Fully* capable printer driver it should work...otherwise download turboprint and use the free version....which is fine if you just need black and white
2006-05-11T08:05:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	then it is simple..open up the cups web interface...creat a class(whatever you want to call it) then in windows make sure you have the driver installed for your printer...then add a printer using IPP in the format of http://hostname/classname/printername and you will be good to go..
2006-05-11T08:06:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	I assumed you are trying to print to a printer connected to Ubuntu?
2006-05-11T08:06:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Ok then what I stated should work good for you...
2006-05-11T08:08:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Hang on...
2006-05-11T08:11:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Sorry can't find my bookmark anymore...
2006-05-11T08:11:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	U know how to get to the cups web interface?
2006-05-11T08:13:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Just a sec let me get mine open
2006-05-11T08:14:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Click on the classes at the top
2006-05-11T08:15:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	Yeah I know you need to add one
2006-05-11T08:15:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	I assume you can already print from ubuntu to the printer?
2006-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	I suggest dropping back to basics...uninstall and re-install CUPS...then make sure you can print to the printer...then all you need to do is add a class select the printer that is attached to ubuntu...go to windows machine..use the add printer ..but select the option for networking printing...there should be an option for ipp printing...then just http://<ip or hostname/classes/classname you added
2006-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	Zarephath	nix4me	np..good luck
