2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	danhs1		How do I print out a separator page for every job?
2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	danhs1		I have a big batch job and I really need to separate everyone of the files that comes out
2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	I'm almost certain I've seen it somewhere
2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	isn't there a setting in some printer properties?
2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	where?
2008-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	hang on.. let me check
2008-09-14T01:39:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	Is it Finishings: cover?
2008-09-14T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	I was thinking more along the lines of "Starting Banner", or "Ending Banner"
2008-09-14T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	in system, administration, printing
2008-09-14T01:41:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	I see it....
2008-09-14T01:43:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	ok.. I tried "starting banner" and it didn't work
2008-09-14T01:43:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	maybe job options --> common optoins --> more --> finishings --> cover
2008-09-14T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	well.. you can give it a try.. but I think that's stuff the printer might do to your printout afterwards.. stapling etc
2008-09-14T01:47:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	:-p
2008-09-14T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	there's a setting in the printer properties you get when you print that says "cover page"
2008-09-14T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	with the same settings as in the system, adminsitration, printing dialog
2008-09-14T01:47:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	does that coverpage work?
2008-09-14T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	yes, it does.. prints out a nice coverpage with username, time and other stuff
2008-09-14T01:48:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	I really just need a separator page consistently....
2008-09-14T01:51:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	it seems gedit doesn't care about the settings in "system, admin, printing"
2008-09-14T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	I just tried printing from another editor (scite) and it used the settings from that dialog.. including coverpages
2008-09-14T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	danhs1	might just be gedit being all "I'm special".. I don't have to do as you say...
2008-09-14T02:04:00.000Z	danhs1	Slart	thanks.  sounsd good.  I'll give it a shot
