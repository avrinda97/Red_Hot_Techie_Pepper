2007-03-04T15:52:00.000Z	BigMac		Is there a batch conversion software for ubuntu that when I select a directory, it will add all images in that directory and subdirectories, copy over the original ones and be able to resize them all to like 100x100
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	'kim' in KDE has this, but I don't know about gnome. Otherwise just use find with -exec or a loop.
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	you don't really need experience; just one command.
2007-03-04T15:54:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	Well what would that command be
2007-03-04T15:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	(i) cd to the directory you want to be in, then (ii) find . -iname "*.jpg" -exec convert -resize SOMENUMBER% {} {} \;
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	NOTE: that command is *recursive*. It will resize ALL images in subdirectories to SOMENUMBER percentage
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	so if I wanted to resize all the bmps too 100x100
2007-03-04T15:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	like the above, but without the percent, instead with a !
2007-03-04T15:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	so: find . -iname "*.jpg" -exec convert -resize 100x100! {} {} \;
2007-03-04T16:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	yes. In each subdirectory as well, so be careful :)
2007-03-04T16:03:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	it said find: convert: No such file or directory about 150 times
2007-03-04T16:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	sorry, change jpg to bmp
2007-03-04T16:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	show me the exact command you're typing
2007-03-04T16:05:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	http://rafb.net/p/GU4hOL59.html
2007-03-04T16:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	are you sure you've got imagemagick installed?
2007-03-04T16:14:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	no you never told me to install it
2007-03-04T16:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	I actually presumed Ubuntu had it on a default install, actually.
2007-03-04T16:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	nevermind; install it and it should work.
2007-03-04T16:15:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	ok installing right now
2007-03-04T16:16:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	how do I know it is done
2007-03-04T16:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	the command? It will return to the prompt
2007-03-04T16:25:00.000Z	BigMac	apokryphos	anyway I can make a script out of it, so when I doble click it, it will run that command in the directory that the script was placed
2007-03-04T16:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	BigMac	if you like. I really recommend using digiKam though, which is a wonderful image management application (and has easy tools like that, upload to flickr, etc)
