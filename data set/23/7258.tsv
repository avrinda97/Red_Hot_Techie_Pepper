2009-04-02T17:50:00.000Z	sipior	allen	if you move your .gnome2 directory elsewhere temporarily, can you access gnome normally?
2009-04-02T17:52:00.000Z	sipior	allen	a complete reinstall? including a new user home directory?
2009-04-02T17:53:00.000Z	sipior	allen	that doesn't answer the question. did you delete your home directory during the install?
2009-04-02T17:58:00.000Z	sipior	allen	you haven't answered my question regarding your .gnome2 directory. if you don't understand it, that's fine, and i'm happy to elaborate. but an acknowledgment would be nice.
2009-04-02T17:58:00.000Z	allen	sipior	im sorry i dont get it
2009-04-02T17:59:00.000Z	sipior	allen	you have a terminal open? if you type "ls -al" in it, you'll get a list of directories. one of those should be called ".gnome2" (note the dot)
2009-04-02T18:00:00.000Z	sipior	allen	if you try moving that directory; say, via "mv .gnome2 .gnome2.backup", and then log out, and back in, does your problem go away?
2009-04-02T18:01:00.000Z	sipior	allen	sorry, i thought you said you had one open. you can get it from the main menu.
2009-04-02T18:02:00.000Z	sipior	allen	i think there is a hotkey combination to open a terminal, but i'm damned if i remember what it is...anybody?
2009-04-02T18:03:00.000Z	sipior	allen	try "Alt-F2", see if that doesn't start a terminal for you.
2009-04-02T18:04:00.000Z	sipior	allen	try "alt-F7" to get back :-)
2009-04-02T18:06:00.000Z	sipior	allen	actually, if you try "ctrl-alt-F1", do you get a login prompt?
2009-04-02T18:14:00.000Z	sipior	allen	i need to go in a few minutes, but i think the problem is in your .gnome2 directory. sometimes gnome gets a little confused, leaving it in an awkward state. that would explain why you get a background and cursor, but no toolbars. if you move that directory temporarily, you force gnome to reinitialise it, hopefully fixing your problem. alternatively, making a new account would be a quick way to verify that that is where the problem lies. good luck!
