2009-05-01T12:14:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	why does opera look so incredibly dodgy? i installed the qt4 version

2009-05-01T12:16:00.000Z	xangua	Flynsarmy	justo go to System> Preferences> Qt4 conf -or something like that-  and select GTK, save ans exist
2009-05-01T12:17:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	made no difference. By default its set to 'Desktop Settings' which i'm assuming would have been GTK+ anyway
2009-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	xangua	Flynsarmy	no diference ¿¿
2009-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	it looks identical to how it did before i made the change.
2009-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	xangua	Flynsarmy	do you save and quit ¿¿
2009-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	xangua	Flynsarmy	do you select GTK style ¿¿
2009-05-01T12:20:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	i set it to gtk+ style, did a file - save and closed it. then opened opera
2009-05-01T12:21:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	yes. deb name was opera_9.64.2480.gcc4.qt4_i386.deb
2009-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	xangua	Flynsarmy	have you tried with the alpha 10 ¿¿
2009-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	nah, i'm still using the same deb i used on intrepid

2010-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	no, its an applet sitting in the notification area. i've still got notification area up there - its just a little mouse grabber thing
2010-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	xangua	for future reference - it was the 'indicator' applet
