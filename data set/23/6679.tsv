2006-06-13T12:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	the voice of experience?
2006-06-13T12:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	yes unfortunately. I'd really like to be able to run weather apps for different cities, with clocks for their respective time zone underneath, but all the desklets crap out but for the last to load
2006-06-13T13:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	I should take a screenshot though - it looks pretty impressive - shame it's broken
2006-06-13T13:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	ah, I've seen that one, I need current weather also.
2006-06-13T13:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	does the touching of the forcefsck in / still work (haven't tried it recently)
2006-06-13T13:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	grep forcefsk /etc/init.d/checkfs.sh        that's a cool trick - didn't know that was there...
2006-06-13T13:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	it's an old debian trick ...
2006-06-13T13:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	2.6.15 on dapper
2007-08-29T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	the rc-default script in /etc/event.d doesn't work?
2007-08-29T11:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	as I read that script, it's supposed to take the argument passed by grub & boot to that runlevel - but no, this doesn't work in practive - you only get rl2 despite what rl you pass on grub's kernel line
2007-08-29T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	I'm on gutsy at the moment, but I'm sure when I looked at it in feisty it did some sed magic on /etc/inittab
2007-08-29T11:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	that should work, but still doesn't let you choose rl from grub
2007-08-29T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	ok
2007-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	discussion of gutsy #ubuntu+1
2007-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	explaining why I can't help with his fiesty, not explaining gutsy :)
2007-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	vmware, that is
2007-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	yeah, but you know noobs see 'gutsy', then want to run it
2007-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	point taken
2008-05-24T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	gnome-font-viewer <font> , or you might try gnome-specimen
2008-05-24T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	ah, now I remember. gwaterfall
2008-07-04T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Frogzoo	did you do that from memory?
2008-07-04T11:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nickrud	sure ;)
