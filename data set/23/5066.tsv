2008-02-29T19:55:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	chemical	I don't think memory requirements of gutsy are that different from those of feisty
2008-02-29T19:55:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		moreover hardy seems pretty more efficient than gutsy
2008-02-29T19:56:00.000Z	chemical		the main reason of becoming linux user is attractive usability

2008-02-29T20:03:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	chemical	before upgrading move /usr/local out of the way if you have something into that
2008-02-29T20:04:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	chemical	that's the only problem I know of, and it's a shame nobody agrees that it should be fixed
