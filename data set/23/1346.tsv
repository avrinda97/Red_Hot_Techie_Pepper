2011-01-24T00:47:00.000Z	phong_		hi guys
2011-01-24T00:47:00.000Z	phong_		is it posible to install office 2010 on ubuntu?
2011-01-24T00:48:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	no, but you could use Openoffice.org, which is just as good
2011-01-24T00:48:00.000Z	PeterNL		(wine probably doesn't do new office versions)
2011-01-24T00:48:00.000Z	phong_	PeterNL	i dont like openoffice ...prefer real office from ms
2011-01-24T00:49:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	oo.o is just as real as mso. Claiming that one is "not the real thing" is very insulting.
2011-01-24T00:49:00.000Z	phong_		lol
2011-01-24T00:49:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	if you really want MS office you should buy windows.
2011-01-24T00:49:00.000Z	phong_		i have windows
2011-01-24T00:49:00.000Z	phong_		;)
2011-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	phong_		and i do like ubuntu
2011-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	PeterNL		So use whatever you want on whatever OS works best with it :)
2011-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	PeterNL		And yes, you can run both OSes in a vm (both ways) just fine. or dualboot. Or get two (or more) machines :)
2011-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	phong_		why there aren't many software for linux?
2011-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	PeterNL		But what's a good video format for my portable media player for 320x240 videos? It supports xvid and mp4, no ogg vorbis/theora...
2011-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	there is lots of software for linux, you just need to know where to find it
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	phong_		is there like adobe photoshop for linux?
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	The GIMP
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	phong_		and antivirus for linux?
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	phong_		i'm more familiar with photoshop
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	phong_		why not need one?
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	phong_		oh
2011-01-24T00:52:00.000Z	PeterNL	phong_	ClamAV (altough you will only need it on a server with windows clients :) )
