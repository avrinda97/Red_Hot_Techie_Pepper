2007-05-10T06:32:00.000Z	polysynaptic		anybody able to help with wireless on Feisty?
2007-05-10T06:33:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	I could certainly give it a try. :)  Just got it working for myself.
2007-05-10T06:33:00.000Z	polysynaptic		hey fouressence! thanks I would appreciate any input
2007-05-10T06:33:00.000Z	polysynaptic	fouressence	I use ra2500 with WPAPSK on a DDWRT router
2007-05-10T06:34:00.000Z	polysynaptic		I've removed network-manager and network-manager gnome and configured my /etc/network/interfaces with the PSK in text and hex
2007-05-10T06:34:00.000Z	polysynaptic		rebooted both my router and my machine and still unable to connect
2007-05-10T06:34:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	I'm using the ra73, so more-or-less close.  I'd recommend downloading the serialmonkey drivers:
2007-05-10T06:35:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	Actually, let me back up a little: does your wireless card work yet?
2007-05-10T06:35:00.000Z	polysynaptic		I did that too. using this tutorial http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241565
2007-05-10T06:36:00.000Z	polysynaptic		foure: yes, worked perfectly in Dapper about two days ago
2007-05-10T06:37:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	Alrighty.  There are some differences though between Dapper and Feisty, apparently, in regards to wireless...  Have you gone through the serialmonkey tutorial for Feisty?
2007-05-10T06:37:00.000Z	fouressence		**tutorial while using Fesity (not a specific feisty one. puh)
2007-05-10T06:38:00.000Z	polysynaptic	fouressence	I may have, can you post me a link?
2007-05-10T06:39:00.000Z	polysynaptic		http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=21765&sid=b926f1d0ac2731c401bc3b0cb2a6227b
2007-05-10T06:39:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	I mean just installing the serialmoney drivers in Feisty.  The Dapper stuff confused things a bit.
2007-05-10T06:39:00.000Z	polysynaptic		confusing that it worked in Dapper, I installed Feisty and it won't work now?
2007-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	That's what I'm saying --there seem to be strange differences like that.
2007-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	polysynaptic		yes, I have installed the serialmonkey drivers. the tutorial in this link is what I was referring to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241565
2007-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	fouressence		okee dokes.
2007-05-10T06:41:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	if you type iwconfig, does your card show up?
2007-05-10T06:41:00.000Z	polysynaptic	fouressence	yes
2007-05-10T06:42:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	okee.  iwconfig [cardName]  essid [network name]  ?
2007-05-10T06:42:00.000Z	fouressence	polysynaptic	Arrrff, sorry, I have to get going.
