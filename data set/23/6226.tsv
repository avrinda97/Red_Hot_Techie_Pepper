2006-06-04T08:52:00.000Z	skippy81		I tried Gentoo today - i have in after the third hour of wathing it compile xorg :)
2006-06-04T08:53:00.000Z	skippy81		gave in*
2006-06-04T08:55:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	if you could look that over and tell me if there is a better way that would be super!
2006-06-04T08:55:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	what is the name of the 2.4 driver? is it nwfs.ko?
2006-06-04T08:55:00.000Z	skippy81		if you can find the name of the 2.4 driver i will have a go ylon :) im good on google :)
2006-06-04T08:55:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	well, I don't see any ko's there, except perhaps the 2.5.1-pre1 bz2 you can see there...
2006-06-04T08:56:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	can you link me the location of the 2.4 drivers?
2006-06-04T08:56:00.000Z	skippy81		i will download em and take a look
2006-06-04T08:56:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	yeah, that is the page that I listed above
2006-06-04T08:56:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	the only other helpful page I've found after hours of digging is: http://www.dicas-l.com.br/dicas-l/20031201.php
2006-06-04T09:01:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	i have a theory
2006-06-04T09:02:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	I'm all ears, I'm about ready to loose my mind
2006-06-04T09:02:00.000Z	skippy81		i think it is a distinct possibility that NWFS support does exist, but has to be enabled in the 2.6 kernel (ie it doesnt run as a module)
2006-06-04T09:03:00.000Z	skippy81		to test this i am going to boot into gentoo now, and check out my kernel source. i will be back in 5 minutes to give you an answer ylon
2006-06-04T09:03:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	thanks much
2006-06-04T09:03:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	ill be back in 5 - 10 min
2006-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	 there may be hope for you - i have found that there is a kernel module named "NCPFS" (Netware core protocol), it is described as "allowing you to mount netware file server volumes and access them", basically it lets you use your linux machine as a netware CLIENT. Is that what you want?
2006-06-04T09:15:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	no, I need to mount netware file systems.
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	how much would you charge to figure out a solution?  I've been working on this for about 8 hours
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	skippy81		so the file systems are physucally located in your linux box?
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	skippy81	ylon	people dont charge here :)
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	ylon	skippy81	I don't have much mind left after this, it seems that there are some distros out there that would do what I need, but I can't find any
