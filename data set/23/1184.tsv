2010-07-27T08:43:00.000Z	RealEyes		i know im running the command wrong
2010-07-27T08:43:00.000Z	RealEyes		file /home/realeyes/Desktop/01 Starting Over.mp3
2010-07-27T08:43:00.000Z	RealEyes		gave me errors
2010-07-27T08:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	RealEyes	are you using \'s to delimit those spaces?
2010-07-27T08:44:00.000Z	RealEyes		is that what im supposed to?
2010-07-27T08:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding		as in, 01\ Starting\ Over.mp3
2010-07-27T08:44:00.000Z	RealEyes		'\'
2010-07-27T08:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding		bash can't tell if that is a filename with spaces or three different files
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding		one of which is named 01, the other Starting, and the last Over.mp3
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding		The \'s are required to make it unambiguous
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	RealEyes		/home/realeyes/Desktop/01 Starting Over.mp3: data
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	RealEyes		Did I just DL a virus?
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding		file probably doesn't know how to grok mp3's, maybe
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	RealEyes		<.<;
2010-07-27T08:45:00.000Z	RealEyes		I should delete all this, huh?
2010-07-27T08:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding		It could be a non-mp3 masquerading as one
2010-07-27T08:46:00.000Z	RealEyes	ZykoticK9	What should I do? Convert it? Should I just delete it?
2010-07-27T08:46:00.000Z	RealEyes		how does one convert it?
2010-07-27T08:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding		It would be hard to convert if it is not an mp3
2010-07-27T08:47:00.000Z	RealEyes		How is it not an mp3? Its listed as that...
2010-07-27T08:48:00.000Z	RealEyes		How can I make Ubuntu see that it is an mp3?
2010-07-27T08:48:00.000Z	RealEyes		nvm
2010-07-27T08:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	RealEyes	if you can play it in an mp3 player or audio app, you know that it's a music file
