2006-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	elsebasbe		hi, if I had 3 processes called tell.exe, update.exe and another one *.exe, using all my cpu,could it be viruses?
2006-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	elsebasbe		I suspect they where running via wine
2006-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	where are they on your hd?
2006-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	dunno
2006-11-30T17:04:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	oh sorry, misunderstood you there. yes, they where on my hd
2006-11-30T17:04:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	yes, but where?
2006-11-30T17:05:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	might reveal a lot
2006-11-30T17:05:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	/home/elias/.wine/Program Files/
2006-11-30T17:06:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	any thoughts?
2006-11-30T17:06:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	I'm getting mixed stuff on that
2006-11-30T17:07:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	aha?
2006-11-30T17:08:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	I'd probably just delete the files
2006-11-30T17:08:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	now nothing
2006-11-30T17:09:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	but usually when there is a file that I can't open I run it through wine :/
2006-11-30T17:09:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	nope
2006-11-30T17:10:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	hmmm.. in theory a windows virus could run under wine like that
2006-11-30T17:10:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	that was my thought too
2006-11-30T17:10:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	a bit clumsy of me :)
2006-11-30T17:11:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	never heard of it happening. well, it's a first. must be a hostile environment for the poor virus, not even a explorer.exe to restore it after it is gone ;)
2006-11-30T17:11:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	haha :D
2006-11-30T17:14:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	unreal
2006-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	tuna-fish-	elsebasbe	working for new ways for windows and linux to co-operate: now you can run windows viruses on linux too!
2006-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	elsebasbe	tuna-fish-	it could be a big hit!
