2006-08-14T09:48:00.000Z	weex		i just got a 300gb hard drive, how should i format it to use in both windows and linux?
2006-08-14T09:48:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	1/2 each?
2006-08-14T09:49:00.000Z	weex	zephen_	lets assume so
2006-08-14T09:49:00.000Z	weex	zephen_	actually i'd like one big partition...was thinking about fat32 but there's a 4gb limit on filesize right?
2006-08-14T09:50:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	you'll need 2 partitions - one for linux and one for windows
2006-08-14T09:50:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	no 4gb limit on the fat
2006-08-14T09:51:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	so what i'd do is install windows first, make 2 partitions with it's installer, format the windows one FAT32
2006-08-14T09:51:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	then install ubuntu on the other one. Grub will probably set itself up so that you can dual boot
2006-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	ah, just use the FAT32 then
2006-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	unfortunately that is the best solution
2006-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	it is fud now, didn't used to be
2006-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	ah 4gb file
2006-08-14T09:53:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	yes
2006-08-14T09:53:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	but there is a way to have a larger than 4gb file on there, if you use linux to create the file
2006-08-14T09:53:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	what are the 4gb+ files you have
2006-08-14T09:54:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	yeah, i had the same problem with some dvd isos - i googled and found a way that i could write bigger than 4gb isos through linux
2006-08-14T09:55:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	well actually i did it in freebsd , but i think the same principle holds
2006-08-14T09:56:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	it works
2006-08-14T09:56:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	just not all that well ;)
2006-08-14T09:57:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	i don't trust the writing
2006-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	weex	zephen_	you've had an issue where the writing messed up?
2006-08-14T09:59:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	i've had corrupted isos that i can only blame on transferring with ext2fs driver
2006-08-14T09:59:00.000Z	zephen_	weex	others though, think it's pretty good
