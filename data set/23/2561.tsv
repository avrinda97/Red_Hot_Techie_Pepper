2010-11-24T07:21:00.000Z	jonathan		guys how can i access my windows files from ubuntu?, i have a windows os on partition 1, and partition 2 for my movies etc. i now installed ubuntu on partition 2 but i can't seem to find my files in that partition. i can see my files on partition 1 where windows is installed but not on partition 2
2010-11-24T07:21:00.000Z	jonathan		yes2
2010-11-24T07:21:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	did you delete the partition when you installed ubuntu?
2010-11-24T07:24:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	you have at least 3 if you include swap
2010-11-24T07:28:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	do you see it in places?
2010-11-24T07:29:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	i only see part1, no part2 shown but when i open my computer, part2 is shown as file system
2010-11-24T07:30:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	so you see it in "computer"?
2010-11-24T07:31:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	can you pastebin the output of "sudo /sbin/fdisk -l"
2010-11-24T07:31:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	yes2 i see them both
2010-11-24T07:31:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	you cant open it from "computer" then?
2010-11-24T07:32:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	here it is, thanks.
2010-11-24T07:32:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	no problem, glad i could help :)
2010-11-24T07:33:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	here XD http://paste.ubuntu.com/535745/
2010-11-24T07:34:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	most likely it just isnt auto-mounted, so once you open it, you will have an icon on your desktop for it
2010-11-24T07:35:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	you can view it now though right?
2010-11-24T07:36:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	how can i automount it? tnx
2010-11-24T07:36:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	good instructions on this page:       http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/mountlinux
2010-11-24T07:37:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	ok2 i'll read it, so for now can i open it without mounting it first?
2010-11-24T07:38:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	when you open it it is mounted
2010-11-24T07:40:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	tnx for the help
2010-11-24T07:40:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	no problem, for automounting that page should straighten you out :)
2010-11-24T07:42:00.000Z	jonathan	cbilljones	wow i've done it thank you very much, tnx tnx have a gud day
2010-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	cbilljones	jonathan	good to hear :)
