2007-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	Ace2016		i get this error http://pastebin.co.uk/10991
2007-02-26T07:09:00.000Z	Ace2016		???
2007-02-26T07:09:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	looks like its trying to access a directory it doesnt have permissions to go to..
2007-02-26T07:10:00.000Z	Ace2016	merc	its in my home dir
2007-02-26T07:10:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	you're not passing it any arguments to go to a certain directory?
2007-02-26T07:11:00.000Z	Ace2016	merc	i used  sudo git checkout xgl-0-0-1   and it gave the same error
2007-02-26T07:11:00.000Z	merc		hm
2007-02-26T07:11:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	can your user use the chdir command?
2007-02-26T07:11:00.000Z	Ace2016		it says /usr/bin/gitfm: fatal error: `chdir' failed: permission denied.   and locate chdir only gives /usr/lib/perl/5.8.8/auto/POSIX/chdir.al
2007-02-26T07:12:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	one sec
2007-02-26T07:13:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	im guessing chdir is part of a package of command line tools..finding that package and installing it however, hasnt been fruitful for me in the past, oh, minute of searching :)
2007-02-26T07:15:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	uhm, you sure you are using the tool you want to be using?
2007-02-26T07:16:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	git appears to be a filemanager, and you're trying to check stuff out...the text refers to a content tracker etc...
2007-02-26T07:17:00.000Z	Ace2016	merc	maybe the concent tracker tool over the name git?
2007-02-26T07:18:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	so, which one do you want to be using, the content tracker deal yeah?
2007-02-26T07:18:00.000Z	Ace2016		the content tracker
2007-02-26T07:18:00.000Z	merc	Ace2016	it appears you're using the file manager.
2007-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	Ace2016		ltp
2007-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	Ace2016		woops
2007-02-26T07:21:00.000Z	merc		wasnt there some new app that came out that will figure out all the 3d driver junk for you?
2007-02-26T07:26:00.000Z	Ace2016	merc	i think that git was the wrong git, may have been the file manager, i think i needed the other one and i switched to it and i had to also cd into xserver and it worked
