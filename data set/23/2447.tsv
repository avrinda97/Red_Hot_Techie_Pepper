2009-03-10T21:54:00.000Z	unop	I2	why doesn't bash it for you? because it does the job.
2009-03-10T21:55:00.000Z	unop	I2	not all bash commands are accessible through another scripting language..

2009-03-10T22:01:00.000Z	unop	I2	floating point arithmetic - http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/022
2009-03-10T22:03:00.000Z	I2	unop	i can't use the wiki u send to me
2009-03-10T22:03:00.000Z	unop	I2	why not? any errors?
2009-03-10T22:04:00.000Z	I2	unop	beacause i don't have two numeric variable....i have two string obtained from a substring call from the return of a command
2009-03-10T22:05:00.000Z	unop	I2	the shell doesn't know the difference between strings and numbers/integers/floats - everything is a string.
2009-03-10T22:10:00.000Z	I2	unop	sorry if i'm late
2009-03-10T22:11:00.000Z	unop	I2	  a="2.3"; b="6.7"; echo "$a + $b" | bc
2009-03-10T22:12:00.000Z	unop	I2	it doesn't matter how the variables are initialised - just make sure they contain strings that look like numbers and bc will do it's magic.
2009-03-10T22:14:00.000Z	unop	I2	make sure you copy it properly - because that should work alright.
2009-03-10T22:17:00.000Z	unop	I2	http://pastebin.com/d32a3381
2009-03-10T22:17:00.000Z	unop	I2	yes i know :)
