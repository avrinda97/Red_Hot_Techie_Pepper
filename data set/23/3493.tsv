2008-04-26T11:46:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 If you use GNOME, open a terminal and type gconf-editor
2008-04-26T11:47:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 go to desktop, (under nautilus) and uncheck volumes_visible
2008-04-26T11:49:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	after desktop, i only have gnome.
2008-04-26T11:49:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 It's a bit weird, but it isn't under Desktop directly
2008-04-26T11:50:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 sorry, in case you didn't get that, apps > nautilus > desktop
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	i' on it.
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	what will i do next?
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Okay, at the end of the right pane, there's an option called volumes_visible
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Uncheck it, and your volumes wont show on your desktop
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	am i going to uncheck it?
2008-04-26T11:51:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 yeah :)
2008-04-26T11:52:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	thanks
2008-04-26T11:52:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 no problem
2008-04-26T11:55:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Sorry, I think the closest you'll get is keeping them aligned
2008-04-26T11:56:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	thanks for the info. maybe i just have to arraged it manually.
2008-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Sorry I couldn't help any more, I don't use icons :P
2008-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Maybe you could help me with something, though.
2008-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 Do you know if anyone other than me refers to computer power cables as kettle leads?
2008-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	Kilgariff	gooody	 :)
2008-04-26T11:59:00.000Z	gooody	Kilgariff	i don't know.
