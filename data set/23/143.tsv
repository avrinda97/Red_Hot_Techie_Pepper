2012-05-28T03:58:00.000Z	vagtastic		Just updated a 10.04 headless lamp server to 12.04. Its an old machine running a 32bit cpu with pae for memory. Was wondering why the kernel was only bumped up to hyperspace 3.0.0-20-generic-pae and not 3.2.0 ?
2012-05-28T03:59:00.000Z	vagtastic		sry hyperspace is the name of the machine.
