2005-11-24T16:47:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer		Hey guys, I changed my mind about installing Ubuntu at the partitioning-part, and pressed 'abort install'. Now I can'teven boot windows! It just says 'grub error 15' and that's that. Doesn't work with the Ubuntu disc either. Help anyone? :)
2005-11-24T16:49:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	did you actually change your partition scheme?
2005-11-24T16:50:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	No, it said that I hadn't specified some 'root'-thingey, and then I aborted. I think it did something with my 1,3 gig swap-partition though
2005-11-24T16:51:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	I already had an ext3-partition and a swap-partition before I started the installer from a previous try at ubuntu
2005-11-24T16:52:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	well assuming that all you blew away was your boot sector you can either reinstall grub or reinstall the windows boot loader
2005-11-24T16:52:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	can I ask why you aborted the installation?
2005-11-24T16:54:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	Okay, but how? The computer wont start from the Ubuntu disc... I aborted it because it turned out I didn't have time to install ubuntu, I didn't think it had done anything besides on perhaps those two partitions I dont even use
2005-11-24T16:55:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	what error does it give when you try to boot from the disk?
2005-11-24T16:56:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	I don't think it's trying to boot from the CD. Are you certain that you have your BIOS boot order specified correctly?
2005-11-24T16:59:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	well the CD doesn't use grub, so for some reason your computer isn't attempting to boot from the CD at all.
2005-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	It as the 'Intel Boot agent' and the message received was 'No boot filename received'
2005-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	it's trying to download boot instructions. Net Boot or something must be set
2005-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	you need to go into your BIOS. It's definately not using the appropriate boot options
2005-11-24T17:08:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	if you get that Intel message it has already bypassed your BIOS and has started the boot process.
2005-11-24T17:09:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	It looks like the boot order is NET ,  HARDDRIVE , CDROM
2005-11-24T17:16:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	I dunno what to say. If the CD is in, and it tries to boot from it you shouldn't get the grub error
2005-11-24T17:23:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	I got it to work! How do I set up the boot loader from here? I got the ubuntu installer screen
2005-11-24T17:23:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	which boot loader?
2005-11-24T17:24:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	which boot loader?
2005-11-24T17:24:00.000Z	Hirtenfeuer	polpak	well, so i can get it to work again
2005-11-24T17:25:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	well if you're trying to get your windows boot loader reinstalled you'll need a windows boot disk with fdisk on it
2005-11-24T17:25:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	otherwise you can install ubuntu and it will set up grub
2005-11-24T17:27:00.000Z	polpak	Hirtenfeuer	if you want to install the windows boot loader the command is fdisk /mbr
