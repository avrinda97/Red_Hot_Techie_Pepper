2008-10-02T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	what are you doing moving system files like that?
2008-10-02T09:50:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	?
2008-10-02T09:50:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	I accidentally copied /lib into /usr/lib32
2008-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	so then I just did a find for the most recently modified files (to find the ones I copied over) and then removed them.
2008-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	and now it seems that certain things aren't behaving properly
2008-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	if you must, reinstall, libgcc1
2008-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	ok let me try that... can I do it via apt-get?
2008-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	yes: sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgcc1
2008-10-02T09:52:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	note that you need that file at /lib/libgcc_s.so.1
2008-10-02T09:52:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	ok it's there.... and I tried running the program again but I still get error while loading shared libraries: libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-10-02T09:52:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	is a reboot required?
2008-10-02T09:53:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	ldconfig may need to be run
2008-10-02T09:53:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	try sudo ldconfig -v, and then run your program again
2008-10-02T09:54:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	ok, just ran ldconfig but still same error -- it's really strange because it's right there in /lib
2008-10-02T09:54:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	could it be a path thing perhaps?
2008-10-02T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	you get this error when?
2008-10-02T09:55:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	when I try to run the firefox executable
2008-10-02T09:55:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	when I run ldconfig -v I can see it first loading up libraries from /lib
2008-10-02T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	I'm not sure, then
2008-10-02T09:58:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	could I use the synaptic package manager to reinstall all of my installed packages?
2008-10-02T10:00:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	yes, but that would take a very long time.
2008-10-02T10:00:00.000Z	savage--	tritium	i'm trying it now:-)
2008-10-02T10:00:00.000Z	tritium	savage--	I'd advise against it
