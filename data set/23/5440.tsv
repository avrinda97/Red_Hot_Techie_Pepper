2006-12-21T15:33:00.000Z	Pie-rate		in showkey i can see it randomly giving some different scancodes while i have it held down
2006-12-21T15:34:00.000Z	Pie-rate		oh and my start key is no longer mapped to mod4
2006-12-21T15:35:00.000Z	Pie-rate		and gnome is just generally screwed over it seems
2006-12-21T15:35:00.000Z	Pie-rate		not only in the keyboard department
2006-12-21T15:36:00.000Z	Pie-rate		this is why windows is still king, it has less of these incredibly strange problems with things that should be incredibly simple and just WORK
2006-12-21T15:36:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	It's all a matter of perspective...
2006-12-21T15:36:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	Coming from a heavy *nix background windows does a lot of strange things and doesn't just work
2006-12-21T15:38:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	C/D/E drives? no physical files representing the devices? registry?  no X server? no chmod? have to restart to install stuff? it makes no sense to someone used to a linux or BSD system and would seem to 'not just work'
2006-12-21T15:39:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	no random screwups with the handling of the keyboard that causes an apparently unsolvable random keypress? no broken as hell drivers for everything?
2006-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	What exactly is the problem I missed the beginning
2006-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	no, nothing.
2006-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	it only happens in X
2006-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	it only happens when there's load on the CPU
2006-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	Thinking
2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	for example if i hold it down and then scroll my IRC window up and down it makes a lot more '-'s
2006-12-21T16:07:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	think of anything?
2006-12-21T16:10:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	No sorry
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	If you have some key you don't want
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	You could map 82 to down
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	racarr	Pie-rate	and something else to -
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	that'd map - to down
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	Pie-rate	racarr	that'd a dirty hack and there'd still be unwanted keypresses in there
