2007-08-02T08:09:00.000Z	DWSR		And if you can't find it, do sudo apt-cache search xchat and install what comes up.
2007-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	DWSR		wtf? I have no wireless entry anymore.
2007-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	DWSR		The interface is not listed.
2007-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	DWSR		YARLY.
2007-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	DWSR		:-P
2007-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	DWSR		yes.
2007-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	DWSR		else network-admin doesn't run.
2007-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	DWSR		I was working on this last night as well.
2007-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	DWSR		Last night there was a wireless entry, then I blacklisted the native Linux drivers for my nic because I installed them with ndiswrapper, and now there is no entry.
2007-08-02T08:14:00.000Z	DWSR		yes, I checked in the bios.
2007-08-02T08:14:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	did you include ndiswrappers in the modules list?
2007-08-02T08:15:00.000Z	DWSR	Falstius	I followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	did you use lsmod | grep ndis   to make sure ndiswrapper is loaded?
2007-08-02T08:17:00.000Z	DWSR	Falstius	not loaded.
2007-08-02T08:17:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	told you so :-P ;)
2007-08-03T07:59:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	generally the current directory isn't in the path, so you need ./ to run a program in it.
2007-08-03T08:00:00.000Z	DWSR	Falstius	normally bash will search the current directory for an executable.
2007-08-03T08:00:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	only if the current directory is in the $PATH variable, normally it isn't.
2007-08-03T08:01:00.000Z	DWSR	Falstius	Can't you just add . to $PATH?
2007-08-03T08:01:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	ofcourse .. but you shouldn't.
2007-08-03T08:01:00.000Z	DWSR	Falstius	why not?
2007-08-03T08:02:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	because it can cause confusion with you're developing software and it keeps you from accidentally executing files.
2007-08-03T08:04:00.000Z	Falstius	DWSR	yes it will, and you can do that.  I'm not telling you not to add . to your path, just don't go around telling everyone to do it :)
