2008-08-03T05:39:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	unplug the ipod, in your terminal type this out.  sudo tail -f /var/log/dmesg  # plug your ipod back in and have a look at what happens in the terminal.
2008-08-03T05:40:00.000Z	aadasas	unop	nothing changed
2008-08-03T05:42:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	hmm, does the regular dmesg command give you anything?
2008-08-03T05:43:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	is your ipod actually functioning? :) coz this is not normal
2008-08-03T05:44:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	do you know how to reboot your ipod?
2008-08-03T05:44:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	not reset, just reboot
2008-08-03T05:45:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	yea .. does that have any effect while it is plugged in?
2008-08-03T05:46:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	this might help -- if you manage to get the ipod recognized.  http://lilserenity.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/virgin-mobile-praise-ubuntu-and-ipod-nano-3g/
2008-08-03T05:49:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	do you use a usb hub?
2008-08-03T05:49:00.000Z	aadasas	unop	no i do not
2008-08-03T05:49:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	have you tried plugging the ipod into a different port?
2008-08-03T05:51:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	hmm, does the ipod work and is mountable on another machine? windows perhaps?
2008-08-03T05:51:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	well, that doesn't mean it's workable -- it could be brand new and faulty too out of the box.
2008-08-03T05:52:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	do you have a windows machine/install to try this out on?
2008-08-03T05:53:00.000Z	unop	aadasas	you might have to set the ipod in "disk use" mode ..
