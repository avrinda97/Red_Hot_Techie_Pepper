2007-08-26T14:22:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	the command is "wallpaper-tray", you don't need to know where it is
2007-08-26T14:24:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	to find out type: which wallpaper-tray
2007-08-26T14:25:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	indeed, but you only need the command name "wallpaper-tray" is my point, it is already in your $PATH
2007-08-26T15:33:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	look in /usr/share/doc/wallpaper-tray/README for a start
2007-08-26T15:38:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	guess not, it's a pretty specific question. try searching ubuntuforums.org or google
2007-08-26T15:42:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	those messages from ubotu meant to NOT keep repeating your question
2007-09-29T08:59:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	try asking in #ubuntu-in
2007-10-13T11:11:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	type who, they might both be you

2007-10-14T15:41:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	it should be identical for gaim
2007-10-14T15:42:00.000Z	vsayikiran	astro76	but in gaim there is no XMpp protocol
2007-10-14T15:45:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	ah ok, try this: Protocol Jabber, User ID user@gmail.com (including @gmail.com), server talk.google.com, port 5223
2007-10-14T15:45:00.000Z	vsayikiran	astro76	its not working the website you asked me to see
2007-10-14T15:46:00.000Z	astro76	vsayikiran	also in the advanced tab where you change the port to 5223, check the 2 checkboxes
2007-10-14T15:46:00.000Z	vsayikiran	astro76	ok
