2011-11-10T02:41:00.000Z	zenmaster		Whats up guys.
2011-11-10T02:41:00.000Z	zenmaster		So I am trying to get my Team Fotress 2 server up. And I think one of my compiler libraries might be out of date.
2011-11-10T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	you don't update glibc - it's critical not to
2011-11-10T02:42:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	So I did this "apt-get install build essential".
2011-11-10T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	that's just installing compiler tools, nothing to do with glibc
2011-11-10T02:43:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	According to the Team Fortress 2 wiki, I need GLIBC version at least 2.3.2
2011-11-10T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	ok ? and ?
2011-11-10T02:43:00.000Z	zenmaster		I recently installed Ubuntu server 11.10 and when I did a version check, mine was older then that.
2011-11-10T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	ok - so you can't use it then
2011-11-10T02:43:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	And would be were you gave me a positive lead in how to fix this situation.
2011-11-10T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	you can't - you don't update glibc
2011-11-10T02:44:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	So what you are telling me is that there are no TF2 servers running on Ubuntu server 11.10 in the world right now?
2011-11-10T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	if software is not backward compatible, that is the software issue, you contact the software vendor and ask them to fix it for backwards compatability
2011-11-10T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	if it requires a version of glibc that is not shipped with ubuntu, yes
2011-11-10T02:44:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	Thank you that is all that I was asking.
2011-11-10T02:45:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	A definite answer. :)
2011-11-10T02:45:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	How ever I don't believe it and will continue my reasearch.
2011-11-10T02:45:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	waste your time and damage your machine then, don't come asking for help if you don't want the answer
2011-11-10T02:47:00.000Z	zenmaster	ikonia	Where did that come from? This is a hobby for me obviously. As I am talking about a game server. And to me learning is not wasting time. I just fail to believe in a operating system so popular would have such a huge disadvantage to such a popular game...
2011-11-10T02:47:00.000Z	zenmaster		But I understand. I'm not a Linux guy. I'm more of a Unix person myself.
2011-11-10T02:47:00.000Z	zenmaster		Now let me get the last laugh.
2011-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	zenmaster		Have a great day.
2011-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zenmaster	again if you don't want to know/accept the answer, why bother asking, just keep researching/wasting your time on how to wreck your machine
