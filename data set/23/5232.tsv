2009-10-09T17:03:00.000Z	Pici	lukasz	About launchpad? or using https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ ?
2009-10-09T17:05:00.000Z	lukasz	Pici	I'm on the website but can't find a button to post it, I'm already logged in.
2009-10-09T17:05:00.000Z	Pici	lukasz	Press the 'add' button?
2009-10-09T17:07:00.000Z	lukasz	Pici	Sorry, now I guess I get it. You must select a package first to ask a question, it can't be general, but package-related, right?
2009-10-09T17:09:00.000Z	Pici	lukasz	looking, one moment.
2009-10-09T17:12:00.000Z	Pici	lukasz	I don't know what you're seeing, in both the main launchpad and the staging server I'm not requrired to attach my question to a package.
2009-10-09T17:13:00.000Z	lukasz	Pici	Thanks for your help, I think I solved the problem. Cheers :)
