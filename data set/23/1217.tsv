2010-10-26T19:24:00.000Z	Tanvir		What is the best audio-video converter for ubuntu?
2010-10-26T19:24:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	the one you like most
2012-07-29T14:29:00.000Z	Tanvir	iceroot	can you help to solve my problem?
2012-07-29T14:30:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	connecting to 8.8.8.8?
2012-07-29T14:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	sounds like a very broken sources.list because 8.8.8.8 is not a repo but a dns server
2012-07-29T14:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	what is the outout of "ifconfig" "cat /etc/resolv.conf" and "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
2012-07-29T14:31:00.000Z	Tanvir	iceroot	aye, I tried Google Public DNS because I had problem to visit some sites, but now I cannot update. I can I go back to previous settings?
2012-07-29T14:33:00.000Z	Tanvir	iceroot	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1117230/ is for ifconfig
2012-07-29T14:36:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
2012-07-29T14:36:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	and "ping -c 4 google.com"
2012-07-29T14:39:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	both looking fine. and the output of "sudo apt-get update"
2012-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	hm looking strange
2012-07-29T14:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	you put the google dns as apt-proxy in your config
2012-07-29T14:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	/etc/apt/apt.conf:Acquire::http::proxy "http://8.8.8.8:8080/";
2012-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	why?
2012-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	remove http://8.8.8.8:8080/ from that file
2012-07-29T14:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf
2012-07-29T14:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	imo when you are setting a proxy server some tools are also changing that file
2012-07-29T14:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	but because 8.8.8.8 is not a proxy, its not working
2012-07-29T14:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	no
2012-07-29T14:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	just "sudo apt-get update"
2012-07-29T14:51:00.000Z	Tanvir	iceroot	now it is "Acquire::http::proxy "";"
2012-07-29T14:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Tanvir	put # at the start of that line
