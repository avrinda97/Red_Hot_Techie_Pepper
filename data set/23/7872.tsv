2005-04-08T09:00:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	if you use xdm/kdm/gdm then the best place to but the xset -b command is in the..hang on let me confirm the location
2005-04-08T09:11:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	are you willing to reinstall?
2005-04-08T09:11:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	if so then do a server install of ubuntu
2005-04-08T09:11:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	its as clean/minimal as you can get...then you can start adding packages you want
2005-04-08T09:11:00.000Z	keyhack	thingy	meh... I want to avoid reinstalling if I can
2005-04-08T09:12:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	its the most elegant way...the alternative is manually removing packages :-(

2005-04-08T09:13:00.000Z	keyhack	thingy	Where is this "server" install you speak of?
2005-04-08T09:13:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	when you boot up from the ubuntu cd, just type in server and hit enter
2005-04-08T09:15:00.000Z	keyhack	thingy	hmm ok
2005-04-08T09:20:00.000Z	thingy	keyhack	right...hit the functions keys for some help if you want
