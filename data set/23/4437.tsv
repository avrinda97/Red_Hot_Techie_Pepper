2007-11-25T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Hello all
2007-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I need some help with my fstab file -- currently I have a FAT32 partition mounted, but nobody (not even root) can write to the partition
2007-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80		How can I change the fstab file so that at least root can write to the partition ?
2007-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	whats the fstab entry? you may want to stick like umask=000 for mount option
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	UUID=0950-920C  /media/sdb4     vfat    defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	change that umask=007 to umask=000
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	Can I somehow remount the stuff without rebooting the whole PC?
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	sure
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	sudo mount -a
2007-11-25T10:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	sudo umount -a then that
2007-11-25T10:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	or just sudo umount the mount point
2007-11-25T10:19:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	still no go
2007-11-25T10:54:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	lies :P
2007-11-25T10:55:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	it does some games very nicely
2007-11-25T10:55:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	Ok, let me rephrase that to say "Games which depend on DirectX"
2007-11-25T10:57:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	I played some DX games that did better on Linux than Windows :P
2007-11-26T09:29:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	Ubuntu is a Linux DISTRIBUTION ;)
2007-11-26T09:29:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	Linux is just a kernel
2007-11-26T09:30:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	Right
2007-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	~ = home directory
2007-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	scguy318	oh right
2007-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Cpudan80	April 08
