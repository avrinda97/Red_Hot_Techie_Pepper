2005-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	occy		any reason why Ubuntu would be locking up computers?
2005-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	occy		My friend has had the same problem I have been having.
2005-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	at what stage?
2005-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	more details needed please :)
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy	lesshaste	I can get a lock-up doing anything CPU intensive.
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy		yeah, sorry...
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	complete lock up? Does num-lock work?
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy		it doesn't seem like I'm really doing anything in particular.
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	hardware?
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy		I'm running Windows on the same computer...
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy		with no problems.  (scary huh?)
2005-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	occy		different hard drives though
2005-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	is the lockup complete? Does num-lock work? Is there anything in the logs afterwards?
2005-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	occy		it might simply be the hard drive.
2005-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	occy	lesshaste	Don't know exactly... I've not used it for a while.  I'll test that if it happens again.
2005-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	ok... if it is a complete lockup with nothing in the logs you should try swapping drives and also memtest86
2005-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	occy		:/
2005-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	occy		k, thanks guys.  I'll give it a whirl.
2005-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	occy		do the memtest86 too
2005-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	good luck
2005-05-01T07:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	still here?
2005-05-01T07:18:00.000Z	occy		yah
2005-05-01T07:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	occy	can I pm you re: your problem?
