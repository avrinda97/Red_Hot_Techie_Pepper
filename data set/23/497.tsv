2011-07-23T17:49:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	If you were to give us some context of what's giving you that error.
2011-07-23T19:14:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	Maybe.
2011-07-24T19:54:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	Produces a hash based on the data of a file. It can be used to verify the integrity of a file; a file with different contents will have a different hash (almost all of the time)
2011-07-24T19:56:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	It won't "show you have a problem". The hash'll be different from what it should be if the ISO you have is incomplete or corrupt.
2011-07-24T19:58:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	edbian: Would depend on the size of the file
2011-07-27T18:23:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	the ubuntu user should already exist on a LiveCD.
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	So what should I do?
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	When you switch to a TTY it should prompt you for a login, right? It'll say "<hostname> login:"
2011-07-27T18:26:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	how do i go to TTY?
2011-07-27T18:26:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	Ctrl+Alt+F1
2011-07-27T18:27:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	please guide me step by step? what do i do after ctrl alt f1?
2011-07-27T18:27:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	It prompts you for a login, correct? What exactly is the problem you're attempting to solve, by the way?
2011-07-27T18:28:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	i'm trying to get pass the black screen
2011-07-27T18:29:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	Just a black screen with no prompt whatsoever? Just when it boots up, correct?
2011-07-27T18:29:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	that's right
2011-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	And you haven't tried the alternate CD like someone suggested above?
2011-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	i d/l the alternate CD.ISO and md5sum check it and checks is fine
2011-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	Is that what you're on now.
2011-08-31T04:41:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	You could look up your netbook on Ubuntu's certified hardware list
2011-08-31T04:44:00.000Z	ionite	Polah	interface wise, any difference from 11.04?
2011-08-31T04:44:00.000Z	Polah	ionite	What do oyu mean?
