2007-03-12T09:06:00.000Z	cables	vox754	that's a weird dependency
2007-03-12T09:07:00.000Z	vox754	cables	it is not a dependency, I removed Tk and that other program later... dunno why they where installed
2007-03-12T09:08:00.000Z	vox754	cables	what was that other package...? remember, something about SVG...
2007-03-12T09:08:00.000Z	cables	vox754	not sure
2007-03-12T09:09:00.000Z	vox754	cables	I remember, "skencil"; now I can rest in piece.
2007-03-12T09:09:00.000Z	cables	vox754	I have that... so that's where I got it.
2007-05-06T15:24:00.000Z	vox754	cables	use the Win XP... boot the recovery console, then "fixmbr"
2007-05-06T15:24:00.000Z	cables	vox754	do i need to do anything besides that?
2007-05-06T15:25:00.000Z	cables	vox754	do I need to know anything about the disk?
2007-05-06T15:26:00.000Z	vox754	cables	The MBR doesn't care about partitioning, but ... oyu won't be able to boot Ubuntu... if that is your concern... you'll have to reinstall GRUB later
2007-05-06T15:26:00.000Z	cables	vox754	ok, i'm not worried about that... once I get Windows working I'll set up ubuntu again
2007-05-07T16:58:00.000Z	cables	vox754	I know Perl, but I'm not sure what do do with rename.
2007-05-07T16:58:00.000Z	vox754	cables	"man rename"
2007-05-07T16:59:00.000Z	cables	vox754	:P
2007-05-07T05:39:00.000Z	cables	vox754	seriously, you heard my question.
2007-06-03T10:46:00.000Z	cables	vox754	ah, you beat me :)
2007-06-03T10:46:00.000Z	vox754	cables	zes
2007-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	vox754	cables	now that you mention it. What Mario game is available for Wii?
2007-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	cables	vox754	there are a lot of games under the mario brand, but if you mean a super mario adventurish thing, Super Mario Galaxy will come out at some point
2007-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	cables	vox754	or you can buy SMB, SM64, and other old games from Virtual Console
2007-06-18T08:05:00.000Z	cables	vox754	thank you :)
2007-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	vox754	cables	this guys has been around for quite sometime, and the truth is not even he knows what he wants.
2007-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	cables	vox754	well, I'll try to help him for a few more minutes, then I'll have to give up.
