2008-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	squidly		does anyone know of a way to convert a 32bit ubutnu install to a 64bit install?
2008-02-09T10:25:00.000Z	squidly		what about installing over my current install?
2008-02-09T10:25:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	I went the other way (64 bit to 32 bit) and the only solution I found was to install from scratch.
2008-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	that I can understand.
2008-02-09T10:29:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	may I ask why you went from 64 back to 32 bit?
2008-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	it was fiesty at the time, but I found lots of problems with 64 bit on the desktop, mainly having to do with things such as flash and java being a pita to get working, plus not being able to use w32codecs for videos, etc.
2008-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	ahh okies.. yea this will be a backend server. no gui stuff needed ;)
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	ahhh, ok, I do run some centos servers as 64 bit and I have no problems with that.  My feelings is that 64 bit is good for the server but not for the desktop.
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	not until some of the more commanly used things are moved to 64bit like java and flash
2008-02-09T10:33:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	exactly
2008-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	I tried that, but I found that the pain of getting 32 bit things to work on a setup like that was not outweighed by the performance differences of 64 bit vs 32 bit.  I just run 32 bit now and everything works painlessly.
2008-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	for me it works well with gentoo. but then everything is pretty much compiled as 64bit
2008-02-09T10:35:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	yes, I can see that it would work better with gentoo sinc eyou can control the compilation of everything.
2008-02-09T10:35:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	yep. I once I get my server in my noc at work, I will help with developmenting and making 64bit packages for ubuntu
2008-02-09T10:36:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	yep, the 64 bit packaging in ubuntu is largely good, though.  The main problems is with proprietary stuff that you can't get source code on.
2008-02-09T10:36:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	very true. that is mostly were the world would be needed
2008-02-09T10:38:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	ubuntu actually saved my old boss several times from him self :D
2008-02-09T10:39:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	cool, I have only been using ubuntu since feisty, but I've found it to be that good that I'm now recommending it and installing it on friends computers, etc.
2008-02-09T10:39:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	same here. I started with 6.02 (i think) and have been useing it ever since.
2008-02-09T10:41:00.000Z	pajamian	squidly	been on RH and then FC before that, I stopped using FC when they scrapped Fedora Legacy.
2008-02-09T10:41:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	I stoped useing roothat back around rh5
2008-02-09T10:44:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	lol tab completion ftw! :D
2008-02-09T10:45:00.000Z	squidly	pajamian	heh.. yea save here
