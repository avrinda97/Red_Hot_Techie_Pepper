2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		yo guys I just got an ubuntu 10.10 maverick vps it wont let me edit the sudo file even as root...any help?
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	visudo
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		yes
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		visudo
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		wont let me edit it
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	sudo visudo
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		even as root?
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		I have to sudo as root
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		well the group it has is %sudo
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		not admin
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		I wanted to change it to admin
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		and I wanted to add user
2011-11-20T07:30:00.000Z	eusid		no not what I am looking for. the file comes up by visudo but it is unwritable Im guessing from root I need to chdmod the privs?
2011-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	it's a read only file.. but as root you can still write to it. When you're done editting use :wq!
2011-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	eusid		alias to exec long commands quickly, bash script to execute a series of actions from a file
2011-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	eusid		ahh wq! okay thats what I was looking for I believe thank you I will try it
2011-11-20T07:33:00.000Z	eusid		I don't use vim as my normal editor Im a fairly new python guy so I actually am using jetbrains python ide for its django support very good for dev with django
2011-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	eusid		thank you much imbezol
2011-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	eusid	brjannc	yeah I am familiar with that command and setting an editor unfortunately it doesnt have nano so I will have to install. however I don't see why it wont let me write as root and even opening it with gedit will not allow me to save it
2011-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	eusid		I know vim is the answer but without me learning basically another language what is the best terminal edit that I could use on my server?
2011-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	sudo chmod u+w /etc/sudoers; sudo nano /etc/sudoers; sudo chmod -w /etc/sudoers
2011-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	or whatever editor.. you get the idea
2011-11-20T07:38:00.000Z	imbezol	eusid	or you skip all the sudo crap and just become root
