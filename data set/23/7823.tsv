2005-05-15T12:51:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i knida want to try debain after ubuntu
2005-05-15T12:51:00.000Z	bodaciousb		but i386, 686 and so on is processor acitecture right?
2005-05-15T12:52:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i run a athlon xp 2200+
2005-05-15T12:53:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i still dont undestand the difference... mandrake is a 586 distro, and it worked fine for me... redhat is a 386 and it ran fine...
2005-05-15T12:54:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i think ubuntu is a 386
2005-05-15T12:54:00.000Z	bodaciousb		oh
2005-05-15T12:54:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i love it when my questions spark a big debate
2005-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	bodaciousb		hmm ok
2005-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	concept10	bodaciousb	what cpu do you have
2005-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	bodaciousb		xp 2200
2005-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	bodaciousb		686 apparently
2005-05-15T12:56:00.000Z	bodaciousb	Skipp_OSX	dont ask me im the confused one
2005-05-15T12:56:00.000Z	bodaciousb		arch is probly much harder to learn than ubuntu?
2005-05-15T12:56:00.000Z	concept10		you have a 686, i386 and up wil work for you, ubuntu is compiled for i386, mandrake compiled for 586
2005-05-15T12:57:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i really dont thinki  can live withought APT
2005-05-15T12:57:00.000Z	concept10		you can use apt with almost any distro
2005-05-15T12:58:00.000Z	bodaciousb		i installed apt on suse 9.3... it wasnt pretty
2005-05-15T12:58:00.000Z	concept10		I use apt with fedora
2005-05-15T12:58:00.000Z	bodaciousb		whne i installed apt... it would run fine... but somehow it wasnt tied in with the system
2005-05-15T12:59:00.000Z	bodaciousb		like ... apt-get fglrx-somethinorother wouldnt do anything.... it said that it had nothing to do with that file
2005-05-15T13:00:00.000Z	concept10	bodaciousb	some distros dont have repos set up for apt
