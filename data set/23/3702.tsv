2008-12-30T01:54:00.000Z	rblst		i've just installed an ubuntu 8.04 amd64, and there is no kernel installed, nothing in /boot; how can i fix this?
2008-12-30T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	ehh.. and you're running it now? without a kernel?
2008-12-30T01:56:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	the live cd, of course
2008-12-30T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	phew.. it was getting spooky there for a minute =).. I would try a reinstall.. don't know if you can just download the kernel and install it manually without the system running
2008-12-30T01:58:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	and what would that change if i reinstall it?
2008-12-30T01:59:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	hopefully whatever happened when you installed it the first time won't happen again.. if the same thing happens again I would start checking the cd for defects, perhaps download a new iso and so on
2008-12-30T02:34:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	i reinstalled the system, but nothing changed
2008-12-30T02:35:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	have you checked the cd for errors? there is an option to do that when it boots up
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	well.. I can't really think of any reason for the installer to skip the kernels..
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	the simlinks in / are also created, but they point to no existing file
2008-12-30T02:51:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	an interesting thing: when i restarted the installer, the partitioning program said that 64M is used on /boot, although there is nothing in that directory
2008-12-30T02:52:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	you've done a fsck on that partition?
2008-12-30T02:53:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	it's a brand new disk, i bought it this afternoon, some hours ago
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	I didn't mean for the hard drive.. I meant if the file system had been messed up in the install process.. or you've formatted it during the install?
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	yes i did format it
2008-12-30T02:55:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	but i think i just fooled you and myself...
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	ok =).. what was it?
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	because the files are there, i did not mount the boot partition; still, grub does not find the files
2008-12-30T02:58:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	ahhh... then we need to find out why grub doesn't find it.. at least I like this problem better =)
2008-12-30T02:58:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	sorry for that, and thanks for coming with me this far with my folly...
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	no worries, happy to do it
2008-12-30T03:13:00.000Z	rblst	Slart	i justed had to swap hd0 and hd1, thanks a lot for your persevering help
2008-12-30T03:14:00.000Z	Slart	rblst	ah.. I've been reading up on how grub does it's magic.. interesting stuff.. you're welcome
