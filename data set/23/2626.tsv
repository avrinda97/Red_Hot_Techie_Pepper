2010-08-22T13:06:00.000Z	g0tcha		does ubuntu sever 10.4 has a firewall enabled by default?
2010-08-22T13:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	no as far as I know the firewall is disabled in ubuntu 10.04 but your adsl router will probly be set to only allow outgoing initial conections.
2010-08-22T13:17:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	hmm this is weird.. i installed Redmine and it requires port 3000, when i ssh to my ubuntu server and i use lynx to go to localhost:3000 it works fine, but on my pc's browser i get connection timed out
2010-08-22T13:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	are they on the same network?  both on local lan?
2010-08-22T13:20:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	yes, i ssh to the server from this pc to it fine
2010-08-22T13:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	oh you need to put the address of your computer not local:3000 you need something like 192.168.2.234:3000
2010-08-22T13:21:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	yeah ofcourse, in my pc browser im using the ip of ubuntu server and port 3000
2010-08-22T13:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	oh and you want to ssh?
2010-08-22T13:22:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	hmm no.. i want to open it from my pc browser using ubuntu ip:3000 but like i said i cant do that
2010-08-22T13:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	I'm not familure with redmine.  is that like a web host like apache2?
2010-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	oh you can't even ping your ubuntu server from your pc?  ping 192.168.2.123 ?
2010-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	its like a web interface
2010-08-22T13:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	well try apache2  that I can help you with.  it works very good for me to web host.
2010-08-22T13:25:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	dude, it has nothing to do with web hosting, Redmine uses Apache2 anyways, only difference is it uses its own port
2010-08-22T13:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	oh ok the pastbin me the /etc/apache2  config files
2010-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	dude, youre missing the point.. apache is not the problem :/
2010-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	so you think redmine setup a firewall?
2010-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	do you mind if i private msg you?
2010-08-22T13:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	sure
2010-08-23T09:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	that sounds like the correct place
2010-08-23T09:23:00.000Z	g0tcha	sacarlson	ah so its normal for it to be empty like this? i just open it and add what i want there?
2010-08-23T09:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	you just spelled it wrong
2010-08-23T09:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	g0tcha	it's sources.list
