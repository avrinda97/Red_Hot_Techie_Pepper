2009-01-04T10:06:00.000Z	ebaby		everex stepnote nc 1502 not found on /hardwareSupportMachines - works fine during install just want to make install settings stick after restart...
2009-01-04T10:08:00.000Z	ebaby		its using the file: "xorg.conf.new" can anyone help me to set it up correctly?
2009-01-04T10:09:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	sar is your friend it will gives you plenty of information if you don't like it try ksar a graphical frontend
2009-01-04T10:10:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	not familiar with sar can you hip me to it as I am a fresh around here
2009-01-04T10:11:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	i assume you mean type sar into terminal to get the info I need?
2009-01-04T10:17:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	command tells me i need to get 1 of 2 packages - sysstat or atsar which is the preferred choice?
2009-01-04T10:17:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	systat
2009-01-04T10:18:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	you drive is not dying no ?
2009-01-04T10:18:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	all recent harddirves support smartd
2009-01-04T10:18:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	a must read http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/know-when-your-drives-are-failing-smartd
2009-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	failed to fetch http://...  - any other cmd to get the packages
2009-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	harddrive failing is that your take on the problem...?
2009-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	no but who knows a harddrive that dy is something frequeent
2009-01-04T10:25:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	as weird as it sounds that would almost be easier to deal with than having a picture perfect install only to reboot to the Twilight zone on your screen - so I assume failed to fetch means that the machine cant access the net or the files are no longer at that location?
2009-01-04T10:25:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	yeah that's the message i got
2009-01-04T10:26:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	sorry to ask again what happens if you type : sudo apt-get install sysstat
2009-01-04T10:29:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	final message is "could not resolve 'us.archive.ubuntu.com'
2009-01-04T10:31:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	it seems it was unable to get all that it needed as 40.8kb of archives were needed and it gave that error mssg
2009-01-04T10:31:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	is the machine you are using irc ?
2009-01-04T10:32:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	no I am using another machine for this irc - the other could access net during install though
2009-01-04T10:33:00.000Z	jp_sf	ebaby	seems it lost connection
2009-01-04T10:34:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	my hunch is to figure out a way to make the settings that the machine used during install to stick after the restart. any tips on getting that to work
2009-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	ebaby	jp_sf	 I read that using the cmd "sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" might get the settings to stick but I get an error mssg when I enter that  not sure why though
