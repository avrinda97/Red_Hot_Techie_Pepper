2006-11-17T08:33:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	there are many options
2006-11-17T08:27:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	what's up?
2006-11-17T08:27:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	i get an error when i try to play AVI's. i think i need to do something with win32.. or something
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	do you have the w32codecs installed?  'dpkg -l w32codecs'
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	i dont think so
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	what happens when you run 'sudo aptitude install w32codecs'
2006-11-17T08:30:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	you probably can't install it without adding a 'patent problem' repository
2006-11-17T08:30:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	it does allot of stuff :/
2006-11-17T08:31:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	the error is: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device
2006-11-17T08:32:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	totally different problem, sorry.  run 'mplayer -vo help' to see what options are available for video output
2006-11-17T08:35:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	choose -vo xv for the best accelerated output.  if that doesn't work then use -vo x11
2006-11-17T08:38:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	entering mplayer -vo xv, and mplayer -vo x11 in terminal returned errors/help list
2006-11-17T08:38:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	that brings me back to the idea that you don't have the correct windows codecs installed
2006-11-17T08:39:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	how might i install these codecs?
2006-11-17T08:39:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	is it possible to do so via terminal?
2006-11-17T08:41:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	w32codecs check out http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy for more information
2006-11-17T08:41:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	will start reading up
2006-11-17T08:42:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	should i run this code?: sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl gstreamer0.10-plugins-base \
2006-11-17T08:44:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	that will attempt to get totem codecs which is different and I don't think that you have the right repositories.  Ubuntu can't offer patent infringing packages
2006-11-17T08:44:00.000Z	rasman	Suavsilk_	http://seveas.theplayboymansion.net/seveas/ has the repository list
2006-11-17T08:44:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	i see
2006-11-17T08:45:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	im runing the code i posted b4, at the end it does have win32codecs
2006-11-17T08:53:00.000Z	Suavsilk_	rasman	skreet, bruenig, somehow during what i did i managed to get Totem Movie Player 2.16.2 to work perfectly... ive decided to uninstall MPlayer. thanks for your help
