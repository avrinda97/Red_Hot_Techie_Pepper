2011-04-07T03:11:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Yes, I've had it installed for God knows how long.
2011-04-07T03:11:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Just go to Applitcations->Ubuntu Software Center, and search for "Gnome3"
2011-04-07T03:12:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	What?
2011-04-07T03:13:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	The full DE, yes.
2011-04-07T03:13:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Log out, choose the DE, log in.
2011-04-07T03:14:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Ask your question. I'm here for help, but if I need to help you first to get it then so be it. What's your question?
2011-04-07T03:15:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	So you want to isntall GNOME3, that is correct?
2011-04-07T03:25:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Go to Ubuntu Software Center, search GNOME3, make sure that one's installed.
2011-04-07T03:26:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Then just Log Out, choose your Environment, and Log In
2011-04-07T05:15:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	It's also under places in GNOME3
2011-04-07T05:16:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Wait, what did you try it in? You're in Ubuntu either way.
2011-04-07T05:16:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	You never leave Ubuntu.
2011-04-16T13:22:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Go to the Gnome3 site and go to "Try it" or whatever
2011-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	Starminn	pooltable	Glad to hear it. Just try it live from the CD. You'll have ot use unetbootin to burn the .iso
