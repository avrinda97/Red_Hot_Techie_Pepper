2011-06-22T01:15:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	okay, and how does that help me?
2011-06-22T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	sorry, I just saw that it doesn't really help, looking into it
2011-06-22T01:19:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	you said VM? then use <host key> F1
2011-06-22T01:19:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	no luck
2011-06-22T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	on the splash screen just press <alt> <left> until you get the "recovery menu"
2011-06-22T01:21:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	no sorry.
2011-06-22T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	I just did exactly that, -- btw do you *really* need runlevel 1? or just a terminal?
2011-06-22T01:22:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	I want to remount root ro
2011-06-22T01:23:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	use a live CD? runlevel 1 is the recovery menu on ubuntu
2011-06-22T01:23:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	done it, <host-key>+f1 and then type telinit 1 there doh
2011-06-22T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	all set now?
2011-06-22T01:24:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	yeah it pops the spash screen up again, but I have to quickly press <host>+f1 again, then I get the recovery menu...
2011-06-22T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	good :)
2011-06-22T01:27:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	now I do: mount -o remount,ro /dev/sda1 and it says device is busy?
2011-06-22T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	thats whi I suggested to use a live "CD" (iso)
2011-06-22T01:29:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	yep that would be better, but I thought you should be able to remount root in runlevel 1?
2011-06-22T01:30:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	not to my knowledge
2011-06-22T01:30:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	well that's what man zerofree told me.
2011-06-22T01:31:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	no idea wha zerofree might be :)
2011-06-22T01:32:00.000Z	giles	guntbert	it zero's your free space.
2011-06-22T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	giles	I see, no experience with that here, but as Isaid: use a live CD :)
