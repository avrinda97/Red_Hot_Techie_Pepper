2007-01-02T11:28:00.000Z	Sensae		Can anyone give me a hand with this crontab? http://www.pastebin.com/849385
2007-01-02T11:29:00.000Z	Sensae		I've got a crontab working, but it isn't doing what I want.
2007-01-02T11:30:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	In what sense?
2007-01-02T11:30:00.000Z	Sensae	phiwum	You can see it here http://www.pastebin.com/849385 I did a sudo crontab -e to create it. The crontab executes, but it restarts the computer instead of locking the perosn out
2007-01-02T11:31:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Thanks, I'll have a look.  One difference: I want a cron as a user, not as root.
2007-01-02T11:32:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Well, not sure why cron is killing your computer, but the syntax is just as I expected it.  No differences there.
2007-01-02T11:39:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	So you didn't have to do anything special to create that crontab?  Just crontab -e, right?
2007-01-02T11:39:00.000Z	Sensae	phiwum	Yes
2007-01-02T11:39:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Because I just can't seem to get cron to notice my crontabs!
2007-01-02T11:40:00.000Z	Sensae	phiwum	I've never tried to create a user one, only root
2007-01-02T11:40:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	I tried to create a root one, too.  No difference.
2007-01-02T11:40:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Cron just doesn't care about me.
2007-01-02T11:41:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Not even when I'm pretending to be root.
2007-01-02T11:41:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	(sniff)
2007-01-02T11:43:00.000Z	Sensae	phiwum	Not sure what to say, I'm here for crontab help too
2007-01-02T11:43:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Weird!  I killed and restarted the cron daemon and the little bugger finally noticed my jobs.
2007-01-02T11:45:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Very strange.  It doesn't notice changes unless I restart it.
2007-01-02T11:45:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Or perhaps at some  other times?
2007-01-02T11:45:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Not what I've come to expect from Slackware's cron daemon.
2007-01-02T11:49:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	I guess my problem was transient.  Sorry, I've never tried to log someone out via cron jobs, so I'm not sure I can help you.
2007-01-02T11:49:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	But have you tried your approach "by hand"?
2007-01-02T11:50:00.000Z	Sensae	phiwum	Just trying it now, the system's in another room, I can't log him out because he isn't part of sudo, though I can log myself in as only user and try it, brb
2007-01-02T11:56:00.000Z	phiwum	Sensae	Sounds good...
