2007-05-08T10:12:00.000Z	borgista		Question/Problem: My Optical Drives are detected but they don't detect a Blank CD-R.
2007-05-08T10:13:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 did you enable it in menu > system > prefs > removable media ... ?
2007-05-08T10:13:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	it's set to automount anything
2007-05-08T10:13:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 do you have the correct command to start the prog ?
2007-05-08T10:14:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	well I'm using the launcher in the menu to launch GnomeBaker to burn a CD.
2007-05-08T10:14:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 that app I directed you to  has a switch in it to start a prog when blank media is mounted
2007-05-08T10:15:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	all the "ticks" are marked off, so I'd assume all should 'just work' as it did in Edgy.
2007-05-08T10:15:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	just reviewing the basic
2007-05-08T10:15:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	ok, thanks :-)
2007-05-08T10:21:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	any other ideas on why my drives ARE detected but no cd-r's?
2007-05-08T10:22:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	not realy,  I assume you have tried several cd to make sure it wasn't one borked one
2007-05-08T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	and itworks in other OS ? and it reads cd fine ?
2007-05-08T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 do you mean you can'T burn cd at all ? I thought you were just complaiing that it didn' auto start
2007-05-08T10:24:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	I can't burn a CD because the CD-RW drive doesn't detect when I put a disk in there
2007-05-08T10:24:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	check the device manager  and make sure the cdrw is recognised properly
2007-05-08T10:24:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	I'll check
2007-05-08T10:26:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	all seems fine in the "device manager"
2007-05-08T10:27:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 check the forum
2007-10-05T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	is the cd damaged ?
2007-10-05T08:44:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	why does it need to be force mounted ?
2007-10-05T08:44:00.000Z	borgista	Pelo	maybe dbus is messed-up
2007-10-05T08:45:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	will it mount manualy ?
2007-10-05T08:45:00.000Z	Pelo	borgista	 in the terminal   mount /dev/cdrom1 /media/cdrom
