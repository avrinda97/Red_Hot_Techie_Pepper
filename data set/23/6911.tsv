2009-04-27T17:08:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	What is your question?
2009-04-27T17:05:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	What do you have on the drive now?
2009-04-27T17:06:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	Grub MBR?
2009-04-27T17:06:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	And what are you trying to do?  ultimately
2009-04-27T17:07:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	grub is installed by default, it is your boot loader.
2009-04-27T17:08:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	I very well know what is Grub
2009-04-27T17:08:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	I want to replace it with Vista Bootloader
2009-04-27T17:09:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	My question was, if use grub-setup to install it in root partition will it be erased from MBR?
2009-04-27T17:09:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	That would be a difficult task and not much of a reason for it.
2009-04-27T17:09:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	Grub is a very capable boot loader.  You should stick with it.
2009-04-27T17:10:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	why dfficult task?
2009-04-27T17:10:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	I will still use it to start ubuntu
2009-04-27T17:10:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	But it won't be there in MBR
2009-04-27T17:10:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	But you justs aid that you wanted to replace Grub with Vista's boot loader.
2009-04-27T17:11:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	Is your Linux system booting ok?
2009-04-27T17:12:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	Is your Vista system booting ok?
2009-04-27T17:12:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	Yup, but with the help of grub chainloading bcd.
2009-04-27T17:13:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	bcd was working well
2009-04-27T17:14:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	What is bcd?
2009-04-27T17:15:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	Vista Boot loader, replacement of NTLDR
2009-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	Try scp
2009-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	raddy	usr13	Nautilus won't support scp.
2009-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	usr13	raddy	What are you trying to do?
