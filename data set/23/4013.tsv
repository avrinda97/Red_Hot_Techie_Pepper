2008-04-03T13:15:00.000Z	Riot777		vmware server haven't got any good option except "samba sharing" for sharing files between os and virtual os
2008-04-03T13:16:00.000Z	Riot777		I would recommend you really good, fast, virtualisation software called VirtualBox it has such option without installing stuff DOOM_NX
2008-04-03T13:16:00.000Z	Riot777		www.virtualbox.org
2008-04-03T13:16:00.000Z	Riot777		it's faster than vmware and qemu
2008-04-03T13:16:00.000Z	Riot777		even
2008-04-03T13:17:00.000Z	Riot777		rocket I would say :d

2008-04-03T13:17:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		but
2008-04-03T13:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		i can't forward ports to virtual machine's applications
2008-04-03T13:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		in vmware i can use bridged network
2008-04-03T13:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		plus it says: Choose VM > Settings > Options > Shared Folders
2008-04-03T13:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		no shared folders anyway
2008-04-03T13:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		anywhere*
2008-04-03T13:19:00.000Z	Riot777		well you could try virtualbox again if it was some period ago cause it's often updated (new releases every now and then)
2008-04-03T13:19:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		it's the last version
2008-04-03T13:19:00.000Z	Riot777		ah :d
