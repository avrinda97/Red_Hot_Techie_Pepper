2008-06-03T08:41:00.000Z	TiZ_		Oh! Okay, thanks!
2008-06-03T08:41:00.000Z	TiZ_		That may very well do it.
2008-06-03T08:41:00.000Z	TiZ_		Let's hope.
2008-06-03T08:42:00.000Z	TiZ_		Haha. Full Control.
2008-06-03T08:42:00.000Z	TiZ_		Let's see if it works
2008-06-03T08:42:00.000Z	TiZ_		Blast.
2008-06-03T08:42:00.000Z	TiZ_		It didn't work.
2008-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	TiZ_		Ugh, this is crazy.
2008-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	TiZ_		I'll just do what I need to do from Windows later.
2008-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	TiZ_		I have to go back to play games sometime anyways.
2008-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	why?
2008-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	what do you mean?
2008-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	what games are you playing that wont ply better on linux?
2008-06-03T08:47:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	*play
2008-06-03T08:48:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	zsnes?
2008-06-03T08:48:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	ZSNES runs badly in Ubuntu. osu! does not yet run at all on Linux. I don't know about Audiosurf.
2008-06-03T08:50:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	so i am assuming you have tried here?  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Gutsy#Super_Nintendo_Emulator_.28ZSNES.29_1.510_for_i386.2FAMD64
2008-06-03T08:51:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	I'm using Hardy. Is this issue present in Hardy?
2008-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	and you say play is poor?,,,
2008-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	Very much so.
2008-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	what do you mean, "config to play better"?
2008-06-03T08:59:00.000Z	SeaPhor	TiZ_	   in the emulator, there is config , via settings, prefs, etc
2008-06-03T08:59:00.000Z	TiZ_	SeaPhor	I know all that. As I said, turning off the graphics filter makes it run at full speed. But I shouldn't have to do that when my computer is well capable of doing better
