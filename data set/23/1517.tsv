2010-02-17T02:15:00.000Z	aarce		OK.  so the only solution I have is to add the sftp user to the group root
2010-02-17T02:15:00.000Z	aarce		and that just plain doesn't seem right.
2010-02-17T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	you've not setup your jail correctly
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	so it's owned by root - that's why it's not going to work
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	unless you're root
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	If anyone else owns it, it denies login
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	that's just your ftp setup being wrong
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	in reality root should not be allowed to login
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	*nod*  the question is... where?
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	well first of all, I'm worried how you got root to login as root has no password and root is also disabled in the ftp user file
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	root's not allowed login.  I log in as myself and the sudo -s
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	also, this is sftp/scp, not ftp
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	sudo has nothing to do with your ftp login
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	you can't do sudo from an ftp shell
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	not in an ftp shell
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	then you're not ftp'ing to something
2010-02-17T02:20:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	two separate users.  aarce and aatest.  aarce is logged in SSH right now, sudo'ed.  I want to jail aatest to /home/aatest, let him sftp, let him scp, but let him not browse above /home/aatest
2010-02-17T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	oh, so you want to ssh into the box and jail the ssh
2010-02-17T02:21:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	somewhat relevant is that the box and I are 1800 miles apart.  =)
2010-02-17T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	setting up an ssh jail is quite complex as you need to link the binaries you need to the jail and libraries,
2010-02-17T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	that's why you can't do anything like ls once your in
2010-02-17T02:22:00.000Z	aarce	ikonia	I dont' specifically need to be able to ls.  just write to the thing
2010-02-17T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	aarce	but you won't have access to any of the commands as tools like "ls" are in /bin
