2008-07-26T09:07:00.000Z	amirman		is there a channel for X issues in ubuntu?
2008-07-26T09:07:00.000Z	unop	amirman	usually this is it.
2008-07-26T09:10:00.000Z	unop	amirman	how do you usually start the other sessions?
2008-07-26T09:11:00.000Z	amirman	unop	i haven't started any successfully on ubuntu, let me find the script i was using
2008-07-26T09:11:00.000Z	unop	amirman	you can make your own set of autorization files that xauth can use - perhaps that's something you could look into
2008-07-26T09:11:00.000Z	amirman	unop	you know where i can find some newbie friendly documentation on it? or what i can search for?
2008-07-26T09:12:00.000Z	unop	amirman	the xauth manpage is quite straight forward
2008-07-26T09:13:00.000Z	amirman	unop	here's the script i was using http://pastebin.com/f50f9c3a7

2008-07-26T09:19:00.000Z	amirman	unop	thanks! i was just about to tell you how confusing these man pages are
2008-08-09T03:21:00.000Z	unop	amirman	what do you mean?
2008-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	amirman	unop	i heard the advantage of using aptitude over apt-get was that aptitude would look at a metapackage and when removing it would also take all the packages it installed along with it, but when i was running aptitude remove it was only removing the metapackage, i was wondering if there was a way to tell it to remove everything that it installs
2008-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	amirman	unop	but i found another dirty solution so it's not a major issue anymore but it would still be nice to know

2008-08-29T05:32:00.000Z	unop	amirman	do you want to be able to interact with the app ?
2008-08-29T05:32:00.000Z	amirman	unop	yeah definitely, i want to be able to switch between the app and my desktop with alt+f7 alt+f6
2008-08-29T05:33:00.000Z	unop	amirman	see   man 1 xinit
