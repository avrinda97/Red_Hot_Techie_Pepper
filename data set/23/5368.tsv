2007-01-28T12:47:00.000Z	Alpha232		is it me or does ubuntu make it impossible to compile shit
2007-01-28T12:47:00.000Z	Alpha232		the readme is useless
2007-01-28T12:48:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	it's you
2007-01-28T12:57:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	what package doesn't make any kind of makefile?  are you sure you downloaded the source?
2007-01-28T12:59:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	this is a high-traffic channel. please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-01-28T12:59:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	whoa... what makes this off topic?
2007-01-28T12:59:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	   i type in  apt-get source apache2
2007-01-28T13:00:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	i get source that has no source!
2007-01-28T13:00:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	that isn't the apache 2 source
2007-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	you're asking apt-get to download two packages, one called apache2 and one called "source"
2007-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	uhhh no
2007-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	yes, the command-line is space delimited
2007-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	read the manpage for apt-get
2007-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	packages which are source have names like apache2-source
2007-01-28T13:16:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	I dunno what you're whining about, there source is in that package
2007-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	it's funny how you tell other people to RTFM when they try to help you
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	do you want to start this up again?
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	Alpha232	proqesi	 man apt-get
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	it took two seconds to find the source
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	dunno if I should even help trolls like you
2007-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	/etc/apt/apache2-2.0.53/upstream/tarballs/
2007-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	proqesi	Alpha232	and stop asking me to man apt-get.. I didn't ask you for help with it
