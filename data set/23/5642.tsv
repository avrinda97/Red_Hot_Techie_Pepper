2007-01-22T07:41:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	run a new terminal [the file is only loaded when the terminal starts] 
2007-01-22T07:42:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	opened a new terminal and a new firefox, but still not found in the applet
2007-01-22T07:44:00.000Z	Svish		echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2007-01-22T07:44:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	firefox [if you're running it from the menu or something]  won't pick up the environment variables until you log out and in again... but running it from the [new]  terminal should work
2007-01-22T07:44:00.000Z	Svish		lol.. that shouldve been in the terminal..
2007-01-22T07:44:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	how do I run http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/jmfdiagnostics.html from the terminal?
2007-01-22T07:47:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	either by running firefox [just typing it]  from the terminal, then going there, or using "appletviewer url.html"
2007-01-22T07:47:00.000Z	Svish		um... Where did the classpath go?? after opening new terminal, echo $CLASSPATH returns nothing
2007-01-22T07:48:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	hmm... well, i wasn't following the conversation very well, so i'm not 100% sure how it was set up, but someone should be able to help - i'm going to bed however
2007-01-22T07:49:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	ok. I used export variablename=value
2007-01-22T07:50:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	and you put it in .bashrc?
2007-01-22T07:50:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	i dont know, lol. he just told me to run export
2007-01-22T07:50:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	dont know what that does..
2007-01-22T07:51:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	but I think I have found a tutorial on how to do this here now....
2007-01-22T07:51:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	so you just go to bed if you want to :)
2007-01-22T07:51:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	oh, i think he meant put it in the .bashrc file [eg, by running "gedit ~/.bashrc" and adding whatever lines to the end]  - this is the file that's run each time you open a new terminal
2007-01-22T07:52:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	using export from the terminal by just running it will only take effect in that terminal session
2007-01-22T07:52:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	ah ok. how can I make it permanent then?
2007-01-22T07:53:00.000Z	Svish		i am in the /etc/bash.bashrc file now. do i just add like, $JMFHOME=somepath at the end of the file or?
2007-01-22T07:54:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	putting the export thingos in bashrc will make it permanent [but require you to open a new terminal for it to take effect, and you'll need to log out and in again for it to take effect system-wide] 
2007-01-22T07:55:00.000Z	Svish	zak_	aha, so I add the whole export JMFHOME=bla bla there?
2007-01-22T07:56:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	yep
2007-01-22T07:57:00.000Z	zak_	Svish	bashrc files are just a bunch of normal shell commands, only they're executed every time the shell is started
