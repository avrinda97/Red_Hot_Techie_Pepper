2008-08-03T11:40:00.000Z	gavi		i have a computer that intermitantly boots, what would you say is the problem?
2008-08-03T11:41:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	bad power supply
2008-08-03T11:41:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	i just right swaped that 5 minuts ago
2008-08-03T11:42:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	was it doing that before you replaced power supply?
2008-08-03T11:42:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	i have a feeling the computer is possibly not grounded properly
2008-08-03T11:42:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	yes that would do it
2008-08-03T11:43:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	i waited till i had the problem. powered computer, pc froze in the middle of boot, rebooted, and problem occoured
2008-08-03T11:44:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	before i take out the board and test the computer outside, would you recommend anything else?
2008-08-03T11:45:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	most likely culprits are power supply and possibly memory
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	there is a channel    #hardware   they may know
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	ill try it out
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	good luck
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	thanx
2008-08-03T11:47:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	the channel is actually   ##hardware
2008-08-03T11:52:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	#hardware is dead, but as im taking out the boared, i notice that the heatsink is very hot!
2008-08-03T11:53:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	yes overheating will definitely cause that.especially if unplugging it for 15 minues helps
2008-08-03T11:54:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	  are all fans working
2008-08-03T11:54:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	all 3 of them
2008-08-03T11:55:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	do u have any idea what dualcore temperature should be running at?
2008-08-03T11:58:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	no sorry id don't.  maybe google                 dual core normal temperature
2008-08-03T12:05:00.000Z	gavi	legend2440	i have a feeling it is temperature now! :-)
2008-08-03T12:05:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	yes i think so too. especially since you mentioned that a 15 minute cooling period helps
2008-08-03T12:06:00.000Z	legend2440	gavi	  especially with dual core
