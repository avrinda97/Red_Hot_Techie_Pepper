2006-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	IdleOne		follow the link ubotu just sent you
2006-02-24T07:14:00.000Z	IdleOne		how can I check what type of ram I have?
2006-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	'free'
2006-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 not the amount I want type . I have an old machine here
2006-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	ahh what type? I doubt it.. what sort of CPU is it?
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	slot 1 or socket type?
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 beats me
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 how do I tell the difference?
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	I assume its most likely on SD-RAM
2006-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 this box is atleast 6 years old if not older
2006-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	when you open the case up, if you see slot 1, there will be a black catridge sitting in it with Intel Pentium 2 words written on it. otherwise its socket. but I presume in most cases it uses SD-RAM
2006-03-02T08:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 mirc does that if he he has it set that way
2006-03-02T08:57:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	hmm.. for irc client.. its been awhile since I last used mirc..
2006-03-02T09:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 now you know where to start from ()
2006-03-02T09:01:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	hmm, flashing on XChat, maybe its under options somewhere I presume
2006-03-02T09:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 let me peak around here in xchat
2006-03-02T09:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 uses irssi I believe
2006-03-02T09:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	hatake_kakashi	 comes with breezy also
2006-03-02T09:09:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	IdleOne	ahh ok
