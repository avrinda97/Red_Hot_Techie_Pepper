2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	schloob		does anyone have a clue why my terminals might be colorless? the only colored text i see is from the ls command. any ideas?
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	where do you expect color and not see it?
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	like.. in vim
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	dunno about vim
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	or usually my prompts (like user@host:~$) are green
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	does it work on the console in color?
2006-04-03T07:12:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	what? -.-
2006-04-03T07:12:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	which terminal emulator are you using? i get good results with xterm
2006-04-03T07:12:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	i mean on the linux console, the one at control-alt-f2 (hit alt-f7 to return to the gui)
2006-04-03T07:12:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	aterm, but neither xterm or gnome-terminal work either.. (oh, i'll try my tty's)
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	it's probably a vim issue, i guess
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	nope, nothing for my tty terminals either.
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	i know it's not a vim issue, it's not only vim
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	that was just an example
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	oh, ok. dunno then
2006-04-03T07:13:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	:[
2006-04-03T07:14:00.000Z	schloob		another question, how do i like add the unstable branch to my list thingy? i want aterm 1.0, but it's not in the breezy tree
2006-04-03T07:16:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	try this: perl -MTerm::ANSIColor -e 'print color green; print "foo\n"'
2006-04-03T07:16:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	yeah, that works
2006-04-03T07:16:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	hm
2006-04-03T07:17:00.000Z	useruser	schloob	maybe something's wrong with your curses installation.. or something
2006-04-03T07:17:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	i don't see why curses would be the problem
2006-04-03T07:19:00.000Z	schloob	useruser	while i'm talking to you, do you know if it's possible to add the dapper list of packages to my list of repositories? i'm using breezy 5.10
