2009-02-16T07:42:00.000Z	alicia		how can i boot another user off of an ssh connection?
2009-02-16T07:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	  as root you could 'kill PID' of their shell.
2009-02-16T07:44:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	they have access as a super user too
2009-02-16T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 so?   If you want to close a ssh connection. You kill the priocess id of the ssh connection or the shell running on it.  or restart the ssh server. (that may not work, ive not tried that)
2009-02-16T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 find the PID of the other users shell, with the 'ps ax' command , and 'sudo kill PID' to kill it
2009-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	how do you know which one?
2009-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 which one for what?
2009-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 not a clue
2009-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	haha thanks
2009-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 see what commands they are running.. or other info or how long they have been connected
2009-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 theres also the 'pstree' command that may help
2009-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	they are just sitting on there closing the things i have running
2009-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	they are one of my friends
2009-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 they why not ask them to log off if you want them to leave?
2009-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	because i'd have to walk down the hall
2009-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 Oh the Humanity of it all! egads!@
2009-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	and they are just messing with me anyway
2009-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 reboot :)
2009-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	but i don't want to reboot every time
2009-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	they did this before
2009-02-16T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 then learn to use pstree,  and ps - I guess. try one.  worse it can do is disconnect the wrong person
2009-02-16T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alicia	 # ps ax | grep bash   narrows it down a bit. :) you may hafe to use 'sudo kill -9 PID'
2009-02-16T08:04:00.000Z	alicia	Dr_willis	it seems to be taking a really long time
