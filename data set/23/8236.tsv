2005-03-01T10:02:00.000Z	britt_radiofree		so, typeahead in epiphany hasn't worked for me forever ... can anyone confirm having or not having this problem?
2005-03-01T10:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	lots of firefox devotees here I suspect ;)
2005-03-01T10:04:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	surely someone uses ephy! :)
2005-03-01T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	I used to use galeon until Havoc and co took it out of gnome, effectively - so I'm a little biased against epiphany ;)
2005-03-01T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	although it's a nice browser - I'm not trying to start a holy war ;-)
2005-03-01T10:06:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	yeah, there are obviously pros and cons to both ephy and ff, which have been discussed ad hom. :)
2005-03-01T10:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	the lack of configurability in epiph drives me nuts
2005-03-01T10:07:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	what does ff allow you to configure that ephy doesnt?
2005-03-01T10:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	if youu know a command to make it open tabs without popping in my face, I'm all ears
2005-03-01T10:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	with galeon you did galeon --no-raise -n
2005-03-01T10:09:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	don't get me wrong, when developing web apps I use ff for the extensions, but i personally prefer ephy for general browsing
2005-03-01T10:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	as I said, it's nice enough  - but  a lot of galeon's options are missing
2005-03-01T10:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	I like to open stuff from other apps in the bckground: afaik you can't do it with epiphany
2005-03-01T10:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	I have to shunt the browser to another workspace to avoid it covering what I'm reading when it loads
2005-03-01T10:12:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	you mean you click 'open link in new window'?
2005-03-01T10:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	no, for example if I click an URL in an email. it pops up regardless of what options I enter (new tab or whatever)
2005-03-01T10:14:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	well that's a metacity thing
2005-03-01T10:14:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	the fix is in, but everyone has to fix their apps, which hasn't been completed yet so it's not going to make 2.10
2005-03-01T10:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	no it isn't - with galeon you could do galeon --no-raise -n
2005-03-01T10:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	you could specify that in gconf or whatever
2005-03-01T10:15:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	thoreauputic	that might have been a temp fix in galeon, but the proper solution is desktop-wide w/ metacity
2005-03-01T10:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	you see my irritation though? Gnome needs to have a *few* configurable options that don't require workarounds
2005-03-01T10:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	britt_radiofree	heh - actually I use fluxbox a lot because it obeys my changes- changing gnome has become awkward. i know the reasons - i just find some things illogical
