2006-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	cyphase		*sigh*
2006-02-21T15:35:00.000Z	cyphase		haha
2006-02-21T15:35:00.000Z	cyphase		well, not accused exactly..
2006-02-21T15:35:00.000Z	cyphase		but the guy pretty much told everyone that i'd hacked into it
2006-02-21T15:36:00.000Z	cyphase		all i did was boot a linux live cd on a desktop computer there
2006-02-21T15:38:00.000Z	cyphase		for whatever reason
2006-02-21T15:38:00.000Z	cyphase		so he might just be repeating false information from someone else
2006-02-21T15:38:00.000Z	cyphase		and you know how they have monitoring programs on school computers..
2006-02-21T15:39:00.000Z	cyphase		i think he might have sniffed my password when i tried to SSH into this computer from there
2006-02-21T15:39:00.000Z	cyphase		not very good, consdiering it worked :P
2006-02-21T15:39:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	how could he sniff the password from ssh ? it's encrypted... ?
2006-02-21T15:40:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	i meant keylogged
2006-02-21T15:40:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	but weren't you using a linux live cd?
2006-02-21T15:41:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	yes
2006-02-21T15:41:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	and it isn't downloading, probably because traffic :)
2006-02-21T15:42:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	i mean wine
2006-02-21T15:42:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	yeah, I had to retry like 20 times to get the whole thing
2006-02-21T15:43:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	i haven't quite hit 20 yet :P
2006-04-21T11:35:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	my laptops are only running linux..
2006-04-21T11:36:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	i'm not talking about us geeks
2006-04-21T11:37:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	my father in law is using linux on his laptop. And he's not a geek
2006-04-21T11:37:00.000Z	cyphase	polpak	i didn't say only geeks use linux
2006-04-21T11:37:00.000Z	polpak	cyphase	I just told him I wouldn't do support for windows computers anymore
