2007-02-08T12:01:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		Woohoo! Nobody helped me but I managed to fix my system anyway! xD I had to reinstall libgnomevfs2-0 and libxkbfile1
2007-02-08T12:02:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		I accidentally deleted all files on my system that had the string "file.so" in them.
2007-02-08T12:02:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	woops!
2007-02-08T12:03:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	yeah. xD Someone gave me a command that was to help me conveniantely erase multiple files of the same name so I wouldn't have to do it by hand. I copied their command and forgot to change "file.so" in their example to what I needed.
2007-02-08T12:04:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	which .so ?
2007-02-08T12:04:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	next time a ls before rm would've been better
2007-02-08T12:06:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	So far, I know that I lost libaudiofile.so.0, libfile.so, and libbxkbfile.so. I managed to reinstall the packages that needed those (from failsafe terminal mode), and everything seems to be working alright. I'm not sure though, if any others are gone.
2007-02-08T12:06:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	lol  g'luck
2007-02-08T12:08:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	lol thank you. They had me run a for i in 'locate file.so'; do sudo rm $i; done. I was supposed to change "file.so" to "libflashplayer.so", but I didn't think of that.
2007-02-08T12:10:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	lol , let me copy down those cmds and try
2007-02-08T12:10:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		nooo dont
2007-02-08T12:10:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	:P j/k
2007-02-08T12:10:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		xD haha
2007-02-08T12:11:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	do you have a relatively average install of dapper? If so, can you run a locate file.so, to give me an idea of what else might be missing?
2007-02-08T12:15:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	http://www.pastebin.ca/345636 , sorry the pastbin is kind of slow
2007-02-08T12:16:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	wow, I'm missing alot of stuff. xD
2007-02-08T12:16:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	some of it you might not need, like kvirc
2007-02-08T12:17:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	Some of it I don't know what it is. Oh, and my sound is playing at slightly higher pitch and speed for some reason. xD A shutdown, waiting for a few seconds and then restarting should fix that though. It always does.
2007-02-08T12:17:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	lol strange beast you got there
2007-02-08T12:17:00.000Z	yellow		lol
2007-02-08T12:18:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	lol, yeah. It seems to like to do that sometimes if I start it up too soon after shutting down.
2007-02-08T12:18:00.000Z	yellow	AmaroqWolf	that reminds me of some TVs i've encountered, *kick it >> not works >> kick it some more >> still not works >>> karate chop >>> voila
2007-02-08T12:19:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	yellow	haha.
