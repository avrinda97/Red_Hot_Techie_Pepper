2008-02-27T06:57:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		I'll be going AFK to watch the Obama/Clinton debate.... be back later
2008-02-27T06:58:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		RedHeron, it's like watching a boxing match :)
2008-02-27T06:59:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	I know... but they have smiles on their faces.
2008-02-27T06:59:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	i know!! :) ok going AFK
2008-03-01T10:23:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	Depends on the syntax... that's PHP syntax.
2008-03-01T10:24:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	ah..... in SQL it's !=
2008-03-01T10:24:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	Right, but in PHP, a single "=" means "store the left into the right".
2008-03-01T10:25:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	:) well not being a php-person, we just spoke past each other, is all........ :-)
2008-03-01T10:25:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	Yep.
2008-03-01T10:33:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	You're talking about adding features to IRC???
2008-03-01T10:33:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	lol ... who, me?
2008-03-01T10:33:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	hey if it were up to me.. I'd run them off independently off large VM's and mirror them
2008-03-01T10:34:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	That would be fun to set up. :-)
2008-03-01T10:35:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	imagine it ... virtual IP connections with fully transparent TCP stacks mirroring to VMs.... it'd be like RAIDing the IRC :-)
2008-03-01T10:35:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	I know... I was thinking about redundancy.
2008-03-01T10:36:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	But then the fun part would be tunneling protocols and obtaining a QoS guarantee for IRC relays on every continent. :-)
2008-03-01T10:36:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	1990s? It was happening in the 1980's, too... since I was online in 1984.
2008-03-01T10:36:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	bah!!!!!!!!  Put Riverbed WAN (WAAS) acceleration devices at the edge routers ...end of QoS
2008-03-01T10:37:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	1991 for me..........
2008-03-01T10:37:00.000Z	RedHeron	Bossmanbeta	You're footing the bill for those WAAS devices, right?
2008-03-01T10:38:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	RedHeron	... of course... I will go to my ATM in fantasyland (where we're building this monument to IRC'dom) and withdraw the funnymoney for it.. or maybe I'll enter next year's WSOP and go all in on a 7/2 offsuit :-)
