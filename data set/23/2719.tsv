2009-06-09T13:53:00.000Z	cypha		can someone tell me what the CL command is for "showing an application"?
2009-06-09T13:53:00.000Z	cypha		like "restoring" it
2009-06-09T13:53:00.000Z	cypha		an application that is already running
2009-06-09T13:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	You mean like...restoring an application window? Unminimizing it?
2009-06-09T13:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Well - can't your alt-tab to it?
2009-06-09T14:24:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Have you tried typing ggl-gtk from a terminal?
2009-06-09T14:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	I suspect you have gnome. Please try: ggl-gtk
2009-06-09T14:26:00.000Z	cypha	tiyowan	how do i uninstall ggl-qt then?
2009-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	If you install an application that uses the qt widgets (which is the one used by the KDE environment), then the qt libraries will be installed as, regardless of whether you're using gnome or kde. And that is why you see the QT4 settings in gnome
2009-06-09T14:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	If it didn't report any errors, then you should be ok. :)
2009-06-09T14:29:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Are you trying to install google gadgets?
2009-06-09T14:30:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	You had the wrong version installed. Try sudo apt-get install google-gadgets-gtk now.
2009-06-09T14:30:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	After running this command, "Google Gadgets" should show up in Applications -> Internet
2009-06-09T14:31:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Ignore that for the moment.
2009-06-09T14:31:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	It's probably a left-over menu reference. :)
2009-06-09T14:32:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	I think you can get rid of it if you right-click on your menu and edit it - I don't remember the exact steps, but you have to untick the checkmark next to it to make it go away.
2009-06-09T14:35:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Okay. Can you type dpkg -l | ggl, copy the results, go to pastebin.ubuntu.com, paste the results there, and post the link here?
2009-06-09T14:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Please don't delete files directly from /usr/bin - it doesn't work that way.
2009-06-09T14:38:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Type dpkg -l | ggl, copy the results, go to pastebin.ubuntu.com, paste the results there, and post the link here.
2009-06-09T14:38:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	sorry, it's paste.ubuntu.com
2009-06-09T14:41:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	Type dpkg -l | ggl, copy the results, go to pastebin.ubuntu.com, paste the results there, and post the link here.
2009-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	cypha	tiyowan	dpgk command not found
2009-06-09T15:01:00.000Z	tiyowan	cypha	It's dp*kg* -l | grep ggl
