2008-04-19T23:34:00.000Z	Dowah		Having a serious problem. Disk boot failure. Twice in one month. formatted disks two weeks ago., I have 2 hard drives. Both couldn't go bad all at once. Seems like this happens after I do an automatic Update of the system .. Any Help For this???
2008-04-19T23:36:00.000Z	Dowah		I don't want to return to WIndows does anyone know what might be causing this?
2008-04-19T23:37:00.000Z	will	Dowah	so Windows still works then? Ruling out drive failure?
2008-04-19T23:37:00.000Z	Dowah		I dont have windows installed at all
2008-04-19T23:37:00.000Z	Dowah		 Using Live cd
2008-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	will		Oh
2008-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	will		Perhaps you should run a drive utility to rule out drive failure
2008-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	Dowah		My bios wont even register drives now
2008-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	Dowah		Win98 startup disk says not fat partion
2008-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	will		Oh, sounds like the drives bad then, if BIOS won't register it, it's likely nothing to be with Ubuntu
2008-04-19T23:39:00.000Z	Dowah		needs to be formatted again
2008-04-19T23:39:00.000Z	will		Formatting doesn't matter to BIOS.

2008-04-19T23:39:00.000Z	Dowah		 I formatted and all was weel agin till this morning
2008-04-19T23:40:00.000Z	will	Dowah	 If you go to your drive manufacturers website, you should be able to get a bootable cd image/floopy to test your drive. Do that after you check connections, etc.
