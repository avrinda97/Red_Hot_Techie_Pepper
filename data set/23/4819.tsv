2007-07-23T12:22:00.000Z	balleyne		I've got a gstreamer question (I think) if anyone can help - has anyone been having trouble in Feisty? It seems to crash when I play certain .mp3s (in the exact same place)
2007-07-23T12:22:00.000Z	balleyne		and I think it's gstreamer because it crashes in Rhythmbox/Banshee, but not XMMS/Amarok or from the command line with mpg321...
2007-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	balleyne		gstreamer troubles anyone?
2007-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	explain
2007-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	Banshee and Rhytmbox are crashing on some of my mp3s since upgrading to Feisty
2007-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	same spot every time, and it's a seg fault
2007-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	XMMS/Amaork/mpg321 do not crash, which is why I think it may be gstreamer? (does that make sense?)
2007-07-23T12:26:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	what procedure did you follow to 'upgrade' to feisty?
2007-07-23T12:27:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	I just used the upgrade manager, I think it was 'gksudo update-manager -c' or something like that, and just let that handle the upgrade for me
2007-07-23T12:27:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	same problem on my gf's laptop, which I upgraded in the same way, though she's using Xubuntu (again, just with Banshe/Rhythmbox though)
2007-07-23T12:29:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	you didn't do it right
2007-07-23T12:31:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	you typed it out wrong. you need to follow directions to the letter.
2007-07-23T12:32:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	sorry, I didn't type it wrong, I just typed it a couple months ago
2007-07-23T12:32:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	well, go through it and try the entire thing again, it may have missed something.
2007-07-23T12:32:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	alright, thanks
2007-07-23T12:50:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	you can use upgrade for single packages though
2007-07-23T12:51:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	wrong.
2007-07-23T12:51:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	true true, just digging through the man pages, I was mistaken
2007-07-23T12:51:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	upgrade will install the newest versions of ALL packages that it finds after you run apt-get update
2007-07-23T12:52:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	i've been using debian for nearly a decade, i'm pretty sure ;)
2007-07-23T12:53:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	haha, yeah, my mistake - is there a way to upgrade a single package then? will install check for the latest version if already installed?
2007-07-23T12:53:00.000Z	Gnea	balleyne	just apt-get update && apt-get install <packagename>  :)
2007-07-23T12:53:00.000Z	balleyne	Gnea	*nodding head* makes sense, thanks :)
