2007-03-25T05:14:00.000Z	alucard		i dont understand why i cant boot windows after i installed ubuntu
2007-03-25T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	whats the error
2007-03-25T05:17:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	i just cant seem to get it to work it will say like invalid device and stuff like that
2007-03-25T05:17:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	apologies, I missed your initial question
2007-03-25T05:18:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	it was about grub and how it wont load windows
2007-03-25T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	ooh yes, can you detail your problem
2007-03-25T05:19:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	well, it doesnt load, im not sure if this is because im accessing the wrong device (im using hd0,0)
2007-03-25T05:19:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	what is the error
2007-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	I'll ask again, more specific "What happens when you try to boot windows"
2007-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	it says that you need to load kernel before you boot
2007-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	when you try to boot windows it says that ?
2007-03-25T05:21:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	thats very strange as thats not even a windows error message
2007-03-25T05:21:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	its not even loading windows man thats what im saying
2007-03-25T05:21:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	is it actually loading grub
2007-03-25T05:22:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	can you boot into ubuntu
2007-03-25T05:22:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	boot into ubuntu and pastebin your menu.lst
2007-03-25T05:24:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	im getting a query failure when i try to send with pastebin
2007-03-25T05:24:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	use another pastebin
2007-03-25T05:25:00.000Z	alucard	ikonia	http://pastebin.ca/409018
2007-03-25T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	I say - add the options "makeactive - and on the next line chainloader     +1"
2007-03-25T05:27:00.000Z	ikonia	alucard	no - sorry
