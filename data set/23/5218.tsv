2007-02-04T14:25:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 what connects the win2000 comp upto wifi?
2007-02-04T14:27:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: I have a dlink wifi card , and wifi enabled laptop on other end, I dont know which scheme to use..infrascture etc
2007-02-04T14:28:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 errm, is there a wireless access point intermediate to win2000 and the wifi laptop?
2007-02-04T14:28:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: nopes , I want to have a point to point connection (I suspect its possible)
2007-02-04T14:29:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 sure, although it's called an ad-hoc connection with regards to wireless
2007-02-04T14:30:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 ok, all you have to do is share the ISDN connection on win2000 for the other two to be able to get on the internet - provided IP addressing and other config options are set right
2007-02-04T14:31:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	 right .... can I connect to multiple wifi cards in adhoc mode..
2007-02-04T14:31:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	 right .... or does it have to be point to point connection
2007-02-04T14:33:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 sure -- you can connect multiple wifi devices up in ad-hoc mode -- afaik, there is no point-to-point terminology when it comes to wifi
2007-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 as for getting the gentoo server visible to the internet you'll need a 3rd party port-forwarder for win2000 so it forwards required traffic on
2007-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 I have a very similar setup here -- but i use win2k3 and RAS instead .. it's much more versatile than what is provided by win2000
2007-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: I have cygwin , and with it lots of unix goodies..can i use some thing open source
2007-02-04T14:37:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 errm, i'm sure there is something that cygwin can contribute -- although i'm no master at cygwin
2007-02-04T14:38:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: i am being recomended ipcop and pfsense from another channle
2007-02-04T14:39:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 well, the question to be asked is are those applications cygwin/win32 compatible
2007-02-04T14:42:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: how to share inetenet connection , NAT , Proxy , Port fowarding ...
2007-02-04T14:43:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 one sec
2007-02-04T14:44:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: this question is more on the lines of ..which is the best , most suitable option
2007-02-04T14:45:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	to share a connection - control panel > network connections > right click connection > properties > advanced > share connection with other users on network (or something similar)
2007-02-04T14:46:00.000Z	geoaxis	unop	: this option is avaialble from windows xp onwards
2007-02-04T14:46:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 well, the best option is probably ipcop and pfsense as you said (although i dont know if they work on cygwin as well as they do otherwise)
2007-02-04T14:47:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 win2000 can share connections too -- the wording is a bit differrent albeit
2007-02-04T14:48:00.000Z	unop	geoaxis	 you should see this under the properties of the connection http://www.annoyances.org/pictures/articles/ics_2000_2.gif
