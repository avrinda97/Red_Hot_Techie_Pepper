2008-07-12T18:11:00.000Z	Xpistos		I could use a little help. I am running hardy and my samba shares are very inconsistant. I have one bookmarked and that is never a problem, but If I go to network and windows Network they do not always so up? Can some help me with this. It is very frustrating.
2008-07-12T18:13:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	that kinda stuff is tricky since WINS and those other MS protocols used for this are fscked up. do you know the DNS name of the windows machine you want to access or the iP?
2008-07-12T18:15:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	\\Athena in your favourite file browser. usually works
2008-07-12T18:15:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	File browser as in Nautilus?
2008-07-12T18:15:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	yes
2008-07-12T18:17:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	that did not work
2008-07-12T18:19:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	what for? does ping Athena resolve?
2008-07-12T18:20:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	fix your dns then. what is the IP?
2008-07-12T18:20:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	of athena that is
2008-07-12T18:21:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	then edit your /etc/hosts
2008-07-12T18:21:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	same file as windows in that regard
2008-07-12T18:21:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	I will try that
2008-07-12T18:21:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	then try \\Athena again
2008-07-12T18:26:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	Using //Athena I get cannot be displayed
2008-07-12T18:26:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	smbclient -L <athena ip>
2008-07-12T18:26:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	O
2008-07-12T18:30:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	\\ip of athena in nautilus. and since you must use IP your hosts entry is most probably wrong
2008-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	Says it cannot display that kind of location
2008-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	then I dunno, sorry
2008-07-12T18:33:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	create more bookmarks. as I said: WINS is awful
2008-07-12T18:33:00.000Z	Xpistos	wols_	thank you for your help my friend
2008-07-12T18:40:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	sorry. not really a nautolus user
2008-07-12T21:59:00.000Z	wols_	Xpistos	man smb.conf
