2012-04-13T21:24:00.000Z	Flying		hey guys, I'm trying to run an Ubuntu live USB but my computer's bios only support USB-FDD. The optical diskdrive doesn't work, and it's a faily old version of ubuntu I am trying to update. Anything I can do??
2012-04-13T21:26:00.000Z	Flying		how does that make it bootable?
2012-04-13T21:27:00.000Z	Flying		no because my computer's bios only support USB-FDD. Pendrivelinux says it doesn't support USB-FDD
2012-04-13T21:28:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	is there a USB-HDD option?
2012-04-13T21:29:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	no there isn't. The computer I have is an HP Pavilion 304w, it's really old.
2012-04-13T21:29:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	I am also unable to download an update because I can't get into any OS
2012-04-13T21:30:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	often times there's an option that says something along the lines of "Allow booting of other devices"
2012-04-13T21:30:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	I don' expect for you to memorize it in the least bit. I was just giving you information in case it would help.
2012-04-13T21:32:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	that's not what I'm saying
2012-04-13T21:36:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	because here's the thing, it will load past grub, to the ubuntu OS loading screen, then it just goes blank
2012-04-13T21:37:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	try adding "nomodeset" to the kernel options for ubuntu
2012-04-13T21:37:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	how do I do that? Do I need to run the command
2012-04-13T21:40:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	yeah that's the symptom that nomodeset should fix
2012-04-13T21:42:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	I didn't click it. Did you?
2012-04-13T21:43:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	there's a nice graphical rundown of it on that forum post =p
2012-04-13T21:50:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	did you try the things that the forum post mentioned?
2012-04-13T21:51:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	please stop misspelling my name. It's quite annoying
2012-04-13T21:52:00.000Z	Flying	Kanerix	sorry, I'm (no shit) dyslexic
2012-04-13T21:58:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	well there's actually a way to highjack the running bootloader to boot USB, but it's not very friendly
2012-04-13T22:06:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	the problem is that you have to edit the GRUB boot parameters to tell it to boot a live disk instead of what's installed on the hard drive
2012-04-13T22:06:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	I'm trying to help you. Calm down please
2012-04-13T22:08:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	I don't think he realizes that you and I are different people
2012-04-13T22:08:00.000Z	Kanerix	Flying	okay how many drives do you have in this machine? I know you have a hard drive and an optical drive, right?
