2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	look for the hdd-image (i know debian has it)
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	then you just zcat it to the usb disk
2010-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	have you checked your ISO?
2010-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	that's what i'm doing now
2010-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	good choice, sounds fishy
2010-07-04T15:14:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	so my iso looks ok
2010-07-04T15:14:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	did you do a md5sum -c on it?
2010-07-04T15:14:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	openssl md5 (it is windows ;)
2010-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	i have no idea about windows
2010-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	well, openssl works great here
2010-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	if you have a *real* shell, it shouldn't matter
2010-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	i think i will md5 check the squashfs on the pendrive vs the one from iso
2010-07-04T15:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	md5sum -c will verify the iso you downloaded isn't corrupt compared to the file on the server
2010-07-04T15:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	the .iso contains the squashfs root filesystem
2010-07-04T15:16:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	yes, and the md5 says my iso is ok
2010-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	but than during boot i get info about squashfs corrupted
2010-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	might be worth doing a   'badblocks /dev/YourBootDisk'
2010-07-04T15:19:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	ha! squashfs on the pendrive and iso is different!
2010-07-04T15:20:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	michal|3s are you just tring to install from a pendrive?
2010-07-04T15:24:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	wow. copied (by hand) squashfs onthe pendrive and it started
2010-07-04T15:24:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	good stuff...
2010-07-04T15:43:00.000Z	michal|3s	codebrainz	Pirate_Hunter - ubuntu desktop working great now. somehow the usb creator had problems with copying squashfs to the pendrive (did it myself, worked). thx for your help and inspiration! :)
2010-07-04T15:44:00.000Z	codebrainz	michal|3s	any time
