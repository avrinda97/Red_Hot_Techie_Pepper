2005-07-22T16:04:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	its called nvidia-glx
2005-07-22T16:04:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	 i think its about 3MB
2005-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	 type sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2005-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	why do you only have text mode?
2005-07-22T16:09:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	warty probably doesnt support your card because its too old. maybe you do need to install that nvidia binary after all
2005-07-22T16:17:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	you ever used vi before?
2005-07-22T16:24:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	im trying to remember where xfree86.conf is on warty
2005-07-22T16:27:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	first type  $ sudo cp /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 /etc/X11/XF86Config-4_backup
2005-07-22T16:27:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	this will backup your configuration
2005-07-22T16:28:00.000Z	jamesDOOD	raven3x7	ok
2005-07-22T16:29:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	now you need to change the driver
2005-07-22T16:32:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	type sudo nano /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 find the line where it says Driver          "nvidia". delete it and replace it with "vesa". then ctrl+x to exit. when it asks to save the buffer say yes
2005-07-22T16:33:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	it says "nv" not "nvidia" sorry. only delete that word
2005-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	its a winmodem
2005-07-22T05:58:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	is it external?
2005-07-22T05:59:00.000Z	raven3x7	jamesDOOD	http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/ detailed instructions available there
