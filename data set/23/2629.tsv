2009-04-26T18:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	do you mean you deleted a partition and want to recover it ?
2009-04-26T18:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	you may be able to recover it using "testdisk", as long you didn't overwrite a part of the previous partition
2009-04-26T18:51:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	I mean it is my old disk of ubuntu. I have a partittion there with an old version of windows and the old partition of ubuntu 8.10 , the same i am using is now shown under windows as free space
2009-04-26T19:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	please try to manually mount/read the disk from the terminal
2009-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	can you help me on this manual mounting?
2009-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	you need to get yourself familiar with fdisk and mount
2009-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	to start, list the existing partitions with : sudo fdisk -l
2009-04-26T19:11:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	it is my drive sdb reported as  Disk /dev/sdb: 250.0 GB, 250059350016 bytes
2009-04-26T19:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	that's the disk device, that it list partitions on it ?
2009-04-26T19:12:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	yes it lists one partition /dev/sdb1             510       15351   119218365    7  HPFS/NTFS
2009-04-26T19:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	but the data is on another partition which you lost, right ?
2009-04-26T19:13:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	and this is the hard drive I got the error "DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply." while trying  to see it
2009-04-26T19:14:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	: and there is a lot of free space (almost half of the disk in a second partition I lost, yes
2009-04-26T19:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	install testdisk
2009-04-26T19:14:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	under console?
2009-04-26T19:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	sudo apt-get install testdisk
2009-04-26T19:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	sudo testdisk /disk_device
2009-04-26T19:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	but be carefull, you need to understand what you are doing, partition recovery is not a trivial task
2009-04-26T19:23:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	Ok i have to take the risk!
2009-04-26T19:29:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	: thx for help I think I am going  to save previously all remaining data there as I am in  a process where I can lose more data and I will need some time for that ...will come late ...Thanks
2009-04-26T19:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	FernandoF	good approach, good luck :)
2009-04-26T23:08:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	still there?
2009-04-26T23:43:00.000Z	FernandoF	joaopinto	can you give some help?
