2012-03-29T10:00:00.000Z	Myrth		are there any reasons against lvm on boot ssd?
2012-03-29T10:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	not that I know of but you might need the alternate ubuntu install iso that supports lvm to install it
2012-03-29T10:01:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	this page is fine with livecd: http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem
2012-03-29T10:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	is shows in that link you gave me Unfortunately, at the time this article was written, Ubuntu does not offer such settings with the Desktop Install CD.
2012-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	which settings? i can do `apt-get install lvm2`
2012-03-29T10:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	it has to do with what's missing in initrz  I think
2012-03-29T10:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	I'm sure you can make a custom cd with the added modules but I think the alternate iso might already have them
2012-03-29T10:42:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	alternate iso doesn't have driver for my ssd. is there a way to add?
2012-03-29T11:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	I wonder if that method I see in your link http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem  where they chroot after boot would enable you to add your ssd driver?
2012-03-29T11:14:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	at this point i think i need to know where to copy the module file so it will be included into initramfs when i run update-iniramfs
2012-03-29T11:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	that makes sense.  In my searches I don't see anyone speak of adding drivers to use ssd as boot
2012-03-29T11:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	I still don't have enuf info I guess your ssd is a scsi device so the driver isn't embedded in the kernel or initz file what is the name of your scsi controler?
2012-03-29T11:27:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	the driver is downloaded from here: http://oczenterprise.com/drivers.html
2012-03-29T11:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	worst case you could compile a new kernel with the driver added and boot install live cd chroot and install your needed kernel mods
2012-03-29T11:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	I've seen onother link that tried that and failed as the modules need to be compiled and linked on the same kernel, but if you compile the same kernel as will be installed with livecd that would also work
2012-03-29T11:35:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	there's no source for the module. only compiled binary
2012-03-29T11:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	oh ok then I guess that's how it's done then
2012-03-29T11:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	my guess is there ko file will only work on a group of kernel not all
2012-03-29T11:37:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	yep, it works only up until 3.0, doesn't work with 3.2
2012-03-29T11:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	oh so no 11.10 eather then I guess since I have Linux sacarlson-11 3.0.0-12-generic #20-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 7 14:50:42 UTC 2011 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux
2012-03-29T11:38:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	it loaded and worked fine on 11.10
2012-03-29T11:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	Myrth	ok cool
2012-03-29T11:41:00.000Z	Myrth	sacarlson	oh nm, mounted to /dev/mapper/...
