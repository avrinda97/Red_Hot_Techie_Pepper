2009-09-28T07:52:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	basicallly after installing apache a web page you create will live in /var/www
2009-09-28T07:52:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	just looking to serve up a simple html page
2009-09-28T07:53:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	so thts where u are supp to create ur web pages?
2009-09-28T07:53:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	in a text editor
2009-09-28T07:56:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	so if u r creating a web application as such...you'd hve to create folders in /var/www and proceed with development?
2009-09-28T07:56:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	are you looking for a program to design a page?  Open office will save files in html.. there's another that took over after NVU was no longer maintained but I've forgotten the name.
2009-09-28T07:57:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	no...i hve html editors. i just want to deploy web apps
2009-09-28T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	ok.. create a page and put it in /var/www .. then from your machine in a browser go to http://localhost and it should display.. from another machine on the LAN you have to enter the IP address of the machine running apache
2009-09-28T08:00:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	wht abt creating a folder where by i can manage different web applications...
2009-09-28T08:01:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	are you developing "applications" or just pages?
2009-09-28T08:02:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	actually both :)
2009-09-28T08:03:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	you can create them anywhere you want.. to view them in a browser they typically have to be copied to /var/www unless you change the defaults for apache.. if you're adding php and other things.. that is beyond my experience.. you might ask in #ubuntu-server
2009-09-28T08:03:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	or #apache
2009-09-28T08:04:00.000Z	deostroll	scunizi	cool! thanx

2010-01-22T08:58:00.000Z	scunizi	deostroll	right mouse click the current icon for your app, choose properties, in the new box click the icon, find the one you want and save
