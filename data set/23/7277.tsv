2007-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	goose		anyone else have problems running   gksudo "update-manager -c -d"   ?  i get dbus error
2007-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	you shouldn't need both the -c and -d at the same time, but I can't imagine that's the source of the error
2007-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	which guide?
2007-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	the one linked off digg a few days ago
2007-04-10T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	Right.  Sounds like a bad idea.  Follow the official ones: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
2007-04-10T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	I'd link you to the page further, but have no idea which one you're upgrading to ;)
2007-04-10T09:33:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	ok i'll try that
2007-04-10T09:33:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	i'll read it and then let you know if i run into problems =D
2007-04-10T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	actually, you should probably ask in #ubuntu+1, since that's the Feisty channel for another week.
2007-04-16T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	-c is only needed when upgrading from LTS releases.  -d is for development, so if you, say, wanted the current feisty
2007-04-16T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	Dapper is an LTS.  Dapper won't nag you about edgy being out without the -c
2007-04-16T06:18:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	i did gksudo update-manager -c  but it jsut times out
2007-04-16T06:19:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	-d not -c
2007-04-16T06:19:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	trying -d
2007-04-16T06:21:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	i get this error. warning: could not initiate dbus
2007-04-20T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	never
2007-04-20T06:20:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	darn :|
2007-09-08T07:19:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	You can de-DRM them if you have OSX or windows and itunes.  Then you'll have them.  Check out Hymn (its on sourceforge, I believe)
2007-09-08T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	Hymn
2008-09-18T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	#ubuntu+1 for Hardy Intrepid support, thanks.
2009-06-08T22:28:00.000Z	goose	Flannel	any reason you told ubottu to PM me about my away message?
2009-06-08T22:29:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	Your nick changes when you're away (goose|zZz), If you have an away message above that, we have no qualms with that.
2009-10-29T12:21:00.000Z	Flannel	goose	Please don't be malicious
