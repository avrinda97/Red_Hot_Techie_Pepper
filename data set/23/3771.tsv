2008-03-22T08:32:00.000Z	Phoebus		Does Ubuntu run well on vmware? :)
2008-03-22T08:33:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	depends on the host..
2008-03-22T08:33:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	if the host is windows, you won't get the true ubuntu experience
2008-03-22T08:34:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	I see... well I've been trying all day to get betrayal in antara to work... with a xp 64-bit host. I tried compatibility: failed. I tried windows 98: sound wouldn't effing work, drives gave me blue screen. Tried  windows 3.11 even, and doh.. I give up. I'm going to vmware linux and run betrayal in antara in WINE lol.
2008-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	the free vmware-server doesn't work on a 64 bit machine.. you'll need to purchase esx
2008-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	we had the same problem at work on our dell1950's..
2008-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	I'm using workshop 6, that doesn't work..?
2008-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	Phoebus		hmm
2008-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	esx as in the server? :X
2008-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	esx is a vmware piece of software... what virtualisation software are you using?
2008-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	mark[oz]		I thought you said vmware somewhere?
2008-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	VmWare workstation 6.
2008-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	ahh sorry... I miss read it.. uhmm it should work then.
2008-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	mark[oz]		maybe its something for the "vmware" forums.
2008-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	maybe its something for the "vmware" forums.
2008-03-22T08:38:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	believe me when I say I've tried everything... I'll give esx a try, maybe you're right.
2008-03-22T08:38:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	esx cost a lot of money, and is itself an o/s
2008-03-22T08:38:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	sorry I couldn't help more..
2008-03-22T08:40:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	so do you think my vain idea will work? ubuntu w/ wine -> betrayal in antara (old win 95/3.11 game).
2008-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	yea it should.. if not, get FreeDos, and virtualise it!
2008-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	mark[oz]		using vmware-server
2008-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	mark[oz]	Phoebus	I use freedos when playing dukenukem 3d :)
2008-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	Phoebus	mark[oz]	this stupid game likes to be installed while in windows...
