2006-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	Duff		I've only downloaded the .iso
2006-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	Duff		Alright.
2006-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	Duff		And this is going to do what? Run ubuntu?
2006-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	Duff		No, I don't have nero.
2006-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	Duff		Recordnow!
2006-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	Duff		Alright.
2006-07-04T13:24:00.000Z	Duff		Sorry for me being a complete idiot at this.
2006-07-04T13:24:00.000Z	Duff		I'm young and learning.
2006-07-04T13:25:00.000Z	Duff		I have the .iso, I'm going to go and get a blank CD to burn it right now.
2006-07-04T13:27:00.000Z	Duff		Also, when it says "Burn the ISO", it means all the files and folders individually, right? Or do I put them all in one folder and burn that?
2006-07-04T13:28:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	you should burn it like an iso image. That's an option in you burning program.
2006-07-04T13:28:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	check the page ubotu sent you
2006-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	you got a message from ubotu, but it's here in this channel too, after i typed !burniso
2006-07-04T13:38:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	Then you've got the wrong option i think. Did you do as said in the wiki. Go to the File menu, choose Write Disk from iso file?
2006-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	does it anywhere say image or something?
2006-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	ok, that should be good
2006-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	in the program you should now be able to select the downloaded iso file
2006-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	don't open the file in Windows
2006-07-04T13:41:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	no, it's saved somewhere on your harddisk, go to that location with your burning program and select the iso file
2006-07-04T13:42:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	maybe in your 'My Documents' folder
2006-07-04T13:55:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	a few weeks. Where are you from, if i may ask?
2006-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	you have several options, but you need a spare partition to put ubuntu on
2006-07-04T14:08:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Duff	boot from the cd
