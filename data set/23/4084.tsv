2008-02-16T12:38:00.000Z	pawan		how to mount partition using livecd
2008-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	pawan		!mount
2008-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	pawan		i have ubuntu installed and also want to preserve it and mount it
2008-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	you need to find the partition in /dev/ and then   sudo mount /dev/sda1    or wichever it is
2008-02-16T12:43:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	shouldn't that be hda1  hda4?
2008-02-16T12:47:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	sudo mount /dev/sdb3   is what you type in a terminal - do you know terminal?
2008-02-16T12:49:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	unless you change something in your existing ubuntu it will stay preserved
2008-02-16T12:52:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	then browse to /media/disk-5
2008-02-16T12:54:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	don't worry about the name of the mount - look at the files to see if it is the right one that's mounted
2008-02-16T12:56:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	you don't mount disks you mount the partitions on the disk - an important point
2008-02-16T12:57:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	sudo mount /dev/sda3  or whichever it is called - you need to find it in the folder /dev
2008-02-16T12:57:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	if right click says unmount then it is mounted already
2008-02-16T12:58:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	it won't from the live cd
2008-02-16T12:59:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	you have 3 ubuntu installs from your menu.lst - do you get none from the grub menu?
2008-02-16T13:00:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	are you in the live cd now?
2008-02-16T13:01:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	open a terminal and type   sudo grub
2008-02-16T13:01:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	then type find /boot/grub/stage1
2008-02-16T13:02:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	type   update grub
2008-02-16T13:04:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	type   quit   then type     update grub
2008-02-16T13:10:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	you can try to grub-install and see if it works - but you may have a hard disk issue - 'cause you do have a /boot/grub/menu.lst - so the hard disk might be on its' way out
2008-02-16T13:12:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	it might be the part of the disk with the master boot record on that has trouble - hard to say from here - but seems like it is a hardware issue - maybe
2008-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	ere4si	pawan	http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-using-grub_002dinstall.html - is the manual for that
