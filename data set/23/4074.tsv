2007-11-19T20:46:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy		Hey all.  I have a somewhat new anomaly.  When I plug in my USB key, nothing happens.  How do I query my USB ports to mount a USB drive?
2007-11-19T20:46:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy		Opera is just an example of *good software*.  It would be nice if it was OSS though.
2007-11-19T20:48:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy		how do I mount my USB drive, people??
2007-11-19T20:48:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	whats your version and stick?
2007-11-19T20:49:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	Gutsy, stick is a "card reader" with an SD card in it.  Used to work on plug-n-play.  Now, nothing happens.
2007-11-19T20:50:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	do you have another box you can mount it to? or SD readable/writable to camera or whatever?
2007-11-19T20:51:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	seen more than a few usb drives melt down after a hot unplug
2007-11-19T20:51:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	I could certainly try ... although the other day when I had this same problem, I just stuck it in a different USB port and she worked fine.  Not this time though.
2007-11-19T20:52:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	well, I don't think that's the issue here :D ... I just can't remember how to manually mount a usb drive
2007-11-19T20:53:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	i wondered because I just lost a drive i used for years, but this time I hit eject and missed a pop under from my music player detecting an mp3 in the root. dead and gone
2007-11-19T20:53:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	ew that sucks
2007-11-19T20:54:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	sorry you got the usb weirdness
2007-11-19T20:54:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	no problemo
2007-11-19T20:55:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	thanx fer the help.  I'll eventually muddle thru it :D
2007-11-19T20:55:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	sorry I can't help more, good luck!
2007-11-19T20:57:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	strangely, I just physically manipulated the drive (unplugged, roughed it up a little with my mad anger skillz) and then plugged it back in.  Now she works.  Strange.
2007-11-19T20:58:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	 might want to check the cable to your reader, I had one abused in and out of a laptop bag eventually short out a little but. drove me crazy, also bent pins on a multicard reader, I could use it for sd but not cf after that.
2007-11-19T20:59:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	ya
2007-11-19T21:09:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	sorry for the abrupt reply and departure there ... gastrointestinal anomalies.  LOL.  Anyhoo, ya, I've had my fair share of hardware-failure issues.  Just recently I had an entire hard drive go corrupted.  I managed to rescue about 75% of the data, but lost quite a bit.  I had to manually rebuild the superblocks and everything.  It was totally nuts.
2007-11-19T21:11:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	wow that is the suxxor. I am about to pickup another external for backup reasons. I bought a WD160 passport, did all my backups then tested a restore and it failed multiple times, ugly.
2007-11-19T21:14:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	wow, WDs usually don't die like that.  Wierd.  ncix.com has (had?) some 500GB externals on for $100 CAD.  3yr warranty I believe.
2007-11-19T21:15:00.000Z	ip_helper	Em3raldMcSquizzy	meant that last matttastic for you
2007-11-19T21:16:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	ip_helper	IC.  Yeah, that's not a bad plan.  Just make sure that you don't cheap out on the enclosure.  Spend a few extra $$ on the enclosure to make sure it's got active cooling, and a robust construction.
