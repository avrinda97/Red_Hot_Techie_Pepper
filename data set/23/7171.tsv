2005-10-05T06:49:00.000Z	JustinHH	Chousuke	You can also use the qt3-qtconfig package to configure QT's appearance, which has fare less dependencies than kcontrol (none, in fact).
2005-10-05T06:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	JustinHH	it's just for the appearance.
2005-10-05T06:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	JustinHH	here: apt-get install --ignore-breakage skype
