2007-04-19T15:48:00.000Z	slyfox		Please help, I have a hard drive and only I the user who installed ubuntu can read and write to it, I have 2 more users whom I want to grant access to read and write. How do I do that ?
2007-04-19T15:50:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	you've already created those users on the system?
2007-04-19T15:50:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	yes
2007-04-19T15:50:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	okay, and they need to be able to access those files locally?
2007-04-19T15:50:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	yes and be able to write and read to the hard drive
2007-04-19T15:51:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	which ubuntu version are you using (not sure if that makes any difference, but still)
2007-04-19T15:51:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	7.04
2007-04-19T15:52:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	great, then I can just do the same things as you should, and we both should see the same results. Hang on, I'm gonna try out some stuff
2007-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	sudo chmod 777 /media/disk   worked
2007-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	My guess is the best way to do this is to create a new group to which you should add all the users that require access, and then set the proper group permissions to all files
2007-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	that should work as well, yes, but now the entire world can access that disk and it's files ;)
2007-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	if that's no problem, then you're done
2007-04-19T15:55:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	that should do it, that is what I needed. What did you have in mind, I would like to know as I can learn soemthing new here.
2007-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	a bit more secure approach would be, as I described above, to creat a separate group and add all neccesary users to that group
2007-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	and then only change the group permissions on all files
2007-04-19T15:57:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	How would I  only change the group permissions on all files ?
2007-04-19T15:58:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	chgrp -R [groupname]  *
2007-04-19T15:58:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	and then chmod 770 *
2007-04-19T15:59:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	liek this?    chgrp -R [groupname]  /media/disk ?
2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	that _should_ do it, yes... but you have to add the specified group first, of course
2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	slyfox	iGadget	got it, thanks.
2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	and add the users to that group :)
2007-04-20T16:02:00.000Z	iGadget	slyfox	I use that method to share photos and media files with my gf... there's a small catch, though - newly created / copied files won't get the proper permissions by default. You have to fix that manually every time. There should be a solution to that, but I havn't had the time to look for it yet.
