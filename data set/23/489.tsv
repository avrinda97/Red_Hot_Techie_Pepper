2011-07-29T03:20:00.000Z	mediacentaur		could someone help me with installing a realtek r8169 driver. i've followed the included readme but i'm still getting errors and google isn't helping...
2011-07-29T03:22:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	What are the errors?
2011-07-29T03:23:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	i've used sudo but it's still telling me it cannot remove r8169.ko: permission denied (for one)
2011-07-29T03:23:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	Remove r8169.ko from where?
2011-07-29T03:24:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	Perhaps I can help you get wifi working by a different method?
2011-07-29T03:24:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	I don't think compiling the driver is going to fix the problem.  Thoughts?
2011-07-29T03:24:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	it's ethernet, but i'm up for whatever works.
2011-07-29T03:25:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	ethernet huh.  That's not good.  Can you run sudo lspci -k   for me?
2011-07-29T03:25:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	What driver is your card using?  What modules are available?
2011-07-29T03:25:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	i don't have the card installed at the moment. i figured maybe it was locking up the driver
2011-07-29T03:26:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	When the card is installed does the system not boot?
2011-07-29T03:27:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	it boots. it is recognized as a "linksys gigabit ethernet adapter" which is correct but it doesn't work. i believe it got an ip from the router, but it's not actually passing anything through
2011-07-29T03:27:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	It got an IP?  Can it ping?
2011-07-29T03:27:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	was not able to ping.
2011-07-29T03:27:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	Does this card work with any other OS?
2011-07-29T03:28:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	Put it had an IP via DHCP?
2011-07-29T03:28:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	worked on windows but i ditched windows.
2011-07-29T03:28:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	ok
2011-07-29T03:29:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	i'm pretty sure it was listed as a client in the router config. i could be wrong. i've been messing with it so much that it feels like what i've tried is blurring together.
2011-07-29T03:29:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	i'm on natty, if that helps.
2011-07-29T03:30:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	put the card in, boot the computer, run sudo lspci -k, tell me what driver is being used and what modules are available
2011-07-29T03:31:00.000Z	mediacentaur	edbian	give me just a sec. i'll enter the room under my actual irc alias... i just used a quick join on the ubuntu machine using the on-board nic...
2011-07-29T03:31:00.000Z	edbian	mediacentaur	ok
