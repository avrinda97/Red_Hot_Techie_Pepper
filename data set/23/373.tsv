2012-02-06T22:36:00.000Z	auronandace	Hopsy	your partitions should be visable/mountable under /media/ (what do you see under /media/?)
2012-02-06T22:38:00.000Z	Hopsy	auronandace	I am now on windows
2012-02-06T22:39:00.000Z	Hopsy	auronandace	I dont see anything in media
2012-02-06T22:40:00.000Z	auronandace	Hopsy	what does it show: sudo fdisk -l
