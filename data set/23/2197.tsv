2009-05-31T19:36:00.000Z	zortec		I looked at the boot options page, but I'm not sure which one to add...
2009-05-31T19:37:00.000Z	zortec		But I do think there is a problem with SATA because it will not load the installer on the LiveCD or text based installer
2009-05-31T19:37:00.000Z	zortec		Jaunty
2009-05-31T19:38:00.000Z	zortec		What is this about a generic-ide boot option? I don't see that one in BootOptions page
2009-05-31T19:39:00.000Z	zortec		Am I the only one who has ran into this problem with the Live CD not booting or the text based installer?
2009-05-31T19:40:00.000Z	zortec		I mean there should be a failsafe or something to at least get Ubuntu to boot
2009-05-31T19:40:00.000Z	zortec		It is annoying to have to do hit the power button on my computer because it won't exit
2009-05-31T19:42:00.000Z	zortec		Anyone?  I have been trying to get Ubuntu to install for several hours now.  I'm tired and I can't seem to get anything working.
2009-05-31T19:42:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	what's the problem?
2009-05-31T19:43:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	is there a specific problem or error or any more info?
2009-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	what hardware and bios?

2009-05-31T19:48:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	just add the kernel param I just linked you too and see if that works
2009-05-31T19:49:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	we wont know until you try
2009-05-31T19:49:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	scunizi seems to verify the adivce I gave to you as being tested and working on some hardware
2009-05-31T19:50:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	hit f6 at the first screen on the live cd, not sure where to do it on the alternative installer
2009-05-31T19:52:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	use the live cd and add the kernel param, that should then work
2009-05-31T19:53:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	god damm.. I KNOW IT IS A SATA ISSUE. and I gave you the fix
2009-05-31T19:54:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	you'll have to use google to see if you can add kernel params on the alt installer, I dont think you can though
2009-05-31T19:56:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	the kernel parameter will bypass the sata issue
2009-05-31T19:58:00.000Z	elgar	zortec	get the live cd, add the kernel parameter by pressing f6 at the first screen, then it will work fine./
