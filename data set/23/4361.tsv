File should be owned by user and have 644 permissions. User's $HOME directory must be owned by user and not writable by other usuers

2007-10-29T06:02:00.000Z	Keepoffgrass	jrib	Thanks man, that seems to have worked
2007-10-29T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	Keepoffgrass	what file are you clicking on?
2007-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	Keepoffgrass	your user is not supposed to, you should only change things in HOME
2007-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	Keepoffgrass	jrib	ok... so I should just leave it
2007-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	Keepoffgrass	yep, it's supposed to be like that.  When you do need to change something outside of your home, you use sudo.  But like I said, you shouldn't need to
