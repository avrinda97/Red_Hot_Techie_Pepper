2005-11-27T13:11:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	the splash screen background color is set in the GDM login manager, under standard greeter.
2005-11-27T13:12:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	i think i get it, didn't check the GTK+ greeter option
2005-11-27T13:13:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	yes
2005-11-27T13:14:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	i know and it's the color i want it to be
2005-11-27T13:14:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	and by the way i actually meant the splashsceen i get when i log in, not the login manager
2005-11-27T13:15:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	nope, that's it :) i also hate brown :P
2005-11-27T13:15:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	thanks :)
2005-11-27T13:16:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	i changed the splash image, dunno if i can change the background easily
2005-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	yeah the background is "in theory" set in the gdm greeter as well, but I've never tried.  I have changed the graphical greeter, the splash image and background, and all of the desktop stuff.
2005-11-27T13:18:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	gonna log out and give a try to my changes, i'll be right back ;)
2005-11-27T13:18:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	yes i meant that lol
2005-11-27T13:19:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	see ya
2005-11-27T13:22:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	got it :)
2005-11-27T13:24:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	all i did was change the GTK+ background color and the desktop background color with no wallpaper to the color i wanted and wham! it works! :)
2005-11-27T13:25:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	nice.
2005-11-27T13:25:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	thanks a bunch
2005-11-27T13:25:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	I found by doing a "server" install, followed by apt-get install xubuntu-desktop I avoid all the brown as well.  although I don't get gnome, I get xfce4
2005-11-27T13:26:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	by the way, how much better (and why) is xfce4 from gnome?
2005-11-27T13:27:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	I don't know that I'd say it's better, it's just different.  on my laptop xfce is faster.  I'm pretty sure xfce has a smaller memory and disk footprint.
2005-11-27T13:27:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	yeah probably... i guess i wouldn't notice it on my desktop though
2005-11-27T13:28:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	i would apt-get it if the sources weren't so damn troubled today :P
2005-11-27T13:29:00.000Z	absenth	Seven	sources are slow today eh....  one of my systems is using something other then the default mirror.  I can't remember which one though.
2005-11-27T13:31:00.000Z	Seven	absenth	yeah i gotta get my university's sources as well
