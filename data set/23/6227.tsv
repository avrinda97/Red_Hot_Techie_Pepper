2006-06-03T09:19:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	 if you dont have stuff you need to keep then a fresh install will be quicker and easier

2006-06-03T09:20:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	why would it be quicker?
2006-06-03T09:20:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	it is quicker to install everypackage from scratch than it is to remove, reinstall and reconfigure every package :)
2006-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	a fresh install would be about 15-25 minutes faster normally
2006-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	so you saying that most of my config file will not work
2006-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	do you have a seperate home partition
2006-06-03T09:22:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	no but I save most of my work on a separt fat32 partition
2006-06-03T09:23:00.000Z	skippy81		well earthen, if you have the time to spare, then you may as well backup to your NTFS parition and try the upgrade first
2006-06-03T09:24:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	Ok i was jsut wondering what the end result would be, I alway tent to beleve that nothen is better than a fresh install
2006-06-03T09:25:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	sorry for the bad typing my mind is way faster then my fingers!
2006-06-03T09:25:00.000Z	skippy81		earthen if you updrade then in theory you should get the same result as a fresh install, but you will retain all the packages you downloaded, and the contents of your home directory
2006-06-03T09:25:00.000Z	skippy81		however earthen, upgrade goes wrong in about 10% of cases
2006-06-03T09:26:00.000Z	skippy81		so backup your data whichever route you choose earthen
2006-06-03T09:26:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	and I should be able to upgrade from the cd right!
2006-06-03T09:26:00.000Z	skippy81		earthen yes, read uboto's guide
2006-06-03T09:26:00.000Z	skippy81		!upgrade
2006-06-03T09:27:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	I'm asuming it's just put the cd in the sources list
2006-06-03T09:27:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	yeah cd in sources and then a dist upgrade: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
2006-06-03T09:28:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	thanks I think i'll try the upgrade first but I will prepare for the full reinstall
2006-06-03T09:28:00.000Z	skippy81	earthen	yeah sounds like a good idea, just makesure your home directory is backed up and then you have little to lose
2006-06-03T09:29:00.000Z	earthen	skippy81	 Thanks
