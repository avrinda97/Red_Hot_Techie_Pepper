2008-05-26T12:51:00.000Z	douye		Why do i get a update notice about the AMD drivers while i got a intel processor and a nvidia videocard? :/
2008-05-26T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	What update? Are you running 32 or 64 bit?
2008-05-26T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	did you perhaps install xserver-xorg-driver-all?
2008-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	Oh, actually.  It seems that xserver-xorg might bring in a lot of that stuff depending on how its installed.
2008-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	How about xserver-xorg-video-all?
2008-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/xserver-xorg see how those depends are set up?  the -all packages (both input and video) depend on every arch it seems.  Depending on what gets chosen when you install, you may find yourself with all of those.
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	it'd be -nv
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	Or, nvidia-glx with or without -legacy
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	See the first two things after -video-2
2008-05-26T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	correct, although the -nv version might not be a bad fallback in case something goes wrong.  But yeah, you just need one of those.
2008-05-26T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	I believe you need the nvidia-settings package for that.
2008-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	I don't know.  You'll have to ask someone who has experience with it.
2008-07-19T06:19:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	What do you want to change? (and you can always look without rebooting, just see /boot/grub/menu.lst)
2008-07-19T06:21:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	You can move vista up to before the ## begin automagic debian line, and that'll work.  You'll probably want to change your default to 1 intsead of 0 then (or have vista as default)
2008-07-19T06:23:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	There's a "default " line near the top of the file
2008-07-19T06:23:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	yeah
2008-07-19T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	The other way to do the defaults is with "default saved" and then savedefault on menu entries
2008-07-19T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	That means your vista option is inside of the ### debian automagic lines, right?
2008-07-19T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	that won't work.  You *cannot* have anything else in between those two lines (it'll get erased)
2008-07-19T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	Not really, no.
2008-07-19T06:29:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	You can have it temporarily as the second option, except every time you get a new kernel, you'll need to re-do it.
2008-07-19T06:32:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	paste the whole file
2008-07-19T06:34:00.000Z	Flannel	douye	You can do that, except the next time you install a kernel update, you'll need to recopy the vista one up to under the ubuntu one.
