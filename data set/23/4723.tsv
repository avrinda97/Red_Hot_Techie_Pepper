2007-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	right click on the partition, click "umount"
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	are you pressing "apply"?
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	the error comes up when I press apply
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	what error?
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	it says /dev/sda1 is mounted
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	and I keep unmounting, but it keeps mounting back
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	ahh.
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	maybe you need to edit /etc/fstab
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	what should I edit in it
2007-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	remove the reference to sda1
2007-06-13T07:40:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	I think sudo umount -a will do that
2007-06-13T07:42:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	everytime I open GParted, it opens a new browser window with the name "disk" with my HDD
2007-06-13T07:43:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	I'm going crazy, each unmount, mounts it back up
2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	I think that the only way is to remove the lines containing "sda1" from /etc/fstab
2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	there's no sda1 in fstab
2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	remove it from /etc/mtab, perhaps
2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	nothing
2007-06-13T07:49:00.000Z	Jimmey	aMMuNix	remove the reference, then "umount /dev/sda1" in a terminal
2007-06-13T07:49:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	there was no reference
2007-06-13T07:49:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	"umount: /dev/sda1 is not mounted (according to mtab)"
2007-06-13T07:50:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	hold on I think I got it!
2007-06-13T07:50:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	I think I just fooled GParted if this works
2007-06-13T07:53:00.000Z	aMMuNix	Jimmey	I unmounted using GParted, which of course mounted it back up, then GParted still though it was unmounted, so I unmounted in a terminal, and no errors so far
