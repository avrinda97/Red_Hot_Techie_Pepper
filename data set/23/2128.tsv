2009-06-21T20:56:00.000Z	aTr		hmm why do I get e: 175 pos: 1 parser failed somehow near here: (EOL) at lighttpd.conf?
2009-06-21T20:56:00.000Z	aTr		there is no line 175
2009-06-21T20:57:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	is there a line 174?
2009-06-21T20:57:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	yes, there is a line 174
2009-06-21T20:58:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	then I would be looking for your error there, or the line above.
2009-06-21T20:58:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	i'll pastebin it
2009-06-21T20:59:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	is that your entire lighttpd.conf?
2009-06-21T20:59:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	just the end of it
2009-06-21T21:01:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	it appears your fastcgi.server section is wonky
2009-06-21T21:03:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	should I search for another fastcgi.server section?
2009-06-21T21:03:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	why not remove that and then do lighty-enable-mod fastcgi
2009-06-21T21:05:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	http://pastebin.com/d29d04f1b
2009-06-21T21:05:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	yes, you need to remove the fastcgi.server section in your lighttpd.conf
2009-06-21T21:06:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	it is removed
2009-06-21T21:07:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	does a file with mod-fastcgi exist in /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled?
2009-06-21T21:08:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	it was on the lighttpd folder, so I moved into conf-enabled
2009-06-21T21:08:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	so you didn't do sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi then?
2009-06-21T21:09:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	I did
2009-06-21T21:09:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	please pastebin the output of ls -la /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled and your new lighttpd.conf as well as /etc/init.d/lighttpd start
2009-06-21T21:13:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	here it is: http://pastebin.com/dcf6bca
2009-06-21T21:13:00.000Z	ziroday	aTr	hmm, I'd ask in #lighttpd
2009-06-21T21:15:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	let's see what's the result :)
2009-06-21T21:41:00.000Z	aTr	ziroday	I've completely purged all php5 debs and lighttpd and reinstalled them
