2010-07-29T01:44:00.000Z	itsjar		What could you guys advise me when I'm trying to fix my computer after replacing an nvidia card with an ati card?
2010-07-29T01:45:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	which ati card?
2010-07-29T01:47:00.000Z	itsjar	appamajig	I tried several things as uninstall nvidia and install fglrx, but now I get the error (EE) can't load fireGL DRM library
2010-07-29T01:47:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	well, get to an emergency root terminal with network and remove nvidia* (sudo apt-get purge nvidia*) then install nouveau (sudo apt-get install nouveau)
2010-07-29T01:48:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	probably would do it... might want to download/install ati's newest drivers
2010-07-29T01:48:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	yeah, that's the free (gpl I think) radeon drivers with 3D acceleration
2010-07-29T01:49:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	np
2010-07-29T01:50:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	ok... good luck
2010-07-29T01:58:00.000Z	itsjar	appamajig	nouveau should be standard available in the packages?
2010-07-29T01:58:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	yep, it should be in there
2010-07-29T02:00:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	hmmm... one sec lemme double check
2010-07-29T02:01:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	yeah, that's the one
2010-07-29T02:03:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	sorry for not telling you correctly to begin with :P I just remember nouveau
2010-07-29T02:06:00.000Z	itsjar	appamajig	np man, already happy someone tries :)
2010-07-29T02:07:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	:) have any luck with that? there's some weirdness with radeon video cards working well with ubuntu... I worked on it once for like three hours
2010-07-29T02:09:00.000Z	itsjar	appamajig	well.. not yet
2010-07-29T02:11:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	here's the best link that I could find when I was doing this... it explains every step and nuance to getting this to work: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
2010-07-29T02:11:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	it doesn't cover anything nvidia of course, but I think you got that already taken care of :)
2010-07-29T02:13:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	holy crap, I got confused lol nouveau is nvidia... sorry man
2010-07-29T02:13:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	but that link does tell you how to get the best ati setup... *shame*
2010-07-29T02:18:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	I'm sorry about that man, lol I have my system that I'm on, with nvidia and another with ati, and I got confused
2010-07-29T02:18:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	know this: do NOT use the fglrx drivers, those are crap :) the link I sent you has everything you need
2010-07-29T02:19:00.000Z	appamajig	itsjar	yeah... it's an nvidia driver... *furtive glances*
