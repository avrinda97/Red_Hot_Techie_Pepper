2007-11-05T21:29:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	I should have used gksudo ?
2007-11-05T21:23:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	how are you changing the file, whats the command ?
2007-11-05T21:23:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-11-05T21:23:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	do you have an nividia, or an ait ?
2007-11-05T21:24:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	If I edit the file and restart it works, but on the second restart it resets
2007-11-05T21:24:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	Nvidia propriatery(sp?) drivers
2007-11-05T21:24:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	there is an nvidia app, nvidia-xorg and nvidia-settings used to the the xorg.conf
2007-11-05T21:25:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	I will try that right now, thanks for the tip
2007-11-05T21:25:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	but you reallly need to see whats causing your file to not save or why its becoming rewritten to
2007-11-05T21:27:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	I can I check that ? I just saved the xorg.conf file through nvidia-settings (w/ merging option)
2007-11-05T21:27:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	did you use gksudo or sudo ?
2007-11-05T21:27:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	sudo
2007-11-05T21:30:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	as long as you use either, the file will be saved...
2007-11-05T21:30:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	any idea how to check why a file gets replaced on reboot ?
2007-11-05T21:31:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	read the verbose output (but I think your imaging things :)
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	1) edit the xorg.conf - save 2) restart 3) 1360x768 is there 4) restart again - back to 1024x768 with a replaced xorg.conf file. -------- I set the refresh rate in nvidia-settings to 60 but the screens/res panel in administration says i'm in 76hz :S
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	you dont have to explain it to me 3-4 times, I got it the first, tahts why I am helping....
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	lol ok cuz with "(but I think your imaging things" i though you were saying I was imaginating things :P
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	but just to let you know something that I know, you are imaging things, there is no way something is just going to change your xorg.conf, you had to have setup something to do it, a computer doesnt think/perform actions that itself deems necessary
2007-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	a bug in ubuntu could do it (maybe)... a conflict between nvidia driver and the way ubuntu is setup
2007-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	neverblue	xplatinum	I havent seen anyone else have you imaginary issue yet :)
2007-11-05T21:48:00.000Z	xplatinum	neverblue	ok problem solved. the file was indeed being reset by nvidia drivers because I did not save the xorg.conf through their settings panel. After merging settings to xorg.conf file and # the old screen section, everything is fine after every single reboot.
