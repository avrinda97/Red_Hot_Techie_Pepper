2007-09-13T13:52:00.000Z	heartsblood		could somebody please explain the difference between the nvidia and nv modules?
2007-09-13T13:53:00.000Z	heartsblood		figured as much
2007-09-13T13:54:00.000Z	heartsblood		has anybody had problems getting the nvidia module to load on ubuntu systems?  I dont ever remember haveing much of a problem in deb.
2007-09-13T13:55:00.000Z	heartsblood		I get no return from modprobe nvidia
2007-09-13T13:56:00.000Z	heartsblood		the error in the gdm/xorg logs say "failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel moduel. ><
2007-09-13T13:57:00.000Z	heartsblood		I'm wondering if letting invidia compile it's own moduel was a good idea.
2007-09-13T13:57:00.000Z	heartsblood		nvidia*
2007-09-13T13:58:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	invidia is awfully close to invidious, and it can be :)
2007-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	sudo updatedb
2007-10-19T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	gconf-editor, navigate to /etc/nautilus/desktop  or preferences , look for desktop
2007-10-19T10:50:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	ty
2007-10-21T10:44:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	~/.gconf/apps/metacity (access it with gconf-editor, navigate to apps/metacity)
2007-10-21T10:46:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	maybe I wasn't clear enough.  Where are is the setting that determines what window manager is used?
2007-10-21T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	ah, that's shifted around and I've lost track ;(
2008-01-05T02:14:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	the ubuntu libgpod doesn't support it. You'd have to compile it
2008-04-06T03:43:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	gl apps and compiz simply don't get along well
2008-04-06T03:43:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	so I've noticed.
2008-04-06T03:44:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	is there anything I can do besides metacity --replace every time I want to run something full screen?
2008-04-06T03:44:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	#compiz-fusion probably could explain why, it you're really interested
2008-04-06T03:44:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	good idea, i'll go pester them
2008-04-06T04:52:00.000Z	heartsblood	nickrud	I just wanted to let you know, in case anybody else asks, the 10 minute period between crashes was significant.  It turns out that the screen saver was the culprit, but only causes problems in compiz.  I don't know why yet, but disabling the screen saver allows me to run full screen GL apps with compiz running without crashes.
2008-04-06T04:55:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	try using a screensaver that doesn't use gl
2008-04-06T04:57:00.000Z	nickrud	heartsblood	hm. Oh well, I'll keep that one in mind
