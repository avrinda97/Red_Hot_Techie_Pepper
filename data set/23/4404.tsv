2008-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		I'm using Gutsy and tried to test flash player by going to youtube. firefox reported i needed to install either flash player or gnash. i installed flash player - still wasn't working. i installed gnash aswell, still not working. Any ideas?
2008-01-10T17:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	the ubuntu flash package is currently broke
2008-01-30T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	where is it trying to write, and exactly what file/location ?
2008-01-30T14:33:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	../txt/area.tst: Permission denied is what it says in the log. its /home/etrials/Rom24/area/area.tst
2008-01-30T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	please show me the permissions on the file
2008-01-30T14:33:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	How do i find it out?
2008-01-30T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	ls -la /home/etrials/Rom24/area/area.tst

2008-01-30T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	what is the user launching the mud process ?
2008-01-30T14:35:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	enigma
2008-01-30T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	then you need to either make enigma the owner of that file - or you need to chmod it to be world writeable
2008-10-24T17:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	it's not stable
2009-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	just a repo on the cd
2009-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	on the dvd sorry
2010-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	its actually very efficient for me, I've been monitoring it for the past 1.5 hours while I've been on a train
2010-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	i'm noticing 50-200meg jumps in memory consumption over a 24 hour period. over short amounts of time i don't noticemuch change
2010-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	that's still a reasonable change, I didn'tsee anything
2010-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	w works of uid
2010-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	you have created a user sharing the same uid as root - that's your issue
2010-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	yea :( how can i now remove it?
2010-09-07T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	you'll have to use the gui, or manually remove it from the password and shadow file
2010-09-07T14:49:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	ikonia	jeez, that message might have been helpful before i'd actually tried it :) luckily it failed
2010-09-07T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Flynsarmy	no
