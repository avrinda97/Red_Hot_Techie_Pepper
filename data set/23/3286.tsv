2008-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	kibibyte	redwyrm	how to change keyboard layout
2008-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	are you familiar with the xmodmap command?
2008-05-25T11:34:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	I'm going to google for a minute or two and find you a keymap to use
2008-05-25T11:34:00.000Z	kibibyte	redwyrm	in xorg.conf i have  Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"
2008-05-25T11:35:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	do you know how to edit a file?
2008-05-25T11:36:00.000Z	kibibyte	redwyrm	i know but is there any app tool for change x keymap
2008-05-25T11:47:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	sorry, I got distracted by conversations in other channels
2008-05-25T11:47:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	the tool you need is xmodmap
2008-05-25T11:48:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	and the way you use it is by piping the appropriate modmap file to it
2008-05-25T11:48:00.000Z	kibibyte	redwyrm	 how
2008-05-25T11:49:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	  xmodmap < modmapfile
2008-05-25T11:49:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	the downside is that you need to use that command every time you start up X
2008-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	I'm not sure how you would make it permanent... all I know how to do is to change it when you start up X
2008-05-25T11:51:00.000Z	redwyrm	kibibyte	sorry
