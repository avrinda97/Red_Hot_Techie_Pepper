2005-10-30T14:03:00.000Z	cool_guy		with good graphics n
2005-10-30T14:04:00.000Z	cool_guy		where do we get it?
2005-10-30T14:04:00.000Z	cool_guy		do we get games as we get in windows?
2005-10-30T14:04:00.000Z	cool_guy		not the built in games guys
2005-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	yes, we have lots of games. but they are not the same games of course
2005-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	it would help if you told us which game you're talking about
2005-10-30T14:07:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	UT works iirc
2005-10-30T14:10:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	you can boot win2k but not xp?
2005-10-30T14:10:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	how did you dual boot the windows versions previously?
2005-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	maybe you will have to add xp to win2k's boot loader. so you can choose linux/windows with grub and if you boot windows you have another choice =)
2005-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	you probably can't do that non-destructively
2005-10-30T14:24:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	so tell your boot loader about all your operating systems. look at the win2k stanza in /boot/grub/menu.lst and create one for xp
2005-10-30T14:26:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	not really, i told you exactly what to do :)
2005-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	it's easiest, yes
2005-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	of course
2005-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	please search the web for examples. i have no idea how to boot windows
2005-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	you're the only one who knows where your xp installation is
2005-10-30T14:31:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	and it's a primary partition right?
2005-10-30T14:32:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	is it on the first disk?
2005-10-30T14:33:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	so, open a terminal and do "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdb" and see what partitions you have, and which one would be the xp installation
2005-10-30T14:35:00.000Z	topyli	cool_guy	why don't you check? "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda" and you will see for yourself. we can't really see your disk from here
