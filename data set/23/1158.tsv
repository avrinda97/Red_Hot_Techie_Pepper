2012-01-10T22:04:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	im doing a apt-get install puppet
2012-01-10T22:04:00.000Z	krish		and I already have puppet.conf in /etc/puppet
2012-01-10T22:04:00.000Z	krish		so it presents me with option to either take maintainers version or with my version
2012-01-10T22:05:00.000Z	krish		how can i over write this on command line itself
2012-01-10T22:05:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	^
2012-01-10T22:06:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	im doing a apt-get install puppet.  and I already have puppet.conf in /etc/puppet. so it presents me with option to either take maintainers version or with my version. how can i over write this on command line itself
2012-01-10T22:06:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	If you're using apt-get install puppet it defaults to the highest version available.
2012-01-10T22:07:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	its not the version issue
2012-01-10T22:07:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	if I already have the config file in /etc/puppet , it will ask me either to take maintainers version or not
2012-01-10T22:08:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	i dont want user to wait for that option, rather specify it in apt-get itself
2012-01-10T22:08:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	on the command line itself.. any help
2012-01-10T22:08:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	One second, my internet is being stupid right now...
2012-01-10T22:11:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	Have you tried invoking the program directly "puppet --help" to see if you can call the version at startup that way?
2012-01-10T22:12:00.000Z	krish	cypher-neo	what would I achieve with that? :)
2012-01-10T22:15:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	Let me clarify what you're trying to do. You want to install puppet from a particular source automatically at startup?
2012-01-10T22:15:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	Using apt-get
2012-01-10T22:16:00.000Z	cypher-neo	krish	Otherwise it gives you an option between 2 different versions?
