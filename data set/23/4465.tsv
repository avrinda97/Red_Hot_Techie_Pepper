2007-10-20T14:07:00.000Z	sku		i can't easily paste anything as i'm using a different comp.  but the last relevant thing in dmesg is "eth1: no ipv6 routers present".  there is some message during bootup, but it flashes past too quickly.  are these messages stored in a logfile somewhere?
2007-10-20T14:08:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	try dmesg > dmesg.txt to catch your bootup from a terminal
2007-10-20T14:12:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	"/sbin/ifconfig: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token ` ---garbage here--- '
2007-10-20T14:14:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	and that was from dmesg > dmesg.txt ?
2007-10-20T14:14:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	no, that was from ifconfig eth1
2007-10-20T14:15:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	have you modified /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-10-20T14:16:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	i'll try and copy dmesg.txt over.  how do i get it to you online?
2007-10-20T14:16:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	paste it here --> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-10-20T14:16:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	i haven't modified anything, but i did have a total power failure which required fscking afterwards
2007-10-20T14:17:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	Oooohhh yuck!
2007-10-20T14:17:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	see if you can pastebin the txt to me
2007-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	how did you go?
2007-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	all my computers are crashing on me :(  I'm thinking i might just do a fresh install of 7.10, usb appears to be not functioning properly either
2007-10-20T14:28:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	nasty, if your data isn't important it may be easier!
2007-10-20T14:35:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	dmesg is in the pastebin.  (the computer crashing i was having was to do with unplugging a particular memory stick.  it happened on different computers so maybe it's an ubuntu bug)
2007-10-20T14:36:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	what is the url?
2007-10-20T14:36:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	I will be a few minutes, I am on dialup here :(
2007-10-20T14:37:00.000Z	sku	mechdave	wow! how do you do it?  many thanks for your help
2007-10-20T14:38:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	It is annoying me greatly, but the telephone company refuses to put in new phone lines so I can get internet!
2007-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	this is crap... damn Telstra and dialup!
2007-10-20T14:55:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	can you paste /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-10-20T14:57:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	Ubuntu is seeing your card and giving it device eth1, so that is at least ok!
2007-10-20T15:33:00.000Z	mechdave	sku	did that fix your problems?
