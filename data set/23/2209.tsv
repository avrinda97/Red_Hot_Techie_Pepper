2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		hey, is there a SEARCH feature in APTGET?
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		when i try to go apt-get search something, it says ERROR NO SUCH COMMAND
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	darlek	jvainio	 sudo apt-cache search whateverI'mlookingfor
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		ah
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		ok
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		thanks a lot mates
2009-05-29T13:12:00.000Z	darlek		cheers
2009-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	darlek		habit I guess
2009-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	jvainio		and if the command doesnt find anything, it doesnt print anything out, right_
2009-05-29T13:14:00.000Z	darlek		jva: then the word isn't there
2009-05-29T13:14:00.000Z	darlek		what are you looking for?
2009-05-29T13:14:00.000Z	darlek		it might be under a different name that you expect
2009-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	darlek		also under your current system, type apropos whateveritIS , and that will check current files
2009-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio	darlek	Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
2009-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio		straight Dcrawl will do
2009-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio		but stone soup would be so much better
2009-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	darlek		ext3 is well established though and fine for most systems.
2009-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	jvainio	darlek	now it says it cannot even install basic crawl
2009-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	jvainio		that it cannot "Lock installation folder"
2009-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	jvainio		wtf
2009-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	darlek		jvo: got about 1000 hits on google with Dungeon crawl stone soup ubuntu, so some hope there
2009-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	darlek		you might have to compile the latest version though
2009-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	jvainio	darlek	i have the newest ubuntu and i just updated
