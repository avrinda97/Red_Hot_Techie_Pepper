2007-02-09T16:19:00.000Z	LycoLoco		anyone here to help at this hour?
2007-02-09T16:21:00.000Z	LycoLoco		I'm having issues with booting back into ubuntu after trying to set up my mouse: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2128110&postcount=399
2007-02-09T16:22:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	um.. why were you trying to set up a printer in fstab?
2007-02-09T16:22:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	I dunno man, it was something that was suggested, so I tried it - obviously it failed :-p
2007-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	/etc/fstab is only for mounting of disks.. printers is /etc/printcap
2007-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	I know, I know, however that's not an issue anymore - the current issue is with my mouse
2007-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	try running 'udevstart' as root
2007-02-09T16:24:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	I can't even get to a terminal
2007-02-09T16:24:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	ctrl-alt-F1 ?
2007-02-09T16:24:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	it doesn't even get that far, but lemme try
2007-02-09T16:38:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	where does it stop booting?
2007-02-09T16:39:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	looks like it's having trouble mounting that disk.. or detecting it properly
2007-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	yeah, I know what you mean, but as I said, I had this problem before after messing around with udev, and when I removed the code last time, it worked again
2007-02-09T16:41:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	are you running 6.06?
2007-02-09T16:41:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	you shouldn't need to edit udev to detect the mouse.. it should automatically detect it
2007-02-09T16:41:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	it's not a problem about mouse detection, it's about trying to get extra buttons working
2007-02-09T16:42:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	oh that's easy. just edit xorg.conf and put in Option "ZAxisMapping"   "4 5"
2007-02-09T16:42:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	yeah, now you tell me :-p
2007-02-09T16:45:00.000Z	fialar	LycoLoco	I'd undo those 6.06 evdev / udev instructions
2007-02-09T16:46:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	ok - I did remove the udev file that I created, is there anything else that would cause issues?
2007-02-09T16:46:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	any where else that I should look to delete files?
2007-02-09T16:48:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	as far as I know, I didn't do anything to the system other than install imwheel, install xvkbd and xbindkeys, create the udev file (which I deleted) and edited my xorg.conf (which I returned to how it was before this mess started)
2007-02-09T16:52:00.000Z	LycoLoco	fialar	any other ideas?
