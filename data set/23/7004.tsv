2006-10-03T10:18:00.000Z	ANTDx1		I've been in and out of here all day trying different fixes for the same problem: when I boot Ubuntu, it keeps stopping at the part where it is "loading manual drivers"  During this time, the wireless light on my laptop blinks softly.  Does anyone have any possible solutions to this?
2006-10-03T10:20:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	are you booting single user that you see that message?
2006-10-03T10:21:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	ok lets start from the beginning when and were do you see that message
2006-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	ok what version of ubuntu
2006-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	i dont run ubuntu but dont you have two entrys in the  grub menu one for single user?
2006-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	does one say failsafe
2006-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	answer drews question about the video driver
2006-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	when it stops what is the longest time you have waited before forcing a reboot?
2006-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	ok lets wait for about 5-7 to 10 minutes to see if there is a timeout problem and it hits it and when the timeout is reached it go ahead a boots
2006-10-03T10:29:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	no waiting for a while has bit me a lot in the past
2006-10-03T10:29:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	no=not
2006-10-03T10:30:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	wait for at least 7 minutes
2006-10-03T10:42:00.000Z	ANTDx1	jtholmes	 I now have another problem: my computer is at 100% use..constantly
2006-10-03T10:42:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	so disable the wireless since it was the last thing you did
2006-10-03T10:43:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	the wifi is probably a module do you know how to unload it
2006-10-03T10:44:00.000Z	ANTDx1	jtholmes	Not a clue.  I isntalled a driver that I thought would work.  It was working but now it doesn't.  IT could be because I tried installing two different drivers...the first one did't seem to work.
2006-10-03T10:44:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	hmm... interseting do you know the names of the drivers you installed
2006-10-03T10:45:00.000Z	ANTDx1	jtholmes	 One was bcmxxxx I believe.  That one didn't work.
2006-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	ok execute   lsmod | grep -i bcm  and see is one of the names is  bcmxxx  something
2006-10-03T10:48:00.000Z	ANTDx1	jtholmes	, no response from the terminal..it just moved to the next line
2006-10-03T10:48:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	ok so that driver is not loaded (it appears)  what was the other driver name
2006-10-03T10:49:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	if you dont remember then execute   lsmod  |  less and scroll thru the list and see if anything comes to mind
2006-10-03T10:50:00.000Z	jtholmes	ANTDx1	that is   lsmod | less    less is a pager in case you are use to more
