2006-01-27T06:34:00.000Z	Comrade_Sergei		ok which is better wine or cedega
2006-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	wine is better for apps, cedega is better for games
2006-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	but cedega also costs money
2006-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	Sometimes.
2006-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	You'd have to try it and see.
2006-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	err, you install wine from synaptic
2006-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	'wine'
2006-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	you need to enable universe
2006-01-27T06:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	how do you use WINE?
2006-01-27T06:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	it should be setup so double clicking on an exe file opens it in WINE.
2006-01-27T06:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	I just told you.
2006-01-27T06:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	Put in the install CD.
2006-01-27T06:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	You can't play the already installed version.
2006-01-27T06:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	Sorry, I'm not going to help you break the law.
2006-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	join #cedega, they'll help you compile the CVS version of cedega (it's free, but doesn't have any support for SafeDisc and etc)
2006-01-27T07:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	I have no idea, but please don't shout.
2006-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	I'm not even in #cedega, how could I have banned you?
2006-01-27T07:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	They're don't tolerate people who aren't willing to help themselves. Did they at least give you a link to a FAQ or something first?
2006-01-27T07:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Comrade_Sergei	I know nothing about cedega, sorry.
