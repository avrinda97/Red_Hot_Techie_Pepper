2011-03-10T22:57:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	Stop repeating ;) What do you want to know :)
2011-03-10T22:58:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	You can use gcc, use -Wall for warnings
2011-03-10T22:58:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	man gcc for extra options
2011-03-10T23:00:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	you use gcc myfile.c to compile and then you can run your progam a.out
2011-03-10T23:01:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	use -Wall to get all warnings and -o mybinary to specify an outputfile/
2011-03-10T23:02:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	Yes, but maybe it's a good idea to search for tutorials with compiling c in linux or something. Or type man gcc for instructions.
2011-03-10T23:06:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	What ubuntu version are you running?
2011-03-10T23:07:00.000Z	dj__	hnsz	m running 10.10
2011-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	It's possible you already have it, system>preferences>appearance>visual effects select extra
2011-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	May not be bleeding edge but you do get the effect most people are searching for.
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	dj__	hnsz	u dr
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	You dont get the wobbly screens? Verify that it is selected, do you get a warning?
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	When you drag a window does it wobble?
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	Need what?
2011-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	dj__	hnsz	i need mouse effects
2011-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	hnsz	dj__	Which one?
2011-03-10T23:13:00.000Z	dj__	hnsz	cum on single chat
