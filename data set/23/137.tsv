2012-10-11T21:21:00.000Z	hilo		how can I set a shell script to run at boot completion time, and have it run as a specific user?
2012-10-11T21:21:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	in /etc/rc.local: su -c '/path/to/script' username
2012-10-11T21:23:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	Thanks!!
2012-10-11T21:27:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	is there a similar file where I can place shell scripts that need to run before the system starts shutting down and sending sigterm to all the processes? (I am trying to figure out a way to gracefully shutdown or save state for virtual machines that are running at the time of a shutdown command)
2012-10-11T21:28:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	/etc/rc.shutdown ;)
2012-10-11T21:28:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	well that makes sense.
2012-10-11T21:28:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	thanks
2012-10-11T21:29:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	Wait, that's wrong, seems that's not in Ubuntu :/
2012-10-11T21:29:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	yeah doesn't exist on my system :(
2012-10-11T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	Okay, well, copy a random script to /etc/init.d and run "sudo update-rc.d myscript start 0 6". Kinda old way but I have no other ideas
2012-10-11T21:33:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	can you explain what the latter parts of that are actually saying? "start 0 6"
2012-10-11T21:33:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	"start on runlevels 0 (system shutdown) and 6 (system reboot)"
2012-10-11T21:34:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	awesome, thanks
2012-10-12T20:08:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	What do you want to do with the string exactly?
2012-10-12T20:09:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	it is output from a command to show me what VM's are currently running. It gives the name and uuid.. I need to pass JUST the name to the vboxmanage command to shut off the vm gracefully
2012-10-12T20:10:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	so it is like this "NAME" {uuid}
2012-10-12T20:10:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	I need to strip off the {uuid} / parse out the name
2012-10-12T20:11:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	Oh, heh. echo $string | sed -r 's/\{.*\}//g' | sed -r 's/\"//g' will do the trick.
2012-10-12T20:12:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	can you explain that to me? it looks like magic.
2012-10-12T20:12:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	Regular expressions... They are beyond explaining in a single message
2012-10-12T20:13:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	okay, I'll take it. works flawlessly
2012-10-12T20:14:00.000Z	hilo	theadmin	thanks, if you know any good regular expressions tutorials, I'd love to take a look.
2012-10-12T20:14:00.000Z	theadmin	hilo	I don't think I really know any, eh, I don't remember how I learned them
