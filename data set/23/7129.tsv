2005-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	is there something we can help you with?
2005-10-14T16:14:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	sorry I'm unable to get highlighting of a specific nick in xchat working, do you know?
2005-10-14T11:50:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	yes you can, install openssh-server
2005-10-14T11:50:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	and this will be graphical? I don't want to access it using the terminal. I want to login, as if I was using the computer
2005-10-14T11:50:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	you can use vnc or xforwading
2005-10-14T11:51:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	but vnc is more or less just sending images of the other computer no? :)  I want to login to my other computer but use the computer power in this computer
2005-10-14T11:51:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	then use xforwarding
2005-10-14T11:52:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	ok great! so if I have fast computer A and I want to login using the preferences saved on computer B, I just use xforwarding ?
2005-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	hwaara no. xforwarding uses the prefs on the powerful box you log into
2005-10-14T11:59:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	I seem to have both xauth and xhost on both my computers. are they integrated in GNOME or ubuntu somehow?
2005-10-14T12:01:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	i believe they are part of the xserver
2005-10-14T12:01:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	ask uncle googla "xforwarding ssh howto"
2005-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	:)
2005-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	we're trying...
2005-10-15T14:56:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	please dont paste in here
2005-10-20T13:34:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	data i/o speed
2005-10-20T13:35:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	it can use pc133
2005-10-20T13:35:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	the pc133 will slow down to pc100, tho
2005-10-20T13:35:00.000Z	hwaara	nalioth	sure! as long as my PC at least recognizes it (which it doesn't right now). this is my problem.
2005-10-20T13:41:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	ignore it usually
2005-10-20T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	hwaara	that is to be expected
