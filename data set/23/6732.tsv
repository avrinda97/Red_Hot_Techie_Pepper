2006-01-17T11:03:00.000Z	Miyomei		Okay, I'm having a load of problems.
2006-01-17T11:04:00.000Z	Miyomei		First off, I'm running from the LiveCD right now. I moved my ubuntu HDD plus others to a new PC, and now it wont boot. It keeps looking for root in /dev/hda1.
2006-01-17T11:06:00.000Z	Miyomei		Along with not being able to boot into my Ubuntu install, I want to shrink the partition, but it wont even let me do it from the LiveCD.
2006-01-17T11:06:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- edit you're fstab to reflect the new /dev/hd??
2006-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	Miyomei	vskye	- How would I go agout doing that? I mean, the command?
2006-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- try a emergency boot, (can't recall) and the location of you're boot hd, ala /dev/hda1 or whatever and then after boot edit /etc/fstab
2006-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	Miyomei		Alright. Also, how do I shrink the partition size of my Linux partiton?
2006-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- sorry for the total lack of details, but I just converted from SuSE a month or so ago.
2006-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	Miyomei	vskye	- Better than I am; this is only my third day of Linux from XP. ;p
2006-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- ;)

2006-01-17T11:11:00.000Z	Miyomei		Those are the problems I'm having, but vskye helped me out a bit with the first.
2006-01-17T11:12:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- if you can, try putting the drives back in the same order as they were on the old computer.
2006-01-17T11:12:00.000Z	Miyomei	vskye	- The case layout is physically different, so I'm not able to.
2006-01-17T11:13:00.000Z	Miyomei		And, it would let me alter the partition on my Linux HDD if 'extended' and 'linux-swap' weren't mounted, but I don't know how to unmount them.
2006-01-17T11:14:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- been there, done that! So, hda1 would be the first partition on (C:) and hda2 would be the second parition, etc.
2006-01-17T11:15:00.000Z	Miyomei		Right. But now my Linux drive is hdb1.
2006-01-17T11:15:00.000Z	Miyomei		But it's still looking in hda1 for root.
2006-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	Miyomei		But I can't get into the system to change it.
2006-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	Miyomei		Unless I mount hda1, I guess, but I don't know how.
2006-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	Miyomei		I'm on it right now. ;p
2006-01-17T11:17:00.000Z	vskye	Miyomei	- So why not just as swap the ide cables?  Just to get the thing to boot and change the reference from /dev/hda1 to /dev/hdb1?
