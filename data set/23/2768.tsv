2009-04-06T01:05:00.000Z	manzur	Brucevdk	can u help me do a plugin for nautilus
2009-04-06T01:06:00.000Z	Brucevdk	manzur	you can't specifically do this as a plugin either (you'd have to hack on Nautilus itself), see: http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus/Development However, there might be some people working on someting like this for Google's Summer of Code.
2009-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	manzur	Brucevdk	what is that google's ....???
2009-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	Brucevdk	manzur	Google sponsors an event where students are paid over the summer to work on Open Source projects (like an internship), http://code.google.com/soc/
