2010-06-17T17:18:00.000Z	Incarnation		Hi - I am attempting to figure out what the term "multiplexer" means in the following context: "If you have access to an SSH server where you can install and run  Irssi, it is also recommended to install screen, a terminal multiplexer."
2010-06-17T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 you have more then 1 terminal at a time, you switch btween them via key combox.
2010-06-17T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 you could think of your tv as a 'video multiplexer' :) it can change channels..
2010-06-17T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 screen is WORTH learning to use if you are going to be using ssh/terminal a lot
2010-06-17T17:19:00.000Z	Incarnation	Dr_Willis	okay
2010-06-17T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 you ssh in, run screen, then run irssi in screen.. you dont need to run a 2nd ssh session then
2010-06-17T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 unless you WANT to run it locally...
2010-06-17T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 so you dont need to run a second ssh session some where else...
2010-06-17T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 thats the whold point of screen... sssh in once.. have dozen+ shells going if you want..
2010-06-17T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 your use of the term 'just a '   is belittling :)
2010-06-17T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 ;)
2010-06-27T00:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 gcc --version  ?
2010-06-27T00:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 most apps have a --version option :)
2010-06-27T00:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 some odd ones  dont.. but they are rare. :)
2010-06-27T00:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 yep. It pays to learn the fundamentals.. and you get amazed at how well thoguht out/logical linux can be. :) well parts of it at least.
2010-06-27T00:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 think of 'legos and layers' Linux is lots of little blocks. building up layers of the OS. It pays to learn at least the basics of the blocks.
2010-06-27T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 I buy lots of linux books from the clearance section of the book store.. keep them in the 'reading room'  :) and read them for about 5 min every morning,.,.
2010-06-27T00:31:00.000Z	Incarnation	Dr_Willis	how do you manage to remember all that stuff?
2010-06-27T00:31:00.000Z	Incarnation	Dr_Willis	my main concern is with biology
2010-06-27T00:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 you rember what you use.. and  if i stumble upon somthing i need to learn/use.. i 'rember' that i saw it in some book.. and i go back to it.
2010-06-27T00:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 for example. I dont Use scp every day.. but i rember the basics of what i read   and the core idea that 'scp' is supposed to work like 'cp' only with  user@server type addresses also. :)
2010-06-29T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 it might also need 'sun java' not the other java.
2010-06-29T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Incarnation	 run it from terminal. look for error messatges
