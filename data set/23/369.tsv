2011-10-30T22:51:00.000Z	padmick		sorry
2011-10-30T22:52:00.000Z	padmick		im using wubi and every time 1 try to start ubuntu all i get is a purple screen can any 1 help?
2011-10-30T22:54:00.000Z	padmick		does anyone here use wubi?
2011-10-30T22:55:00.000Z	escott	padmick	not a lot of wubi users here. im afriad. the purple screen, can you tell if it is grub, or is it plymouth? ie is it after you selected to boot to wubi or before? If it is after have you tried pressing the up arrow?
2011-10-30T22:56:00.000Z	escott	padmick	in plymouth the up arrow drops you back to the framebuffer so you can see kernel messages
2011-10-30T22:57:00.000Z	escott	padmick	its helpful if there is some kind of issue with the hardware as you can usually see what is causing the kernel to get stuck. if the problem is grub not being able to find the wubi image file on the ntfs partition that i have no idea how to help with, except to suggest not using wubi
2011-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	padmick	escott	whats happing is
2011-10-30T23:01:00.000Z	escott	padmick	AFAIK the wubi image file is just an ext4 file you can loopmount. so boot your livecd and loop mount the wubi image file
2011-10-30T23:04:00.000Z	padmick	escott	could u simpifly what u are saying to me thanks
2011-10-30T23:04:00.000Z	escott	padmick	wubi has a file which is an image file of the contents of wubi's / partition. the livecd can mount the ntfs partition to /media/NTFS or something, and then you can loop mount (just a fancy way to say mount this file as if it were a device) the wubi image file to /media/wubi
2011-10-30T23:05:00.000Z	escott	padmick	then you can recover your data/move it outside the wubi image file to the ntfs partition and have it accessible under windows
2011-10-30T23:10:00.000Z	escott	padmick	best to wait until you have booted the livecd then we can walk you through it.
2011-10-30T23:14:00.000Z	escott	padmick	you may have to install a client, but yes as long as you can get online you can get to irc from the livecd
2011-10-30T23:59:00.000Z	padmick	escott	u probeally dont remember me but i was talking to u earlyer and u said u would help me with my wubi when i get my live cd workin so here i am
2011-10-30T23:59:00.000Z	escott	padmick	yes. are you in the livecd
2011-10-31T00:00:00.000Z	escott	padmick	open the file browser and find and click on the windows drive until you can see its contents
2011-10-31T00:02:00.000Z	escott	padmick	now open a terminal and type "mount" it should tell you what folder the windows partition is mounted to
2011-10-31T00:03:00.000Z	escott	padmick	after you have identified where the windows partition is rooted to you can try and find the wubi image file. i don't know where that would be
2011-10-31T00:04:00.000Z	padmick	escott	all i am seein is a hole lade of gibberish in the termal that makes no sence
2011-10-31T00:06:00.000Z	escott	padmick	mount will output stuff like /dev/sda3 on /path/to/folder type whatever. the point is to figure out where the ntfs partition is mounted so we can later get the full path to the wubi image file
2011-10-31T00:06:00.000Z	escott	padmick	you don't have to use mount to figure that out
