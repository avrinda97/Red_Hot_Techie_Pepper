2006-10-06T09:14:00.000Z	Quintin		I installed KDE
2006-10-06T09:14:00.000Z	Quintin		and I hate it </3
2006-10-06T09:14:00.000Z	Quintin		what is proper way to "undo" installing it?
2006-10-06T09:14:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	you don't have to uninstall it, just don't run it.
2006-10-06T09:14:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	..................
2006-10-06T09:21:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	you don't like it, which is certainly your privilege.  I use it every day.
2006-10-06T09:21:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	as I said before, you don't have to run something just because it's installed
2006-10-06T09:21:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	thank you, again, for stating the obvious.  :)
2007-02-19T07:53:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	as well as edit fstab, and menu.lst
2007-02-19T07:54:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	possibly, possibly not.  if he has the same layout other than partition sizes, fstab will be fine, and menu.lst is likely to be fine if he is replacing a drive with a larger or different one.
2007-02-19T07:55:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	the uuid of the partitions isn't going to be the same.
2007-02-19T07:55:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	that won't impact fstab or menu.lst
2007-02-19T07:56:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	you're perfectly correct if by 'won't impact'  you mean 'will keep the kernel from booting'
2007-02-19T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	I think you are seriously confused.
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	paste your /etc/fstab and menu.lst for me then.
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	mine?  what do mine have to do with anything?
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	So I can show where you are mistaken
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	I just did this *yesterday*.  trust me
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	I have only ext3 partitions.  there is nothing in fstab related to uid
2007-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	if you are assigning uids to windows partitions, then something might have to change, but not otherwise.
2007-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	Quintin	sethk	uuid ... not uid
2007-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	either way, it doesn't appear in fstab.
2007-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	Quintin	my fstab is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6503/
