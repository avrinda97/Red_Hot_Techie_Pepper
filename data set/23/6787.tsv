2006-01-03T10:22:00.000Z	aconbere		is there a place to dig up system requirements for running ubuntu (disk space in particular)?
2006-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  2G min
2006-01-03T10:59:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  what package are you trying to apt-get
2006-01-03T11:00:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	well I tried openssh-server and gnome-taskbar
2006-01-03T11:00:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	??  did you do a server install?
2006-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  did apt-get install openssh-server  finish?
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	I didn't do a server install I figured that an ssh daemon is fairly standard affair for any machine.
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	it won't run, it wants me to run dpkg --configure -a, which gives this bus error "over-current on port 1"
2006-01-03T11:06:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  type   ps -ale | grep ssh
2006-01-03T11:06:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  do you see sshd
2006-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	but I mean... I just want to install anything I know how to administer a *nix machine.
2006-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  using your command is not normal    if you want more background  google will help
2006-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	I don't want to run it, but ubuntu's base install won't let my run apt-get without running dpkg --configure -a
2006-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  ok  now your asking a different question
2006-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	no I'm not I'm asking the same question I have been :)
2006-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  apt-get update doesnt work at all?
2006-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	no, the install crashes consistently in the middle of the 2nd stage
2006-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  ??? the install never finished?
2006-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	no
2006-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	and there doesn't seem to be a way to restart at the second stage
2006-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	 well  you went from this> pashaw: well I tried openssh-server and gnome-taskbar  to  install failing
2006-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	aconbere	pashaw	nah you just missed some sections
2006-01-03T11:12:00.000Z	pashaw	aconbere	  thoreauputic's suggestion is a good idea to try if desktop install keeps failing
