2007-04-20T05:59:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	xchat won't install on feisty :/
2007-04-20T06:00:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	really? an error?
2007-04-20T06:00:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	xchat: Depends: tcl8.4 (>= 8.4.5) but it is not installable
2007-04-20T06:01:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	So I need to install tcl8.4 first?
2007-04-20T06:01:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	yes, but there seems to be some issue.  Put our sources.list file on a pastebin
2007-04-20T06:05:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16545/
2007-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	done a 'sudo apt-get update' recently?
2007-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	let me try that
2007-04-20T06:11:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	seems like I'm having a problem, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16546/
2007-04-20T06:13:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	yes, i'd try another mirror ...
2007-04-20T06:14:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	Do I change what mirror I'm using in synaptic or something?
2007-04-20T06:16:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	you can modify mirrors via synaptic but probably the easiest way is to edity /etc/apt/sources.list directly
2007-04-20T06:16:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	'gksudo "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"'
2007-04-20T06:17:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	ok, that worked...so I just replace http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ with another mirror I find?
2007-04-20T06:18:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	yes, choose one from that page ubotu mentioned
2007-04-20T06:24:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	check this out, http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/
2007-04-20T06:25:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	yes i've seen that.  Wasn't sure if it would give you a wide choice of mirrors though.
2007-04-20T06:28:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	bimberi	got xchat, thanks for all your help :)
2007-04-20T06:29:00.000Z	bimberi	BrokenLinux	cool, np :)
