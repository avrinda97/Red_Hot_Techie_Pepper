2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		hihi all
2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		We just installed Ubuntu on a laptop, and it all works nicely except for DVD playback.
2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		Totem says "Totem could not play 'dvd://' Error invoking "dvdnav_get_next_block": Error reading NAV packet"
2005-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	Jan_		*heavenly chorus*
2005-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	Jan_		Yes.
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	Jan_		I assumed it would be something like that.

2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	don't use ubuntuguide, use the wiki
2005-09-30T13:38:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	lol
2005-09-30T13:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	you probably need to enable DMA
2005-09-30T13:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	do a search in Synaptic for it
2005-09-30T13:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	or there ;) P229
2005-09-30T14:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	maybe you should consider downloading Hoary and installing that, it is stable, Breezy will be released offically oct 13
2005-09-30T14:03:00.000Z	Jan_	tristanmike	we were told to use Breezy. I'm sure if we download Hoary someone will tell us to use Breezy. It's a vicious circle with Linux.
2005-09-30T14:04:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	haha, that's too bad, don't listen to them, I recommend using the stable release, I do, it's fine, untill you start to know a little bit more of what to do, I would stay with the stable releases
2005-09-30T14:42:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	you make a FAT partition to share data
2005-09-30T14:42:00.000Z	Jan_	tristanmike	no I don't.
2005-09-30T14:43:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	the FAT partition can be read to and written to by both Linux and Windows
2005-09-30T14:45:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	because Microsoft keeps all source code to themselves so it has to be reverse engineered by people like you and me
2005-09-30T14:45:00.000Z	Jan_	tristanmike	Like I keep saying, yes that's why Linux can't read NTFS.
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	no, that's why it can't write
2005-09-30T14:47:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	I believe there is a program that will allow you to access a Linux filesystem, but to what extent I don't know, and where to get it....wait, Chris_Tucker will give you
2005-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jan_	here is a program that will let you copy files from your Linux system to WindowsOS, read more to find out if it suits your needs. http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm
