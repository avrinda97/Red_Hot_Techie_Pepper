2007-01-29T16:12:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	i'm there
2007-01-29T16:12:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	I meant - ask in #fluxbuntu :)
2007-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	Just out of curiosity I found here ( http://fluxbuntu.org/?q=node/3 ) it says that you need to run "sudo ubiquity" to install.
2007-01-30T17:06:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	512MB is more than enough
2007-01-30T17:06:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	what is that swap partition used for anyway ?
2007-01-30T17:07:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	both ext3 and swap should be primary partitions?
2007-01-30T17:07:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	swap = page file. to free up some data that is stored in ram that is not used very often.
2007-01-30T17:07:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	doesn't matter. you can have 4 primary partitions. if you need more partitions than that you need to create an extended partition with logical partitions inside of it.
2007-01-30T17:09:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	problem :P
2007-01-30T17:10:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	I can see that ;) it's a ntfs partition or something?
2007-01-30T17:10:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	yes..
2007-01-30T17:11:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	do you need the data that is on it?
2007-01-30T17:11:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	why :P
2007-01-30T17:12:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	i think i need it
2007-01-30T17:12:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	well, you have an option to delete all partitions, reboot and then run the installer again. or you can try to only run gparted to resize the partition and reboot, then run the installer again to create the other partitions needed. that error is a bit hard to troubleshoot. it's like doing guesswork.
2007-01-30T17:14:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	gparted?
2007-01-30T17:15:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	is that included in my fluxbuntu?
2007-01-30T17:15:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	I have no idea what partitioning tools fluxbuntu come with. in the ubuntu live/desktop cd you run gparted.
2007-01-30T17:15:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	#fluxbuntu should be able to help you there
2007-01-30T17:16:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	yes i'm there
2007-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	Jowi	cameotwat	I need to hit the sack. getting late here. good luck.
2007-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	cameotwat	Jowi	thanks
