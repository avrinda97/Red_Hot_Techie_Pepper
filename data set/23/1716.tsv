2009-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	geekusa		Anyone here proficent with dual booting Win 7 & 9.10?  I've been messing with this for 8 hours today and am still at square one.
2009-11-17T05:19:00.000Z	geekusa		I have installed win 7, then ubuntu 9.10.  But Grub2 is failing to see the win 7 partition and never gives me the option to choose it.
2009-11-17T05:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	you know how to edit the grub menu?
2009-11-17T05:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	have you tried adding the entry in the grub menu manually?
2009-11-17T05:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	are you sure that your Windows7 partition is still good to go?
2009-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	geekusa		Well, i did a clean of install of win 7 & left 80 gigs for Ubuntu.
2009-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	geekusa		I'm in the process of re-installing 9.10.
2009-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	geekusa		I was just reading on how to edit the grub menu.  It appears you hit E when it shows up.
2009-11-17T05:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	and when you installed Ubuntu you made sure that you manually assigned the install and boot partition?
2009-11-17T05:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	well that is a temporary way to edit it .. boot into Ubuntu and edit it for good from within
2009-11-17T05:23:00.000Z	geekusa	zetheroo	 I manually assigned the swap & / partitons.  but I left the rest alone.
2009-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	sounds good - so you could see the Win partition but left it alone - ya?
2009-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	geekusa	zetheroo	 Yes.  9.10 identified it as Win 7 bootloader but did not give the option to install it side by side and let me choose.
2009-11-17T05:25:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	well if the partition is untouched then you should be looking to add the entry manually in the grub menu ....
2009-11-17T05:26:00.000Z	geekusa	zetheroo	 What's the best way of going about that? :)
2009-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	do you know where the grub file is? ....
2009-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	geekusa		btw this is the ultimate irony:  This is on a 20" imac that refuses to run any version of osx.  But it runs win 7 & ubuntu no problem.
2009-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	geekusa	zetheroo	 I believe I read it was in the boot/grub/and it's a img file now?
2009-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	geekusa		the one I looked at earlier said not to edit this file haha.
2009-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	yep .. seems like grub2 is a whole new kit and kaboodle
2009-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	zetheroo	geekusa	looks like this is for you :) https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Adding%20Entries%20to%20Grub%202
2009-11-17T05:32:00.000Z	geekusa	zetheroo	 That's very helpful thank you!
