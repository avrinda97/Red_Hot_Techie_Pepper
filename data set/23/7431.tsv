2005-11-09T12:11:00.000Z	drummer		Having MAJOR problems re-installing VMWare on a re-install of Hoary.  Problems related to gcc.  Can someone help?
2005-11-09T12:13:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	export CC=gcc-3.4
2005-11-09T12:13:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	if you have gcc-3.4 installed
2005-11-09T12:14:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	I tried that - no joy.
2005-11-09T12:14:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	read the rest of the error.  it says your kernel was compiled with one version of gcc and your compiler is this version.  what are the details?
2005-11-09T12:14:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	and yes gcc-3.4 is installed in /usr/bin
2005-11-09T12:15:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	can copy a portion of the error message if you want
2005-11-09T12:15:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	if it's a one-liner, feel free
2005-11-09T12:15:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	else use the pastebin
2005-11-09T12:16:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	it's a little long - Never used the paste bin, how do I?

2005-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	figured out pastebin - the error info is in 4068
2005-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	link?

2005-11-09T12:24:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	"For proper build you'll have to replace gcc with symbolic link to /usr/bin/gcc-3.3"
2005-11-09T12:24:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	translation: ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-3.3 /usr/bin/gcc
2005-11-09T12:24:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	or ln -sf if it already exists
2005-11-09T12:26:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	wow could have sworn that was one of two dozen things I tried about 2AM, but I'll try again.
2005-11-09T12:30:00.000Z	drummer	trappist	 Bless You, thank you, it f***ing worked!!!!!!
2005-11-09T12:30:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	I forgot which problem what yours :)
2005-11-09T12:32:00.000Z	trappist	drummer	oh you were the vmware guy.  you're welcome :)
