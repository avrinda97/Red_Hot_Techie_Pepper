2007-10-05T09:04:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	Be patient :) I'm tying to remember
2007-10-05T09:07:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	I remember now. The file type icons are attached to your theme. Some themes may have different icons for those file types, some may not
2007-10-05T09:08:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	So in other words, there is no direct way to change it - you have to play with the theme
2007-10-05T09:08:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	And if I wat to keep the Human theme, but change icons, that isn't possible?
2007-10-05T09:09:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	It is, but you'll have to modify the theme
2007-10-05T09:09:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	Just found this on goog.. http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-302549.html
2007-10-05T09:11:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	How do I find the folder where my icon theme is installed?
2007-10-05T09:11:00.000Z	user__		!icons
2007-10-05T09:13:00.000Z	Vlet	user__	I don't know. You can figure it out :)
2007-10-05T09:13:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	because ~/.icons is empty
2007-10-05T09:15:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	Or is it /usr/share/icons/Human with me?
2007-10-05T09:16:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	So that I have to create /usr/share/icons/Human/48x48/mimetypes/gnome-mime-application-pdf.png ?
2007-10-05T09:21:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	That doesn't work: I created /usr/share/icons/Human/48x48/mimetypes/gnome-mime-application-pdf.png
2007-10-05T09:22:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	Oh. The instructions say to log out and in. I'll try
2007-10-05T09:23:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	it didn't work
2007-10-05T09:23:00.000Z	user__		The icons are the same
2007-10-05T09:24:00.000Z	user__		is there anything else I can try?
2007-10-05T09:25:00.000Z	user__	Vlet	What did I do wrong?
