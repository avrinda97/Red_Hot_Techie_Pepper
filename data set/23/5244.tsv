2010-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	|604|		but, why did it break the inodeS?..all i did was use rt kernal
2010-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	|604|		could shutting the laptop pwoer off with the power button break inodes?
2010-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	|604|		like hard power off
2010-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 yes.
2010-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 is /tmp on its own partition?
2010-03-03T07:22:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	what are your partitions?
2010-03-03T07:23:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	/ is 10gb, and /home is 200+gb?
2010-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	is / full?
2010-03-03T07:25:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	let me go back and read your posts a sec...
2010-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 i read your ubuntufourms post, if you install a bunch of extra kernel stuff it could possibly go over 10gb...
2010-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 you can try creating a gparted disk, boot to that and adjust your partitions
2010-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php
2010-03-03T07:36:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	/tmp is part of /, so if / is full there's no room to write to /tmp
2010-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	i'd use gparted to decrease /home by 10 or 15gb and add that to /
2010-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 sorry
2010-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	fliptop	|604|	 logfilename.1 - usually a rotated log file, probably done once per week
