2011-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	sss		Can someone help me install Wubi? I need help with partitioning
2011-01-30T17:18:00.000Z	zenithdk_-	sss	what is the problem?
2011-01-30T17:19:00.000Z	sss		zenithdk_, I have Windows XP and I want to dual boot Ubuntu 10.10 to it
2011-01-30T17:19:00.000Z	zenithdk_-	sss	yeah? so run Wubi and have it make a container, no need to reformat
2011-01-30T17:20:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	In the installation I can either erase whole drive (don't want this) or specify partitions manually
2011-01-30T17:20:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		how do I re-add the "presence" applet? it seems to have crashed and have not started again - I need it to logon to my accounts
2011-01-30T17:20:00.000Z	zenithdk_-	sss	have you booted into Windows?
2011-01-30T17:21:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	 I have windows xp already installed and I have used it , and now I want to install Ubuntu using the LiveCD
2011-01-30T17:21:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		so have you booted up on the Live CD into Ubuntu or are you in Windows?
2011-01-30T17:22:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	I am now using Ubuntu through the LiveCD and I want to install it
2011-01-30T17:23:00.000Z	zenithdk_-	sss	I just wanted to know if you were running Ubuntu, or were in Windows, you are in Ubuntu, right
2011-01-30T17:23:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		so for the partitioning, have it create a 40GB partition for Ubuntu
2011-01-30T17:23:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	Right now I am chatting with you using Ubuntu
2011-01-30T17:24:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		so it just needs to resize your existing partition, which version of Ubuntu are you running? I thought newer installers assumed this by themselves
2011-01-30T17:24:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	10.10. I don't have an option to automatically install alongside current OS
2011-01-30T17:25:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		I think if you run Wubi from Windows it should ask you that, to resize your existing partition
2011-01-30T17:25:00.000Z	zenithdk_-	sss	ok, then just shrink your existing partition
2011-01-30T17:25:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	 I am not using Wubi! I am using the LiveCD
2011-01-30T17:26:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		rigth, but you mentioned Wubi at the start :P I think if you boot into Windows Wubi or something like it can be run from Windows to start the install also
2011-01-30T17:26:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		but regardless, can you make out how to configure it to resize the partition?
2011-01-30T17:27:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	I am using already 4 prime partitions, I think, Can I add another partition?
2011-01-30T17:27:00.000Z	zenithdk_-		aaaarh, that is another issue, you can only have 4 primary partitions, you need to make an "extended" partition if I remember correctly
2011-01-30T17:28:00.000Z	sss	zenithdk_-	I heared I need to make an extended partition, but I have no idea how to
