2008-05-03T14:50:00.000Z	abyss_		lo everyone! i have an SATA2 Harddisk but HDPARM says it only makes  170 MB in  3.02 seconds =  56.37 MB/sec! How i can speed up so that my hdd is being use more efficient?
2008-05-03T14:50:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	do you know what motherboard you have?

2008-05-03T14:54:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	is that information enough?
2008-05-03T14:54:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	probably;  I'm not a sata expert, but I want to check something
2008-05-03T14:54:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	k, just say me what to do to check :)
2008-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	but i think 50 mb/s is a bit to low for an sata2 3gb/s connection
2008-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	did you have to boot with any kernel flags (i.e., grub options) at any point?
2008-05-03T14:56:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	not that i know
2008-05-03T14:56:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	oops, my bad;  I know what it is
2008-05-03T14:57:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	3gb/s only helps you if the physical drive can move that much off the platter (i.e., you're only going to get that rate out of the drive cache)
2008-05-03T14:57:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	what rpm is the drive?
2008-05-03T14:57:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	7200 rpm

2008-05-03T14:58:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	one sec, work is calling
2008-05-03T15:00:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	k thanks so its normal in that case and yes they are right cached read are about 938 MB/s
2008-05-03T15:03:00.000Z	abyss_	cwillu	may i ask another question? i run ubuntu 8.04 desktop the sound management seems to be very poor! if i open youtube for exmaple and play a movie then pause it and then i start vlc for example vlc wont make any noise :)
2008-05-03T15:05:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	(sorry about the delay)
2008-05-03T15:06:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	yes, there's an issue with the flash plugin causing firefox crashes if it's routed through pulseaudio
2008-05-03T15:06:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	so that functionality is disabled right now
2008-05-03T15:06:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	you can install libflashsupport, and then remove and reinstall the flashplugin, and that'll make it share the audio device, but you get occasional crashes (although they're more annoying than damaging, due to the session restoring that firefox has)
2008-05-03T15:07:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	btw, hdparm cached will be referring to the kernel cache afaik, not the actual drive cache
2008-05-03T15:07:00.000Z	cwillu	abyss_	doing an uncached speed test for a very small amount, and then doing it again before accessing anything else, should give you more representative numbers
