2008-01-18T06:10:00.000Z	FluxD		so does server install have TWM as its window manager ?
2008-01-18T06:10:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	no X anything
2008-01-18T06:11:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	so what in ubuntu has twm as default wm ?
2008-01-18T06:12:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	no desktops I'm aware of use it as a window manager
2008-01-18T06:13:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	why do you ask?
2008-01-18T06:13:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	apparently my server company installed that on my server =/
2008-01-18T06:13:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	ah, yeah it would be a good light wm to use for vnc I guess
2008-01-18T06:14:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	it is often used for that
2008-01-18T06:14:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	I couldnt get it working under vnc and so I had to download ubuntu-desktop worth 2 gbs :/
2008-01-18T06:32:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	I need some help with this VNC :/
2008-01-18T06:35:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	I haven't done vnc for awhile but ask the channel and see if anyone can help ;)
2008-01-18T06:35:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	I asked many times no one seems to know
2008-01-18T06:36:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	what are you trying to accomplish ultimately? why do you need to vnc to your server?
2008-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	ok basically it has no gui (or it had twm) so I installed ubuntu-desktop pakage then I setup VNC. I just want a server that looks like default desktop install
2008-01-27T09:37:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-01-27T09:37:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	I am on 6.06 server edition logged in using ssh as root so these command will still work right?
2008-01-27T09:38:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	keep in mind you have to upgrade 6.06 to 6.10 to 7.04 to 7.10
2008-01-27T09:40:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	I am on 6.06 server edition logged in using ssh as root so these command will still work right?
2008-01-27T09:41:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	um if you are really logged in as root then you don't use sudo
2008-01-27T09:41:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	ty
2008-01-27T09:52:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	it appears to be gone
2008-01-27T09:52:00.000Z	astro76	FluxD	http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/
2008-01-27T09:52:00.000Z	FluxD	astro76	yes sadly
