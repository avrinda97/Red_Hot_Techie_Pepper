2007-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	you'd have to write a pam handler to do that, i think. simpler might be to modify /etc/fstab and add a user=<foo> option, so that only that user can mount the volume
2007-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	great... could you tell me the format for a user named: xyz
2007-11-27T22:34:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	syntax i mean... also can i specify it by group and not by user?
2007-11-27T22:34:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	under the options column, simply add user=xyz to the list.
2007-11-27T22:35:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	the options column is where "defaults" is right? or nouser or noauto
2007-11-27T22:35:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	yes, group is possible, but i believe the group has to own the device in question
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	do a "man mount" for all the gory details
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	ah yes... i just saw in the man pages
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	yeah... problem is a lot of the contents in the man pages i do not understand outright... :)
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	thanks alot
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	man fstab will give you the syntax of the file as well
2007-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	great
2007-11-27T22:37:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	yeah, man pages take some getting used to, but are well worth the trouble to read. have fun :)
2007-11-27T22:37:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	oh wait... but with adding user=xyz, will the partition automount when xyz logs in, but not when abc does?
2007-11-27T22:38:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	it won't automount...simply allow user xyz to mount, whilst abc cannot
2007-11-27T22:38:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	and then it unmounts when xyz logs out
2007-11-27T22:38:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	oh... i see...
2007-11-27T22:38:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	and it has to be unmounted when i edit fstab?
2007-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	you could write a pam plugin which will do this, but that's some subtle arcanery there
2007-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	not necessarily unmounted. just specify the remount option
2007-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	probably can't do that.. as i don't know what pam is in the first place lol
2007-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	sipior	gvsa123	probably safest just to unmount beforehand though
2007-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	gvsa123	sipior	i see. thanks. i'll try it out first...
