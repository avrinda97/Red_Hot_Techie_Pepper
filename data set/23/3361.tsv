2008-11-14T01:45:00.000Z	gd1		hi I need to install linux-headers-2.6.24-20 but it is no longer available anywhere
2008-11-14T01:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	why should you need headers for a kernel that you don't have installed ?
2008-11-14T01:46:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	because I have it installed
2008-11-14T01:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	sudo apt-get install  linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2008-11-14T01:47:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	package ...yadayada.... has no candidates to install
2008-11-14T01:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	check that you have the standard repositories enabled
2008-11-14T01:48:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	all of them. sources included
2008-11-14T01:51:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	what can I do
2008-11-14T01:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	can't help, i am not using hardy  :\
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	ah, you are using an unsupport configuration, the linux headers package for that version is available on the hardy repos, not on intrepid
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	I would like to use the new kernel but it just does not work
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	it does not boot
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	stuck, frozen
2008-11-14T01:55:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	I would like to file a bug but it's 99% useless. When a kernel is not good for your system, it will never be
2008-11-14T01:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	well, if you file a bug during development it is likely to get some attention and fixed
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	I dunno if it's a bug
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	kernels are not bad for any particular system, on your case it's a regression, since you had a working kernel, so you should have filed a bug
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	I see no errors, just freeze
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	if you can boot with hardy but not with intrepid, it's a bug
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	is there any log I can investigate and post to the dev's
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	otherwise just saying "er, it does not work" is useless for them
2008-11-14T01:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	gd1	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures#Kernel
2008-11-14T01:58:00.000Z	gd1	joaopinto	well, digital photos are ok . I see
