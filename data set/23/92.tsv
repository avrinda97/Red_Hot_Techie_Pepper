2012-07-28T09:54:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	What problem are you having with the sound card?
2012-07-28T09:55:00.000Z	coop	jmrog	well it seems to be playing through the pc speaker and I have connected everything properly
2012-07-28T09:57:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	I must have missed what your problem is. You don't want it playing through the speaker?
2012-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	I don't think the GMA 3000 supports resolutions that high
2012-07-28T10:20:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	WhatWhereAmI: I'm only basing that thought on quick googling, though, and now I'm seeing some mixed results, so it's not clear to me what resolution it supports
2012-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	coop	jmrog	so you feel my pain and now know why I am here
2012-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	Guess so :)
2012-07-28T10:26:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	Do you know the chipset for the card?
2012-07-28T10:27:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	If it's G965 or G963 express then the documentation from Intel says it supports resolutions up to 2048x1536
2012-07-28T10:27:00.000Z	jmrog	coop	www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma3000/gma3000.pdf
