2012-01-17T19:52:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	uh?
2012-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 i guess he means 'from outside'
2012-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	yes... and? Linux systems get "hacked from outside" daily.
2012-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 i guess he means that someone broke into his system and took over
2012-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	yes. and that happens all the time.
2012-01-17T19:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 guess we wean different things, i was talking about security
2012-01-17T19:54:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	so was i!
2012-01-17T19:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 stop please :)
2012-01-18T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	wasn't greek
2012-01-21T19:10:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	who said it stood for super user?
2012-01-22T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	how so?
2012-01-22T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	he was the one reporting the bug.
2012-01-26T01:42:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	don't encourage them :(
2012-01-26T01:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 sorry
2012-01-26T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	yes, it's also, empty.
2012-01-26T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	err, asking whether a given ubuntu driver is the correct one for a given card does belong here.
2012-02-25T22:46:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	why?
2012-04-18T14:30:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	i think he's talking about the output of "diff"
2012-06-11T21:12:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	"sudo -i" isn't a particular no no... it makes sense to use it when you need to run several commands as root. although if you only need one, a single "sudo <command>" will suffice.
2012-06-11T21:13:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	LjL	 yes, but it is not advicable to suggest it to a beginner; or let a beginner pick it up
2012-07-23T13:59:00.000Z	LjL	MonkeyDust	it was a nickname
