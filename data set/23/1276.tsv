2010-05-31T21:59:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	if you seacrh the repo's you'll find those packages,
2010-05-31T21:59:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	keep in mind that xorg is modular so the package names may be slightly different depending on the distro, however the contents are the same
2010-05-31T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	you don't need to
2010-05-31T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	they should be in the repo
2010-05-31T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	you don't need to make it
2010-05-31T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	it's in the ubuntu repos - pre-compiled and waiting for you to use
2010-06-03T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	no, ask your proper question
2010-06-03T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	sorry, that's not going to happen, what ati card do  you have and we'll see if we can help
2010-06-03T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	ok - so first things first, have you tried the driver suggested in the restricted driver manager tool in ubuntu ?
2010-06-03T19:24:00.000Z	toughengineer	ikonia	: i did
2010-06-03T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	is that the one that's currently installed ?
2010-06-03T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	have you checked if your card is supported by that driver ?
2010-06-03T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	toughengineer	ok and the ubuntu version supports that card ?
