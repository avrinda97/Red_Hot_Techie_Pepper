2006-07-12T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel		zomg this thing is password protected
2006-07-12T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel		and oowriter respects that!  i can't make changes?   how do i get around this?
2006-07-12T08:02:00.000Z	wastrel		hi yipe!  this msword doc i need to edit is password locked and oowriter is respecting that for some insane reason
2006-07-12T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel		kinda can't
2006-07-12T08:03:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	Where'd you get the file from?
2006-07-12T08:04:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 it's a job application for the company i'm interviewing with tomorrow.  i need to edit it because oowriter isn't getting the formatting right and it's printing out on waaaay too many pages.
2006-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	Have you tried another text editor like AbiWord?
2006-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 abiword is even worse :] 
2006-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	Ugh, why'd I ask?
2006-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 hmm that gave me an idea tho
2006-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	How about in...*gasp*...Window$?
2006-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	wastrel		i don't have windows :] 
2006-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	What's your idea?
2006-07-12T08:08:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 didn't work - abiword can edit the file but the formatting is so broken i wouldn't be able to fix it.  and saving from abiword just saves the broken formatting
2006-07-12T08:08:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	But did AbiWord break the password off?
2006-07-12T08:10:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 yes
2006-07-12T08:11:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	I know it sounds like a waste of time, but try to save a second copy of the file in abiword and bring it into openoffice to fix it up.
2006-07-12T08:11:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 i'm just going to arrive early and ask them to give me a copy tomorrow :] 
2006-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	Sorry I couldn't help further.
2006-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	wastrel	SKunsai379	 i just can't believe oowriter honors the stupid password :p
2006-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	wastrel		i bet there's a complie flag for that
2006-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	wastrel		or a patch
2006-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	SKunsai379	wastrel	I think that's one of the minor consequences of having M$ Word compatibility.
