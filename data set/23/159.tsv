2012-05-13T01:07:00.000Z	EvilResistance		i might have to yell at the dev team eventually for failing to thoroughly test the LiveCD installation to make sure that doesnt happen
2012-05-13T01:08:00.000Z	EvilResistance		prevent installation?  block website accesses?  etc.
2012-05-13T01:09:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	Which driver?
2012-05-13T01:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	you should be asking which card :p
2012-05-13T01:10:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	standby
2012-05-13T01:10:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	You should be able to download the driver from apt
2012-05-13T01:12:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	So you want the nvidia proprietary blob?
2012-05-13T01:12:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	i'll need the nvidia drivers
2012-05-13T01:15:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current afaik
2012-05-13T01:16:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	i can get into the guest session without incident
2012-05-13T01:16:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	What happens when it glitches?
2012-05-13T01:17:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	black screen, TTY screen, login screen
2012-05-13T01:17:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	how else was i able to talk to you guys on the TTY pre-reboot?
2012-05-13T01:18:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	So to clarify, you cant login to your account in X but can on tty?
2012-05-13T01:19:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	You can log into guest on tty and X, user account on tty but not X
2012-05-13T01:19:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	i dont use guest on CLI.  I can get into my own user via TTY, and into guest via X, but cannot get into user via X
2012-05-13T01:19:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	What WM/DE are you using?
2012-05-13T01:20:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	basic Ubuntu, clean install from the LiveCD (did i not mention earlier its a clean 12.04 installation?  could have sworn i did)
2012-05-13T01:20:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	I walked in halfway through :P
2012-05-13T01:22:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	Try moving all the default X settings files from your home directory
2012-05-13T01:23:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	By memory that's ~/.gnome2, ~/.gconf, ~/.local and ~/.compiz
2012-05-13T01:24:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Luceo	.Xauthority was write-protected, i'm removing that and restarting (but those other files you specified don't exist)
2012-05-13T01:24:00.000Z	Luceo	EvilResistance	Apparently .Xauthority is a common issue, if you remove that should work
