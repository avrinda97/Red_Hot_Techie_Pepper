2009-12-13T22:24:00.000Z	user__		and linux was supposed to be easy ;) whats the issue with HDMI audio=
2009-12-13T22:25:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	is there a white plug there too with the red and yellow?
2009-12-13T22:27:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	can you use the VGA input on your TV?
2009-12-13T22:27:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	there might be
2009-12-13T22:27:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	but its not a 'standard' audio connector
2009-12-13T22:27:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	yes the vga works, but crappy resolution
2009-12-13T22:28:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	exactly, i need at least 720p =)
2009-12-13T22:30:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	VGA won't do 1280X720 on your tv?
2009-12-13T22:30:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	nope
2009-12-13T22:31:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	how about dvi?
2009-12-13T22:33:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	havent thought of that, I do have a dvi-vga swich actually (since the tv only has a vga connector)
2009-12-13T22:34:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	as long as your computer has the analog version of DVI available..
2009-12-13T22:36:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	yeah but most do? anyway it would be so much easier with hdmi, ive recently bought a cable just for this. and now I need to get a long vga and audio cable. (since the computer is built into a 'wall' some meters away
2009-12-13T22:36:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	if you use the vga port in the TV, there are probably audio inputs very close to it to use
2009-12-13T22:37:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	it's only easier with hdmi if your computer's hdmi will do it properly
2009-12-13T22:38:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	i mean, if it can't do what you want how you want, it will be MUCH harder (impossible) to make it do what you want
2009-12-13T22:38:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	well the computer is doing it properly. not ubuntu though. no audio is getting through. and I havent found any way to fix it, not even someone stating they know how to
2009-12-13T22:38:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	are you sure audio is coming out the signal?
2009-12-13T22:39:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	I see. well mthen ill figure out some nice solution.
2009-12-13T22:39:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	i shuold double check that, ill get something that i know can receive hdmi sound properly and test
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	ssh is the client, sshd is the server
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	user__	LizardK|ng	oh so sshd isnt installed with the ssh package?
2009-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	user__	probably not
