2009-10-09T21:45:00.000Z	iceroot	DaveMustaine	dont put the iso directly to the cd, use the option "burn cd image"

2009-10-09T21:56:00.000Z	DaveMustaine	iceroot	why do I have to burn it with less than x12 speed?
2009-10-09T21:57:00.000Z	iceroot	DaveMustaine	because burners are cr*p and cant make good quality at high speed
