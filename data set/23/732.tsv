2011-04-01T20:23:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	i give up. why?
2011-04-01T20:24:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	maybe the error message explains why?
2011-04-01T20:25:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	sorry for the way I put the question, I need someone to help me
2011-04-01T20:26:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	I don't recognize that error. could you paste it at paste.ubuntu.com ?
2011-04-01T20:27:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	include the command you used to try to install the deb.
2011-04-01T20:29:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	i download from the internet... and double click, I use my ubuntu offline not online, and i use my window to download the application, then copy it to my ubuntu to install, didnt use any command in the terminal
2011-04-01T20:29:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	okay. I still don't know that error message. It would be helpful to see it.
2011-04-01T20:30:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	can you answer this, have you installed package offline
2011-04-01T20:30:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	yes, but using the commandline, not doubleclicking it.
2011-04-01T20:31:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	I don't think apt-get would work offline.
2011-04-01T20:31:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	I'd usually use dpkg for offline.
2011-04-01T20:32:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	need to reboot my computer to switch to ubuntu, can you give me a command that i can use
2011-04-01T20:32:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	dpkg -i filename.deb
2011-04-01T20:33:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	you mean the package would already be on my system
2011-04-01T20:33:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	I thought you said you already had the deb on the system?
2011-04-01T20:34:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	on my ubuntu desktop
2011-04-01T20:34:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	okay, you can install that with dpkg as I said.
2011-04-01T20:36:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	have you ever set up openVPN on your system
2011-04-01T20:37:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	yes
2011-04-01T20:38:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	need you to help me in setting you a program called your-freedom, and this package is to browse through the net
2011-04-01T20:39:00.000Z	ayecee	larious	I am quite busy and cannot hold your hand through the process. however, if you have specific questions, I or someone else may be able to answer them here.
2011-04-01T22:12:00.000Z	larious	ayecee	are you there
