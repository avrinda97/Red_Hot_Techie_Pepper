2011-11-18T06:12:00.000Z	_calum		if I ran dd if=/dev/sda of=/UbuntuBackup.img, where will the drive image be saved by default?
2011-11-18T06:12:00.000Z	_calum		sorry *sda3
2011-11-18T06:12:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	in your root directory
2011-11-18T06:13:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	that's what the / is
2011-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	one thing to note, make sure /dev/sda3 is unmounted when you do that, otherwise your image may end up broken
2011-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	(or mounted read-only)
2011-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	dd isn't smart enough to understand what to do if the filesytem changes; it's literally just copying bits. you can check if it's mounted readonly by running: mount | grep /dev/sda3
2011-11-18T06:16:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	no, you need to use sudo because you're accessing what's called a block device (which is what /dev/sda3 is)
2011-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	look at the end of the line, you'll see something like (rw) or (ro), possibly with some other options
2011-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	not exactly; /dev/sda3 refers to the actual partition itself, not the filesystem on it
2011-11-18T06:20:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	potentially. it depends on if there's been activity on that filesystem while you've been backing it up; for safety's sake, i would say yes, it's probably not a good backup, and you should cancel it
2011-11-18T06:21:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	yep, or remount it read-only. where is that partition currently mounted?
2011-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	run it again, and paste the line here? mount | grep /dev/sda3
2011-11-18T06:26:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	ack. unfortunately, you can't unmount that partition, because it's your root partition -- it's where your OS currently lives :) so you also can't run a backup to / because then it'd be backing it up to itself
2011-11-18T06:27:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	nono, you should be fine, so long as you only ran the dd command you wrote earlier
2011-11-18T06:27:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	so far, you've only created a broken filesystem image; delete that, and it's like nothing ever happened
2011-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	should be. it's possible you've filled up the disk, though, but that's recoverable.
2011-11-18T06:32:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	yep -- just be very careful in what you type, and double-check it, since you're sudo rm'ing from the root directory. i'd recommend: sudo rm -i /UbuntuBackup.img
2011-11-18T06:32:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	the -i will prompt you for a y/n answer before removing anything, so make sure it's what you want before you hit 'y'
2011-11-18T06:33:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	once you've done that, you can check how much space is on the drive with: df -h | grep /dev/sda3
2011-11-18T06:34:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	then you should be back to normal :)
2011-11-18T06:35:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	sure thing. if you want to try it again, you'll have to boot from a livecd, and back it up to another drive (i.e., an external drive). also:
2011-11-18T06:39:00.000Z	brjannc	_calum	good deal :)
