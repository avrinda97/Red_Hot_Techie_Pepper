2009-02-06T18:30:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		I'm a fast learning newbie. I pick up stuff fast, but I usually miss some things (probably because of short attention span ;)
2009-02-06T18:31:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		And sometimes I never get that far into learning about something.
2009-02-06T18:32:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		viperborg: huh?
2009-02-06T18:33:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		This is starting to get really confusing
2009-02-06T18:35:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	Sorry, had a forced reboot. The idea is to select the correct repository for KDE 4.2 and then just download the package(s), not install them.
2009-02-06T18:36:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	There are some apt- tools that might help, possibly on the system you're intending to install KDE4.2 to.
2009-02-06T18:37:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	to use on a win2000 pc?
2009-02-06T18:37:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	 No, to use with your Live Disk.
2009-02-06T18:38:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	the idea is to avoid LiveCDs in school
2009-02-06T18:39:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	Either you have a Linux setup available, or you're likely to struggle downloading packages via apt-get
2009-02-06T18:40:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	apt-get on windows ! ?
2009-02-06T18:40:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	No! Afaik, you can't do apt-get on windows. If it's feasible, cygwin *might* do it, but I'm not convinced.
2009-02-06T18:41:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	I want to avoid BOTH LiveCDs and Cygwin in school
2009-02-06T18:41:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	 If you have install privs, then VirtualBox might be a good idea.
2009-02-06T18:42:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	Otherwise, just forget it :)
2009-02-06T18:42:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	Forgetting about it is not an option either ;)
2009-02-06T18:42:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	You might as well be asking how to run WindowsUpdate in Ubuntu..
2009-02-06T18:43:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	:D
2009-02-06T18:43:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	Why not? ;)
2009-02-06T18:44:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	Alternatively, why not download KDE4.2 source from svn/wherever and compile yourself.. another option.
2009-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	blizzle_	Where's the svn?
2009-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	Now you're getting lazy! Google, my friend.
2009-02-06T18:51:00.000Z	blizzle_	Jonathan_L	 That's shorthand for "ignore him"
