2011-03-16T14:56:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	they're not supposed to be all the way up at the panel..
2011-03-16T14:56:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	what do you mean one place too low?
2011-03-16T14:56:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	the sound bubble comes right under the top panel, but something else like an internet connection comes under that bubble, now you might be thinking "well duh, because the sound bubble is on top of it", but it's not
2011-03-16T14:57:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	it's the way it's supposed to be
2011-03-16T14:57:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	why is it supposed to be that way?
2011-03-16T14:58:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	i have no idea, but it is
2011-03-16T14:58:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	shouldn't a bubble always be right under the top panel? and where there are multiple bubbles, then put them under each other?
2011-03-16T14:59:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	I used to be annoyed with it as well.. have gotten used to the fact that it's the way it is
2011-03-16T15:00:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	so I'm not the only one apparently, however my friend has it the way "it's supposed to be", and he didn't customize anything
2011-03-16T15:00:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	they don't even stack anymore.. getting multiple notifications will just queue them
2011-03-16T15:00:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	which version is he running?
2011-03-16T15:00:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	is there some sort of specification online?
2011-03-16T15:01:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	he's using 10.10 with all the latest updates, just like me
2011-03-16T15:01:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	that's weird.. i'm pretty sure the way i have it is the standard.. i could be wrong
2011-03-16T15:02:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	I'm starting to think he's wrong since we both haven't customized it and have it the "wrong way"
2011-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	there was a design document somewhere.. can't find it
2011-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	k, I'll google around a bit
2011-03-16T15:07:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	just to be clear: you get this same behavior right? http://i.imgur.com/QJx1C.png
2011-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	correct
2011-03-16T15:12:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	it is supposed to be the way we have it :D https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD and http://askubuntu.com/questions/3326/why-are-notifications-so-low
2011-03-16T15:15:00.000Z	stianhj	bubblegummybear	yeah.. that's the page i was looking for..
2011-03-16T15:15:00.000Z	bubblegummybear	stianhj	so no worries, it's perfect the way it is :)
