2007-11-27T10:16:00.000Z	NIMBY		how can I enable the swap disk feature now ?
2007-11-27T10:17:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	you made a swap partition when installing ubuntu?
2007-11-27T10:17:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	I have just used gparted to move my original install to another drive and I made and 8gb linuxswap on the end of it
2007-11-27T10:18:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	whoa.. an 8GB swap!! well you'll have to issue the following command to enable it this session: sudo mkswap -v1 /dev/<device> && sudo swapon /dev/<device>
2007-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	you may have to edit your /etc/fstab enable that at boot time
2007-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	I have 4gb of ram, I have no idea what it would normally be :)
2007-11-27T10:21:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	with that much RAM at your disposle I don't think you'll ever need a swap partition under normal usage. but an equal swap should do equally well. 8GB IMHO is an overkill
2007-11-27T10:22:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	Im very new to linux and am used to windows needed huge amounts of virtual memory space
2007-11-27T10:23:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	I guess you were Windows Vista or probably XP that grew a tad old.
2007-11-27T10:24:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	 I have used various flavours of ms for years but vista has made me want to change, it is such utter crap
2007-11-27T10:24:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	want to know more crap? google for "Windows Vista - A Cost Analysis". Nice document..
2007-11-27T10:24:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	I have the fastest computer I ever had with the most ram and fastest drives and yet with vista it was slower than xp
2007-11-27T10:25:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	welcome to ubuntu XD
2007-11-27T10:25:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	and linux
2007-11-27T10:25:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	$400 for vista ultimate, and then we do the debugging for ms for nothing :-(
2007-11-27T10:26:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	vista networking was the thing that broke the camels back for me
2007-11-27T10:26:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	was quicker to burn data to dvd and run downstairs than transfer it
2007-11-27T10:27:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	I guess you left vista for good now. try not to think about it... eases the pain.
2007-11-27T10:28:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	I will have to have dual boot for awhile, Bioshock wont work on linux I believe but I am going to have xp insted of vista
2007-11-27T10:29:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	and if I can get WoW to work here I should be on here 90% of the time anyway
2007-11-27T10:29:00.000Z	_nix_	NIMBY	what's WoW??
2007-11-27T10:33:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	I refuse to pay $5 extra just to play a few games, I have already purchased xp so will suffer dual boot until I no longer need to , but thanks for the info :)
2007-11-27T10:33:00.000Z	NIMBY	_nix_	$ per month *
