2006-12-15T15:41:00.000Z	wy		Is there a way to remove grub from the disk from Windows XP. I've tried many ways but none works
2006-12-15T15:42:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	in dos, "fdisk /MBR", in *nix, "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=1"
2006-12-15T15:43:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	Thanks! I can't book into dos. So are you sure the second command line is accurate?
2006-12-15T15:44:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	give me a minute to double check the second one
2006-12-15T15:44:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	Thanks.
2006-12-15T15:44:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	is there anything on the disk you need to keep, or are you just wiping it out to prepare for a complete re-install?
2006-12-15T15:44:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	I don't want to break the system. That's my wife's computer now
2006-12-15T15:45:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	then don't type the dd command line I gave you!
2006-12-15T15:45:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	what's on the box now? it's just winders xp and nothing else?
2006-12-15T15:46:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	Just windows XP
2006-12-15T15:46:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	I wonder if there is a program can do this just inside windows XP.
2006-12-15T15:47:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	with no access to dos, I think you need to play with the xp recovery console... that's something I really don't know much about....
2006-12-15T15:47:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	Press F8 when it starts?
2006-12-15T15:47:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	scratching my head here.... it's a bit over the top, but a re-install of XP, telling it to "repair" would definitely do it.
2006-12-15T15:48:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	yes... but after that, I don't know what to do. Googling for ideas here....
2006-12-15T15:49:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	do you have an XP install CD?
2006-12-15T15:50:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	your answer is here (boot into recovery console from install CD, use 'fixmbr' command) http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/483/xp_repair_fix_master_boot_record_recovery_console
2006-12-15T15:52:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	Can I boot into recovery console from the harddisk?
2006-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	I don't think so, but not 100% sure... press f8 at boot time and see what options it gives you. I think you need an install cd though
2006-12-15T16:00:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	I get into the command from the install CD. Is fixmbr and fixboot the same?
2006-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	I don't know dude... I'm really no expert on 'fixing' xp.... I usually just use fdisk/format to fix problems! :-)
2006-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	wy	sonicGB	fixmbr works. Thank you!
2006-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	sonicGB	wy	u welcome... glad you're sorted! :-)
