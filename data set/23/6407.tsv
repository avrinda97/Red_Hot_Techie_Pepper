2006-05-17T10:09:00.000Z	scifi		yo guys, do u think it wud ever be possible to switch directly from ubuntu to windows and back without having to restart ?
2006-05-17T10:10:00.000Z	scifi		thats a no then lol
2006-05-17T10:10:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	with Xen maybe...but right now Windows doesn't run on Xen
2006-05-17T10:10:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	whats Xen ?
2006-05-17T10:11:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	so its already possible with xen and linux distros ?
2006-05-17T10:11:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	yah
2006-05-17T10:11:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	Xen isn't another OS
2006-05-17T10:12:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	yeh i meant USING xen along with linux
2006-05-17T10:12:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	you use a patched Linux Kernel(s) and a piece of software known as the Hypervisor
2006-05-17T10:13:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	maybe virtualisation will become part of linux distros by default
2006-05-17T10:14:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	maybe
2006-05-17T10:15:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	yes
2006-05-17T10:17:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	not sure how vmware works, i have to "install" my ubuntu onto XP? or wud i be able to use vmware to "link" my seperate xp & ubuntu installations that i have now ?
2006-05-17T10:17:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	no, that wouldn't work
2006-05-17T10:18:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	I heard Qemu can do something like that (load an OS on another partition into the Emulator session) but I dunno about VMWare
2006-05-17T10:18:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	what are you trying to do exactly?
2006-05-17T10:19:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	switch from ubuntu to xp without rebooting
2006-05-17T10:20:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	IIRC you can't do that ATM
2006-05-17T10:24:00.000Z	scifi	Kyral	why would i want to do that?? because CS runs perfectly on XP and it means everytime i want to play a game i have to log out of ubuntu and reboot into xp. Yes ive tried wine, dont want to bother with cedega
2006-05-17T10:24:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	I can guarentee you CS won't work fine under the strain of two OSs
2006-05-17T10:26:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	It might work, if your computer is powerful enough
2006-05-17T10:28:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	you'd need two computers :P
2006-05-17T10:29:00.000Z	Kyral	scifi	a KVM just allows you to switch one keyboard, mouse, and monitor between two computers
