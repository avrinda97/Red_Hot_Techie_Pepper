2006-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	spikeb	waldo	yes, you can give the second user sudo privs, then THAT users password is the sudo password, for them
2006-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	spikeb	waldo	correct
2006-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	waldo	spikeb	cool thankye
2006-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	spikeb	waldo	just make ABSOLUTELY SURE that sudo is working for the new user before you delete your old account\
