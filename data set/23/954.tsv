2010-11-08T05:55:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx		Ok, I accidentally disconnected my Windows Server box from the internet.  I can boot into a Linux "RESCUE SYSTEM" and access the Windows server...is there any way I can fix it?
2010-11-08T05:55:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	does your server have a remote kvm?
2010-11-08T05:58:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	if you have a remote kvm then you should be able to sort the nic out not sure from a live cd
2010-11-08T05:59:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	I'm looking for it now on my host's website.  I might just have to copy my data on my hard drives to my website and format the box.  How can I navigate to my hard drive in the terminal?
2010-11-08T06:00:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	whos your host?

2010-11-08T06:01:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	if its a dedi they should have a remote kvm an eric drac or similiar
2010-11-08T06:01:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	ouch
2010-11-08T06:01:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	are they managed servers or un managed?
2010-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	for a one off the engineer service would be cheaper that setup fe is ridiculus
2010-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	I agree
2010-11-08T06:04:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	can you run an ipconfig /renew from the live cd
2010-11-08T06:04:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	what do you mean? in the Windows command line? I can't get into that, I believe I'm in a Debian-based rescue system
2010-11-08T06:05:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	yeah can you execute or run anything windows side?
2010-11-08T06:05:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	Don't believe so...at this point, I think I should just format. I just need my stuff off of there now
2010-11-08T06:06:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	you got backups?
2010-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	Nope, I activated my freaking backup account, but the login wouldn't work
2010-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	Id contact your host see what they offer were I used to work we offered unmanaged boxes but in certain circumstances we would fix for free
2010-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	Thanks, will do
2010-11-08T06:13:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	although we also included remote kvm with our servers
2010-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	sftp
2010-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	xFROzENFUSiONx	r007	Thanks :)
2010-11-08T06:48:00.000Z	r007	xFROzENFUSiONx	that should work I usually use root for sftp though and ubuntu doesent have default root unless you set it
