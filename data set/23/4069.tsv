2007-11-21T09:54:00.000Z	multiverse		I just wanted to tell everyone that the 64 bit version of 7.10 is much better then the earlier distros.
2007-11-21T09:55:00.000Z	multiverse		Well, when I installed the earlier version nothing worked.  But now it works much better.  Specifically, you get BIGMEM, so you get all 4 GB
2007-11-21T09:55:00.000Z	multiverse		Thanks for the advice Evanlec
2007-11-21T09:55:00.000Z	multiverse		You guys were right.
2007-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	multiverse		That's what I mena.
2007-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	multiverse		mean
2007-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	multiverse		I got all four of my 4 GB, and the system is moving along nicley.
2007-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	multiverse		I was concerned that the video drivers wouldn't work.
2007-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	V1k1ng	multiverse	any drawbacks?
2007-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	multiverse	vocx	he kind of jumped me yesterday, but I decided to follow his advice yesterday and I'm glad that I did.
2007-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	multiverse		So far none.
2007-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	multiverse		I just finished the install.
2007-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	multiverse		I'm on a Lenovo R61, and the drivers situation is iffy at best.
2007-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	multiverse		I am going to go off the deep end configuring it this week and weekend.
2007-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	multiverse		I plan to hang around this channel when I'm working on it so I can help others 64 bit it.
2007-11-21T09:59:00.000Z	V1k1ng	multiverse	 i switched to 32 bit, for some reason it works with my broadcom card better
2007-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	multiverse		V1k:  I have yet to get my wireless to work.
2007-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	multiverse		I'm using a cable!
2007-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	multiverse		So old fashioned.
2007-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	V1k1ng	multiverse	  yeah, for some reason it worked in 7.04 64 bit, but not 7.10
2007-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	multiverse		I had trouble with 7.04 64 bit:  the video drivers were absent.
2007-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	multiverse		Main reason for the 4 GB of ram is for VMware experimentation.
2007-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	V1k1ng	multiverse	  never had a problem with that
