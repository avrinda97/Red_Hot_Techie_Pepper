2006-09-20T07:03:00.000Z	CrippsFX		what's the latest kernel in the ubuntu repos?
2006-09-20T07:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	have you done an apt-get upgrade lately? there's a new one, and whatever that one is, is it
2006-09-20T07:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	and you can find out what that is with uname -r
2006-09-20T07:05:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	care to give me a version number? I have 2.6.15-26-386, but according to the ubuntu wiki, I *should* be able to get 2.6.17-x ...
2006-09-20T07:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	could you give the wiki page you're looking at, please?
2006-09-20T07:07:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Dapper hm ... I see ... may be an issue of me misunderstanding what it says.
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	so you're trying to get wireless set up? is that the issue?
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	set up, no .... working, yes.
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	aha. and you've got a bcm-whatever driver?
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	yep.
2006-09-20T07:10:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	basically goes words to the effect of: I jhave native broadcom installed (properly), I'm sitting on top of my AP, and when I do "iwlist eth1 scan" I get no results.
2006-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	to be honest, my advice to you is to use ndiswrapper, as i for one have found it to be more stable and reliable than the kernel driver.
2006-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	you're running a broadcom card too?
2006-09-20T07:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	yup!
2006-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	kk. IIRC I also had some troubles using NDIS wrapper as well ... but I'll give it another shot.
2006-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	oh, that's too bad...i hope you get everything up and running!
2006-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	you have no idea ;)
2006-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	it's always frustrating trying to get stuff to work in the first place
2006-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	yeah ... the worst is when it *does* work, and then stops and you can't figure out why :/
2006-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	oh no!
2006-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	yep ... that's been my experience with my bcm card since I upgraded from FC4 .... it didn't work in FC5, and then worked in dapper, but sporradically breaks ...
2006-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	CrippsFX	hmmmm...that's really lame. good luck
2006-09-20T07:18:00.000Z	CrippsFX	ladydoor	thanks.
