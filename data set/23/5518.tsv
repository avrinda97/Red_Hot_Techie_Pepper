2007-06-23T05:51:00.000Z	shwouchk		I have a problem lately getting updates from several repositories such as ftp://ftp.berlios.de unstable/non-free. What could cause that?
2007-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	they are not ubuntu repos so you would need to talk to the people that run them
2007-06-23T05:56:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	is there a list of standard+community ubuntu reps?
2007-06-23T05:57:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	and is there a tool to autoupdate my list?
2007-06-23T05:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	apt-get update
2007-06-23T05:57:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	do you actually read the question? I want to update the list of repositories
2007-06-23T05:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	to update the repos sudo apt-get update. what do you mean by update?
2007-06-23T05:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	thats old and not kept up
2007-06-23T05:59:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	what is old and not kept up?
2007-06-23T05:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	easy source
2007-06-23T06:00:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	ok then where do I get an updated list? again, apt-get update updates the list of packages, not of the list of repositories
2007-06-23T06:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2007-06-23T06:01:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	7.04
2007-06-23T06:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	the repos have updated packages in them what do you mean updated list?
2007-06-23T06:01:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	geez
2007-06-23T06:02:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	for instance the non-free rep I had stopped working... new repositories are created by people... maybe some repositories have updated adresses. I want an updated list of available repositories. NOT PACKAGES.
2007-06-23T06:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	define updated repos list please. if you mean unofficial repos you need to find them else where/ if you mean ubuntu repos than the ones in your list if all are uncommented you have latest
2007-06-23T06:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	they most likely use the same ones
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	you want the newer version of unofficial repos see the opwners of the repos
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	we do not support unofficial repos
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	there is no page for unofficial repositories?
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	shwouchk	gnomefreak	geez
2007-06-23T06:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shwouchk	not one that is kept up anymore
