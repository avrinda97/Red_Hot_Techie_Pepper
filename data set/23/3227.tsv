2008-09-05T12:53:00.000Z	m0u5e		anyone know how to use subtract in formulas for openspreadsheet?
2008-09-05T12:53:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	sorry what?
2008-09-05T12:53:00.000Z	m0u5e		its really frustrating... i believe in excel the command is just =SUB... but SUB does not exist in ooo spread
2008-09-05T12:54:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	how do i subract :/
2008-09-05T12:54:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	yes it doesn't exist, just make the numbers negative and use SUM
2008-09-05T12:55:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	thats stupid :X
2008-09-05T12:55:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	that completely defeats the purpose of using sub
2008-09-05T12:55:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	no its quite logical, as i can't see what logic subtract would use in regards to referencing
2008-09-05T12:56:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	you could always write your own function if need be and name it SUB
2008-09-05T12:56:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	no because for example i have a spreadsheet of numbers, and i want to find the difference between the two
2008-09-05T12:56:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	i dont want to change my original value, i need the program to subtract the two to see if my difference is positive or negative
2008-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	so you have just 2 numbers? or a list of numbers?
2008-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	it was just an example, but i have a list of numbers
2008-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	use A - B ?
2008-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	and i have other formulas depending on those #s so i cannot change them
2008-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	m0u5e		oh lol?
2008-09-05T12:58:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	not sure what the structure of the sheet is, could you show a sample
2008-09-05T12:58:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	i just want to subtract a list of numbers (sorry if im confusing you)
2008-09-05T12:59:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	subtract them from what, and is it possible to see a sample file i could try help more after i look at the structure of the sheet (you can change labels and values)
2008-09-05T13:00:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	okay so lets say i have value which is stored in A1, i want A1 to be subtracted by B1:F1
2008-09-05T13:00:00.000Z	m0u5e	rampageoberon	err okay let me pastebin lol
2008-09-05T13:01:00.000Z	m0u5e		!paste|m0u5e
2008-09-05T13:06:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m0u5e	done the paste?
