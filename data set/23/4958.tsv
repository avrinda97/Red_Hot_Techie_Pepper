2007-11-27T22:21:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	it's in apache.conf instead
2008-07-17T02:29:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	chown
2008-07-17T02:30:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	then /media/disk is the mountpoint
2009-01-16T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	it probably ends up in the root users trash
2009-01-16T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	take a look in /root/.local or something like that
2009-01-16T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	so /root/local/share/Trash
2009-01-16T17:23:00.000Z	Ximal	Slart	is there a command to EMPTY all trash bins on the system ?
2009-01-16T17:23:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	not that I know of.. there is a command line trash application you could use with sudo though
2009-01-16T17:24:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	you're welcome
2009-01-16T17:37:00.000Z	Ximal	Slart	hey m8... I can't find the dern command for trash-cli ... I mean rather ... trash-cli brings up the no command found response ...
2009-01-16T17:37:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	there are lots of commands.. "trash-cli" is just a package, not a command.. try empty-trash
2009-01-16T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	there's also list-trash, restore-trash, trash
2009-01-16T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	Ximal	man trash or man empty-trash
