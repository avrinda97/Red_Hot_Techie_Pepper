2008-11-30T12:59:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	no, it's gOS >.>
2008-11-30T13:31:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	do you have the ability to edit ubottu factoids? if so... the opera one mentions dapper :S
2008-11-30T13:32:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	its supported for a while yet still
2008-11-30T13:32:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	yeah, but most people reading that factoid won't be using it :P
2009-01-21T14:59:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	I think he meant "any"
2010-01-13T17:03:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	That looks suspiciously similar to the last time I failed to /ignore joins and parts in here.
2010-02-04T09:39:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	thanks
2010-06-04T15:07:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	#backtrack-linux has *@*root*!* banned
2010-06-04T15:07:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	he is simply not paying attention
2010-06-04T15:07:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	I would imagine he'd be more amenable to asking in #backtrack-linux if he could get in #backtrack-linux. Just a thought.
2010-06-04T15:08:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	(not that this excuses him screwing around in here instead)
2010-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	its english
2010-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	not on my screen :(
2010-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	and Google thinks it's chinese :(
2010-08-13T11:47:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	will be glad to debate you in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
2010-10-07T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	had to install it here
2010-10-07T10:17:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	hrm. maybe I'm thinking of 10.10. iono.
2010-10-08T04:19:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	whoa, deja vu
2010-10-08T04:20:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	indeedy
2011-01-04T13:25:00.000Z	rww	bazhang	? is shorthand for "question", I guess >.>
2011-01-15T14:27:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	no they recommend a PPA
2011-01-16T09:11:00.000Z	bazhang	rww	he quit
