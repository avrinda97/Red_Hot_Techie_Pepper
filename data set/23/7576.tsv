2005-06-26T07:39:00.000Z	Addius		meh, I'm still getting operation not permitted when trying to run 'modprobe ndiswrapper'.. would it make any sense if root didn't have access to /lib/modules/?
2005-06-26T07:40:00.000Z	liable	Addius	root has access to everything
2005-06-26T07:41:00.000Z	Addius	liable	That's what I thought too.. In other words there's something else wrong and I'm just bad at interprating the Error-message
2005-06-26T07:42:00.000Z	liable	Addius	wheres the drivers stored for ndiswrapper?
2005-06-26T07:42:00.000Z	Addius	liable	you mean the one I'm trying to get working? I don't know actually, any way to check?
2005-06-26T07:43:00.000Z	liable	Addius	erm, no, I dont know, didnt you copy the driver to somewhere?
2005-06-26T07:43:00.000Z	Addius	liable	you mean the windows-driver?
2005-06-26T07:44:00.000Z	liable	Addius	yes
2005-06-26T07:44:00.000Z	Addius	liable	ah, I just put it in /lib/, didn't know of any better place to put it
2005-06-26T07:45:00.000Z	liable	Addius	did you follow some sort of howto?
2005-06-26T07:46:00.000Z	Addius	liable	yeah, "HowToSetUpNdiswrapper" from the ubuntu-wiki
2005-06-26T07:47:00.000Z	liable	Addius	well, if its in the right spot, go over it all again, and double check.
2005-06-26T07:50:00.000Z	Addius	liable	no, I'm still getting the same error =/
2005-06-26T07:51:00.000Z	Addius	liable	now ndiswrapper is claiming that the driver is invalid though, so I'm guessing this is pretty much as far as I can go if it doesn't work with the windows-driver
2005-06-26T07:53:00.000Z	Addius	liable	anyways, thanks for the help
2005-06-26T07:56:00.000Z	liable	Addius	got the right file? for the driver, theres two, and one doesnt work
2005-06-26T07:57:00.000Z	Addius	liable	the right file? I'm supposed to use the windowsdriver from the manufacturor ain't I?
2005-06-26T07:58:00.000Z	liable	Addius	yes but there is two files generally I think. I havent actualyy used ndiwrapper, but read there is generally two files.
2005-06-26T07:59:00.000Z	Addius	liable	okay, no I was supplied with only one .inf file
2005-06-26T08:00:00.000Z	liable	Addius	ok, if my memory serves me right, thats the right one.
2005-06-26T08:01:00.000Z	Addius	liable	is there any chance that perhaps an older driver might work better?
2005-06-26T08:02:00.000Z	liable	Addius	sorry dude, absolutely no idea.
2005-06-26T08:03:00.000Z	Addius	liable	aff, then I'll have to go back to getting the 'native' driver working. Thanks for the help though!
