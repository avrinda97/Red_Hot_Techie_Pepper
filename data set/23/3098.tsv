2011-06-25T05:03:00.000Z	tanath		i'm looking to build a computer with the Radeon HD 6850, but i'm not sure how good ubuntu's support is. anyone have relevant info?
2011-06-25T05:04:00.000Z	tanath		i'd rather go with AMD
2011-06-25T05:05:00.000Z	szal	tanath	then don't come complaining about crappy performance ;)
2011-06-25T05:05:00.000Z	tanath	szal	oh, if the performance is crappy due to ubuntu's support, i most certainly would complain
2011-06-25T05:05:00.000Z	szal	tanath	no, the performance is crappy due to AMD delivering crappy drivers
2012-03-17T11:24:00.000Z	szal	tanath	what's the difference between commercial and SOHO printers?
2012-03-17T11:24:00.000Z	tanath	szal	about 4 feet?
2012-03-17T11:25:00.000Z	szal	tanath	huh? care to explain?
2012-03-17T11:25:00.000Z	tanath	szal	the one in the vid is about 4 feet taller than a home printer
2012-03-17T11:26:00.000Z	szal	tanath	nothing prevents you from buying a HP Color LaserJet 8000 series for home use.. except your budget perhaps :P
2012-03-17T11:27:00.000Z	tanath	szal	what i'm getting at is what about home printers?
2012-03-17T11:27:00.000Z	szal	tanath	well, what about them?
2012-03-17T11:28:00.000Z	tanath	szal	did you see the vid or catch any of the conversation? talking about resetting the printer chips so they can be refilled (yay antifeatures)
2012-03-17T11:29:00.000Z	tanath	szal	vid shows a likely expensive solution that may be good in a commercial setting, but what about home or small business users?
2012-03-17T11:29:00.000Z	szal	tanath	pretty futile to do so, you're breathing toxic dust if you do.. better have that done by a company that specializes in that, or buy refill cartridges
2012-03-17T11:30:00.000Z	tanath	szal	what are you talking about? no toxic dust when i refilled mine...
2012-03-17T11:31:00.000Z	tanath	szal	the point is they're pulling shenanigans to force people to unnecessarily buy replacements when we could refill them ourselves. did you know printer ink is more expensive than oil or human blood?
2012-03-17T11:31:00.000Z	tanath	szal	that should be user choice though. chip prevents that
2012-03-17T11:34:00.000Z	tanath	szal	same here, but i'd rather do it free. i just don't know about dealing with the chips... yet
2012-03-17T11:34:00.000Z	szal	tanath	well, you still pay for the ink or toner
2012-03-17T11:34:00.000Z	tanath	szal	nope. got it free
2012-03-17T11:34:00.000Z	szal	tanath	then you're just lucky
2012-03-17T11:35:00.000Z	tanath	szal	true, but it's going to waste because printer companies are asshats
