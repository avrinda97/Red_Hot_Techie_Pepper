2006-08-24T14:28:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	what's the problem with twinview?
2006-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: it won't work..  when I configure it according to specs it moves everything to my secondary monitor (on the left), but disables my primary monitor...  no dual displays
2006-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	can you put your xorg.conf on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/?
2006-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	atm0sph		yeah one sec smeggy
2006-08-24T14:31:00.000Z	atm0sph	Smeggy	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21529
2006-08-24T14:31:00.000Z	atm0sph		I have it commented out right now so I can use my primary monitor ..  it's a 17inch..  without those commented lines under the screen section everything moves over to my 15 inch which is to the left
2006-08-24T14:34:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: any ideas?
2006-08-24T14:34:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	try moving the twinview options into the device section and adding Option "NVreg_SoftEDID" "true"
2006-08-24T14:35:00.000Z	atm0sph		all the twinview options
2006-08-24T14:35:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: as in everything that's commented out?
2006-08-24T14:35:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	yes.
2006-08-24T14:37:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21530
2006-08-24T14:37:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	yes.
2006-08-24T14:38:00.000Z	atm0sph		brb
2006-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: so no go ..  hmm..
2006-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	did it do anything different?
2006-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	atm0sph		everything went back to the left monitor
2006-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	Smeggy		hmm
2006-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	atm0sph		then my right monitor just went into standbye
2006-08-24T14:40:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	trying giving it the actaul modes for the second monitor instead of relying on the display id data?
2006-08-24T14:40:00.000Z	atm0sph		smeggy: the refresh you mean?
2006-08-24T14:40:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	that would also mean removing the 'useedidfreqs' option.
2006-08-24T14:40:00.000Z	Smeggy	atm0sph	yes the refresh rates.
