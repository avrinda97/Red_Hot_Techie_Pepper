2005-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	BurgerMann		Can someone help me with users, groups and file permissions? I know the elementrary but certain things makes me lost.
2005-10-06T10:21:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	have a specific question/
2005-10-06T10:23:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	It seems it doesn't know that I'm in the group that owns the dir.
2005-10-06T10:23:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	what did you change your group to?
2005-10-06T10:24:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	did you change the group ownership of the directory?
2005-10-06T10:24:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	yep.
2005-10-06T10:25:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	I checked both /etc/passwd and /etc/group. everything seems okay
2005-10-06T10:27:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	you doing ls -l ?
2005-10-06T10:29:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	what's the ls-l ouput line for that dir?
2005-10-06T10:30:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	arh.. nm I lost the connex to the server now :s
2005-10-06T10:31:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	then what was the command you used to chown the dir?
2005-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	still there?
2005-10-06T10:40:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	did you figure out what the problem was?
2005-10-06T10:50:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	nah. I've seen it before but then it somehow got to work. I never figured how.. I just tried to reboot the server but now I've got a few problems getting it online again :s
2005-10-06T10:51:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	hmmm, I see. anyhow, I strongly suspect that the group of the dir does not match your user's group (web-admin)
2005-10-06T10:51:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	hmn. Must be something like that.
2005-10-06T10:52:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	now it works, after rebooting
2005-10-06T10:53:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	interesting. oh, did you logout after chgrp'ing?
2005-10-06T10:53:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	No i didn't :)
2005-10-06T10:53:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	that's why, then
2005-10-06T10:54:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	here's the next question, can you still sudo with that user?
2005-10-06T10:55:00.000Z	BurgerMann	P229	yes, sure.
2005-10-06T10:57:00.000Z	P229	BurgerMann	ok
