2009-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	Nightblaze		okay, do I need to ask my question a fourth time or is everyone here clueless? =/
2009-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	what is your question? (problably im clueless as well)
2009-11-08T07:44:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/sound probably this removed your hardware drivers for sound hehe.. so it did what was supposed to do
2009-11-08T07:45:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	did you restore them?
2009-11-08T07:45:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	i did all of what the guide said, so i'm not sure, lemme try the last part again
2009-11-08T07:46:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	try it. maybe something went wrong
2009-11-08T07:47:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	and by the way `uname -r` is for the kernel you are running. the howto is wrong. it should have `uname -r` for the kernel below he is reinstalling, and he assumes 2.6.28
2009-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	it didn't install properly, it couldn't find any of the packages
2009-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	uname -r please
2009-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	ah, so it's trying to install the wrong file?
2009-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	yes most probably. I will try to give you the right instruction. hold on
2009-11-08T07:49:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	sudo aptitude reinstall linux-headers-`uname -r` linux-image-`uname -r` linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2009-11-08T07:50:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	this should do the trick
2009-11-08T07:51:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	k
2009-11-08T07:51:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	i think i got it now, thanx for suggestion the uname -r input ;)
2009-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	yeah, no problem. maybe you should comment in that thread for fixing the howto. it is definitely misleading
2009-11-08T07:54:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	glad to help you
2009-11-08T07:55:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	I think its working, its downloading a file right now instead of doing nothing like last time =P
2009-11-08T07:56:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	nice! :D
2009-11-08T07:58:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	rebooting, will tell you the outcome in a bit
2009-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	ok
2009-11-08T08:13:00.000Z	Nightblaze	ccfontes	I continued with the rest of the instructions, but still no luck... the hardware is added again though, so its progress =)
2009-11-08T08:16:00.000Z	ccfontes	Nightblaze	at least you have drivers :p .. but did you unmute the sound?
