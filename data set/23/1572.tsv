2010-03-16T22:45:00.000Z	Trek		whoops
2010-03-16T22:45:00.000Z	killown	Trek	why?
2010-03-16T22:46:00.000Z	Trek	killown	don't use NTFS for your home partition, unless you need it to work with windows.  it might run into issues when loading
2010-03-16T22:46:00.000Z	killown		Trek i need share this partition with windows
2010-03-16T22:46:00.000Z	Trek	killown	assuming you have the ntfs-related packages, you shouldn't have any real issues, but if you need Windows to work with it, then NTFS or FAT32
2010-03-16T22:46:00.000Z	Trek	killown	up to you though
2010-03-16T22:47:00.000Z	killown	Trek	ntfs take more processor load than others linux filesystems?
2010-03-16T22:47:00.000Z	Trek	killown	FAT32 is guaranteed to work on everything, all operating systems can read it
2010-03-16T22:47:00.000Z	Trek	killown	how large a partition you making for home?
2010-03-16T22:48:00.000Z	killown		40gb
2010-03-16T22:49:00.000Z	Trek	killown	you might consider using NTFS.  but remember that NTFS has a large overhead requirement, and it will take up a bit of space.  so either FAT32 or NTFS.  FAT32 for guaranteed compatibility, NTFS if you wish for it to work with Windows and Linux only
2010-03-16T22:49:00.000Z	killown		yep, i have windows 7 installed here
2010-03-16T22:49:00.000Z	killown		i need ntfs partition
2010-03-16T22:51:00.000Z	killown	Trek	but i need know if ntfs-3g takes very processor load
2010-03-16T22:52:00.000Z	Trek	killown	its not typically processor load, rather hard drive usage.  If you set a 40GB NTFS partition, you'll only get maybe 30 - 39 GBs of usable space, since NTFS has a large file indexer
2010-03-16T22:53:00.000Z	killown		ahh ok
2010-03-16T22:53:00.000Z	Trek	killown	personally, I use Ubuntu to work with NTFS drives in order to recover data, check for errors, etc, and there's no real processor load
2010-03-16T22:56:00.000Z	killown	Trek	thank you
2010-03-16T22:56:00.000Z	Trek		no problem, killown
2010-03-16T22:56:00.000Z	Trek	killown	remember: the drives I work with are 250GB +, and they usualy have about 100GB - 150GB on NTFS partitions
2010-03-16T22:57:00.000Z	killown		hmm
2010-03-16T22:57:00.000Z	Trek	killown	it works becuase there's so much space that the NTFS overhead that stores where things are on the partition has sufficient space to work
2010-03-16T22:58:00.000Z	Trek	killown	I have made NTFS work on 40GB partitions as well, but you lose a bit of space due to the NTFS overhead, as such, its up to you, you'll still have approx. 35GB give or take 2GB usable
