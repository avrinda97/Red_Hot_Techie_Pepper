2005-10-05T11:09:00.000Z	neutrin0		hi tritium
2005-10-05T11:09:00.000Z	neutrin0		I'm working on getting a simple LAN going
2005-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	neutrin0		can anyone field some routing questions?
2005-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	neutrin0		whats up tritium
2005-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	ask and you might find an answer
2005-10-05T11:13:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	that would probably be the easiest way
2005-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/Masquerading-Simple-HOWTO.html
2005-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	did you enable ip_forward ?
2005-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	neutrin0	calc	yes
2005-10-05T11:18:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	that worked?
2005-10-05T11:19:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	on the knoppix box it would need to set its gateway to the ubuntu one as well, probably via dhcp server telling it
2005-10-05T11:20:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	also use numeric ips to ping for testing since you could end up having dns issues etc if trying to go to a web page
2005-10-05T11:21:00.000Z	neutrin0	calc	i've set the nic on the ubuntu box as the default:soundright?
2005-10-05T11:22:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	should be
2005-10-05T11:23:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	er yea you are going to have fun with this
2005-10-05T11:23:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	its a little more complicated than i first realized
2005-10-05T11:23:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	you probably will need two addresses on the ubuntu nic
2005-10-05T11:24:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	or does the ubuntu box have two nics?
2005-10-05T11:25:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	still here?
2005-10-05T11:29:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	oh ok
2005-10-05T11:29:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	yea so the knoppix one should point to the one it is connected to as the gateway
2005-10-05T11:37:00.000Z	calc	neutrin0	that dhcp3-server package is in ubuntu
