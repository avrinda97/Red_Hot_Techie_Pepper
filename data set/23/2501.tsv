2009-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe		How do i get my cpu fan working. it has power and is connected
2009-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	and it doesn't kick in even if you put some load on the cpu, and it does work before ubuntu boots?
2009-02-17T08:46:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	nothing with putting load on it. let me reboot
2009-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	(I'm wondering if this is hardware or software)
2009-02-17T08:48:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	i believe it to be software, stops running when the grub starts to load.get nothing what so ever after that
2009-02-17T08:50:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	i tried to looking some stuff up on google but got mixed results. I see you got you hands full just pm me when you get a sec i will continue to look online
2009-02-17T08:50:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	not sure what's up with that, unless it's a laptop and you're missing some kernel support, but that'd be weird if this is a stock ubuntu kernel
2009-02-17T08:50:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	doubt I can help, I don't really do laptops
2009-02-17T08:51:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	its not a laptop , frankestein desktop
2009-02-17T08:53:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	its not a laptop , frankestein desktop
2009-02-17T08:54:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	not sure what's up then (hw sensors/fan control doing something weird is possible, but I don't know why it'd be doing that without you explicitly telling it to)
2009-02-17T08:55:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	i didn't tell it to do that. is there a file i can check config settings in? i will check bios
2009-02-17T08:55:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	not sure where ubuntu would have this.
2009-02-17T08:57:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	great it might be awhile  comp being a pain
2009-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	now my boot process hangs , couldn't get into bios. something about 8254 timer
2009-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	what did you change?
2009-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	also, what's "something" (try photographing the screen since you probably can't copy/paste where it hangs)?
2009-02-17T09:09:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	hangs on the orange bar
2009-02-17T09:18:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	it was force a fsck  and now its getting all kinds of errors
2009-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	Digitalcheffe	mzz	asking if i want to ignore errors
2009-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	you usually don't
2009-02-17T09:39:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	try the drive in a different system to see if it's bad?
2009-02-17T09:54:00.000Z	mzz	Digitalcheffe	with your fan trouble it's possible something else in the system broke, so if at all possible I'd try the drive in a different system before deciding it's broken
