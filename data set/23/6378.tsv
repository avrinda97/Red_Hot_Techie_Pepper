2006-05-03T15:21:00.000Z	patrick_king		wat is vmware
2006-05-03T15:22:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	quick answer is yes. Provide more detail for a more detailed answer.
2006-05-03T15:23:00.000Z	patrick_king	ic56	at the momnet i have 3 different accounts for each user to use ssh,ftp,mysql, but i cant seem to make one account tobe able to use ssh,ftp,mysql
2006-05-03T15:24:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	define "use" are we talking about the uid under which the servers run or the uid of the users invoking the clients?
2006-05-03T15:27:00.000Z	patrick_king	ic56	to be able to delete,modifie,add
2006-05-03T15:27:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	You're ocnfusing me. "modify" isn't relevant to ssh sessions.  Please be more specific.
2006-05-03T15:35:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	do you know what people mean by server and client?  If I use this vocabulary, will we be on common ground?
2006-05-03T15:38:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	so, this dstamp user you mention, if someone logs in as that user at the console or at the X login prompt, then what happens? are they immediately in a command-line window with, say, an ftp client already running?
2006-05-03T15:52:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	are you still there?
2006-05-03T15:53:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	so... you plan on answering my question or have you given up on this?
2006-05-03T15:56:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	how familiar are you with Linux?
2006-05-03T15:58:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	ok, what are the names of the 3 users you speak of?
2006-05-03T16:00:00.000Z	patrick_king	ic56	the names are dstamp for ftp, danielstamp for ssh and dstamp for mysql
2006-05-03T16:02:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	ok. are you using these from the command line, from the GUI, or both?
2006-05-03T16:02:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	ok. say you are at the command line console, and you login as danielstamp.  What happens?
2006-05-03T16:03:00.000Z	patrick_king	ic56	the user is using ftp in dreamweaver, ssh from terminal and mysql in phpmyadmin
2006-05-03T16:05:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	I think I'm starting to understand.  Explain more about what happens when you log in as user danielstamp.
2006-05-03T16:06:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	ssh to where?
2006-05-03T16:08:00.000Z	patrick_king	ic56	i have sorted it now, i remember wat i done wrong thanks for trying to help
2006-05-03T16:09:00.000Z	ic56	patrick_king	np. good luck.
