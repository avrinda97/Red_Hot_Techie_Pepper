2012-06-20T23:12:00.000Z	KBentley57		hey guys, does "glibc2" go by any other package name?  I'm trying to install it without compiling from source
2012-06-20T23:12:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	why do you want it?
2012-06-20T23:12:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	I'm trying to install LabVIEW, and it requires it
2012-06-20T23:13:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	are you compiling labview?
2012-06-20T23:14:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	no, but the first thing I see after I run the install file says "WARNING!  You do not have glibc2 (libc.so.6) installed.
2012-06-20T23:15:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	is it a 32bit app perhaps?
2012-06-20T23:16:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	 I'm not positive, but being a very scientific app I highly doubt it
2012-06-20T23:16:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	check?
2012-06-20T23:16:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	checking
2012-06-20T23:22:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	damn, looks like it is a 32 bit program.
2012-06-20T23:22:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	good call
2012-06-20T23:22:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	try installing libc6:i386 using apt-get
2012-06-20T23:24:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	mcphail, thanks for the tip.  grabbing them as we speak.  I suppose that since it is a 32 bit program, I need the 32 bit c std library for it to work with?
2012-06-20T23:26:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	mcphail, i grabbed libc6-i386 and libc6-i386-dev, but it's still griping about libc.so.6 (glibc2)
2012-06-20T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	not sure that's the same.  use the :
2012-06-20T23:27:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	i think it is, but I'll fire up synaptic and check it out
2012-06-20T23:29:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	you're right, there are two different packages.  Any idea on the difference?
2012-06-20T23:29:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	no
2012-06-20T23:29:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	:)
2012-06-20T23:31:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	then there is this monster: libc6-dev-amd64:i386
2012-06-20T23:31:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	nice
2012-06-20T23:32:00.000Z	jrib	KBentley57	I guess that's for compiling for other arches than your current one
2012-06-20T23:32:00.000Z	KBentley57	jrib	I have libc6:i386 installed, the description for the other is "Contains the symlinks and object files needed to compile and link programs
