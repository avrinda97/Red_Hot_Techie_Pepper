2010-10-24T18:42:00.000Z	antonella_bella	coz_	tks a lot! by now I tried to use jack but i'm unable to connect system's audio to jack...
2010-10-24T18:43:00.000Z	coz_	antonella_bella	  ah  was there an error?
2010-10-24T18:43:00.000Z	antonella_bella	coz_	no, simply no audio
2010-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	antonella_bella	coz_	it seems jack accepts only analog inputs by system... but maybe i'm unable to configure...
2010-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	coz_	antonella_bella	 I am not up to top skill level with audio issues...have you checked in  #pulseaudio or #alsa channels?
2010-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	coz_	antonella_bella	 let me see if there is a jack channel
2010-10-24T18:44:00.000Z	antonella_bella	coz_	not yet, I was searching for a jack channel...
