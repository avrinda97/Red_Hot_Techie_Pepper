2008-10-18T20:17:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	no, that's not what it does
2008-10-18T20:20:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/11936/
2008-10-18T20:21:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	that something is said on brainstorm doesn't make it true, actually erm, quite the contrary
2008-10-18T20:22:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	 Care to provide a link to differing information, just because you 'say' it is so, also does not mean it is
2008-10-18T20:27:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	of course. Add/Remove gets its data from the package "app-install-data", whose documentation you can read at /usr/share/doc/app-install-data/README
2008-10-18T20:48:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	Add/Remove is gnome-app-install.  gnome-app-install depends on .desktop files.  You might enjoy "on the downside" http://www.qeuni.net/f/1/2008/gnome-app-install.html
2008-10-18T20:51:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	Point Add/Remove does not include ALL apps, you can argue about popularity, but not that.  Search for Google Earth in both Synaptic and Add/Remove, see which includes and which doesn't.
2008-10-18T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	i'm not sure what your point is... you've said it's based on .desktop file, and yes that's true, it's the same thing that README i pointed you to says, and is consistent with what i said to begin with. neither add/remove nor synaptic include google earth, of course, since it's not in the repositories
2008-10-18T20:53:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	also, add/remove is not necessarily gnome-app-install, it can be adept_installer (still based on the same app-install-data package)
2008-10-18T20:53:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	Search again, Synaptic does include it
2008-10-18T20:53:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	that's probably because you have some unofficial third-party repository enabled. type "apt-cache policy googleearth" to find out.
2008-10-18T20:53:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	 Suggest you read through the help in Add/Remove
2008-10-18T20:54:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	that's where it identifies itself as gnome-app-install
2008-10-18T20:54:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	i'd rather not install GNOME to read through it, i'd be more grateful if you could point me to a web version of it, or quote the relevant parts
2008-10-18T20:54:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	of course, if you're on GNOME, it's gnome-app-install, that's obvious. it's adept_installer if you're on KDE
2008-10-18T20:55:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	I'm on Xubuntu (Intrepid) which I admit does use parts of gnome
2008-10-18T20:57:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	the package description for adept-installer (which, if you may believe me on this, *is* equivalent to gnome-app-install in a KDE environment) says it nicely: "Adept Installer presents a list of applications available through the
2008-10-18T20:57:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	so popularity is really not in the equation
2008-10-18T20:57:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	This is from the Add/Remove help page:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/59331/
2008-10-18T20:58:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	yes, i see nothing surprising there
2008-10-18T20:58:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	 it doesn't mention Adept Installer
2008-10-18T20:59:00.000Z	hmuller	LjL	 appreciate the discourse, gotta go
2008-10-18T20:59:00.000Z	LjL	hmuller	are you listening to me? Adept *is the KDE version*. do you have KDE? is that help file a KDE help file?
