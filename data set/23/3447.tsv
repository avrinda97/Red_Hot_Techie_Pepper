2008-04-22T13:50:00.000Z	mr_boo		am i the only one who tries to use the 8800gt with the realtime kernel?
2008-04-22T13:50:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	 i use 8800GTS 512 with RT kernel...close
2008-04-22T13:51:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	does one have to do any special magic to get the card to work with the realtime kernel specifically?
2008-04-22T13:52:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	i did NOT have to do anything special ... I am using the nvidia drivers, if that matters
2008-04-22T13:54:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	in my case i can start the generic and it works
2008-04-22T13:54:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	but as soon as i start the realtime one i can only run in low graphics mode
2008-04-22T13:54:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	wait i forgot..if you are using the nvidia drivers you must re-install them anytime the kernel changes
2008-04-22T13:55:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	that is probably it - I had to check my blog to recall what I did and I made a note of the re-install of drivers
2008-04-22T13:59:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	would you recommend using the "envy" script?
2008-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	well, I HAVE used it in the past when I got so frustrated trying to do install the nvidia drivers manually. So, my experience is give it a good try first yourself, and then if that fails, try envy
2008-04-22T14:10:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	usually when I have this problem it is because the "vesa" driver is being used. This means the "nvidia" driver was not installed.
2008-04-22T14:11:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	did you re-install the drivers? since they are complied against the kernel headers, this must be done everytime the kernel changes....oh, nvm I mean the drivers from nvidia proper, not the ones from the restricted driver manager ... you will need to install the drivers from nvidia manually I think
2008-04-22T14:12:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	envy did the job for the generic kernel
2008-04-22T14:12:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	so why shouldn't it work with the realtime kernel?
2008-04-22T14:14:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	I don't know enough about how envy works to guess. On this machine (which is x86_64 rt), I install the drivers myself after downloading from nvidia
2008-04-22T14:24:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	you will have to download the drivers from nvidia and try to manually install. it can be a pain to get it working the first time
2008-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	the thing is that i could use my older nvidia on both kernels
2008-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	envy did the job for that card on both kernels
2008-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	well give it a shot, maybe you will be lucky
2008-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	gonna try
2008-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	mr_boo	ushimitsudoki	do you use the 169.12 driver?
2008-04-22T14:51:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	didn't work?
2008-04-22T14:52:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	mr_boo	hooray!
