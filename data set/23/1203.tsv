2010-07-08T00:58:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	it's working fine (version 1.1.7)
2010-07-08T00:59:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	we're dealing with 2.1.8 here I think...
2010-07-08T01:00:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	I'm using version 1.1.7 because 2.x had some bugs to use with Mikrotik
2010-07-08T01:00:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	you have good results with it? been running it for a long time?
2010-07-08T01:01:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	I'm running it on 2 servers for more than 2 years
2010-07-08T01:01:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	how many systems are on your network?
2010-07-08T01:02:00.000Z	brambilla		Roasted:excuse, what kind of systems?
2010-07-08T01:02:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	well be using freeradius to authenticate wireless laptops. I was just curious how many desktops/laptops/clients or whatever you had on your netowrk
2010-07-08T01:03:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	~3000 online connections, but it's around 6000 clients
2010-07-08T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	ha, dang. more than us. :P
2010-07-08T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	did you have any issues when trying to bind the debian servers to the domain? Its giving me a headache.
2010-07-08T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted		chown USER location
2010-07-08T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted		chown daichi /path/of/file
2010-07-08T01:05:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	I'm using Freeradius to pppoe acounting and authentication without domain
2010-07-08T01:05:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	hmm... okay. well at least its good to hear somebody else out there speaks highly of it.
2010-07-08T01:05:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	were taking a shot in the dark, besides theres a widely known bug with microsoft's radius option
2010-07-08T01:06:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	it drops their authentication after 30 days and doesnt re-register it unless you plug the laptops in via ethernet to re-authenticate there, but again, 30 days later it drops again.
2010-07-08T01:06:00.000Z	Roasted	brambilla	hence our interest in freeradius since users say this problem doesnt exist in freeradius :P
2010-07-08T01:12:00.000Z	brambilla	Roasted	I'm happy with Freeradius, but I don't know about microsoft's radius
