2009-11-18T12:25:00.000Z	bigsteve		Hi, My Intel video driver is gone... strange.  It has been working fine for 4 months.  How do I reinstall it.  The system was using the Intel driver that come with the gnome version.
2009-11-18T12:27:00.000Z	bigsteve		is this the main ubuntu support channel?
2009-11-18T12:27:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Yes
2009-11-18T12:29:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	can you help with a video driver issue?  I know re installing is kind a basic thing, but i am a newbie.
2009-11-18T12:29:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Well, go ahead and ask.
2009-11-18T12:30:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	my video driver disappeared.  How do I re-insall it?  intel chip. on the mother board.
2009-11-18T12:32:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Sorry to see you lost your video. Might want to try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-11-18T12:33:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	thanks. What will that command do?
2009-11-18T12:34:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	It runs a little configuration program. Use the defaults, or try some options.
2009-11-18T12:34:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Please save a copy of your config file beforehand.
2009-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	will it reload the driver?  because the driver is definatly not there right now.
2009-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Well it "should". If not, you're in for some more work, I guess.
2009-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	 LOL  ok.  you said to save the config file.  do you mean save it to another name?
2009-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	Right, just copy it to your home directory or somewhere.
2009-11-18T12:38:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/xorg.conf.backup
2009-11-18T12:45:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	this is doing my key board.. I have no idea what my key board is.  do I really have to count the keys?.
2009-11-18T12:45:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	The default should be OK (it's US keyboard by default). Are you in a US or English country?
2009-11-18T12:48:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	can I stop this.  and go back to what it was.  all i need to do is install a video driver not change my whole system.
2009-11-18T12:49:00.000Z	bigsteve	starhash	i am using a wireless keyboard with several special keys that work fine.  this will turn them off.
2009-11-18T12:49:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	X is responsible for keyboard, mouse input as well as graphical output. It shouldn't have written anything if you're still in the middle of things. Just close out.
2009-11-18T12:51:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	If you're current x config file works right with the wireless keyboard, you may have to bring those settings over to the new config file. Good luck.

2009-11-18T12:55:00.000Z	starhash	bigsteve	There's a non-graphical terminal available at Ctrl+Alt+F1 where you can enter these commands.
