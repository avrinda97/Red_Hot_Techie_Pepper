2009-12-25T03:48:00.000Z	rhett		can I install inittab on ubuntu?
2009-12-25T03:48:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	sure, but why would you want to?
2009-12-25T03:48:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	because I don't see event.d
2009-12-25T03:48:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	it's /etc/init/ now
2009-12-25T03:49:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	indicating the intent to replace /etc/init.d/
2009-12-25T03:49:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	why the f does ubunutu change init all the time?
2009-12-25T03:49:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	eh?  we haven't changed init in years
2009-12-25T03:49:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	we're finally using the init we put in place 2 (3?) years ago)
2009-12-25T03:50:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	all  I want to do is respawn this /usr/bin/svscanboot
2009-12-25T03:51:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	I already said:  /etc/event.d/ -> /etc/init/
2009-12-25T03:51:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	everything in my init ends in .conf
2009-12-25T03:52:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	what are you actually trying to accomplish?  restart a service on boot?
2009-12-25T03:52:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	respawn a service on boot
2009-12-25T03:52:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	sorry;  spawn or respawn?
2009-12-25T03:53:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	in event.d or inittab, you say respawn
2009-12-25T03:53:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	if it's just starting it the first time, look to any of the config files in /etc/init/ as an example;  /etc/init/tty1 is a really basic example, and demonstrates how easy such things are now
2009-12-25T03:54:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	respawn means "restart this if it dies".  It's a parameter that is incidental to starting it in the first place
2009-12-25T03:54:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	I understand your confusion now;  /etc/event.d/inittab wasn't special, it was just another upstart job that you created (it had no special meaning over any other upstart job)
2009-12-25T03:54:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	so, just create /etc/init/whatever.conf, and edit it the same way
2009-12-25T03:56:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	there's no such thing as inittab
2009-12-25T03:56:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	if you happen to make a file called inittab.conf in /etc/init (or inittab in /etc/event.d before), it works no differently than any other file name
2009-12-25T03:58:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	rhett	I'm done with your trolling
2009-12-25T04:48:00.000Z	rhett	cwillu_at_work	how do I log something with upstart?
