2007-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	heguru	Haru	use bchunk
2007-10-09T15:09:00.000Z	Haru	heguru	cant install bchunk w/o root permissions?
2007-10-09T15:10:00.000Z	heguru	Haru	not using apt-get atleast
2007-10-09T15:10:00.000Z	heguru	Haru	do you want to play a videoCD ?
2007-10-09T15:13:00.000Z	Haru	heguru	yes :
2007-10-09T15:13:00.000Z	Haru	heguru	its a video indeed
2007-10-09T15:13:00.000Z	Haru	heguru	wow mplayer plays bin files off the rack
2007-10-09T15:14:00.000Z	heguru	Haru	then you can play it without extracting if you have mplayer installed,
2007-10-09T15:14:00.000Z	heguru	Haru	thats what i was suggesting :D
