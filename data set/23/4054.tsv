2007-11-25T08:04:00.000Z	poseidon		I'm trying to write an image file to a cd, how am I supposed to mount the cd though?
2007-11-25T08:04:00.000Z	poseidon		a cd image file .iso
2007-11-25T08:05:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	you can't mount the blank CD you're burning to
2007-11-25T08:05:00.000Z	poseidon	ephemient	what am I supposed to do?
2007-11-25T08:06:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	Gnome should have asked you if you wanted to burn a CD when you inserted the empty disc
2007-11-25T08:06:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	if it didn't, right-click on the .iso and select burn
2007-11-25T08:08:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	if you are comfortable with the command line, wodim also burns CD images
2007-11-25T08:36:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	run "apt-cache show gnomebaker" and it will list a path on Ubuntu's archive servers
2007-11-25T08:39:00.000Z	poseidon	ephemient	it did not show couldnt' find any servers for it
2007-11-25T08:40:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	archive.ubuntu.org/ubuntu
2007-11-25T08:40:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	oh wait, I might have misinterpreted you
2007-11-25T08:41:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	do you have universe repositories?
2007-11-25T08:41:00.000Z	poseidon	ephemient	I'm trying to download it from on to my computer with windows, then transfer it to my ubuntu comp
2007-11-25T08:42:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	you should fix that :)
2007-11-25T08:42:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	but in this case, it's a little easier
2007-11-25T08:42:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	just go to packages.ubuntu.com, search for gnomebaker, and download the correct dist.
2007-11-25T08:44:00.000Z	poseidon	ephemient	how do I know which dist I have?
2007-11-25T08:45:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	you don't know if you're on Dapper or Edgy or Feisty or Gusty?
2007-11-25T08:47:00.000Z	poseidon	ephemient	I got my live cd from here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-11-25T08:47:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	when?
2007-11-25T08:47:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	Gusty was released last month
2007-11-25T08:48:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	probably Feisty, then
2007-11-25T08:48:00.000Z	ephemient	poseidon	unless you went for LTS and got Dapper... :-/
