2009-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	jacky4		using buntu 9.04
2009-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	nvidia-settings
2009-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	it could be that you have a crappy card.
2009-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	if you have a good card, nvidia-settings works
2009-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	im in nvidia x server settings right now...the max it will let me go is 1200 x 800 i have a 7600 gt
2009-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	well, I would say then you cannot go higher.
2009-07-27T14:40:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	it can also be the case that you need to add another resolution to the screen section of xorg.conf
2009-07-27T14:40:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	but I personally doubt that is necessary.
2009-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	there already should be a screen section in the xorg.conf file, just add the resolution you want to it.
2009-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	and actionparsnip: im sure a 7600 gt is good enough for better htan 1200 x 800 res
2009-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	pressing Control-Alt-+ you can do cycle through the resolutions.
2009-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	and actionparsnip: im gonna pastebin my xorg.conf
2009-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	and actionparsnip: http://pastebin.com/m7f8c613e
2009-07-27T15:15:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	modprobe -r nvidia
2009-07-27T15:15:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	or with sudo before it, depending on your setup.
2009-07-27T15:15:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	can i pm your real quick?
2009-07-27T15:15:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	no
2009-07-27T15:19:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	if i download the fresh drivers from nvidia and go through the installation all i need to type is modprobe -r nvidia to fix it...cause before i got this after the installation....http://img38.imageshack.us/i/helpizj.jpg/
2009-07-27T15:19:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	so, did you read the log?
2009-07-27T15:21:00.000Z	jacky4	pozic	yeah i didnt understand any of it...and then upgrayed from 8.10 to 9.04 and now im using the nvidia 180.44 drivers again
2009-07-27T15:22:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	if you do not understand, you search for the error message on google.
2009-07-27T15:22:00.000Z	pozic	jacky4	you also read the README which has been written by nvidia, I think.
