2008-02-16T06:38:00.000Z	barnaby		Hey all. I cannot log into ubuntu, it says home directory is out of room. Help!
2008-02-16T06:38:00.000Z	barnaby		nope
2008-02-16T06:38:00.000Z	barnaby		just gutsy
2008-02-16T06:38:00.000Z	barnaby		hd not full
2008-02-16T06:39:00.000Z	barnaby		a bit
2008-02-16T06:39:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	df -h will tell you which partition is full, one of your partitions _is_ full
2008-02-16T06:38:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	are you familiar with the console?
2008-02-16T06:39:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	you can use ctrl+alt+f1 to switch to a console and login
2008-02-16T06:40:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	then make space. ctrl+alt+f7 will normally switch back to x
2008-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	barnaby	lyte	are you still there? I have a terminal window open
2008-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	log in, run "df -h" it should tell you info about some partition that is full
2008-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	well if /dev/hda1 and it contains your /home directory that's the drive you need to clean up
2008-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	just delete some files you don't need for a start, get it working then worry about whether you need to expand it
2008-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	look for any large downloads you don't need anymore, cache and temp files etc
2008-02-16T06:48:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	you might find running "aptitude clean" will delete enough stuff (it gets rid of all those .deb files you use once and never need again)
2008-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	barnaby	lyte	(if you are still there) I tried to change into the directory (sda1) to remove some files manually. It says it's not a directory
2008-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	it's right /dev/blah is a device you want the other thing (like just /)
2008-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	you want the bit in the "mounted on" column
2008-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	if you have run aptitude clean and df -h is now reporting some free space i would suggest just trying to log in again
2008-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	a line like - /dev/sda2              10G  6.2G  3.9G  62% / - shows that my second partition mounted at / has 62% used space, make sense? if there is nothing else containing /home it will the root (or the one with a /) partition that contains home and you want to clean up
2008-02-16T07:08:00.000Z	barnaby	lyte	are you still there?
2008-02-16T07:08:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	what's the current question?
2008-02-16T07:10:00.000Z	lyte	barnaby	awesome, good work :)
