2008-06-23T10:41:00.000Z	ryan_	user01	nice
2008-06-23T10:41:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	he only used it for semester at school
2008-06-23T10:41:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	and there is still a warranty and everything on it
2008-06-23T10:41:00.000Z	ryan_	user01	cool
2008-06-23T10:42:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	the top bidder wasnt able to pay
2008-06-23T10:42:00.000Z	ryan_		i didnt get warrenty because i buy computers so much its not worth it
2008-06-23T10:42:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	yeah my t40 just died sorta
2008-06-23T10:42:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	didnt think it was worth getting repaired
2008-06-23T10:43:00.000Z	ryan_		its sad when computers die, kinda brings a tear to my eyes
2008-06-23T10:43:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	do you know if i can use the same ac cord with this one?
2008-06-23T10:43:00.000Z	ryan_		it depends on the voltage and ampage
2008-06-23T10:44:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	the port replicator for the t40 probably wont work with it
2008-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	ryan_	user01	yeah, its best to take it in and get matched up with a new cord if it doesnt come with one
2008-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	user01	ryan_	i think it does come with one, i just wanted to use my two t40 cords as spares
