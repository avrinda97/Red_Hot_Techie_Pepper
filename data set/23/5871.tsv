2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Hi. I have an old Toshiba Tecra laptop, and it has an IrDA infra red port. Can anyone here help me to get it working in Feisty?
2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	see lsmod if the IrDa modules are already loaded (should be)
2007-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	I see irda listed...
2007-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	good, so sudo apt-get install irda-utils
2007-10-13T06:42:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	ok, I got the irda-utils....
2007-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	did it tak you through some configuration during install ?
2007-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	no.
2007-10-13T06:44:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	so sudo dpkg-reconfigure irda-utils (just to make sure it ot everything right)
2007-10-13T06:48:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	it's asking me if I want to use a serial dongle or "native"... I don't know what that means. Do I just choose "native"?
2007-10-13T06:48:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	no on an old Tosh you need serial
2007-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	native is only for USB dongles
2007-10-13T06:55:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	 it's giving me a list of dongle types to choose now.... I don't know what any of them are. Do I just choose "none"?
2007-10-13T06:56:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	yup... it's internal anyway
2007-10-13T06:56:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	ok, the config thing has exited now
2007-10-13T06:57:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	so see 'ifconfig' if a network adater is configured for IrDa now
2007-10-13T06:59:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	I have no idea.. what am I looking for in ifconfig's output?
2007-10-13T07:00:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	put your irda device in front of the Interface and run 'cat /proc/net/irda/discovery
2007-10-13T07:08:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	I don't have an IR device. My goal is to get this to work with LIRC plug-ins so I can see if it works with remote controls....
2007-10-13T07:09:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	anyay I did cat /proc/net/irda/discovery but nothing seemed to happen... it just says IrLMP; Discovery Log:
2007-10-13T07:09:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	That won't work. IR receivers and IrDa interfaces are completly different Hardware
2007-10-13T07:11:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	stefg	oh.. I thought I read somewhere that IRDA interfaces can be used with LIRC?
2007-10-13T07:12:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	only in /very/ rare cases.
2007-10-13T07:12:00.000Z	stefg	CorpseFeeder	and even if it works somehow, it'll be unreliable and unusable in practice
