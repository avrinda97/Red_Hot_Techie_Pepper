2005-03-13T07:39:00.000Z	StoffBox-Steve		hmm i cant get the nvidia driver work ... only vesa is running with my custom kernel, maybe why only vesa is in kernel ... i installed the driver from nvidia.com ... what must i change in the Xfree config do get them work ?
2005-03-13T07:40:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	you can probably find a lot of stuff on google if you search nvidia and xorg
2005-03-13T07:47:00.000Z	StoffBox-Steve	sri	all the changes are done, nvidia is at etc/modules  glx-config is enable, xfreeconfig -4 is edit .. *hmm* any ide's ?
2005-03-13T07:48:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	are you using hoary or warty?
2005-03-13T07:49:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	oh.  yeah so it's still xfreeconfig-4..what does /var/log/Xfree86*.log say?
2005-03-13T07:51:00.000Z	StoffBox-Steve	sri	the log only shows the last free start or ?
2005-03-13T07:52:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	well, it should tell you how it's starting and whether it loaded everything correctly, you should look for EE stuff in the log
2005-03-13T07:53:00.000Z	StoffBox-Steve	sri	ok found this > (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (NVIDIA X driver not found)
2005-03-13T07:53:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	did you load the glx module?
2005-03-13T07:54:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	and also did lsmod | grep nvidia show up?
2005-03-13T07:55:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	no, check to see if it loaded the nvidia kernel module
2005-03-13T07:55:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	lsmod | grep nvidia
2005-03-13T07:56:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	rmmod vesa and nvidia and then do modprobe nvidia
2005-03-13T07:57:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	but make sure in your Xfree86config file you have Module "glx" also in there.  Is uspect you do.
2005-03-13T07:58:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	so maybe you don't have vesa installed..do a modprobe nvidia again
2005-03-13T07:58:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	GLcore should be commented out
2005-03-13T07:59:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	but you should also have a module called glx
2005-03-13T07:59:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	and I'm referring to the X module, not kernel
2005-03-13T07:59:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	so in Section "Module" you should have a Load "glx"
2005-03-13T08:00:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	you don't need to show me the whole thing
2005-03-13T08:00:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	a yes or no is sufficient
2005-03-13T08:01:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	so I'm not sure whats the cause is here is.  I'd google around some and look at your log and maybe search the error in google
2005-03-13T08:01:00.000Z	sri	StoffBox-Steve	that what I usually do.
