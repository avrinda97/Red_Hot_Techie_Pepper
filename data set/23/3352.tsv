2008-06-06T16:15:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	click the icon with the pencil and paper.. should open an address bar
2008-06-06T16:16:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	your looking for an older backup of that xorg.conf file.
2008-06-06T16:19:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	in that folder... are there similar files?
2008-06-06T16:20:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	on paper the old fashioned way
2008-06-06T16:21:00.000Z	abdulla	tj83	which ones do i write?
2008-06-06T16:21:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	do sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.confg1 and then add a # at the top line (nano wont save unless you make a change) and then ctrl+x then y and save as xorg.conf to revert to a working file. this is just in case
2008-06-06T16:22:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	you get the idea? I have to go in just a min
2008-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	give me the exact file name
2008-06-06T16:28:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	geesh that old back up file you said was there like xorg.confg1 or something

2008-06-06T16:31:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	you have to give me the exact file name
2008-06-06T16:32:00.000Z	tj83	abdulla	then write this down
