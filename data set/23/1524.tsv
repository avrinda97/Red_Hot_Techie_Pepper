2010-02-18T00:11:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	are you sure they are duplicates and not a normal one and a recovery one?
2010-02-18T00:11:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	I have two normal ones and two recovery ones
2010-02-18T00:12:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	yes you should, because you have 2 kernels
2010-02-18T00:12:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	you should also have 2 memtest because one is a normal memtest and the other is for a serial console
2010-02-18T00:13:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	i see. should I remove one? or at least, how do I remove the option from the grub menu?
2010-02-18T00:14:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	I'm not sure why I'd need two kernels and I'd rather they not show up when I'm booting.
2010-02-18T00:14:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	if you wanted to remove the other kernel, you just need to uninstall it, but it is usually a good idea to keep at least two kernels (like you have), in case you find a bug in your current one
2010-02-18T00:16:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	in that case I won't remove the old one, however, can I just change the options displayed in the grub boot menu?
2010-02-18T00:17:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	unfortunately no, because they are both added by the same grub script...it is possible to do but it is a hassle, if you really want it gone you should just install the kernel
2010-02-18T00:17:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	install = uninstall
2010-02-18T00:18:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	you can, but it will be overwritten next grub/kernel update
2010-02-18T00:21:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	you can move windows to the top if you want to, you just need to rename /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to /etc/grub.d/09_os-prober and all the other operating systems will be at the top instead of the bottom (and since you only have windows 7, it will be windows 7, then the most recent ubuntu kernel)
2010-02-18T00:22:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	you will need to edit /etc/default/grub and set GRUB_DEFAULT to 1 if you want ubuntu to stay as the default booting system
2010-02-18T00:22:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	thanks, that was very helpful.
2010-02-18T00:22:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	you read my mind! was about to ask :-)
2010-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	I preformed the steps that you suggested and here are the results: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d1dda2388
2010-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	the boot menu did not reflect the changes though (-_-);
2010-02-18T00:38:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	by 'did not reflect the changes' I mean that windows 7 did not move to the tom of the list and grub_default still appears to be 0 (the first item)
2010-02-18T00:40:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	sorry, I may just need to update-grub
2010-02-18T00:44:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	worked wonderfully, thanks again
2010-02-18T00:46:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	you're welcome, glad it is working
2010-02-18T00:49:00.000Z	trism	ericjames	sorry I forgot to mention the sudo update-grub; part
2010-02-18T00:50:00.000Z	ericjames	trism	np, thanks
