2011-08-31T22:50:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	do you mean the lines where the first one starts --- ?
2011-08-31T22:52:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	exactly. I do not know, which file I have to edit, where it is or where I have to edit it etc. I run all upper commands successfully..
2011-08-31T22:52:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	you copy that whole section and put in a file called Makefile.ubuntu.diff
2011-08-31T22:53:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	but where does this file have to be?
2011-08-31T22:54:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	that file should be in the directory where you are building xv
2011-08-31T22:54:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	(I cannot find the folder, where xv is built *shame*)
2011-08-31T22:54:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	I followed every Detail of the instructions.
2011-08-31T22:55:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	you created it in the previous commands, try: locate xv-build
2011-08-31T22:59:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	root@stefan-HP-625:~# locate xv-build
2011-08-31T22:59:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch		root@stefan-HP-625:~#  It does not find anything.
2011-08-31T23:00:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	then you did not follow the previous commands correctly, start again
2011-08-31T23:00:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	in the command line I am on root@stefan-HP-625:~/xv-build/xv-3.10a#
2011-08-31T23:00:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	OK, so that is the one you want
2011-08-31T23:01:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	the locate database had not been refreshed
2011-08-31T23:01:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	I cannot see the file in nautilus. This is weired.
2011-08-31T23:02:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	have you copied and pasted the text into the diff file?
2011-08-31T23:03:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	no, I am not even sure if it exists. should I "gedit ~/xv-build/Makefile.ubuntu.diff"
2011-08-31T23:04:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	gedit ~/xv-build/xv-3.10a/Makefile.ubuntu.diff
2011-08-31T23:07:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	~/xv-build/Makefile.ubuntu.diff does not exist should I touch it?
2011-08-31T23:08:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	You can do, but make sure it goes in the xv-3.10a directory
2011-08-31T23:08:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	even /home/myname/xv-b TAB does not elongate the directory.
2011-08-31T23:08:00.000Z	LurchiderLurch	keithb	thanks, I will try
2011-08-31T23:09:00.000Z	keithb	LurchiderLurch	did you create the directory as root in your home? If so, you won't have access under your normal account
