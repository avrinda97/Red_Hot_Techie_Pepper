2008-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: What is the best text editor for linux? Preferably with the basic programming abilities, like indentation management, syntax highlighting for python, html, php, etc. ?
2008-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	WarrenDumX	Leefmc	: try Geany

2008-06-08T16:25:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: Also, what about a FTP client? Whats a good one for Ubuntu?
2008-06-08T16:25:00.000Z	WarrenDumX	Leefmc	: Filezilla
2008-06-08T16:25:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Again, thank you :)
2008-06-08T16:26:00.000Z	WarrenDumX	Leefmc	you're welcome :)
2008-06-08T16:26:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		Filezilla is popular on windows too...
2008-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Thats the one hard thing about popular programs. You can view all the ratings and lists you want, but word of mouth is all that matters heh. (Though blogs can sometimes help)
2008-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		True :)
2008-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		But Filezilla is known as a good program
2008-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Well not to me :o
2008-06-08T16:28:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		:)
2008-06-08T16:28:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		you can also try gftp, but i don't recommend it because it's not updated and buggy sometimes
2008-06-08T16:28:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	I used my File Browser in windows, i owned a copy of um.. forgot what its called. Either way, it was a replacement for the horrid windows explorer
2008-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		you can also use Ubuntu's file manager for ftp :)
2008-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Great program.. for windows :o. It was better than Nautalis hehe (or however you spell that.. i'm still waking up :p)
2008-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		^^
2008-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	WarrenDumX		Did you like Geany ? :D
2008-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Haven't downloaded it yet, im debating between using it or just using WingIDE (my python ide) for other files for now.
2008-06-08T16:33:00.000Z	Leefmc	WarrenDumX	Wish XChat's libnotify worked. Synaptic says i already have libnotify, but XChat keeps popping up an error saying it needs libnotify to give me popup messages. (alerts)
