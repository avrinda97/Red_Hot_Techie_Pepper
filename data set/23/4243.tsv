2011-10-16T17:27:00.000Z	christian__		i guess i am missing some repositories
2011-10-16T17:27:00.000Z	christian__		in /etc/apt/source.list
2011-10-16T17:28:00.000Z	christian__		btw i am using 10.04 LTS
2011-10-16T17:28:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	then you might have to seek out a backport or PPA to get that version
2011-10-16T17:29:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	the link ActionParsnip sent was for 11.10
2011-10-16T17:34:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	libboost is not in lucid backports, FYI: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid-backports/libs/
2011-10-16T17:35:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	good
2011-10-16T17:36:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	PPAs are personal package archives - it's up to volunteer individuals to maintain those
2011-10-16T17:39:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	they're mostly fine, but just pay attention to what you're adding ;-)
2011-10-16T17:43:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	you might also experiment with installing the deb for a newer version from packages.ubuntu.com - 'dpkg --dry-run <packagename>' would be your friend
2011-10-16T17:43:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	but realize that you're on your own if you do so - that would not be supported :-/
2011-10-16T17:59:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	try 'apt-cache showpkg <packagename>'
2011-10-16T18:09:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	'sudo apt-get --install-suggests <package>'
2011-10-16T18:10:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	sorry - I'm wrong
2011-10-16T18:10:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	it's 'sudo apt-get --install-suggests install <package>'
2011-10-16T18:10:00.000Z	yeats	christian__	missed the 'install' part ;-)
