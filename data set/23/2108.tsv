2009-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Looking for a script that will delete the "localstore.rdf" file from Firefox, everytime it is run.
2009-06-30T20:57:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	just write a bash script that deletes that file before it launches firefox
2009-06-30T20:57:00.000Z	sillyCEO		don't know how to do that. Whats a bash script? A text file?
2009-06-30T20:58:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Oops, I mean rickest:, I don't know how to do that. Whats a bash script? A text file?
2009-06-30T20:58:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	yeah. you'll also need to associate links (URLS) with that script instead of firefox directly. might help if you have someone around you can ask
2009-06-30T21:00:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	something like http://pastebin.com/m11399d0
2009-06-30T21:00:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	associate URLS with the script instead of Firefox directly? What do you mean?
2009-06-30T21:00:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	so when you click a link in e-mail, for example, it runs your script instead of firefox
2009-06-30T21:03:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	Do I copy and paste that text into a text file and put it somewhere? Never did a script before (nooooob)
2009-06-30T21:04:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	yes, then to make it executable do: chmod +x name_of_script
2009-06-30T21:04:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	you see the part in there that you need to replace with an actual folder name, right?
2009-06-30T21:05:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	still staring at "chmod"...
2009-06-30T21:12:00.000Z	sillyCEO		rickrest: Yes, I see that part where I enter my "ff userid" (whatever that is!)
2009-06-30T21:12:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	ok
2009-06-30T21:15:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	I substituted [your_ff_userid] with what I think is my profile folder name, and saved the whole thing as a text file called "script.sh". Now what?  What's chmod?
2009-06-30T21:16:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	chmod marks the script as executable so you can run it as a program
2009-06-30T21:18:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	OK, sorry for being an idiot, but when you say "do: chmod +x name_of_script" - what do you mean by "Do"?
2009-06-30T21:26:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	I mean run that command from a terminal/cmdline
2009-06-30T21:34:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	Oh, Duh. OK. So my script is called "killthefile.sh" so in terminal, I just write "chmod killthefile.sh" ?
2009-06-30T21:43:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	So I wrote "chmod killthefile.sh" in terminal, and it said "missing operand after 'killthefish.sh' Any ideas?
2009-06-30T21:43:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	that's not the command I said to run
2009-06-30T21:45:00.000Z	sillyCEO	rickest	Oh, I see. So how do I know what my permissions mask would be? My "666" ??
2009-06-30T21:46:00.000Z	rickest	sillyCEO	run the command I told you to run, peroid.
