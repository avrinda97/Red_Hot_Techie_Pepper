2011-05-29T12:33:00.000Z	bloodxii_		can anyone help me with a problem?
2011-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	bloodxii_		i have 2 computers 1 lapptop + a desktop. they are connected via cat6 lan cable and they will not connect at all to each other with auto eth0. is there some steps i should have done before hand? i have not configured anything
2011-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	bloodxii_		I asked twice before thus i asked if anyone could help with the porblem that i had prviously stated
2011-05-29T12:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	well do you have any sort of dhcp service running in the net?
2011-05-29T12:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	have you configured static ip adresses?
2011-05-29T12:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	autoassigned by what?
2011-05-29T12:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	if you dont have a dhcp service running i will become hard to have them autoassigned, right?
2011-05-29T12:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	how do you connect them to each other?
2011-05-29T12:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	that you already mentioned, but there has to be a switch or something somewhere, right?
2011-05-29T12:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	but if it works already...
2011-05-29T12:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	there has to be some device where your cat6 cables go into, right?
2011-05-29T12:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	in that case you need to set the computers toanip idrass that lays within the same subnet
2011-05-29T12:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	example
2011-05-29T12:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	by what are you trying to connect the computers, meaning samba, nfs, etc?
2011-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	in order to see files from one computer on another one you need to share them
2011-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	samba does that for you, in that caseyou can also see them on windows computers, nfs also does that, in that case you can NOT see them on windows computers

2011-05-29T12:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	this why "this"?
2011-05-29T12:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	bloodxii_	so stick to it then;)
