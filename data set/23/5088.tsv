2009-08-23T10:51:00.000Z	Zylstra555		Hello, I just had a ton of disk space disappear on me. My drive is now 95% full. What happened? Ubuntu 9.04
2009-08-23T10:51:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Um, could you dump the output of "df -h" in a pastebin?
2009-08-23T10:52:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Again, of you dump the output of df -h, we might be able to troubleshoot this issue better.
2009-08-23T10:55:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	It would appear that you have used up 96 gigs of space on the drive... Did you install anything, uh, major in the past few weeks?
2009-08-23T10:55:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	No, I didn't
2009-08-23T10:56:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	That just outputed a gigantic list
2009-08-23T10:57:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	if you install pastebinit, then run du -hsx /* | pastebinit, that should automatically pastebin that list so eli_ can have a look at it.
2009-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Did you, by chance, create a Machine in VirtualBox?
2009-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	No
2009-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Are you positive?
2009-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Because that can take up a *lot* of space.
2009-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I am positive
2009-08-23T11:16:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I haven't even opened Virtual Box yet, since installing
2009-08-23T11:16:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	Having worked in tech support, I feel the urge to ask you to open virtualbox and check, just incase. Sorry if that sounds a bit patronising; it's not meant to. :)
2009-08-23T11:16:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I work in tech support as well
2009-08-23T11:17:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	It appears VirtualBox has disapeared.
2009-08-23T11:17:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	Actually, anything clasified as "System Tools" gets lost after a while...
2009-08-23T11:18:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I noticed that TrueCrypt keeps disapearing after instalation.
2009-08-23T11:21:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	Oh, I know
2009-08-23T11:21:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I'm pretty sure there's nothing personal in there..
2009-08-23T11:22:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MenZa	I'll delete it afterwards to get rid of my email address.
2009-08-23T11:22:00.000Z	MenZa	Zylstra555	If not, it won't show in about 10 minutes. ;)
