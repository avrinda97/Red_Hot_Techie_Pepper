2004-11-09T09:28:00.000Z	cah		not if you are installing the 4.10 final
2004-11-09T09:29:00.000Z	cah		yes - but just do /dev/hda or /dev/ida/sc0d0
2004-11-09T09:31:00.000Z	cah		* sorry, just realised i meant /dev/ida/c0d0 above
2004-11-09T09:32:00.000Z	cah		I am leaving my server alone, just messing with the desktop
2004-11-09T09:33:00.000Z	cah		yeah, but it works nicely with my smart3 raid card
2004-11-09T09:33:00.000Z	cah		it's one of the few distros that installs from the cd.
2004-11-09T09:34:00.000Z	cah		hehe.
2004-11-09T09:35:00.000Z	cah		*uncomment
2004-11-09T09:36:00.000Z	cah		not bad neuro. lucky I have a 100mbps line ;-) (there's always someone with one bigger)
2004-11-09T09:37:00.000Z	cah		:)
2004-11-09T09:37:00.000Z	neuro|laptop	cah	well we have multiple gigabit out of this building, but 100 meg at the transit point :)
2004-11-09T09:37:00.000Z	cah		where are you neuro if you don't mind me asking? the IP smells of the UK, but we all know that in the UK 256kbps is usually the most ;-)
2004-11-09T09:38:00.000Z	cah	kensai	but the install is so painless you can afford to mess it up once or twice.
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	neuro|laptop	cah	sitting in a datacentre
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	cah		typical. so datacentres or unis or hospitals are the only ones who get decent connections.
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	neuro|laptop		no
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	neuro|laptop		there's more connectivity in the UK beyond BT ADSL
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	cah		neuro: you don't work for BT do you?
2004-11-09T09:39:00.000Z	neuro|laptop		nope
2004-11-09T09:40:00.000Z	cah		phew
2004-11-09T09:40:00.000Z	neuro|laptop		i.e. ADSL via LLU, leased lines, BT SDSL, LLU SDSL, LES, etc
2004-11-09T09:40:00.000Z	cah		'cos I just realised that my 217.37 number is BT and yours is quite close
2004-11-09T09:40:00.000Z	neuro|laptop	cah	do a whois on it and you'll see where i am :>
