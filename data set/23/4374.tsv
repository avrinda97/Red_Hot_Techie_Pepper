2011-09-06T20:49:00.000Z	akSeya		hi folks
2011-09-06T20:49:00.000Z	akSeya		i have a problem with atftpd here.. when I start it, syslog says atftpd: invalid IP address
2011-09-06T20:51:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	not knowing atftpd in particular, it sounds like you probably need to set a listening IP address in your config file. Can you paste your config file (as per the title instructions) and let me take a look?
2011-09-06T20:51:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	here you are http://paste.pocoo.org/show/471398/
2011-09-06T20:52:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	i tried to remove the multicast IP but didn't work..
2011-09-06T20:54:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	are you using it to do multicast?
2011-09-06T20:56:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	I just found a strange thing... i have this setting in /etc/default/atftpd ... in /etc/init.d/atftpd I have the USE_INETD and OPTIONS too
2011-09-06T20:57:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	i have tried tftpd and tftpd-hpa but they didn't work either
2011-09-06T20:59:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	it is
2011-09-06T21:00:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	I'll remove atftp and try tftpd-hpa again
2011-09-06T21:00:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	I may have just found a bug report that refers to this.
2011-09-06T21:02:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	init: tftpd-hpa main process (18794) killed by TERM signal
2011-09-06T21:03:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	yeap
2011-09-06T21:04:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	may I see your configuration file?
2011-09-06T21:04:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	mine is the default
2011-09-06T21:05:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	I'm using the standard options, but from /etc/default/tftpd-hpa, not inetd.
2011-09-06T21:10:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	which server are you currently running?
2011-09-06T21:11:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	here is it's config file http://paste.pocoo.org/show/471403/
2011-09-06T21:11:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	you read my mind.
2011-09-06T21:11:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	that is exactly what I have in mine, and it matches what netstat shows. What are you using as a client?
2011-09-06T21:14:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	have you made any changes to the default firewall?
2011-09-06T21:14:00.000Z	belarm	akSeya	Also, does the transfer work if you connect from the same host running the server?
2011-09-06T21:17:00.000Z	akSeya	belarm	no changes to the firewall... on the same machine it works
