2009-07-16T02:09:00.000Z	Guest82874		On my current network I can do only limited internet stuff like pings and IRC but, no apt-gets or browsing. Any idea as to what would cause this?
2009-07-16T02:09:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Something must be blocking HTTP connections / port 80?
2009-07-16T02:11:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	Thats what I thought but, wouldnt "ping google.com" use port 80 at least for the DNS lookup?
2009-07-16T02:11:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Nope, DNS uses a different port
2009-07-16T02:11:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	udp 53 for DNS :)
2009-07-16T02:12:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	does "apt-get" use port 80?
2009-07-16T02:13:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Yes, it uses standard HTTP connections on port 80, as far as I know
2009-07-16T02:14:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	How do I test this? I suppose I need one more port 80 thing and another non-port 80 thing
2009-07-16T02:16:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Is this on a network at work or something?
2009-07-16T02:16:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	In my win2k3 net admin class
2009-07-16T02:17:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	college not HS
2009-07-16T02:17:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Ask the instructor?
2009-07-16T02:17:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	It sounds like you might have to authenticate with some kind of proxy or something.
2009-07-16T02:17:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	ATM it is lecture time but, during break a few min ago I told him
2009-07-16T02:18:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	How would I confirm this?
2009-07-16T02:19:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Try this: wget http://www.google.com   then open the file that it saves - it should give you whatever the actual error code you're getting is, if you're getting something other than a timeout
2009-07-16T02:20:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	it stops when it gets to "Connecting to www.google.com|Some sort of IP|:80..."
2009-07-16T02:21:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	You probably have to be authenticated to the school's domain or something
2009-07-16T02:21:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	I have used my laptop here many times with very few problems
2009-07-16T02:22:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Without authenticating at all?
2009-07-16T02:24:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	IDK I would just click firefox and thats all
2009-07-16T02:25:00.000Z	firecrotch	Guest82874	Should you be... you know... messing with win2k3 in your win2k3 class? lol
2009-07-16T02:32:00.000Z	Guest82874	firecrotch	Yes, I would be but, I dont feel like triple booting my laptop so that means I need vmplayer
