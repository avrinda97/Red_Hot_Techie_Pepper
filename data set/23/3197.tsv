2008-09-02T01:05:00.000Z	opt1k		i got a problem, when i log in the normal way, in my sudo account which has enabled compiz i only get a blank white screen. this happened after the update via update manager, i don't know what's wrong so if anyone could help me. btw now i'm in the failsafe gnome... so any way to find out what's wrong with it?
2008-09-02T01:05:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	what graphics card? ATI?
2008-09-02T01:06:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	yes, but didn't have those problems till now
2008-09-02T01:06:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	did you notice if it was a kernel update?
2008-09-02T01:06:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	didn't had the time to look at details, as i did sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and went away
2008-09-02T01:07:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	hm ok..can you pastebin the contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-09-02T01:08:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	i'll do that now, give me a sec

2008-09-02T01:11:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	hm ok..why do you have a sudo account btw? :)
2008-09-02T01:12:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	you can try to reinstall the atidrivers perhaps..sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx  and then sudo depmod -a
2008-09-02T01:12:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	hah, it was kind of 2 accs, one for the games & apps, second for compiz & work
2008-09-02T01:12:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	o_O kk, will try, ty for help =)
2008-09-02T01:13:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	np :) im not sure if its will work but its worth a shot
2008-09-02T01:14:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	yeah, i hope it will.. and also i hope ati/community will improve that damn drivers =)
2008-09-02T01:14:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	indeed, I think community is catching up :)
2008-09-02T01:16:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	yep, but for now i prefer proprietary drivers, because regnum plays badly on open source =)
2008-09-02T01:33:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	are the 8.8 ATI drivers in repos?
2008-09-02T01:34:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	nope
2008-09-02T01:34:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	:'((
2008-09-02T01:34:00.000Z	askand	opt1k	you can install manually if you want http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide
2008-09-02T01:35:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	yep, did that once, i'm on 8.8 for a week now so maybe there's no point in reinstalling drivers
2008-09-02T01:37:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	a bit off topic, any good native linux mmorpgs besides regnum online (which is not that good actually)
2008-09-02T01:39:00.000Z	opt1k	askand	btw, how to uninstall manually installed ATi drivers?
