2008-02-13T05:04:00.000Z	ahave_AFK		can someone help me understand how to format my un used partitions?
2008-02-13T05:05:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	there are a bunch of ways. if youve already created the partitions you can just format em by doing a mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda4 or whatever
2008-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	basically you create partitions from the freespace then format those using mkfs.something to whavever format you want
2008-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	itll take alot of searching :)
2008-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	oi
2008-02-13T05:07:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	is it not straight forward?
2008-02-13T05:07:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	not sure how you format ntfs in linux id say youre better off letting windows do it. why do you want ntfs?
2008-02-13T05:07:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	i want ntfs so that i can easily access file storage on my linux box via samba
2008-02-13T05:08:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	typically if youre using samba you just format it a linux format as the client computer doesnt really care i think
2008-02-13T05:09:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	oh?...
2008-02-13T05:10:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	just make it ext3
2008-02-13T05:11:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	would it be easier to repartition?
2008-02-13T05:12:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	well. if you just want to create a samba share you dont really need a seperate partition at all just a directory
2008-02-13T05:13:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	maybe ive misunderstood what youre trying to do
2008-02-13T05:13:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	razordead, right now it is just unformatted space
2008-02-13T05:19:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	razordead, thanks. i think i got a grasp on it now
2008-02-13T05:35:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	I am using the liveCD partitioner.. what do i need to call my mount point?
2008-02-13T05:35:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	i think i just want to have it show up as a seperate drive.. my swap partition is in the way so i can not combine
2008-02-13T05:36:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	anything really youll just need to make sure you create the dir when you boot back to ubuntu like sudo mkdir /media/shared or something
2008-02-13T05:37:00.000Z	ahave_AFK	pike_	will it automaticly mount any ext3 partitions it sees?
2008-02-13T05:38:00.000Z	pike_	ahave_AFK	it should i think under like /media/hda3 or whatever but may not
