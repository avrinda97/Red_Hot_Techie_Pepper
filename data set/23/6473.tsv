2006-11-14T17:53:00.000Z	harm_		i installed vsftpd on my box but i cant upload to it.. i keep getting 550
2006-11-14T17:53:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	have you forwarded all the ports necissary?
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	yes ports are forwarded
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	which ones have you forwarded?
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	but somewhere in the config i think i need to edit it so that ftp login users have 777 permission?
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	21 :)
2006-11-14T06:00:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	you also need about a thousand other ports for passive mode
2006-11-14T06:00:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	to upload i need more ports forwarded?
2006-11-14T06:00:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	i believe thats what passive mode is for
2006-11-14T06:01:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	so which ports should i forward to be able to upload?
2006-11-14T06:02:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	i beleive the standard passive ports are 1024 - 65535.. but thats a few too many so i forwarded 60000 - 65535
2006-11-14T06:02:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	you sure i need to forward that many? and if i do i wont get 550 anymore?
2006-11-14T06:02:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	i'm nat terribly familiar with vsftpd... one moment
2006-11-14T06:03:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	i was having the same error, i believe
2006-11-14T06:04:00.000Z	harm_	itrebal	ok i hate forwarding more then the minimal amount of ports
2006-11-14T06:04:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	i know, me too
2006-11-14T06:06:00.000Z	itrebal	harm_	yes - but each part (separated by " ; ") on a new line
