2010-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	how did you set up ubuntu? anything non-default
2010-10-07T09:22:00.000Z	HeatherHacks	mickster04	I manually created my own partitions. There are two hard drives. One has a small 100mb partition used by win7, a larger win7 partition, then a 10gb / partition, then a larger /home partition, then a swap partion. The other hard drive is just one big ntfs partition
2010-10-07T09:22:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	try mount --bind /dev /mnt/new/dev in terminal and hten try and run it?
2010-10-07T09:22:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	try mount --bind /dev /mnt/new/dev in terminal and hten try and run it?

2010-10-07T09:24:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	hummm...is the / partition on the booting partition?
2010-10-07T09:25:00.000Z	HeatherHacks	mickster04	should be
2010-10-07T09:25:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	then i don't know
2010-10-07T09:33:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	oh?
2010-10-07T09:33:00.000Z	HeatherHacks	mickster04	both my hard drives are set to boot and my storage drive that shouldn't be set to boot is sda
2010-10-07T09:33:00.000Z	mickster04	HeatherHacks	oh ok
2010-10-07T09:34:00.000Z	HeatherHacks	mickster04	so I think grub is installed to the storage drive while windows' boot thing is on the other drive and the other drive is being booted. I'll try screwing with my bios to test this
