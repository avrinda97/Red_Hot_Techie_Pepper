2006-10-20T11:11:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	mount what hard drive
2006-10-20T11:12:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	are you talking about your windows hard drive?
2006-10-20T11:12:00.000Z	faith		my 200gb IDE hard drive just formatted it from NTFS to ext3
2006-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	do you have two seperate hard drives?
2006-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	faith		actually i have 3
2006-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	so what, the drive is completely blank and you just need to mount it to ubuntu?
2006-10-20T11:13:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	yeah you'd need to edit /etc/fstab
2006-10-20T11:14:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	"sudo nano -w /etc/fstab", then you'd have to add the drive there to mount
2006-10-20T11:15:00.000Z	faith	UKMatt	i have mounted it to /home/faith/hdd/   but how do i make it appear in Computer so i can access it from there?
2006-10-20T11:15:00.000Z	UKMatt		you have to mount it in a different place, faith
2006-10-20T11:15:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	here try this
2006-10-20T11:16:00.000Z	faith		:)
2006-10-20T11:17:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	actually I'm not sure how to mount that kind of file system, but go here, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_mount.2Funmount_Windows_partitions_.28FAT.29_manually.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read.2Fwrite , I'd imagine it's very similar with only a different term instead of vfat
2006-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	if you mount it in /media though it will show up right
2006-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	faith		ok thanks UKMatt :)
2006-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	UKMatt	faith	no problem, good luck
