2008-06-22T00:58:00.000Z	s0ullight	NetEcho	did you make a local network? lan?
2008-06-22T00:58:00.000Z	NetEcho	s0ullight	I can see my network shares that are shared off this box
2008-06-22T00:59:00.000Z	NetEcho		I just can't share a folder off my linux machine

2008-06-22T01:01:00.000Z	NetEcho		Does anyone know why Samba/Nautlius would say I don't have permission to create a usershare when I have it checked off under permissions?
2008-06-22T01:01:00.000Z	s0ullight	NetEcho	try under root access
2008-06-22T01:01:00.000Z	NetEcho	s0ullight	you mean change the permissions for the root user?
2008-06-22T01:02:00.000Z	s0ullight		do what you want under root user
2008-06-22T01:02:00.000Z	NetEcho	s0ullight	I can't even log into root
2008-06-22T01:02:00.000Z	NetEcho		unless you mean sudo nautilus
