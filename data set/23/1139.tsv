2010-09-01T15:36:00.000Z	adi11		thanks
2010-09-01T15:38:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	what brand mp3 player?
2010-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	do you see a setting somewhere on the player for the USB connection type?
2010-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| it does not appear on nautilus or rythmbox
2010-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	I meant on the player itself
2010-09-01T15:42:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	alright, does this player recognize in Windows?
2010-09-01T15:44:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| it so strange cause it says on the website i google that support all win macs and linux 2.4
2010-09-01T15:45:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	I know, I saw that part. I was wondering if maybe it was something with the player (e.g. needed a new battery, etc)
2010-09-01T15:46:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| someone gave it to me cause i wanted to use it like a track to move files and floder from one pc to another
2010-09-01T15:46:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	do you have gparted installed on your computer?
2010-09-01T15:49:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	alright, just a moment
2010-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	ok, so can you plug in your player can then run  lsusb   in a terminal?
2010-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| the player itself playes song ok with a a AAA battery or without a batter when connected from mini usb to a usb port via cable

2010-09-01T15:55:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	| ok, can you try running   sudo lsusb   and see if anything changes?
2010-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	usually that's not the case
2010-09-01T15:58:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	it looks like your player isn't being seen as connected
2010-09-01T15:58:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	you could try that
2010-09-01T16:00:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| nothing hapend
2010-09-01T16:01:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	ok. ubuntu comes with all the drivers and libraries needed to connect an mp3 player. Could you try a different usb cable?
2010-09-01T16:02:00.000Z	adi11	kpkarl	| i dont have another usb cable :(
2010-09-01T16:04:00.000Z	kpkarl	adi11	ok. unless there is a USB mode on the player itself, I'm not sure what it could be. If you ask someone else, im sure you'll find someone who will know what to do :)
