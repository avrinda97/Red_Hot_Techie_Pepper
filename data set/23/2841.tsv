2008-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	didn't get here for the beginning of the other user's issue, but it seems you have some audio knowledge?
2008-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	a little, but not much
2008-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	ah... my audio has decided to stop working after a kernel update.... starting to get rather pissed
2008-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	hda-intel?
2008-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	aye
2008-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	follow instructions above ^^
2008-11-05T21:42:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	will the compile script on ubuntuforums perform the same operations?
2008-11-05T21:42:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	not sure, never seen that script
2008-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	the above worked for me
2008-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	*sigh* that's simply unacceptable.... there are other distros out there that are reported to work perfectly with hda-intel
2008-11-05T21:44:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	i agree, many people have hda-intel, but as you should know, ubuntu's sound system needs serious overhauling, possibly the worst part about ubuntu, that and webcam support
2008-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	it is very disappointing.... I like the debian packaging systems, but these audio problems may yet drive me to Fedora (rpm = fail)
2008-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	rpm isn't a bad system.  But there are 10's of thousands more packages for debian.
2008-11-05T21:48:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	sound works ok if you buy non-onboard sound cards.  You get what you pay for
2008-11-05T21:49:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	sure... want to carry around a new sound card for my laptop for me?
2008-11-05T21:51:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	well.... I found the problem.... they didn't even bother to build the ko for hda-intel for the latest kernel build.... WTF?
2008-11-05T21:51:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	they didn't in hardy either, it's an old card btw
2008-11-05T21:52:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	hardware manufacturerers have been putting hda-intel in newer boards too because it works well with windows.
2008-11-05T21:52:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	yeah, my lappy is only a year old Inspiron 1520
2008-11-05T21:53:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	i have hda-intel in my desktop lol, And sigmatel's are in most inspirons
2008-11-05T21:53:00.000Z	koruptid	nikitis	which leads to questioning Ubuntu's sanity in allowing hda-intel support to be so poor when they are effectively screwing over a potentially HUGE number of adopters
2008-11-05T21:54:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	agreed, i've been saying that for nearly a year now.
2008-11-05T21:55:00.000Z	nikitis	koruptid	my hda-intel is is 3 years old.
