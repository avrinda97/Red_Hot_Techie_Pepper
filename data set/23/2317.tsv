2009-08-12T15:13:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	9.10 is supposed to do alot for driver issue
2009-08-12T15:14:00.000Z	indus	gogeta	well,i was wondering --- he used the latest drivers from ati site,how can it perform any better in 9.04,its the same driver
2009-08-12T15:15:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	9.04 drivers are slower
2009-08-12T15:15:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	a issue
2009-08-12T15:15:00.000Z	indus	gogeta	hmm !

2009-08-12T15:22:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	go look at the 2 slot pciw 2.0 gtx cards
2009-08-12T15:24:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	cuda
2009-08-12T15:24:00.000Z	indus	gogeta	cuda is not needed for average users
2009-08-12T15:25:00.000Z	indus	gogeta	all i want is good drivers
2009-08-12T15:25:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	lets you use the 270gps as paralle prossers and yes they can be used for games fallout 3 can use cuda
2009-08-12T15:25:00.000Z	indus	gogeta	270 gps?
2009-08-12T15:30:00.000Z	gogeta	indus	thats why they started putting cuda on gtx cards rather then just a cuda card being games are starting to use it
