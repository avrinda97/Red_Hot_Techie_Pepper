2008-12-03T02:45:00.000Z	sonoblaise		in rythm box, whenever I start the visualisation, it just exits without saying a word....  I get the same trouble trying to read a video DVD with totem (totem open and quit without saying anaything)
2008-12-03T02:47:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 does it also say nothing, when you start for example totem from a terminal?
2008-12-03T02:47:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	you mean starting totem and loading the DVD from the term??
2008-12-03T02:48:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 opening a terminal, "totem", and then totem will perhaps output some error messages, that go to /dev/null, if startet from the graphical menu
2008-12-03T02:49:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	ok, thanks!  I'm trying it and effectively I see the debug information on the terminal
2008-12-03T02:53:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	libdvdread give me a bunch of errors....  I dont understant,because i installed libdvdcss2
2008-12-03T02:55:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 hm, i don't know...  if that does not give enough information, you could try to run totem with strace to get a trace of all system calls and signals (those kill processes): "strace -f -o totem-trace totem"
2008-12-03T02:55:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 It gives me a lot of info, but i dont know what to do with it... pretty new to linux
2008-12-03T02:57:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 ok, then it's a bit difficult... if you want, you can try the strace thing and pastebin the resulting file "totem-trace"
2008-12-03T02:59:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 it'S something like CHECK_VALUE failed in ifo read
2008-12-03T03:00:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 that's from the output in the terminal, isn't it?
2008-12-03T03:00:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 yes
2008-12-03T03:01:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 the that will be file created if you run the strace command will contain the signal that is sent to the process, which is the reason why it crashes/ends suddenly. that may help to diagnose
2008-12-03T03:02:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 sorry, messed up with the text ;)
2008-12-03T03:03:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 next try: the file created with the strace command will contain the signal that is sent to the totem process. this signal is the reason why it crashes/ends suddenly. it may help to diagnose the problem
2008-12-03T03:03:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 good, doing the trace thing
2008-12-03T03:10:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 the trace thing seems to slow everything down... is it  normal?
2008-12-03T03:10:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 yes ;)
2008-12-03T03:11:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 you should try to crash the program as fast as possible to prevent the trace getting really huge...
2008-12-03T03:18:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 the trace is done
2008-12-03T03:27:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 ok, have you looked into it? if it is not too big, put it into pastebin, else only the last few hundred lines
2008-12-03T03:28:00.000Z	sonoblaise	oskar-	 have to leave...  job calls, but it's big  :p   so i'll see about it later
2008-12-03T03:28:00.000Z	oskar-	sonoblaise	 ok, bye
