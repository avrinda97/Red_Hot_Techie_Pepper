2006-09-05T15:19:00.000Z	mistform		I need some help getting JRE :(
2006-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	mistform		I did sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre
2006-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	mistform		and it can't find the package
2006-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	mistform		and YES, I've  already added the multiverse repository
2006-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	JoseStefan	mistform	did you do an update?
2006-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	mistform		yes
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	mistform		I just barely reformatted about.... 2 hrs ago
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	mistform		I've had some problems lately
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	mistform		I've used Codeblocks before
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	JoseStefan		can you paste your sources.list to the pastebin?
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	mistform		it's pretty good programming package
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	mistform	JoseStefan	are you talking to me?
2006-09-05T15:22:00.000Z	JoseStefan		yeah that was for you
2006-09-05T15:23:00.000Z	JoseStefan	mistform	i forget to add the names sometimes
2006-09-05T15:23:00.000Z	mistform		Lol, it's ok ;)
2006-09-05T15:25:00.000Z	mistform	JoseStefan	http://pastebin.ca/161339
2006-09-05T15:26:00.000Z	JoseStefan	mistform	you dont have multiverse enabled
2006-09-05T15:26:00.000Z	mistform		....
2006-09-05T15:27:00.000Z	mistform		the last time I copied the stuff from http://ubuntuguide.org it gave me a broken package in Gedit when it updated
2006-09-05T15:27:00.000Z	mistform		so it messed up my system, and that's why I just reformatted.... I've had to do it because of buffer I/O errors all the time
2006-09-05T15:27:00.000Z	JoseStefan	mistform	you should have the same components on all the repositories
2006-09-05T15:28:00.000Z	mistform		well it was fine until I upgraded with the Ubuntu Wiki's repositories
2006-09-05T15:28:00.000Z	JoseStefan	mistform	just enable them using synaptic, it's a lot easier
