2009-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	Samich		Hello, I am seeking help with BIOS error - no PSB or ACPI _PSS objects while trying to load up the live disc to install, havnt been able to find much on google.
2009-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	Samich		Where might I be able to find it in there?
2009-07-14T07:17:00.000Z	Samich		I took a look earlier, but didnt have any luck.
2009-07-14T07:17:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	& jmigel thats noacpi at boot prompt of live cd .. or grub bootline
2009-07-14T07:18:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	reboot
2009-07-14T07:19:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	at ubuntu screen press F6 and add noacpi to the end of the line at the bottom of the screen above the menu
2009-07-14T07:20:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	Ok, on my way to do that
2009-07-14T07:21:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	Then close the little menu and try to load it again?
2009-07-14T07:22:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	don't have to close the menu ... F6 noacpi enter ... ubuntu should load ... or we check what errors you get now .. ok
2009-07-14T07:23:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	It didn't load, or throw up any errors. Just added an X on the left of it.
2009-07-14T07:24:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	what iso are you using?
2009-07-14T07:25:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	I just downloaded it from the site, the 32-bit. Not exactly which it is or isnt.
2009-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	Ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
2009-07-14T07:30:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	In the F6 menu I have acpi=off/noapic/nolapic/edd=on/Free software only as options
2009-07-14T07:31:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	does that do anything for you?
2009-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	Whenever I select one it just adds an 'x' next to it, and then displays some code under the menu.
2009-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	have you run the test on the disk?
2009-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	When I try to do that it sends me to the same BusyBox, or whatever it was.
2009-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	With the same error.
2009-07-14T07:35:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	Currently there are several different versions of ubuntu ... the one you have is the latest desktop version. Which may have some bugs, more than others.. however there is also a alternate version of the installer that doesn't have a graphical environment ... simple to use Text based installer ... you will have to download it from Also available are the Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron LTS (Long Term Support) which has been more thouroughly
2009-07-14T07:36:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	So would you recommend I download an older version and go from there, or just go straight to the text-based installer?
2009-07-14T07:40:00.000Z	fccf	Samich	personally if you want stability I'd use 8.04 ... consider the text based installer and go from there
2009-07-14T07:41:00.000Z	Samich	fccf	Alright then, thanks for the help.
