2010-04-08T20:28:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	:)
2010-04-20T09:29:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	it's really nice once you get to know it
2010-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	Lucid discussion takes place in #ubuntu+1, feel free to head there
2010-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Well, I don't really have much to ask about... I'll just read the beta2 page on www.ubuntu.com
2010-04-27T03:44:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	they are different versions of Transmission
2010-04-27T03:46:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	Brimstones: speaking of -offtopic, this conversation would be better off completed there :)
2010-05-11T08:38:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	sure, you can
2010-05-11T08:38:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Thanks
2011-07-25T20:24:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	please don't do that in her.
2011-07-25T20:24:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Sorry.
2011-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	we don't take kindly to things like that, and other commands that can be dangerous to other users systems.
2011-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	Don't do it again.
2011-07-25T20:27:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	I got it, I got it, geez
2012-03-09T14:37:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Err, it's not dangerous... We're removing all files from trash, it's not the remove all from root
2012-03-09T14:37:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Well... It would be dangerous if you "cd /" first, naturally...
2012-03-09T14:37:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	just to clarify to anyone that may have joined late, running that from a terminal can be dangerous.
2012-03-09T14:37:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Oh, ok
2012-08-01T07:35:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Try "sudo modprobe netconsole", does it load?
2012-08-01T07:35:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	it loads, but it's not grabbing it's options I want from /etc/modprobe.d/netconsole if I load it that way.
2012-08-01T07:36:00.000Z	theadmin	h00k	Hm... I'm not too familiar with how modules work really, sorry
2012-08-01T07:36:00.000Z	h00k	theadmin	thanks anyway, I'll keep checking. I'm trying to decide if it's a kernel issue or with netconsole itself
