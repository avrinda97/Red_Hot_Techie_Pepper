2009-05-08T01:53:00.000Z	modmadmike	ikonia	true but there is a huge differeince for some games
2009-05-08T01:54:00.000Z	ikonia	modmadmike	in the same way there is on any software product, it depends how the applications use the "driver"
2009-05-08T01:54:00.000Z	modmadmike	ikonia	true but I have always had bad luck with intel cards
