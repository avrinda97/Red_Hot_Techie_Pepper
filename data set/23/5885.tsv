2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nexea		hey
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nexea		i just stopped in to say what a cool job the open source community is doing
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nexea		i just got into subversion and i love
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nexea		it
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nexea		i love open source now
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nexea		i mean.. i can completely screw up a file many different times and completely revert and compare changes
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nexea		and combined with TortoiseSVN with windows.. its even better
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nexea		oh, let me ask you guys.. while i am here
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nexea		what is the command line for the file explorer?
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Nexea	"nautilus"
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nexea		ohh i see
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nexea		warbo: and how do i elevate its power only for one operation? instead of doing sudo nautilus
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nexea		like access a file
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Nexea	Or "nautilus /wherever/you/want/to/visit"
2006-08-17T10:12:00.000Z	Nexea		hmm
2006-08-17T10:12:00.000Z	Warbo	Nexea	1) Use "gksudo nautilus" instead of sudo (sudo can screw up preferences' permissions) and 2) I don't know, just quit it after doing that one thing
2006-08-17T10:12:00.000Z	Nexea		ohh thank you warbo
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Nexea		never heard of gksudo
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Nexea		there  are a ton of commands i have noticed.. i guess that is the unix philosophy
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	Nexea	"ls /usr/bin"
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Nexea	Warbo	but thanks, i appreciate it
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Nexea		oh yeah, i know ls
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	Nexea	Most "commands" are in /usr/bin (they are files, ala the other part of the UNIX philosophy)
