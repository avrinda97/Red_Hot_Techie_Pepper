2011-01-21T02:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	it's a pretty impressive problem
2011-01-21T02:43:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	I am a linux noob and this hurts oCean done that. they only have speed values different
2011-01-21T02:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	well, create a completely clean new user
2011-01-21T02:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	*do not log in as this new user*
2011-01-21T02:47:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	ok
2011-01-21T02:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	go through each file in the new user's directory, and compare it with the one in your own directory
2011-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	There are a lot of files extra on my user. its been here for some months now. and the other user I just created works fine so why do I need to create yet another user?
2011-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	if that doesn't do it, then log in as the new user, and try all the new files that have been created
2011-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	so you have a totally completely clean new user, without any of the files created when you first log in
2011-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	hmm
2011-01-21T02:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	oooh, just thought of another way
2011-01-21T02:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	create a new user as before
2011-01-21T02:52:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	yes and ?
2011-01-21T02:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	copy the config files across one at a time from your current user, until the same fault shows up
2011-01-21T02:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	gut feeling is that it's probably in one of the .gconf directories
2011-01-21T02:53:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	I would better make my settings again on the new user
2011-01-21T02:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	well, thats' the other way...
2011-01-21T02:53:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	will I have to re install all softwares I installed on this user ?
2011-01-21T02:54:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	 btw does your xinput list show macintosh mouse button emulation?
2011-01-21T02:57:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	I found something perhaps I have an extra folder called mouse under peripherals in my current user
2011-01-21T02:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	maybe
2011-01-21T03:25:00.000Z	piyushmishra1	gordonjcp	do you remember the command to launch an application from terminal and return the control to the terminal and not kill it when the terminal closes
2011-01-21T03:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	piyushmishra1	screen, maybe?
