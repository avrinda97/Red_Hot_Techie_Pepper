2009-05-30T05:35:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox		[rww]: worked as a charm
2009-05-30T05:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	what on earth are you trying to run?
2009-05-30T05:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	don't do that square-bracket thing, it doesn't highlight my nick and it makes it hard to track when you reply
2009-05-30T05:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	I must admit, I haven't installed ET since installing jaunty
2009-05-30T05:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	fail installer is made of fail
2009-05-30T05:38:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	gordonjcp	you should say fail user is made of fail, as i am nooby lol
2009-05-30T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	no, it shouldn't require a package that old
2009-05-30T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	that gtk package was thoroughly obsolete even when ET was newly released
2009-05-30T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	what's really going to get on your wick is ET *requires* OSS audio
2009-05-30T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	and that has been obsolete for over a decade
2009-05-30T05:40:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	gordonjcp	there is a patch for that
2009-05-30T05:40:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	gordonjcp	google it that you WILL find it
2009-05-30T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	I needed to faff about with my soundcards to get it to work, ensuring that I had a cheap and crappy onboard sound card as the first device
2009-05-30T05:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnnyVbox	OSS is incapable of dealing with anything other than a single stereo soundcard, and quite comprehensively cacks itself if you try to use a modern card
