2005-12-25T09:34:00.000Z	bigman2		Hello
2005-12-25T09:34:00.000Z	bigman2		Does anyone know of an ftp i can setup on my ubuntu linux
2005-12-25T09:35:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	do you mean a server?
2005-12-25T09:36:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	 yes
2005-12-25T09:37:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	there are several. Try 'apt-cache search ftpd' or 'apt-cache search ftp server' and make your pick.
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	the netkit one (ftpd) worked out of the box for me.
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	no guarantees on security, though.
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	security isnt an issu how do i find the netkit one
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	apt-get install ftpd
2005-12-25T09:39:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	how will i configure this ?
2005-12-25T09:39:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	as I say, worked out of the box for me.
2005-12-25T09:40:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	do 'dpkg -L ftpd | grep etc' after installation to see the config files. Look at /usr/share/doc/ftpd/ for readme files and the like.
2005-12-25T09:55:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	well, I never use ftp anymore, I do file transfers with scp (ssh).
2005-12-25T09:44:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	what port is this ftp on
2005-12-25T09:45:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	'doesn't seem to work' isn't a helpful problem description
2005-12-25T09:46:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	it say connection refused when contact 127.0.0.1
2005-12-25T09:52:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	you'll have to install netkit-inetd as well.
2005-12-25T09:54:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	ftpd isn't very safe, but it runs from inetd, no daemon.
2005-12-25T09:54:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	'sudo apt-get install netkit-inetd' and you'll be fine.
2005-12-25T09:54:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	i havent anyother choice
2005-12-25T09:54:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	is that a question or a statement?
2005-12-25T09:57:00.000Z	soundray	bigman2	putty for windows will do that if you run sshd
2005-12-25T09:57:00.000Z	bigman2	soundray	 i dont think putty will
