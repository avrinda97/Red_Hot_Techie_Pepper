2009-07-22T16:29:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 do i put that in terminal? sorry i'm lil slow lol
2009-07-22T16:31:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Yes.  It might be more helpful to pastebin the output of just "mount" (no quotes)
2009-07-22T16:31:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	it did nothing but skip to next line
2009-07-22T16:32:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	for the original command, you mean?  Will you pastebin the output of "mount" (no quotes), please?
2009-07-22T16:33:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	so just terminal the mount alone ?
2009-07-22T16:36:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Okay, none of the partitions on your other hard drive are mounted right now.  Try mounting one "mkdir ~/foo && sudo mount /dev/sdb1 ~/foo"
2009-07-22T16:38:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	If that works, you should be able to access the files on the first partition of your second hard drive be looking in /home/dj/foo .  (if you reboot, it'll go away, though.)
2009-07-22T16:39:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 will I have to do that every boot ?
2009-07-22T16:40:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	You can set it to mount somewhere automatically.
2009-07-22T16:40:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Either there, or somewhere else.  Most people mount things in /mnt or /media, so you might want to tell it to mount there.
2009-07-22T16:40:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Yes.
2009-07-22T16:41:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Sorry, I wasn't clear: /mnt/something or /media/something : )
2009-07-22T16:41:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	cool : )
2009-07-22T16:42:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 I dunno what you mean on how to do that but its all cool thanks for help so far,I can copy what you gave me in a notepad and use it that way for now
2009-07-22T16:42:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Do you want help getting it to mount automatically?
2009-07-22T16:42:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 I dont know why but thunar is the only file manager that dont have that mounted
2009-07-22T16:42:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 if you got the time I would love it
2009-07-22T16:46:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	If you install it with apt-get or synaptic, it ought to install everything it needs to run.
2009-07-22T16:46:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	It might be hard to get ubuntu to use pcman instead of thunar by default, though
2009-07-22T16:47:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	Say something to me in PM, please?  My IRC client's weird and I sometimes can't just /msg people.
2009-07-22T17:23:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 thanks again for all your help ima reboot and get my graphics driver in use
2009-07-22T17:40:00.000Z	djnomad	onexused	 I dunno why but my panels disappeared on me
2009-07-22T17:41:00.000Z	onexused	djnomad	That's a strange problem.  Maybe someone else on the channel can help you.  But I'm logging off to go to bed now.
