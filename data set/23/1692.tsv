2009-11-24T21:45:00.000Z	Mand0		point me to a programming channel please. new to IRC
2009-11-24T21:47:00.000Z	Mand0		C++ , using wxWidgets on Ubuntu.
2009-11-24T21:49:00.000Z	Mand0		thanks. Programming is the only thing tying me to the window ;)
2009-11-24T21:49:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	you can also try the anjuta channel to give you pointeers on how to start
2009-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- it's pretty good
2009-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- It has glade integration
2009-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	I can also strongly recommend MonoDevelop
2009-11-24T21:51:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	i'll give it atry.
2009-11-24T21:51:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	does it support C++?
2009-11-24T21:52:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- not really, it's built for C#, but if you're agnostic about the language you use, it's pretty good
2009-11-24T21:54:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- I've written a lot of C++ apps with GUI. The best way is to use gtkmm with glade
2009-11-24T21:55:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- The learning curve is rather steep in the gtkmm + C++ + automake path
2009-11-24T21:56:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- the last metapackage gives you all the stuff you need to build gnome apps - libs, docs, ides, etc
2009-11-24T21:56:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	: ur opinion on this... if I want to stop using wind0ws then I should not care about porting my apps to it. right?
2009-11-24T21:57:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- porting is too much trouble. I used to write C++ but now I'm stuck on C#, which should be slightly easier to port if that was your legacy codebase
2009-11-24T21:58:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	how similar is C# to VB
2009-11-24T21:58:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- In fact, I would suggest first building simple gnome apps before trying to port. BEcause you can always get the platform independent code on linux
2009-11-24T21:58:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- not at all, except in some aspects. C# is somewhat like C++ with a better stdlib, delegate support and other benefits
2009-11-24T21:59:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- Plus, you'll never have to deal with pointers again :)
2009-11-24T21:59:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	I'm starting to learn C++. so starting to learn something else won't be a prob.
2009-11-24T22:00:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- I feel it might be a more enjoyable experience working with that stack. I personally recommend it over some experience on all three sides (C++/C#/PyGtk)
2009-11-24T22:01:00.000Z	antileet	Mand0	- I gotta get going, message me if there's anything I can help you with. The gnome devel channels might offer more help than I can though
2009-11-24T22:13:00.000Z	Mand0	antileet	: thanks for your tips.
