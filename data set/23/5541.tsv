2006-11-10T09:33:00.000Z	santeria		clujo, i put in all my stuff to hopefully get my graphics card to work with ubuntu, and i restarted the ocmputer and i didnt get the normal vertical colered line pattern, it brought up a menu that was messed up around the edges and said that the x server wasnt set up correctly
2006-11-10T09:34:00.000Z	santeria		oh lol
2006-11-10T09:34:00.000Z	santeria		ok
2006-11-10T09:35:00.000Z	santeria		jorden_u, you helped me last night some, i put in all my stuff to hopefully get my graphics card to work with ubuntu, and i restarted the ocmputer and i didnt get the normal vertical colered line pattern, it brought up a menu that was messed up around the edges and said that the x server wasnt set up correctly
2006-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	santeria		why does ubuntu hate geforce cards?
2006-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	santeria		funny
2006-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	I don't remember your problem from before, have you tried: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and choosing nvidia ?
2006-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	I remember now.
2006-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	Did it ever get past: sudo apt-get update?
2006-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	Couldn't hurt.
2006-11-10T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	NO.
2006-11-10T09:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	To restart type: sudo reboot , but there is one more command you can try ( although rebooting will have the same effect )
2006-11-10T09:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart ( to see if your graphics work )
2006-11-10T09:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	Restart without the install CD in the drive.
2006-11-10T09:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	:(
2006-11-10T09:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	What is the output of: glxinfo | grep renderer ( should only be one line ) ?
2006-11-10T09:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	glxinfo | grep renderer
2006-11-10T10:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	What do you mean include?
2006-11-10T10:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	No, that was the correct command, it just didn't give the output I expected.
2006-11-10T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	Run glxinfo and see if you can tell where it says what driver you are using.
2006-11-10T10:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	Yes.
2006-11-10T10:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	To be clear, you only type "glxinfo"
2006-11-10T10:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	santeria	At this point I am stumped, try #ubuntu-xgl ( I will be there also )
