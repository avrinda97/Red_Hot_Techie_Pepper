2010-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	oddtod	name_	it seems like your menu file prlly got hosed up. i don't remember where that file is i thought it was in /boot/grub/menu*.lst
2010-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	oddtod		but i can't seem to find mine
2010-10-28T09:01:00.000Z	oddtod	name_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 that is what you're looking for. There should be an area on there discussing the differences between grub 1 and grub 2

2010-10-28T09:01:00.000Z	name_		Grub 2 uses uses boot/grub/grub.cfg. " i reinstalled grub several times. i now think it could be kernel issue , but i have only latest one on grub, and dont know how to install older ones
2010-10-28T09:02:00.000Z	name_		i thought it was in a same line..
2010-10-28T09:03:00.000Z	oddtod	name_	yeah if you don't care about the install just blow it away and reinstall. A fresh install shouldn't matter
2010-10-28T09:04:00.000Z	name_	oddtod	there is nothing too important on my ubuntu partition, yet i would like to see what programs i have installed so that i can reinstall ones i liked, i didnt memorized them, and also i might check my download folder, but i can do that from livecd i am in now
2010-10-28T09:05:00.000Z	name_	oddtod	thing is, i wanna know how to fix this stuff , it is a good for learning
2010-10-28T09:06:00.000Z	oddtod	name_	if its not a fresh install meaning you had a machine that was working it broke and then you wiped the disk and reinstalled. then most likely grub broke you then reinstalled grub(fixed grub) now need to adjust the settings of the boot file to fix this.
2010-10-28T09:08:00.000Z	oddtod	name_	do a paste bin of your /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2010-10-28T09:08:00.000Z	name_	oddtod	it is an old install "installed day when 10.10 came out". grub2 i reinstalled several times, and i fixed any problem partition table might have, or winxp ntfs partition errors. i also removed from fstab all ntfs partitions i had there for autoload
