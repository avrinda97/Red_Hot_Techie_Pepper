2009-07-04T11:08:00.000Z	_ayn_		quick question, where is the kernel located in Jaunty? i need to reboot but i dont see anything in /, i want to make sure the kernel is in there
2009-07-04T11:09:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	check /boot
2009-07-04T11:09:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	i checked, there is a memtest86+.bin, is that it?
2009-07-04T11:10:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	it's a really small file though
2009-07-04T11:10:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	there should be vmlinuz, initrd etc.
2009-07-04T11:10:00.000Z	_ayn_		nothing
2009-07-04T11:11:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	i want to bounce the instance coz motd saids so, i did an apt-get upgrade and i want to bounce it, but it doesnt look like the kernel is there, how weird
2009-07-04T11:11:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	sudo apt-get install linux
2009-07-04T11:12:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	dpkg -l | grep -i linux didnt show anything
2009-07-04T11:12:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	is it possible that apt deleted the kernel?
2009-07-04T11:13:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	hard to believe
2009-07-04T11:13:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	maybe coz this is xen so there is no kernel? im confused... this is an ec2 instance
2009-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	it'd be a good idea to ask the others
2009-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	messed up
2009-07-04T11:15:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	another slicehost instance we have doesnt have shit in /boot either
2009-07-04T11:15:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	probably the new ubuntu standard
2009-07-04T11:15:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	weird thing that i have no idea where the f it is lol
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	kindda reluctant to bounce it when i dont know where the kernel is u know :)
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	haha
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	we're gonna bounce the slicehost instance, coz we dont use it
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	_ayn_	dragon_	and see if it come sup
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	dragon_	_ayn_	yea that's a good idea
