2006-05-14T14:18:00.000Z	phyzome		Alright, so... about upgrading to dapper. "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" just said "nothing to do!"
2006-05-14T14:19:00.000Z	phyzome		Yeah, didn't work for me.
2006-05-14T14:19:00.000Z	phyzome		Which was surprising.
2006-05-14T14:19:00.000Z	NoUse	phyzome	then you missed a step :-)
2006-05-14T14:19:00.000Z	NoUse	phyzome	did you update your sources.list?
2006-05-14T14:20:00.000Z	phyzome		Ah-hah!
2006-05-14T14:20:00.000Z	phyzome		I was surprised that was not mentioned in the instructions.
2006-05-14T14:20:00.000Z	phyzome		Probably should be.
2006-05-14T14:20:00.000Z	phyzome		And where is the canonical sources list for dapper?
2006-05-14T14:21:00.000Z	NoUse		!tell phyzome about repos
2006-05-14T14:21:00.000Z	NoUse		blaze try symlinking /var/www to somewhere else
2006-05-14T14:22:00.000Z	NoUse		thug no
2006-05-14T14:23:00.000Z	phyzome		So, there is no command to upgrade?
2006-05-14T14:23:00.000Z	phyzome		I have to explicitly modify sources.list?
2006-05-14T14:23:00.000Z	NoUse		thug fat32 has both
2006-05-14T14:23:00.000Z	NoUse	phyzome	the instructions tell you to use update-manager
2006-05-14T14:23:00.000Z	phyzome	Seveas	I know, it didn't work for me.
2006-05-14T14:24:00.000Z	NoUse		blaze after you changed the file, did you stop and start apache?
2006-05-14T14:25:00.000Z	phyzome		Right. Both tell me that my system is up to date.
2006-05-14T14:25:00.000Z	phyzome		yeah
2006-05-14T14:26:00.000Z	NoUse	phyzome	how carefully did you read the instructions?
2006-05-14T14:26:00.000Z	phyzome		I thought fairly carefully.
2006-05-14T14:26:00.000Z	NoUse	phyzome	it says the update manager will initially tell you that your system is up to date but that you must click "check" in order to upgrade
