2010-06-28T16:46:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose		is it possible to mount a dump of an ntfs filesystem made using dd?
2010-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 yes. it should be possible,
2010-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	  is it a dump of a whole drive? or just a single partition?
2010-07-28T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	its doable.. i  just dont recall how/where  :) I normally just disable plymouth.
2010-09-18T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 some people where her yestarday with the same problem. No idea on a fix. Other then suggest checking the forums.
2010-09-18T15:57:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	it suggests to me  xf86-input-wacom. That's installed but nothing happens :/
2010-09-18T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 means very little to me. :) i looked at thse tablets befor.. and recalled people having issues with them. so i never bought one.
2010-09-18T15:58:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	ok. thanks anyway  :)
2010-09-23T22:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 you can always install gparted on the live cd and partiion however you want.. or use fdisk/cfdisk.. or what exactly are youy trying to do?
2010-09-23T22:54:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	install to an already existing partition
2010-09-23T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 i do that all the time.. but the installer does try to format the / ,  but i use premade/formated  partitions for /home/ and extra /media/datastuff  all the time
2010-09-23T22:56:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	ah. thanks, that might help :)
2010-10-16T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 it seems to be working here.
2010-10-16T13:50:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	O.o it suddenly works for me too xD
2010-10-16T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 ive noticed on some mice.. the middle clicks can be flakey
2010-10-16T13:51:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	the mouse itself is perfectly fine. thanks all the same :)
2010-10-16T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 some ive seen let you side scroll. I have a hard time clicking.. and not sidescrolling with them
2010-10-16T13:52:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	I have a perfectly normal vertical scrollwheel that's easy to click with :)
2010-10-16T13:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	  PEBKAC then? :)
2011-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	I try to start another instance, but it just "bumps" the first one. Yes, I do have 2 drives.
2011-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 check its options, command line options
2011-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	Dr_Willis	I can't find anything... Is it possible to "trick" it into making a second instance?
2011-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	An_Ony_Moose	 no idea. could be its  just not progremad to allwo it.
