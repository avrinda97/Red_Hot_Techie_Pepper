2012-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	clausen		I can't get foreign languages working in the latest beta...
2012-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	clausen		the gnome-language-support option doesn't let me use Portuguese
2012-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	clausen		(even though it says I installed it already, when I go to Add/Remove languages)
2012-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	skel	clausen	did you switch over to it?
2012-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	clausen	skel	I can't
2012-04-17T02:09:00.000Z	clausen	skel	it's greyed out
2012-04-17T02:10:00.000Z	skel	clausen	does it show up in locale -a ?
2012-04-17T02:10:00.000Z	clausen	skel	everything shows up in locale -a
2012-04-17T02:11:00.000Z	skel	clausen	have you tried using update-locale LANG=<whatever> LC_MESSAGES=POSIX ?
2012-04-17T02:12:00.000Z	clausen	skel	$ update-locale LANG=pt_BR LC_MESSAGES=POSIX*** update-locale: Error: invalid locale settings:  LANG=pt_BR LC_MESSAGES=POSIX
2012-04-17T02:13:00.000Z	skel	clausen	what about pt_BR.UTF8 ?
2012-04-17T02:13:00.000Z	clausen	skel	yes, that one works, but it wants root privileges
2012-04-17T02:13:00.000Z	skel	clausen	hmm weird
2012-04-17T02:14:00.000Z	skel	clausen	I think it just sets those env variables and re-inits the environment so you don't have to logout /in. not positive on that though
2012-04-17T02:15:00.000Z	clausen	skel	ah, ok
2012-04-17T02:16:00.000Z	clausen	skel	this gives me portuguese help:  LANG=pt_BR.UTF8 ls --help
2012-04-17T02:16:00.000Z	clausen	skel	what I'm really interested in is being able to use ibus for portuguese, hindi, and other scripts
2012-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	skel	clausen	yeah you could just try setting LANG=pt_BR.UTF8 in your .bashrc but I don't know if the Window manager will pick that up
2012-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	skel	clausen	I'm not familiar with ibus, whats that?
2012-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	skel	clausen	is that like a replacement for dbus?
2012-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	clausen	skel	it's a keyboard entry method
2012-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	clausen	skel	no, it's not related to dbus
2012-04-17T02:18:00.000Z	skel	clausen	ah ok
