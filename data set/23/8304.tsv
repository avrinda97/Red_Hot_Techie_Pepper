2004-11-03T10:55:00.000Z	TerminX		never mind then
2004-11-03T10:55:00.000Z	TerminX		:D
2004-11-03T10:56:00.000Z	TerminX		one time my burner spit out a bunch of coasters so I got the blowtorch and made this weird modern art out of them
2004-11-03T10:56:00.000Z	TerminX		;)
2004-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	TerminX		I always liked gcombust for burning
2004-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	TerminX		too bad it's still gtk1
2004-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	TerminX		;_;
2004-11-03T10:59:00.000Z	TerminX		the "smart" way would be to just use apt
2004-11-03T10:59:00.000Z	TerminX		;p
2004-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	TerminX		uh, synaptic and aptitude are both front ends for apt
2004-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	They share libapt
2004-11-03T10:52:00.000Z	TerminX	brettcar	just not art like what was there a week ago
2004-11-03T11:00:00.000Z	TerminX	brettcar	you mean apt-get dist-upgrade
2004-11-03T11:00:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	No I mean aptitude dist-upgrade
2004-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	Nope
2004-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	But neither accesses apt, the program suite, itself.
2004-11-03T11:02:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	And aptitude/synaptic/apt-get all use slightly different upgrade methods... aptitude will be nicer with recommendations than apt-get for example
2004-11-03T11:02:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	I already dispelled the rumor that they were equivalents but the dist-upgrade is closest to synaptic's smart.
2004-11-03T11:04:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	No packages you have installed (or are being uninstalled) have dependences on those packages
2004-11-03T11:05:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	It doesn't take into account your psychological dependencies for tetrinet ;)
2004-11-03T11:05:00.000Z	TerminX	brettcar	well, I don't use gtetrinet
2004-11-03T11:05:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	Install gpdf explicitly then
2004-11-03T11:05:00.000Z	brettcar	TerminX	And it'll stop bothering you
