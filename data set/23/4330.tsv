2007-09-14T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	that something you might find in bugs.launchpad.net . Not very common probably
2007-09-14T05:46:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	k
2007-09-14T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	or maybe something's on the forums
2007-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	doesn't look like very many use wakeonlan/etherwake
2007-09-14T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	maybe you should file a bug, it might not get addressed right away (release crunch)
2007-09-14T05:48:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	yeah.
2008-07-10T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	some of the newer dvd's have an improved usage of the encryption
2008-07-10T10:12:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	so only time will fix this ?
2008-07-10T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=652528
2008-07-10T10:14:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	thanks  looking.
2008-07-10T10:22:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	thanks for the heads up  on the new encryption/copy_protection
2008-07-10T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	no i386 is a subset of i686
2008-07-10T10:40:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	i'm on dapper.
2008-07-10T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	shouldn't make a diff
2008-07-10T10:41:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	ok.  just noticed that the arch type differed...   didn't want to cause a conflict there.
2008-07-10T10:42:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	sn9_ actually had the truest answer, anyway :)
2009-01-02T02:51:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	right, he just won't have acceleration. Good catch
2009-01-10T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	_2	inadvertently correct, in a way.
2009-01-10T09:53:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	i know, that's why i said "sorry"
2009-01-10T10:45:00.000Z	_2	nickrud	yes i saw it,  i lag.
