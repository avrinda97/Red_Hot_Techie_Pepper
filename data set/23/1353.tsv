2010-05-07T04:39:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	what are you looking for?
2010-05-07T04:39:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	you can install ubuntu on to a usb disk
2010-05-07T04:39:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	run it live off usb boot. Or if you are looking to install an image of a hard drive or ghost type tools then you want clonezilla
2010-05-07T04:39:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	we have like 200 keyboardless machines and i'd like a light weight <2gb distro, and i'll customize it to have a 'ssh tunnel' icon  then can press via the touchscreen.
2010-05-07T04:40:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	yeah you can do that with ubuntu.
2010-05-07T04:40:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	what do you mean by ssh tunnel though? what do you want them to use the tunnel for?
2010-05-07T04:40:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	well i want them to click on something that will create an ssh tunnel so i can get access to their system
2010-05-07T04:40:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	there are tons of distros that would fill your needs though.
2010-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	true
2010-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	ahh what about reverse connecting with vnc
2010-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	they wouldn't have to forward any ports just you would on your end. then you can support the machine like you were sitting at the desktop
2010-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	it does that too, sets up an ssh tunnel for ssh (port 22) and vnc(5900)
2010-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	well you normally would just forward vnc over ssh
2010-05-07T04:42:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	that is what i mean
2010-05-07T04:42:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	yeah can be done with ubuntu but I wouldn't really consider ubuntu light weight although lucid is really fast off usb
2010-05-07T04:43:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/ looks good
2010-05-07T04:44:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	now thats lightweight
2010-05-07T04:45:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	I would still check otu lucid though and see how fast it is for you. It may boot faster than dsl with all the new improvements
2010-05-07T04:45:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	true.. but with the lucid live cd, is it really just an install cd+live cd and when you boot up you choose either install mode or live cd mode?
2010-05-07T04:51:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	yeah you click try or install
2010-05-07T04:51:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	you can add casper to it so it will save settings like apps you install etc..
2010-05-07T04:52:00.000Z	Theravadan	histo	the people using this are really not brright so at the 'try /install' option, they're already lost .. i'll try dsl
2010-05-07T04:52:00.000Z	histo	Theravadan	i'm sure you can get rid of that menu
