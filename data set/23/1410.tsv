2010-04-14T03:47:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine
2010-04-14T03:49:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2010-04-14T03:50:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	als check in System > Administration > Software Sources and make sure universe is enabled
2010-04-14T03:54:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	What version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-04-14T03:54:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	click on Systme > Admin > Software Sources
2010-04-14T03:55:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	make sure that universe is checkboxed
2010-04-14T03:55:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	was it unchecked before?
2010-04-14T03:57:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	okay now you should be able to just sudo apt-get install wine in a terminal or you can use Applications > add/remove programs to install the wine package.
2010-04-14T03:57:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	or synaptic
2010-04-14T03:57:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	the issue was the repository where wine is located wasn't enabled
2010-04-14T04:05:00.000Z	nimbiotics	histo	=> it worked like  a charm, thx a bunch!!!
2010-11-02T06:43:00.000Z	histo	nimbiotics	there are plenty of them. If you search the software center you will get many results
2010-11-02T06:43:00.000Z	nimbiotics	histo	thanks
