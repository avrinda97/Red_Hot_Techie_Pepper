2008-07-11T21:42:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		anyone know of a fix for samba in gutsy?
2008-07-11T21:42:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		when i map a windows share it gives and error, then sort of maps it twice?
2008-07-11T21:43:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		anyone aware of the broken samba in ubuntu 8.04?
2008-07-11T21:44:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		it happens on every install of gutsy i've done
2008-07-11T21:45:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	what errors are you getting?
2008-07-11T21:47:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	if it's working sometimes but not others you probably have configuration issues with your samba setup.
2008-07-11T21:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	you just said : when i try to open it it sort of mounts a second time
2008-07-11T21:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	 I think that is a nautilaus bug and has been reported.  But shares should work.  Samba isn't that issue.
2008-07-11T21:50:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	ok
2008-07-11T21:51:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	I haven't explored it since it doesn't affect me.  But check out the ubuntu bug forums.  Unop's suggestions will probably avoid this give it a shot.
2008-07-11T21:54:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	irrelevent :)
2008-07-11T21:55:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	how so?
2008-07-11T21:57:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	well the mount will be done, it will fail.  Once the connection is up tho it should work fine.  This is really basic networking, I do not see any problem with the suggestions.
2008-07-11T21:57:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	well then you're stuck doing it with nautilaus.
2008-07-11T22:01:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	how do i get that>
2008-07-11T22:04:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	you may have to upgrade the nautilus manually on gutsy...
2008-07-11T22:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	using deb package manager, sorry I'm not that versed in it.
2008-07-11T22:07:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	is there a .deb for it then?
2008-07-11T22:10:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	I don't know I don't play that way :)  If I was you, I'd dist-upgrade to hardy.  If I didn't want to do that (and I really would), I'd stick to using fstab to avoid nautilus.  But since neither are to your liking....I'd get the deb for nautilus and manually install it.  (this I wouldn't do).
2008-07-11T22:10:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	why do you think the .ded route is a bad idea?
2008-07-11T22:11:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DieseL`nix	what difference would my opinion make ;)
2008-07-11T22:12:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Jeruvy	you seem pretty against it, I'm sure you have a good reason? lol I don't want to do it if it's going to bugger something else up
