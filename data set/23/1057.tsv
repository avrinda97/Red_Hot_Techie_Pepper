2010-10-04T17:19:00.000Z	manfredrasta		anybody can help me with my video? It is slow
2010-10-04T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	do you mean video playback, or the desktop itself...
2010-10-04T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	ok can you use: http://pastie.org   to give the output of:  uname -a; lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf
2010-10-04T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	you should have said youtube was slow instead of "video", its waaay clearer
2010-10-04T17:21:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	sorry
2010-10-04T17:21:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	im using lubuntu
2010-10-04T17:21:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	but i think also my desktop could be faster
2010-10-04T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	we'll see
2010-10-04T17:22:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	are those commands also valid for lubuntu?
2010-10-04T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	yes, they will work on any linux, the only difference between lubuntu and ubuntu are the default apps, you dont have some different OS
2010-10-04T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	waiting for the output dude....
2010-10-04T17:26:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	done: http://pastebin.com/te21Jsdj
2010-10-04T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	the command was ONE long command, please don't break commands up, you may do it wrong and damage your OS
2010-10-04T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	we have the data we need though
2010-10-04T17:28:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	sorry didnt know. im new
2010-10-04T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	that's why it was all on one line, so you can copy the whole lot and paste it as ONE in terminal :)
2010-10-04T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	sudo apt-get --purge remove  flashplugin-installer ; sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2010-10-04T17:32:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	done, should i paste you the result. Seems no errors
2010-10-04T17:33:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	only on the 4th line says: E: couldnt find package  flashplugin-installer
2010-10-04T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	sure use http://pastie.org again
2010-10-04T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	is that on the remove or the install?
2010-10-04T17:35:00.000Z	manfredrasta	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/eZveZWnt
2010-10-04T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	manfredrasta	maybe the repo is being upgraded in some way, you could manually download the deb from http://packages.ubuntu.com   maybe
