2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	kestas		universe should be added by default
2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	kestas		yeah goofrider but it should be done by default
2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	kestas		it *should*
2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	kestas		I mean why the hell not?
2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	kestas		everyone activates it
2005-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	because it is unsupported
2005-05-22T14:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	because there's a commitment to support main
2005-05-22T14:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	and none to support universe
2005-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	it's not that hard to activate universe in synaptic. the idea about asking during install is not too bad, though i get the idea one wants fewer questions, not more ;)
2005-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	the difference is the commitment by ubuntu
2005-05-22T14:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	there's a lot of software, and a line has to be drawn somewhere
2005-05-22T14:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	you are familiar with the idea of trade-offs? this is the result. it's hardly *that* awkward
2005-05-22T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	more questions bad
2005-06-23T11:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	apt-cache search reveals no such package (presume that's what you wanted to know)
2005-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	kestas	HappyFool	do you have universe enabled?
2005-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	main + res + uni + multi
2005-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	you tried packages.ubuntu.com ?
2005-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	that site says no such package in any ubuntu repository
2005-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	kestas	HappyFool	hmm okay guess Ill have to stick with my manually installed package then
2005-07-28T06:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	that sounds a bit backwards. Do you perhaps mean can linux use winmodems ?
2005-07-28T06:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	i don't think there is such a thing as a "linmodem" that is not really a winmodem
2005-07-28T06:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	if you know of one, i'd be curious to know what is is
2005-11-18T15:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	kestas	the other way around; my impression (perhaps incorrect) is that gentoo is not for novices
