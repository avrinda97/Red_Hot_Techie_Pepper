2010-12-17T15:21:00.000Z	pk__		i have a shell account but i cant install anything on the server....is there any method to use a software of my choice on it?
2010-12-17T15:22:00.000Z	pk__		no
2010-12-17T15:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	software like for web or for adding packages to your system?
2010-12-17T15:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	what is the application you want to install?
2010-12-17T15:25:00.000Z	pk__	sacarlson	ctorrent
2010-12-17T15:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	that looks kind of old,  but you might be able to compile it in you local bin space and run it.  the other problem is if the server will let you out on the ports that it uses
2010-12-17T15:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	I tried doing something on the linux godaddy.com server and found that they filtered all but port 80
2010-12-17T15:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	if the system has ruby or python or something you could do some simple test to see if ports are even open
2010-12-17T15:31:00.000Z	pk__	sacarlson	even if the ports are open there are chances that they have logged all server sockets...no?
2010-12-17T15:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	yes I would think so since most have bandwidth limits on customers.
2010-12-17T15:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	if I was the admin I would just make it not posible to setup a torrent on the sever by filter all but 80 and 443
2010-12-17T15:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	try it if it works and they get mad tell them you didn't know
2010-12-17T15:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	have a backup sever running on your home system in the event they close you down
2010-12-17T15:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	I found something to test your port to see if they can be opened to listen with the command  netcat
2012-03-22T09:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	sound like you need to modify the default and timeout in grub
2012-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	pk__	sacarlson	we have set the timeout to 2 and default is set to what should be booted
2012-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	pk__	sacarlson	cant we remove this grub thing and then boot ubuntu directly
2012-03-22T09:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	I was looking for the gui I use to modify my grub setting but haven't found the one I normaly use yet but see this one http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-change-grub-settings-with-guitools.html
2012-03-22T09:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	this is what I was looking for https://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/grub-customizer
2012-03-22T09:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	oh if it boots normal with a normal shutdown then maybe it's a bios setting, or sometimes with flash shutdown the system will get into an unknown state, not fully reset but corrupted mem state
2012-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	pk__	sacarlson	when we go to that place there is just a black screen waiting for us..we just press enter and booting proceeds further
2012-03-22T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	not sure then,  and it sounds like it's intermitent
2012-03-22T09:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	pk__	might be more stable with battery backup on it, even if battery goes to dead it will provide a timely restart
