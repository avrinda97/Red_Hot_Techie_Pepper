2007-10-13T12:32:00.000Z	Abraxas`		hi..I'm in desperate need of help....my work trying to fix my graphics has somehow gotten my display in an unreadable state... It doesn't seem like changing the Xorg.conf means anythign anymore, either (I updated to gutsy in hope that the new-added incompatibilities were related to new packages aimed at guty)
2007-10-13T12:32:00.000Z	Abraxas`		right now, I get the split-screen look of a bad screen resolution
2007-10-13T12:33:00.000Z	Abraxas`		I can't really read anything in X, or figure out how to reconfigure except through trying to read the configuration screen in that split format
2007-10-13T12:34:00.000Z	Abraxas`		can someone please help me?  this isn't me asking so I don't have to work.  I've worked on this a day and a half now and every choice I make worsens the condition
2007-10-13T12:34:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	what the prob?
2007-10-13T12:35:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	well, yesterday, the problem was the nvidia driver suddenly stopped working...after a lot of tries, someone in here told me to swap from 386kernel to generic kernel..I did that... it still din't work, so I tried to upgrade to gutsy (it solved the problem on a past version for me)...
2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	well, now, it still didn't work, but I tried to change the monitor settings..I clicked test..everything worked..I clicked ok and restarted X..now I have a bad resolution in X...i've tried replacing xorg.conf from old versions..nothing..i renamed the xorg.conf and it's still getting the info
2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	also what did /etc/X11/xorg.conf say it was using? nvidia driver right?
2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	Right now, I just want plug&play monitor to work with the vesa driver like it did two hours ago
2007-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	ok try this "never ever ever" use anything to edit xorg.conf except your own two hands. It usually breaks stuff other wise
2007-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	Yeah, that's usually what I do...of course now, it seems to be getting settings from a file other than xorg.conf
2007-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	if you got a terminal do nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and set the resolutions and driver
2007-10-13T12:38:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	I tried that before coming in here...it didn't work
2007-10-13T12:38:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	your refresh rates might be wrong for the monitor causing it to go into low resolution to keep up try checking www.monitorworld.com and getting the right values for your monitor and its resolution
2007-10-13T12:39:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	regrettably, my monitor version isn't on the monitor itself, so I have always used plug&play monitors in linux...i'm trying to use the very same monitor stats that worked two hours ago
2007-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	try for color depth 16 instead of 24 just to put less stress on it
2007-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	is the monitor plugged in? lmao :D
2007-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	try apt-cache search dccprobe it might be under a different name
2007-10-13T12:45:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	Well, I'm on the computer now, so if it's not plugged in, I must say I'm doing really good in this chatroom
2007-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	no, killall gdm ; startx         worked
2007-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	the command is ddcprobe and its in xresprobe package
2007-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	Abraxas`	trogdor	actually, reconfiguring Xorg correctly detected my monitor and my resolution settings
2007-10-13T12:49:00.000Z	trogdor	Abraxas`	still might want to check it out if you don't know anything about what sort of monitor you got
