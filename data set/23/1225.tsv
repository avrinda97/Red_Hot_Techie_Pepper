2010-09-10T22:33:00.000Z	epure_		is there any way to convert a ext4 partition to ntfs without losing everything ?
2010-09-10T22:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	yes.. back it all up,, distroy partition, recreate and format with ntfs.. replace data
2010-09-10T22:35:00.000Z	epure_		kinda hard when we're talking 200G and a 320GB HDD :D
2010-09-10T22:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	why would you want ntfs anyway?  you going back to windows?
2010-09-10T22:36:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	 yes , my laptop wasn't designed for ubuntu
2010-09-10T22:36:00.000Z	epure_		i tried it for a couple of months, it's just not working out
2010-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	did you happen to do a dual boot?
2010-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	never mind.. 200g of data means you don't have enough room to even carve out another partition.
2010-09-10T22:37:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	no, i'm running winxp in VirtualBox most of the time
2010-09-10T22:38:00.000Z	epure_		yes... you see my problem now
2010-09-10T22:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	sounds like ubuntu's been running for a while.. what's the issue?
2010-09-10T22:39:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	 flash is sh*t, no hardware acceleration for videos, no starcraft2... I read they're possible to install through some painful process , but I think it's simply less painful to reinstall windows
2010-09-10T22:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	you running 64 or 32 bit?
2010-09-10T22:40:00.000Z	epure_		64bit
2010-09-10T22:40:00.000Z	epure_		4gb ram... and I would like to use it all
2010-09-10T22:40:00.000Z	epure_		:)
2010-09-10T22:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	ok.. I have both.. flash on 64 bit is problemmatic at best.. 32 bit I haven't had issues with except on slow connections.. the non-free driver is the right one and if you have others installed like gnash etc.. you have to uninstall them so there's no conflict.. however youtube works for me on 64bit
2010-09-10T22:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	starcraft2 is another issue.. I think you have to use Wine there.. their site should have decent docs on how to install it.
2010-09-10T22:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	you can downgrade to 32 bit *if* you have a separate /home partition easily by reinstalling the base system without formatting /home.. if /home is in the main partition with everything else then you're .. well. out of luck
2010-09-10T22:43:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	flash works, but sometimes it crashes when I switch to fullscreen or when I open too many windows. Last time I installed linux was ~7 years ago and it has come a long long way since, but it still has 2-3 years to go
2010-09-10T22:44:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	I made up my mind.. 2-3 months is enough :)
2010-09-10T22:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	epure_	that's 64 bit for you.. so you'll have to find a friend that's willing to let you use an external usb drive big enough to backup your data..
2010-09-10T22:45:00.000Z	epure_	Scunizi	thanks! I'll try it since it seems the only option
