2011-11-18T09:38:00.000Z	HACKhalo2		sorry
2011-11-18T09:39:00.000Z	HACKhalo2		yea, how screwed am I?
2011-11-18T09:39:00.000Z	HACKhalo2		well i stopped it quickly
2011-11-18T09:39:00.000Z	HACKhalo2		can I fix it?
2011-11-18T09:40:00.000Z	HACKhalo2		and yes MestreLion
2011-11-18T09:41:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	wow... grab a coffee... this will be a loooong nite :P
2011-11-18T09:47:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	can't afford a full reinstall, I have a LOT of code and stuff I need for a NPO i work for
2011-11-18T09:48:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	full reinstall would only change apps and OS... it does not need to change *any* of your data
2011-11-18T09:50:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	oh... I always just wiped the partition and reinstalled that way :P
2011-11-18T09:51:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	it is good practice to create a folder/partition (isolated from you $HOME) too keep personal files like docs, music, videos, code, etc etc...
2011-11-18T09:52:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	I'll remember that next time :P
2011-11-18T09:53:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	dont be... it can happen with anyone.. just double check any sudo.. and triple-check any sudo involving chowing :P
2011-11-18T10:00:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	the last "/" in your command mens the root directory...
2011-11-18T10:09:00.000Z	MestreLion	HACKhalo2	weird... chown doesnt even run without sudo
2011-11-18T10:10:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	huh... not sure then. I did chown as a dry run to make sure it was the directory that I wanted
2011-11-18T10:12:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	I mounted it with Nautlius and it mounted it as root
2011-11-18T10:14:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	nope
2011-11-18T10:14:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	ext4
2011-11-18T10:15:00.000Z	HACKhalo2	MestreLion	Nautilus is also crashing while unmounting the partition too
