2006-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	DewDude		umm...i'm hitting hibernate from the log off menu
2006-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	DewDude		it's worked before
2006-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	DewDude		however, when i was using the wifi earlier, i was using my 386  kernal rather than the 686 because my wifi tends to lock the 686 kernel up
2006-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	DewDude		heh, well, if it's using disk swap, it's probablty already overwritten the session
2006-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	DewDude		only thing i can't get running is 3d on my laptop
2006-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	DewDude		it had worked before..i'll ahve to play with it a bit
2006-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	DewDude		my laptop lacks battery, so, if i take it anywhere, i like to sysuspend to disk so i don't have to wait for the boot process
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	DewDude		heh
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	DewDude		hey, i've like, installed linux, then installed XP, then fixed dual boot
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	DewDude		man, i had some fun with the MBR that day
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	that's not very wise
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	DewDude	coucho	i know. I learned my lesson when after resoring my MBR, my XP partition was gone.
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	ouch XD
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	DewDude	coucho	no, cfdisk fixed it in about 2 seconds
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	wow
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	didn't think that was possible
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	DewDude	coucho	sure it is.
2006-05-27T05:46:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	doesn't the xp install completely overwrite the mbr?
2006-05-27T05:46:00.000Z	DewDude	coucho	yes, it does
2006-05-27T05:46:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	then what?
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	so first install linux, backup mbr, install xp, replace mbr?
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	DewDude	coucho	that's one way of doing it IF you want to install linux before windows
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	coucho	DewDude	yeah i just installed xp first, seemed easier XD
