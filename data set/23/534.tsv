2012-03-27T01:51:00.000Z	fartofagony		did i just download the wrong file?
2012-03-27T01:51:00.000Z	fartofagony		i only have the command prompt of ubuntu
2012-03-27T01:52:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	what did you download?
2012-03-27T01:53:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386
2012-03-27T01:53:00.000Z	KM0201		then no, you didn't download the wrong thing
2012-03-27T01:53:00.000Z	KM0201		so you're saying you only have the command prompt fartofagony ?
2012-03-27T01:53:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	yup i suspect some kind of security thing? no idea really :(
2012-03-27T01:54:00.000Z	KM0201		what makes you think its a "security" thing?
2012-03-27T01:55:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	something about locking because its guest blabla, dont remember what the text was and i pressed "continue anyway"
2012-03-27T01:55:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	but that wouldnt make much sense
2012-03-27T01:55:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	no it wouldn't
2012-03-27T01:58:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	fixed it by just restarting. i notice that ubuntu doesnt auto detect my graphics card. is a way around?
2012-03-27T01:59:00.000Z	KM0201		whats your graphics card?
2012-03-27T01:59:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	ati radeon 4650
2012-03-27T02:00:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	go to the unity dash and search for "Additional Drivers"  see if it gives you the option to install an ATI driver.
2012-03-27T02:00:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	ah thanks
2012-03-27T02:01:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	sorry! another question if you dont mind: in this new version where the logikn section is, isnt there an option to apply the classical look of ubuntu?`
2012-03-27T02:02:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	where the login section is?   you mean the login screen?
2012-03-27T02:02:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	yup
2012-03-27T02:02:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	... i'm honestly not sure... i would think so.. but.. honestly I don't use Ubuntu anymore, so i'm not 100% sure,
2012-03-27T02:03:00.000Z	fartofagony	KM0201	ah, ok ! no problems! :D thanks for the heklp with the other problems
2012-03-27T02:03:00.000Z	KM0201	fartofagony	no prob. :)
