2006-03-10T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	no, that's not right 
2006-03-10T16:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	okay where the hell is rc.local in ubuntu?
2006-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	or similiar way for him to launch ddclient on boot?
2006-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	update-rc.d controls init scripts; it's used to create links in /etc/rc[0-6] .d from /etc/init.d
2006-03-10T16:08:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	don't they use a similiar rc.local file for startup of user stuff after all processes have been loaded?
2006-03-10T16:09:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	no. There's /etc/rcS.d/bootmisc.sh you can invoke things from. mgpalmer what you're tring to do is get ddclient to update your ip automatically, right?
2006-03-10T16:09:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	no he's trying to get it just to launch on boot
2006-03-10T16:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	so he could just "echo <pathto>/ddclient > /etc/rcS.d/bootmisc.sh
2006-03-10T16:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	woulodn't he just addit to bootmisc.sh being the proper way?
2006-03-12T12:01:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	dpkg -L <package> | grep bin
2006-03-12T12:01:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	sudo apt-get build-dep gaim, then try compiling it
2006-03-14T10:09:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	how'd you type that character?
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	I have the normal smilie auto replaced in xchat (advanced preferences)
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	you should almost never have to restart
2006-03-14T10:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	I installed some packages via apt that need restart.  new gdm etc...
2006-03-14T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	ah, restart, not reboot ok
2006-03-14T10:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	he already knows what it will do.
2006-03-14T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	that would tell what version of packages he'd be getting
2006-03-20T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	copy an iso to the harddrive, then write multiple cds from there
2006-03-20T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	kubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package, it won't remove kde
2006-03-20T11:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	nickrud	ahh I thought they would put it so it would pull kde etc..
2006-03-20T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	if you install with aptitude, as _jason says
2006-03-20T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	chuckyp	pull in, put not take out
