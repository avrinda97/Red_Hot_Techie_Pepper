2012-04-04T16:37:00.000Z	bekks	myhero	Thats a useless message. Whats the exact error message when trying what exactly when using an Ubuntu (not Knoppix) Live CD?
2012-04-05T18:07:00.000Z	bekks	myhero	a cleaning dvd does not contain cool music.
2012-04-05T18:08:00.000Z	bekks	myhero	Thats nonsense. Playing audio technically CANT clean anything in that device.
2012-04-07T03:46:00.000Z	bekks	myhero	Because Windows cant mount Linux filesystems.
2012-04-07T03:47:00.000Z	bekks	myhero	"No."
