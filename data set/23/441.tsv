2011-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	cnz		my cpu info
2011-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	cnz		it won't go over 800mhz
2011-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	cnz		possitive
2011-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	cnz		it's an x4 945 3.0ghz
2011-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	cnz		not that old
2011-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	cnz		and im not even over clocking it
2011-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	cnz		what you mean then?
2011-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	cnz		cpuinfo should be showing 3000mhz
2011-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	cnz		not 800
2011-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	cnz		no you're just not understanding
2011-09-15T09:45:00.000Z	Thelmaria	cnz	cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies to show the avalible scaled frequencies. cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor to show the current covenor - if it's 'ondemand', chances are that it's just been scaled back due to low load.
2011-09-15T09:46:00.000Z	cnz	Thelmaria	I had this problem before and I was advice to install a package and it fixed it
2011-09-15T09:46:00.000Z	cnz		but I can't remember that package
2011-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	cnz	Thelmaria	yeaeh it's on ondemand but for some reason it never changes has I do stuff
2011-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	cnz		it stays at 800mhz
2011-09-15T09:50:00.000Z	Thelmaria	cnz	If you're on a desktop you can swap to performance (use highest avalibel freq all the time) - google for it, or as root: echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor. I'm sure there's packages to do it, and I'm -almost- sure it'll stay on reboot, but that's how I've done both my boxes.
2011-09-15T09:50:00.000Z	Thelmaria	cnz	If you're on a laptop I'd stick with ondemand to save power.
2011-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	cnz		yeah im on a desktop
2011-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	cnz	Thelmaria	I don't mind it being on scaling just want to make sure it actually scales
2011-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	cnz		and it doesnt seem to
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	Thelmaria	cnz	Theres a load threshold setting somewhere, if I remember right. (You'd need to swap govenors for all cpu cores, by the way) - googling for "cpu frequency manager ubuntu" gives lots of packages / other ways.
2011-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	cnz	Thelmaria	sweet, I will check it out here in a sec, thank you for helping
2011-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	cnz	Thelmaria	I seaarched google for what you suggestion
