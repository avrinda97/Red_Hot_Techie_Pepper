2011-12-13T21:24:00.000Z	ManDay		Can I safely use aptitude to do what  apt-get upgrade does? Because I'd like to selecitvly pick packages one by one
2011-12-13T21:25:00.000Z	webnet	ManDay	should work fine
2011-12-13T21:25:00.000Z	ManDay	webnet	What do I have to do in aptitude so that this happens?
2011-12-13T21:27:00.000Z	webnet	ManDay	well apt-get invokes aptitude thats why its the same concept. beyond that im not entirely sure what you would need to go from there. i dontuually use the aptitude gui.
