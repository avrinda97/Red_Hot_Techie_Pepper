2008-05-06T00:00:00.000Z	shingouz		when setting up a dialup connection, do i need to add the non-root user to other groups than dip and dialout?
2008-05-06T00:00:00.000Z	shingouz		dialout/dialup
2008-05-06T00:01:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	you might have to add the user (you) to the group ^o)
2008-05-06T00:02:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	check out System -> Administration -> Users and Groups
2008-05-06T00:02:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	yes i know, i am just interested if the groups needed are just dip and dialup or is netdev needed too?
2008-05-06T00:03:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	I'm thinking netdev, I played with that a long time ago
2008-05-06T00:03:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	give it a try :S can't hurt
2008-05-06T00:04:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	you will have to log out and back in to apply settings
2008-05-06T00:04:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	will happen. now the funny part is to add a user to a group when the user is a complete noob, has no *nix experience and the computer in question is about 5000 miles away without a working ssh connection
2008-05-06T00:05:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	'sudo adduser [username] netdev'
2008-05-06T00:06:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	that should work.
2008-05-06T00:06:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	heh. sudo is always Bad News for a noob :D
2008-05-06T00:06:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	you have to, give it a shot...
2008-05-06T00:07:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	yeah. also sounds like i will need a megadose of tylenol after that
2008-05-06T00:07:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	:)
2008-05-06T00:07:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	caffeine is always good, too.
2008-05-06T00:08:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	i am already immune, too many years with computers
2008-05-06T00:08:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	amen.  it's best to wean-off for a bit, lower your tolerance, then give'er again
2008-05-06T00:09:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	that sounds scary! have you been off caffeine for more than 15 minutes?
2008-05-06T00:09:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	yes - I was in the ER 3 times in 2 weeks.
2008-05-06T00:09:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	bad news bear.
2008-05-06T00:09:00.000Z	shingouz	h00k	was the er before or after the caffeine deprivation... :p
2008-05-06T00:10:00.000Z	h00k	shingouz	during :) it caused my migraines/nausea, etc
