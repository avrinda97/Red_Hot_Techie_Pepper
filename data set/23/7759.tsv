2007-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	Injen		You can have them both installed
2007-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	Injen		And just boot one or the other,, hell you can boot both at the same time, have gnome and kde running :P
2007-07-21T05:34:00.000Z	Injen		Yea, I agree don;t mess with it.
2007-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	Injen		and no, I don't know much, truth be told, I've been on Ubuntu for 3 days now, although I have about 4 years of Debian experience.
2007-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	Injen		I have found, all linux distros are the same,, only differ in what packages they come with, I like Ubuntu thus far, because it and kunbutu are the only os that have worked out of the box on my newer dell.
2007-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	Anlar	Injen	opensuse should work as well usually
2007-07-21T05:38:00.000Z	Injen	Thursley	Ok, well YOUR version on linux might be better than everyone elses. But the majority of nix filesystems are the same, and hell,,,
2007-07-21T05:38:00.000Z	Injen		Most are built off of Debian anyway.
2007-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	Anlar	Injen	usually opensuse is the most polished and best working.. or foresight (which attempts to be upstream and brand new constantly)
2007-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Injen		I'll give opensuse a few more,, "years"
2007-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Injen		They just got hit with a very bad bug.
