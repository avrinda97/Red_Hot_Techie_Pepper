2006-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	czr		some filesystem drivers have special options in order to set the perms, masks and ownerships
2006-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	czr		in this case you'd want to know what smbfs supports
2006-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	czr		however, smbfs mounting is really implemented using smbmount, so check that manpage
2006-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	czr		probably -o uid=foo,gid=bar
2006-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	czr		what happens?
2006-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	czr		so it's a local problem (as opposed to windows/ntfs-problem)
2006-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	czr		your access rights are probably wrong then. what do you use for perms?
2006-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	czr		it is, since writes succeed
2006-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	czr		windows only thinks that user X is connected (the username parameter in smbfs)
2006-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	czr		sources.list even
2006-01-20T13:20:00.000Z	Thinkingman	czr	no prob
2006-01-20T13:13:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	what's your problem?
2006-01-20T13:13:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	when you mount something manually only root can access the files?
2006-01-20T13:13:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	then you're probably mounting something non-unixy
2006-01-20T13:13:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	ntfs, vfat, iso?
2006-01-20T13:14:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	very bad idea ;-)
2006-01-20T13:18:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	you on the host right now?
2006-01-20T13:18:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	if so, would you mind doing ls -lad /path/to/mointpoint
2006-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	Thinkingman	czr	drwxr-xr-x  1 root root 4096 2006-01-14 13:53 /mnt/bartc
2006-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	at the moment it is mounted with root.root then
2006-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	no wonder only root can write :-)
2006-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	give me a sec, I'll give you the magic blurb
2006-01-20T13:20:00.000Z	czr	Thinkingman	can you privmsg me the mount command line you used (without the password if you gave one on command line)
