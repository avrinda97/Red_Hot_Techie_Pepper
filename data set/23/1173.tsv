2010-07-30T05:49:00.000Z	Flare183		Everytime I use Nautilus to ssh into my server I get a stupid openssh password prompt every time I switch to another folder. I've already entered the password once so why does it keep coming up?
2010-07-30T05:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	well that's unusual too
2010-07-30T05:50:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	Nautilus askes for the password, and its supposed to remember it all the time, so why does a openssh prompt come up if I've already entered it in Nautilus?
2010-07-30T05:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	does it immediately ask or after a while?
2010-07-30T05:51:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	right when I try to do anything with ssh using nautilus
2010-07-30T05:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	how long passes before asking you for password? immediately? after a while? how long?
2010-07-30T05:53:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	Seconds like everytime I click to do ANYTHING that deals with ssh via nautilus
2010-07-30T05:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	does this happen with a specific host/ip or any host?
2010-07-30T05:55:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	well I haven't tried it for another machine yet so idk
2010-07-30T05:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	try it on your own machine, localhost
2010-07-30T05:56:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	It doesn't do it for localhost
2010-07-30T05:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	do you have an ssh server running?
2010-07-30T05:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	sudo apt-get install openssh-server (and remove it after testing)
2010-07-30T05:57:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	yes on both this machine (that I'm using) and the server that I'm connecting to
2010-07-30T05:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	so you can connect to localhost using ssh on the command line?
2010-07-30T05:58:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	*sighs* No, everything is fine via the command line. Its just nautilus and the openssh-agent
2010-07-30T05:59:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	can you connect to localhost or not? 'ssh localhost' on command line works?
2010-07-30T06:01:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	Yes I can and that works perfectly
2010-07-30T06:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	in any case you can use ssh key-based authentication to workaround the password dialog
2010-07-30T06:02:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	and if I ssh up to the dell server via the command line it works perfectly

2010-07-30T06:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Flare183	that looks like a key phrase dialog, not an ssh password dialog
2010-07-30T06:05:00.000Z	Flare183	ilovefairuz	is openssh-agent
