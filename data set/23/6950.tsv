2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		Hi, I'm on Ubuntu server and I'm trying to change the root password
2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		I went to sudo -i
2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		and issued passwd
2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		but after relogin the password reset itself to the old one
2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		ok, so there's a different way to get a sudo password?
2006-08-13T12:51:00.000Z	Talisker		[I tried adding myself to the sudoers] 
2006-08-13T12:52:00.000Z	Talisker		I can't access the link you sent me
2006-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Talisker	your sudo password is your user password
2006-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	Talisker		oh rly\?
2006-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	Talisker		Heh, I never noticed that since they are the same on my machine
2006-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	Talisker		You've been much help, thanks
2006-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Talisker	why on earth do you have a root account then?
2006-08-13T12:54:00.000Z	Talisker	Flannel	what do you mean, you can't not have a root account
2006-08-13T12:54:00.000Z	Talisker		Anyway, you've been much help, thanks
2006-08-13T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Talisker	yes you can.  Ubuntu doesn't have a root account.  Or, it's disabled, and designed to stay that way.
2006-08-13T12:54:00.000Z	Talisker	Flannel	the latter is acceptable
2006-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	Talisker		But sometimes I need root access
2006-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	Talisker		I know that, thanks
2006-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Talisker	so, what do you need a root account for?
2006-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	Talisker		I don't need an active root account, I don't have an active root account, I use the sudo shell for access
2006-08-13T12:56:00.000Z	Talisker		I just thought that the sudo password is the root password
2006-08-13T12:56:00.000Z	Talisker		so I tried to tinker with that
2006-08-13T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Talisker	You set a root password, that means you have a root account ;)  unless you've since disabled it
