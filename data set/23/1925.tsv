2010-05-16T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 you mean in grub2 or are you using grub1 ?
2010-05-16T18:28:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	I'm using grub1, should I install grub2?
2010-05-16T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 grub2 can boot an iso file with the proper options.
2010-05-16T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 grub1 wont do what you want.
2010-05-16T18:29:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	I'm not booting the iso file
2010-05-16T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 or use unetbootin to make a bootable flash drive, thats easier.
2010-05-16T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 the installer/tools have to know how to access the iso file. grub1 isent able to pass the proper info i imagine
2010-05-16T18:30:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	from what I read grub doesn't need to load the iso but the installer running in the linux kernel ^^
2010-05-16T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	  after the kernel loads it needs to access the rest of the OS. you havent told it how to do that.  grub2 i know how to pass the proper arguments.
2010-05-16T18:33:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	http://www.instantfundas.com/2007/08/install-any-linux-distro-directly-from.html I've followed the advices on this blog page
2010-05-16T18:33:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	it's from 2007 so I don't think the grub2 should be necessary
2010-05-16T18:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 ive never gotten  a kernel to access an isu file with grub1.. i can get grub2 to boot an iso file with very little problems.
2010-05-16T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 its possible theres been changes to how ubuntu boots since 2007 however
2010-05-16T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 i even set up the iso file in my /boot/ parittion to allow me a 'rescue boot from iso file' for recovery needfs
2010-05-16T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 you Might need to extract all the files from the iso to the hd for your method to work.
2010-05-16T18:35:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	the installer menu is telling me it's searching for an iso file, so I don't think so :)
2010-05-16T18:41:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	now I wonder what would be more work to setup and compile, grub2 or unetbootin?
2010-05-16T18:41:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	I'm on debian lenny atm, so getting more recent stuff to compile can be quite a pain
2010-05-16T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 unetbootin takes  about 3 min. to do the actual job and does it in like 3 clicks
2010-05-16T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KaffeeJunky123	 the pendrivelinux web site may have some easier tools.. but i doubt it.
2010-05-16T18:43:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	well, the problem wont be using the tool
2010-05-16T18:47:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	as I thought, debian lenny is lacking the libgthread-2, wich is needed by unetbootin
2010-05-16T18:56:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Dr_Willis	I got unetbootin to compile on lenny, and it works now, thanks :)
