2008-05-08T20:44:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> is it in your CLASSPATH?
2008-05-08T20:45:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	I haven't added anything to my class path.
2008-05-08T20:46:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> well you know, to find the libraries it must be in the CLASSPATH so look into it
2008-05-08T20:49:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	I'm not sure what libraries I should be looking for?
2008-05-08T20:50:00.000Z	amenado		I dont understand why people prefer to do an upgrade instead of a fresh install of hardy...
2008-05-08T20:50:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> your error or exception  should tell you
2008-05-08T20:50:00.000Z	amenado	babolat	thats not convenience when far too many faults during upgrade
2008-05-08T20:51:00.000Z	odinsbane		sun.misc.BASE64Decoder() so that should lead me to a jar file or directory?
2008-05-08T20:52:00.000Z	amenado	babolat	i agree, i tend to suggest people use a separate /home when installing
2008-05-08T20:52:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> is that where you are having exceptions?
2008-05-08T20:53:00.000Z	odinsbane		Yes
2008-05-08T20:53:00.000Z	amenado		!who | odinsbane
2008-05-08T20:54:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	Yes that is where it dies, somebody suggested that sun.misc libraries are virtual machin specific.  But that doesn't seem to help me.
2008-05-08T20:55:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> now go see if the package for  sun.misc  exist or in your CLASSPATH
2008-05-08T20:55:00.000Z	odinsbane		my CLASSPATH is empty and if I locate sun | grep misc  I get nothing.
2008-05-08T20:56:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	^^
2008-05-08T20:56:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> then you need to go back and re-learn java. you know how critical classpath is..if its not on the path, it will never be seen
2008-05-08T20:58:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	I am trying to learn Java, I understand that I need a class path, I assume I can use the -cp 'nescessary classpath' but...I dont knwo what class will include sun.misc if any.
2008-05-08T20:59:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> since you are in the learning process of java, perhaps #java channel is more appropiate rather than ubuntu
2008-05-08T21:00:00.000Z	amenado		odinsbane-> may i suggest the undernet #java folks, freenode java folks are brutal to newbies
2008-05-08T21:01:00.000Z	amenado		google-bot-> you have used google correct?
2008-05-08T21:03:00.000Z	amenado		Mikey-> you are now, you are chatting with us
2008-05-08T21:03:00.000Z	odinsbane	amenado	true, I asked in here primarily so I can install some good packages then I will use the path info
