2008-12-25T18:00:00.000Z	Xman		hi all, i need help guys. I m facing problms with ubuntu 8.10. I have installed it on the first prtition of my hdd and also inside windows but the problm is that it does not boot up in any of the installations after logging in.
2008-12-25T18:02:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	logging in where?
2008-12-25T18:02:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	loggin in ubuntu, i have created account while installation
2008-12-25T18:03:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	then, what does not 'boot up' ?
2008-12-25T18:04:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	dude after putting up my uid and passwd in there. It just shows a black screen and doesnt proceed..
2008-12-25T18:05:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	did you try a shell?
2008-12-25T18:05:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	just press CTRL + ALT + F1 and see if you can login in a shell
2008-12-25T18:07:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	i mean after putting ud and pas when i press ctrl+alt+f1 the shell doesnt comes up
2008-12-25T18:08:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	sounds theres some boot-up problems with gnome, not with your video-card.. you get the nice colored login screen right?
2008-12-25T18:08:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	try it again, sometimes you might need to press it twice
2008-12-25T18:08:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	but without loging in through GUI when i press ctrl+alt+f1 the shell comes up nd i login there
2008-12-25T18:09:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	i tried it so many times dude
2008-12-25T18:09:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	okay, you might be able to fix it from the shell.. why not try running gnome from the shell, so it might return some errors
2008-12-25T18:10:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	u mean the cmd init 3 from shell?
2008-12-25T18:10:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	just login in your shell and run gnome
2008-12-25T18:11:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	can u give me the cmd to run gnome
2008-12-25T18:11:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	then get back to the shell and see if there are errors
2008-12-25T18:11:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	sure, hold on
2008-12-25T18:12:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	i believe its gnome-session
2008-12-25T18:13:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	but you have to have X running first.. but if GDM has started, i believe X is started as well..
2008-12-25T18:15:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	shall i do restart /etc/init.d/?dm??
2008-12-25T18:15:00.000Z	Adriaan	Xman	that shouldnt be the problem, but if you feels that can work it doesnt hurt
2008-12-25T18:16:00.000Z	Xman	Adriaan	ok going to reboot now to do that
