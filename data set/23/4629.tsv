2008-05-24T08:50:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	maybe the process has an absurd priority and it's screwing with the X poll events for input?
2008-05-24T08:50:00.000Z	bobsomebody		yeah i read that part
2008-05-24T08:50:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	oh, someone mentoined that?
2008-05-24T08:50:00.000Z	bobsomebody		suposedly a kernal recompile might fix it
2008-05-24T08:50:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	haa, well, that's the only thing i can think of :P
2008-05-24T08:54:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	did you try tweaking kernel options as was mentioned?
2008-05-24T08:54:00.000Z	bobsomebody		im looking into that part
2008-05-24T08:54:00.000Z	bobsomebody		its alot of french to me though

2008-05-24T08:56:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	it seems like tweaking the kernel options is the best bet, but the lag will still occur under heavy IO input
2008-05-24T08:57:00.000Z	garrett__	bobsomebody	*shrug* goofy problem
2008-05-24T08:57:00.000Z	bobsomebody	garrett__	yeah it bites, thanks for giving it a look-see :)
