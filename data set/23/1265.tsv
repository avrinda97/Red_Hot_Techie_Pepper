2010-06-06T06:29:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 run lspci on terminal
2010-06-06T06:29:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	see if youre sound card is detected
2010-06-06T06:30:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 pastebin the output plz
2010-06-06T06:30:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	it says NVidia and VT82xx
2010-06-06T06:31:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 run alsamixer on terminal, make sure Master is on 100 not muted
2010-06-06T06:33:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	the problem is the NVidia is being detected as the primary sound card. It has no details on amixer. I cant make seem to change the default sound to the built-in sound card.
2010-06-06T06:35:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 which is youre main sound card, the one built in with the computer ?
2010-06-06T06:37:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 try sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic and reboot
2010-06-06T06:37:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	I was using the built-in audio before and was working properly. then I installed a new GPU, the GPU is being detected also as a sound device and it becomes the default based on alsamixer
2010-06-06T06:39:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 you can try change youre default sound card by editing the asound.conf:  sudo gedit /etc/asound.conf
2010-06-06T06:41:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	weird, theres no asound.conf on /etc. BTW, im using karmic
2010-06-06T06:42:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 oh okay, In terminal now type sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2010-06-06T06:42:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 Find the place where it says something like # Prevent abnormal drivers from grabbing index 0 and in the list below add: options snd_whateveryourcardnameswere index=-2
2010-06-06T06:44:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 let me know if that fix youre problem
2010-06-06T06:44:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	: both are using snd-hda-intel for the driver.
2010-06-06T06:45:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	: this is where I hit a brick wall.
2010-06-06T06:45:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	open the alsa-base.conf, by useing terminal sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
2010-06-06T06:46:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	ook for the line “# Prevent abnormal drivers from grabbing index 0″, then above it you want to put the following.. options snd_hda_intel index=1
2010-06-06T06:46:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	 his will force the other card to become index 0 and hence the default, and reboot youre system
2010-06-06T06:48:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	: can you help me check. http://pastebin.com/dua2shPQ
2010-06-06T06:51:00.000Z	jepes1981	zer0t0xic	: will be rebooting, brb
2010-06-06T07:04:00.000Z	zer0t0xic	jepes1981	no problem
