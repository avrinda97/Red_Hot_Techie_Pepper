2006-06-15T07:24:00.000Z	venki		how to enable ssh in a machine with ip assigned by a DHCP server?
2006-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	venki		yeah i did that
2006-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	venki		ssh localhost works as well
2006-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	venki		but from a remote host
2006-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	venki		it is not able to ssh to this machine
2006-06-15T07:26:00.000Z	venki		no i know that
2006-06-15T07:26:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	dhcp is irrelevant to the issue, make sure sshd is installed and running
2006-06-15T07:27:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	can you ping the machine? does it have an account with the same name you're logging from or are you using -l option?
2006-06-15T07:29:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	ifconfig shows an ip address?
2006-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	you have a networking issue if your eth0 or whatever device has no ip address
2006-06-15T07:32:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	shouldn't paste in here but no, that looks ok, can you ping anything from that machine?
2006-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	it's not responding to pings though?
2006-06-15T07:34:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	are both machines using same ip range 192.168.0.* and same host mask?
2006-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	that looks like an internet range
2006-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	local networks are usually 192.168.0.* or 10.0.0.* or another I don't recall right now
2006-06-15T07:37:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	this is a machine on your lan yes?
2006-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	is it in a dmz?
2006-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	either
2006-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	seems it's got an external ip address
2006-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	that's a problem with your router configuration
2006-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	no, it's because you set up a dmz machine is my guess
2006-06-15T07:41:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	read your router manual and configure your dhcp to issue a range along 192.168.0.* with netmask of 255.255.255.0
2006-06-15T07:41:00.000Z	anto9us	venki	disable any dmz settings in your firewall
