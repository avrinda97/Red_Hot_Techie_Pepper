2008-11-22T01:04:00.000Z	MindVirus		Hello. Can Rhythmbox have gapless playback?
2008-11-22T01:04:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Yes
2008-11-22T01:04:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	?
2008-11-22T01:05:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Check edit: preferences: playback: enable crossfade backend
2008-11-22T01:05:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	that's not gapless.
2008-11-22T01:05:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Yes it is, check Rhythmbox docs
2008-11-22T01:06:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	I had the exact same reaction as you, but I read up on it and tadaa, gapless playback
2008-11-22T01:06:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	roger. Thanks.
2008-11-22T01:07:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	not quite gapless, but closer.
2008-11-22T01:08:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Then it's most likely a problem with the tracks themselves. Most of my music plays back with flawless gapless
2008-11-22T01:08:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	when played through my iPod it is perfect.
2008-11-22T01:08:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Then it's fishy. You could try sliding the slider up to something other than 0.0
2008-11-22T01:09:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	slider's not at 0.0.
2008-11-22T01:09:00.000Z	MindVirus		It's at 1.5.
2008-11-22T01:09:00.000Z	MindVirus		But I have it set so that it doesn't crossfade between songs on the same album.
2008-11-22T01:09:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Then try putting it at 0.0. Also, did you restart Rhythmbox?
2008-11-22T01:09:00.000Z	MindVirus		Thought I did, but I'll do it again.
2008-11-22T01:10:00.000Z	MindVirus	erk1	nope.
2008-11-22T01:10:00.000Z	MindVirus		Doesn't do the trick.
2008-11-22T01:11:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Okay, my settings are: Enable crossfade, 0.0, crossfade within album. But when listening closely, you're right, it's not entirely flawless, but it is almost indistinguishable.
2008-11-22T01:12:00.000Z	MindVirus		Mine clicks.
2008-11-22T01:12:00.000Z	MindVirus		Noticeably.
2008-11-22T01:12:00.000Z	erk1	MindVirus	Mine did that with tracks I separated myself using mp3splt, but for the rest of the archive it's all good.
