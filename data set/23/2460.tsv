2009-05-09T06:38:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger		Anyone know a good hex editor for ubuntu?
2009-05-09T06:39:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	vim is my favourite
2009-05-09T06:39:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	it depends on what you want. if you want to program, vim, if you want rich text, openoffice.org
2009-05-09T06:39:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	does that come as part of ubuntu, and i just need a hex editor to mod the comiz files to get the genie affect
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	yep, use vim
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	oh actually
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	if you don't know how to use vim, don't
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	use gedit instead
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	cheers.
2009-05-09T06:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	but I'd recommend you learn how to use vim, it's very powerful :D
2009-05-09T06:41:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	only you'll have to know it's inbuild commands etc
2009-05-09T06:43:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	You said I could use gedit for hex, it cant seem to open the file that i need to.
2009-05-09T06:44:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	I'd try vim. Do you mean hex as in hexidecimal?
2009-05-09T06:45:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	I'd try vim because it can do just about everything
2009-05-09T06:46:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	I don't understand why you need a powerful text editor to work with hex tho :/
2009-05-09T06:46:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	already installed yes :D
2009-05-09T06:46:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	Consider emacs too....
2009-05-09T06:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	let me know how you go
2009-05-09T06:48:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	I have used vim before but this ubuntu vim is different to the unix one i used.
2009-05-09T06:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	the UNIX vim is probably vi - and this one is a lot more powerful :D
2009-05-09T06:49:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	yeh it is vi.
2009-05-09T06:58:00.000Z	Tyrath	TonyTheTiger	how are you going?
2009-05-09T06:59:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Tyrath	I just installed bless :)
