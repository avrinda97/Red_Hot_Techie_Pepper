2009-09-20T01:22:00.000Z	Casper1	Biovore	Is that the Gateway?
2009-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	Biovore	Casper1	gw = gateway..  (should be the ip of your internet router thing)

2009-09-20T01:35:00.000Z	Biovore	Casper1	so.. might mean your dns isn't any good..  when connected to wireless can you ping 72.51.60.153?
