2005-02-09T10:06:00.000Z	amiroff		Hello, I have a problem with Nvidia drivers after upgrading to hoary, X just wont start when I have "nvidia" in my xorg.conf, error says that my Nvidia kernel module is 1.0.6111 and my X module is 1.0.6629, thus API mismatch. How can I fix this?
2005-02-09T10:08:00.000Z	amiroff		can anyone help me with Nvidia stuff please?
2005-02-09T10:09:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	boot to hoary kernel
2005-02-09T10:10:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	but then, there's another error with hoary kernel
2005-02-09T10:10:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	ah... of course you could just go grab the driver from nv website
2005-02-09T10:11:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	really? I thought it alredy gor updated from the repository...
2005-02-09T10:11:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	yes, you got the new driver but the kernel driver was for the heary kernel, not the old warty one
2005-02-09T10:12:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	so now, I have to boot with 2.6.10 and get nvidia drivers from their site?
2005-02-09T10:12:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	if you boot w/ 2.6.10 it should work directly
2005-02-09T10:13:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	if you want to stick w/ tho old kernel remove nvidia packages and install the driver from nv website
2005-02-09T10:13:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	it does not work there either :( anyway, will try the second advice
2005-02-09T10:15:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	yes, it is optimal. but get a big drive, you can always use the disk space. small drive will only piss you off in the long run
2005-02-09T10:15:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	sorry wrong msg
2005-02-09T10:15:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	:)
2005-02-09T10:17:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	when you mean remove nvidia stuff, do you mean nvidia-kernel-common or nvidia-glx ?
2005-02-09T10:18:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	all of it
2005-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	but trying to remove nvidia-kernel-common tries to remove some kernel stuff
2005-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	what stuff?
2005-02-09T10:21:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	linux-386, linux-restricted-modules-2.6-386, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-2-386, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1-3-386 and linux-restricted-modules-386
2005-02-09T10:22:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	well, I guess they could go
2005-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	amiroff	Nonphasis	so now I have to boot with 2.6.10 and install download drivers right?
2005-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	yes
2005-02-09T10:25:00.000Z	Nonphasis	amiroff	be sure to have kernel headers installed
