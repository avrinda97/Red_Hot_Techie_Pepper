2010-04-14T09:37:00.000Z	igoryonya		did anybody here had an SSD disk die on you?
2010-04-14T09:39:00.000Z	igoryonya		so, with SSD disk, you have to be doing live backups constantly, nonstop.
2010-04-14T09:40:00.000Z	igoryonya		giacomocarissimi, is the drive visible by the system or it's inaccessable?
2010-04-14T09:41:00.000Z	igoryonya		giacomocarissimi, I can only suggest some windows utilities, I don't know of any such linux utilities, do you want?
2010-04-14T09:42:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	i'll try anything :)
2010-04-14T09:46:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	There is a really good tool, called SpinRite 6, but it's not a file recovery tool, but an inaccessable disk repair tool, I repaired many disks with it, but as far as file recovery goes, I just thought, what file system do you need to recover from?
2010-04-14T09:46:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	just ntfs and ext3
2010-04-14T09:48:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	the windows tools I will suggest, will probably only recover fat and ntfs systems, although, some of them might work with ext3, I don't know though, just a sec., but I've recovered many disks with these tools that had ntfs and fat systems, I just didn't have any disk with ext3 to recover yet.
2010-04-14T09:53:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	im not even sure the data is deleted, i doubt it was able to clear my entire hdd in the matter of 2 seconds the crash happened
2010-04-14T09:53:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	these utilities will recover from deleted, lost partitions or individual files.
2010-04-14T09:53:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	im trying testdisk and some other linux options initially
2010-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	recover4all is a good utility, but it only works on existing partition, It cannot recover from lost partitions.
2010-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	there is also good one Restorer2000 (r2k), but I don't remember if it can recover from lost partitions or only from existing; to come back to easyrecovery, it's good and it can also recover from lost/deleted partitions or existing, but as far as I remember It couldn't recover files that were NTFS compressed or NTFS encrypted, other tools I'
2010-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	've suggested can recover encrypted or compressed, did myself.
2010-04-14T10:03:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	there is Acronis Recovery Expert, I know that acronis is really good disk utility company. their HDD imaging software is better then norton ghost, and Disk Director Suite is better and more stable, then Partition Magic, but I didn't test their recovery expert, so I cannot say, how good it is yet, but I am thinking, that if their other disk utilities are superior, why this...
2010-04-14T10:04:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	well what im thinking is the partition table just got screwed, so if there's an easy way of fixing that up and having everything working, i could just get it to re-write the partition table structure
2010-04-14T10:04:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	I didn't use testdisk, so I don't know, but if it was me, I wouldn't risk it until I imaged this disk with some disk imaging utility to an other disk first. I don't know how safe it is to suggest anything.
2010-04-14T10:05:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	yeah
2010-04-14T10:06:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	this seems like a good idea, the worst that could happen is i'll have to spend the next 3-4 hours getting everything set back up.  i have most of my important data saved on my external anyway
2010-04-14T10:06:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	maybe, you can do it, but as I said, since I'ven't tested this util before, I am afraid to suggest anything about it.
2010-04-14T10:06:00.000Z	GiacomoCarissimi	igoryonya	no worries
2010-04-14T10:07:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	yes, I would like to know
2010-04-14T10:07:00.000Z	igoryonya	GiacomoCarissimi	so I know for the future.
