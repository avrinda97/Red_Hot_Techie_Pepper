2006-06-16T14:42:00.000Z	zax1		zcat its a 700mhz celeron, with 128mb ram, should there be any problems with that ? also, i thought the main reason for xubuntu is to be able to run on older slower hardware.....
2006-06-16T14:42:00.000Z	zax1		XUBUNTU is what i am trying
2006-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	zax1		its what i am using
2006-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	zax1		:)
2006-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	zax1		what happnes is that computer crashes mid installation, right after the "selecting and installing software" section
2006-06-16T14:44:00.000Z	zax1		tryed to bypass it by installing kubuntu server mode, and then follow the instruction to get the xfce desktop
2006-06-16T14:44:00.000Z	zax1		but that doesnt work well either, every time the xserver start it crashes the computer
2006-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	zax1		lowered the resolution and it will load but then i have 2 inches of black border around the desktop
2006-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	zax1		googlus - i have
2006-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	zax1		bbrazi - it takes kubuntu 5.10 no problem ( but very very slow running)
2006-06-16T14:46:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	why are you installing kubuntu on a machine with 128 MB of RAM :P
2006-06-16T14:47:00.000Z	zax1	eobanb	to make sure that the hardware is working well - after the xubuntu failed
2006-06-16T14:47:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	what do you mean by 'crashes'
2006-06-16T14:48:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	how exactly does xubuntu 'crash'
2006-06-16T14:49:00.000Z	zax1	eobanb	after it loads for a sec the blackness of the screen slowly combs down, and then its complete black (alt ctrl backspace or alt +@ dont bring it back)
2006-06-16T14:49:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	what graphics card do you have..
2006-06-16T14:50:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	when it goes to the black screen, can you hit ctrl-alt-F1 to switch to a virtual terminal?
2006-06-16T14:50:00.000Z	zax1	eobanb	 no
2006-06-16T14:52:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	you specifically tried ctrl-alt-F1 ?
2006-06-16T14:52:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	i still get the feeling it's just a problem with xorg, not the whole system
2006-06-16T14:53:00.000Z	zax1	eobanb	yes, i was up till 1:30 last night trying to get help for this and its is one of the trouble shooting quesyions i got
2006-06-16T14:53:00.000Z	eobanb	zax1	it should switch to a virtual terminal
2006-06-16T14:53:00.000Z	zax1	eobanb	it might be, but y does it not even finih the install ?
