2012-06-23T05:51:00.000Z	HaltingState	L3top	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV630 [Radeon HD 3600 Series] [1002:9598]
2012-06-23T05:51:00.000Z	HaltingState		not nvidia
2012-06-23T05:51:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	did you dare invoke fglrx?
2012-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	HaltingState	L3top	whats that
2012-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	L3top		Beacuse you can't
2012-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	L3top		That is ATI's proprietary driver.
2012-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	L3top		They do NOT support your GPU.
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	apt-cache policy fglrx | grep -i 'installed'
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	HaltingState		  Installed: 2:8.960-0ubuntu1
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	L3top		that is why.
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	HaltingState	L3top	is that the proprietary drivers?
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	L3top		one moment
2012-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	HaltingState		what is that
2012-06-23T05:54:00.000Z	HaltingState	L3top	when i installed packages i took a list of packages from 11.10 installation and just reinstall all of them, so bad things might have been installed
2012-06-23T05:55:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	ATI has dropped support for... MOST of the chipsets on the planet. You will have to use the open source drivers... which are decent... but... it is a shameful regression.
2012-06-23T05:55:00.000Z	HaltingState	L3top	what?
2012-06-23T05:55:00.000Z	L3top		give me a moment.
2012-06-23T06:05:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	ATI dropped support for MOST of the chipsets out there with 12-5... but... this long predates that. Based on 10.04.. if       lspci | grep 'VGA' | grep -Ei '((R.)([2-7])|(9|X|ES)(1|2?)([0-9])(5|0)0|Xpress)                 returns a result then it's game over... that doesn't even address the HD 2xxx-4xxx series they dropped this year.

2012-06-23T06:06:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	you will need to reboot after that
2012-06-23T06:07:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	my soul dedication at this point is to autodetection/install of GPU drivers. I promise I am correct.
2012-06-23T06:08:00.000Z	L3top		Ok my primary dedication
2012-06-23T07:06:00.000Z	L3top	HaltingState	You have me worried.
