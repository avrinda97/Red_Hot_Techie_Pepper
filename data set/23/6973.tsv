2005-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	PJeremy		how do i make a softlink from motifwrapper to libXm.so ?
2005-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	ln -s libXm.so motifwrapper
2005-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	with directories i assume?
2005-11-18T07:46:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	if you like :)
2005-11-18T07:46:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	well, is it necessary? ;)
2005-11-18T07:46:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	you could cd to the directory you want to make the link in first.
2005-11-18T07:47:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	then, if the link and the target are in the same directory you need not specify directories
2005-11-18T07:47:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	that would be the motif one ? and no, they're not, libxm is in /usr/lib and motifwrapper is in /usr/lib/opera/plugins
2005-11-18T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	so I would run "sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libxm /usr/lib/opera/plugins/whateveritwascalled"
2005-11-18T07:48:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	alrighty, thanks
2005-11-18T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	(only with more correct paths)
2005-11-18T07:51:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	what should it say if it was successful? should it say "blabla file exists" ?
2005-11-18T07:51:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	it should be quiet
2005-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	well, it tells me that motifwrapper exists, quite obviously it does..
2005-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	sounds like you already either have the link you want, or an alternative file of the same name
2005-11-18T07:53:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	well, if i had the link, motifwrapper would find libXm..
2005-11-18T07:53:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	run "ls -l /usr/lib/opera/whatever" - what's that show you?
2005-11-18T07:54:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 77520 2005-09-16 12:14 /usr/lib/opera/plugins/operamotifwrapper-3
2005-11-18T07:54:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	that's a file...
2005-11-18T07:55:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	try an 'ls -l' on the thing you're trying to link to as well
2005-11-18T07:57:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	http://pastebin.com/427310
2005-11-18T07:58:00.000Z	dooglus	PJeremy	maybe you want to move that plugin out the way and then put in the link in its place
2005-11-18T07:59:00.000Z	PJeremy	dooglus	well, opera uses motifwrapper-3, but can't find it for some odd reason, now i read in a forum entry that someone softlinked them..
