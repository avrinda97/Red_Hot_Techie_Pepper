2008-04-17T09:22:00.000Z	Sharp12		what are some default logins for linux?
2008-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	no
2008-04-17T09:12:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	if the box has sshd, then you can ssh to it
2008-04-17T09:15:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: How do I ssh to it from windows?
2008-04-17T09:15:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	use putty
2008-04-17T09:17:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: you the man!!! now I hope I can find the username and password to it!
2008-04-17T09:19:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	what do you mean?
2008-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: like when it is first setup is there a default username and password?
2008-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	no. Don't you have an account on the machine in question?
2008-04-17T09:26:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: it was setup by someone else and I can't seem to get in.
2008-04-17T09:27:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	do you have the machine in front of you?
2008-04-17T09:28:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	:  not at this moment...but I'm remote into a windows box which is on the same network as the linux server.
2008-04-17T09:29:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	the only way to gain access is to have a user account
2008-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	so you have a user account on the server?
2008-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: I can connect to files on the server through windows. so I must have an account
2008-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: I can connect to files on the server through windows. so I must have an account correct?
2008-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	yes
2008-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	but it could be a generic user account for all the samba "Windows" shares
2008-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	it might not have rights to remotely login to the server using ssh
2008-04-17T09:46:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: so should I just use the recovery concole? Is that my only hope?
2008-04-17T09:47:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	if you can get physical access to the server in question, then yes the recovery console is your only hope
2008-04-17T09:47:00.000Z	Sharp12	pitr256	: okay...thanks for your help...I'll try it.
2008-04-17T09:48:00.000Z	pitr256	Sharp12	good luck
