2008-03-21T21:47:00.000Z	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	waylandbill	do you know?
2008-03-21T22:39:00.000Z	waylandbill	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	That sounds more of a samba question. You may want to ask on #samba
2008-03-21T22:39:00.000Z	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	waylandbill	i asked samba but nobody there knows the answer
2008-03-21T22:40:00.000Z	waylandbill	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	try samba forums or a samba mailing list.
2008-03-21T22:40:00.000Z	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	waylandbill	how will a mailing list help? wont i just get loads of bulk?>
2008-03-21T22:41:00.000Z	waylandbill	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	because you may find someone with an answer?
2008-03-21T22:43:00.000Z	waylandbill	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	keep help.ubuntu.com in your mind. You can always search there as a starting place.
2008-03-21T22:43:00.000Z	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	waylandbill	i know, its just jnkq asked me what problem i was having, i was just telling him :)
2008-03-21T22:44:00.000Z	waylandbill	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	I mean if you have issues in the future. It's a valuable resource.
2008-03-21T23:24:00.000Z	DOMAIN_CONROLLER	waylandbill	i dont see how the repeated asking of a question is abuse, surely you are the one abusing the IRC channel
