2007-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss		has anyone here ever used "upstart" under ubuntu?
2007-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	yes, everybody who uses Ubuntu > Dapper
2007-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 well, I was reading on their web page that it should improve the boot time, and mine seems VERY slow.  Also, there were some screen shots on Slashdot a while ago about some graphical loader as well, any ideas?
2007-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	are you on Ubuntu Edgy Eft (6.10)?
2007-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 one sec, looking for the artical.
2007-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	you can check by typing  lsb_release -a 
2007-03-27T10:17:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 anyways, the thing on slashot was about making your startup load in parellel, and it also gave a live graphical indication of what was going on during the load.
2007-03-27T10:17:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	the problem is, what you are describing happens *by default* under Ubuntu Edgy and later, since upstart is the *default* initializer
2007-03-27T10:17:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 ok, thanks.  I didn't know.
2007-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	if you want to try to improve startup time a little, and you are *already* under edgy, reboot, then at the GRUB prompt, hit "e", go to the kernel line, hit "e", add the word " profile", then hit "b" to boot
2007-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 ok, thanks.  I'll look into it.
2007-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	startup will take much longer than usual, which means the system is analyzing startup files in order to optimize the loading sequence
2007-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	then, next time you boot it should be slightly faster
2007-03-27T11:40:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	sorry but i've never had any wifi gear
2007-03-27T11:40:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	 WHAT?  I live my life wirelessly
2008-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	locate filename
2008-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	does that work for the fill file system?
2008-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	(although that won't work if the file was created recently - in that case, use "find")
2008-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	yes
2008-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	ok, it's not working.  what would the syntax be to search the whole drive for "awstats_updateall.pl"
2008-10-24T05:25:00.000Z	LjL	jeeves_Moss	just "locate filename". but if it's not working then use find, "sudo find / | grep awstats_updateall.pl"
2008-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	thanks.  it's searching
2008-10-24T05:28:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	LjL	thanks, I found what I needed
