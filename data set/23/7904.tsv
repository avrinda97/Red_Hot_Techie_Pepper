2005-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	jirwin		can anyone think of any other causes of the installer hanging for hoary?
2005-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	does the computer freeze, or just the installation process?
2005-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	did vt4 say anything?
2005-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	jirwin		tsume, the only thing it tells me is that it fails setting the locale
2005-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	and your locale is?
2005-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	jirwin	tsume_	utf-8

2005-04-29T05:59:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	I thought it was a selection from the insta...

2005-04-29T05:59:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	oh.. hmm
2005-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	you'd need to ask a dev to debug the problem further
2005-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	jirwin	tsume_	would there be any reason it halts at the exact same spot everytime?
2005-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	well its a bug in the exact same place ;)
2005-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	tsume_	jirwin	did you check the md5 of your ISO?
2005-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	jirwin		i will be sure to do that...
