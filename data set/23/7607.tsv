2005-08-05T09:17:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		you know what I mean to test your video card

2005-08-05T09:18:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		which video card do u have?
2005-08-05T09:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	just over 1300 fps
2005-08-05T09:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	yes
2005-08-05T09:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	even better you can use ctrl + alt + <arrow keys> to change virtual desktops
2005-08-05T09:52:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	LinuxJones	Any idea why I get a black screen in doom3 after running it?
2005-08-05T09:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	run it from a console terminal and look for any errors that might come up
2005-08-05T09:53:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	LinuxJones	the problem is that the terminal is too fast and then I'm in doom3 with a black screen
2005-08-05T09:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	if you hit the escape key a few times does doom3 close ?
2005-08-05T09:55:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	do you have the 3d drivers installed for your nvidia or ati card ?
2005-08-05T09:55:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	but you installed the binary drivers though correct ?
2005-08-05T09:58:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	did it ever work ?
2005-08-05T10:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	ctrl + alt + backspace key and then re-login
2005-08-05T10:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	if you can't do that your system is frozen and you will need to hit the reset switch on your pc
2005-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	PrimoTurbo	the doom 3 file that you run is probably a script itself. If so you can just add the command to that script itself at the top. (If doom3 is designed like Quake3)
