2011-05-30T03:10:00.000Z	fisteri		Anybody know why Ubuntu 11.04 doesnt want to be installed? Downloaded .iso from web and burned it to a disc. When I boot from disc it goes 10 seconds nicely. Then I get message "uncompression errror, system halted" :(
2011-05-30T03:11:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	check the disk is burned proper
2011-05-30T03:11:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	sounds 99% like a bad copy
2011-05-30T03:12:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	yes, either that or bad ram
2011-05-30T03:23:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	its only recommended because 32 bit works on all cpus so it's not to confuse noobs
2011-05-30T03:24:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	99% of apps work on 64 bit
2011-05-30T03:24:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	if u have 4gb of ram use 64
2011-05-30T03:25:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	whats the matter
2011-05-30T03:28:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	what was ur original problem? the uncompress error? or was that someone else?
2011-05-30T03:28:00.000Z	fisteri	sudokill	 no, it was me
2011-05-30T03:28:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	im 99% sure its bad ram or an unstable overclock
2011-05-30T03:30:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	what u mean
2011-05-30T03:30:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	u prob upped ur voltage randomly like a noob lol
2011-05-30T03:31:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	it could be anything
2011-05-30T03:32:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	so it actually shuts down and reboots properly, by itself?
2011-05-30T03:33:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	so it doesnt shutdown properly just "resets"
2011-05-30T03:35:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	but why pay money for a macbook and use ubuntu?
2011-05-30T03:36:00.000Z	fisteri	sudokill	yes along side with mac os if its possible
2011-05-30T03:37:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	go for it
2011-05-30T03:40:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	most people dont care
2011-05-30T03:40:00.000Z	fisteri	sudokill	 i think im one of them
2011-05-30T03:43:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	dont care
2011-05-30T03:44:00.000Z	sudokill	fisteri	tbh it depends
