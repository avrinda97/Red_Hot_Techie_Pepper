2011-08-14T08:17:00.000Z	TYDIRocks		Does it matter if I put Ubuntu on a CD or DVD?
2011-08-14T08:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	burn the CD ISO to a CD, burn the DVD ISO to a DVD
2011-08-14T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	remember to MD5 test the ISO before you burn it so you know it's complete and consistent
2011-08-14T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	size is a dead giveaway
2011-08-14T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	use tab to complete nicks ;)
2011-08-14T08:19:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	I already have tested the md5. For some reason Ubuntu isn't installing. Fedora would boot up find, but all I get with Ubuntu is "Operating System not found
2011-08-14T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	did you make the CD test itself for defects?
2011-08-14T08:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	did you burn the CD slowly?
2011-08-14T08:20:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	when burning in windows 7 I checked Verify disc
2011-08-14T08:20:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	and I've tried 2 different DVDs.
2011-08-14T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	the disk has a self test when it first starts to load
2011-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	the disk seems to work find on windows. The wubi thing comes up find
2011-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	doesn't mean its ok, get it tested
2011-08-14T08:24:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	how?
2011-08-14T08:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	when the CD starts to boot, press SPACE and you should see the menu to test RAM and the disk
2011-08-14T08:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	the usual bios screen will go and you'll see a blank screen or a boot splash
2011-08-14T08:25:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	so when it is at the black screen press space?
2011-08-14T08:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	I just hammer space when it starts to load. I also suggest you try the minimal ISO and use a wired connection. You can install straight from the repos rather than a CD
2011-08-14T08:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	yes
2011-08-14T08:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	USB has no moving parts so checking stuff isnt necessary
2011-08-14T08:28:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	I meant when using the dvd
2011-08-14T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TYDIRocks	then you should run the disk check. USB install will be faster and is more reliable
2011-08-14T08:29:00.000Z	TYDIRocks	ActionParsnip	alright I'll try the USB first
