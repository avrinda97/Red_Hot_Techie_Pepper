2011-05-10T03:09:00.000Z	iaindalton		How can I move a window onto my 2nd monitor in Unity? It tries to maximize when I drag to the edge of the 1st monitor.
2011-05-10T03:10:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  open ccsm and disable the Grid plugin
2011-05-10T03:11:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	is it possible to have the grid work but only on right monitor's right edge and left monitor's left edge?
2011-05-10T03:12:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  I havent tried hold on let me check
2011-05-10T03:12:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	also, what is ccsm?
2011-05-10T03:12:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  compizconfig-settings-manager,, you probably will have to install it,  although no longer sure why ubuntu  doesnt include that with Unity
2011-05-10T03:13:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 you can disable edge bindings in Grid  once you get compizconfi-settings-manager installed
2011-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	disabled grid, but I can't drag windows to the other monitor still. My cursor can go over there when it's not holding a window, but even if I drag a window halfway off the first monitor, it doesn't show on the second
2011-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  which video card are you using?
2011-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	GeForce GT 220. I have the official driver installed
2011-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  and do you have separate xscreens set up ?
2011-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 did you use twinview with t hat?
2011-05-10T03:18:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 are you using twinview?
2011-05-10T03:18:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	looks like I forgot to enable xinerama :P
2011-05-10T03:18:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 no no
2011-05-10T03:18:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 no  it is not
2011-05-10T03:19:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	  open nvidia-settings
2011-05-10T03:19:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 click on  "X Server Display Configuration"
2011-05-10T03:19:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 are both monitors listed graphically there?
2011-05-10T03:20:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 then click on the seondary monitor graphic ,, configure   twinview    set resolution
2011-05-10T03:20:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 thats why you cant drag to the other monitor
2011-05-10T03:20:00.000Z	iaindalton	coz_	I thought enabling xinerama would fix that
2011-05-10T03:20:00.000Z	coz_	iaindalton	 you have to use twinview to drag from one to the other monitor
