2007-07-06T13:48:00.000Z	bigcx2		yes. i partitioned the smaller disk with gparted and i dd'ed the larger partition to the smaller partition
2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	bigcx2		why wouldn't it be set? there's only one partition?
2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	bigcx2		sounds feasible
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	bigcx2		right
2007-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	bigcx2		maybe it would be better to try resize2fs? or gparted?
2007-07-06T13:52:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	it runs from ram so no problems with the partitions being mounted
2007-07-06T13:45:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	what type of file system is it? fat, ext2, ext3, ?
2007-07-06T13:45:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	etx3
2007-07-06T13:45:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	it should work, you probably want to backup.
2007-07-06T13:45:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	is it mounted in linux?
2007-07-06T13:46:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	yes
2007-07-06T13:46:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	are you trying to move it between disks?
2007-07-06T13:47:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	define "it"
2007-07-06T13:47:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	the partition?
2007-07-06T13:47:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	the boot flag may not be set
2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	it might work better to resize the larger partion to fit first, then copy it.
2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	If you use the gparted live cd it can do all this
2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	have you had success with that in the past?
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	gparted cd? yes. Its awesome.
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	no no the resize trick you just said
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	but as with all partition programs your data may be lost. They don't guarantee anything.
2007-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	petervk	bigcx2	no. gparted live cd is probably the best bet.
2007-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	bigcx2	petervk	alright, thanks for your help
