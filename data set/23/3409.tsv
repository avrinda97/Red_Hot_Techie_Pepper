2011-11-03T12:42:00.000Z	MeanEYE		Anyone knows why my apache2 won't follow symlinks although in configuration it is turned on?
2011-11-03T12:43:00.000Z	JapyDooge	MeanEYE	maybe wrong rights on the destination file?
2011-11-03T12:43:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Am linking directory.
2011-11-03T12:43:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	0775 on all files.
2011-11-03T12:44:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Yes.
2011-11-03T12:44:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	drwxrwxr-x 10 meaneye meaneye 4096 2011-11-03 09:31 Web
2011-11-03T12:44:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	You don't have permission to access /shenkin on this server.
2011-11-03T12:45:00.000Z	JapyDooge	MeanEYE	on what user runs your apache? (i think default is www-data)
2011-11-03T12:45:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	default one... www-data
2011-11-03T12:46:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Tried, not working. But I'll try again.
2011-11-03T12:46:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Same.
2011-11-03T12:46:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Yeah. I've been hitting my head with this for an hour now.
2011-11-03T12:47:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Okies.
2011-11-03T12:48:00.000Z	JapyDooge	MeanEYE	how did you enable the symlinks?
2011-11-03T12:48:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	They should be enabled by default... but yes... that's the way they are enabled.
2011-11-03T12:49:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	not a vhost, just default /var/www site.
2011-11-03T12:49:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Weird, I know. And usually it worked out of the box... Now it doesn't.
2011-11-03T12:50:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Hm, I could create vhost. The same way phpmyadmin is doing. That would solve my problem I guess.
2011-11-03T12:51:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	I'll do it that way. Thank you anyway :D
2011-11-03T12:51:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Thanks. :D
2011-11-03T12:56:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Weird. Even with alias I get the same error. It's deffinately problem with permissions but I fail to see what.
2011-11-03T12:57:00.000Z	JapyDooge	MeanEYE	can u compare permissions of the phpmyadmin folder and yours?
2011-11-03T13:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	JapyDooge	Any luck?
