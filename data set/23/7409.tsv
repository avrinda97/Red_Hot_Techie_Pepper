2005-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	jdahm		hello
2005-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	jdahm		When I start up gnome, I get this error "Failed to inititate HAL" or something about starting up HAL
2005-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	jdahm		anyone know how to fix this?
2005-09-10T07:14:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	what is your dbus version?
2005-09-10T07:15:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	how do I check?
2005-09-10T07:15:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	in synaptic, or, if you like the command line, "dpkg -s dbus"
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	not installed :P
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	jdahm		Ill install it
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	wait, hoary?
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	yeah
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	ah, ok
2005-09-10T07:16:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	does that always happen? or just sometimes? did you enable DMA on your CD-ROMs?
2005-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	wait, synaptic tlells me its installed
2005-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	just sometimes
2005-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	it only gives the error on some bootups
2005-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	if you want, file a bug in Bugzilla and do the full hal debug described at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingRemovableDevices
2005-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	however, we can't fix hoary anyway, so maybe, if you can, you can check with the current Breezy live CD?
2005-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	ok I dont have one, is Breezy out now as stable?
2005-09-10T07:19:00.000Z	jdahm		ok
2005-09-10T07:19:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	not yet the release, but the preview is at Wednesday; the current Colony-4 should work already, and you can upgrad eto the releaese easily
2005-09-10T07:19:00.000Z	pitti	jdahm	but with the live CD you have no risk anyway
2005-09-10T07:19:00.000Z	jdahm		ah
2005-09-10T07:21:00.000Z	jdahm	pitti	thanks for the help, breakfast time
