2010-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly		 apt-get.  It'll be easier to you synaptic
2010-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly		*use synaptic
2010-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	apt-cache doesn't need sudo ;)
2010-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	take that back...no sudo....but installing you'll need sudo from the command line
2010-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	just the cache, users can search :D
2010-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	i usually don't use sudo at all
2010-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	for apt-get you will, users can't install packages
2010-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	but also for apt-get update you'll need sudo
2010-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	true but for apt-cache it's not needed
2010-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	just use nano, its way easier, just press CTRL+X and you are asked if you want to save or not
2010-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	he wants to know how to use vimtutor though...and I know this is Ubuntu channel but in other distros you might have to use vi or vim or joe's editor....it's good to know how to use at least "vi"
2010-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	i see, thought you were describing a file edit in terminal to fix stuff
2010-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	no I just told him some need to know commands for vim.
2010-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	gotcha, my bad :(
2011-02-07T08:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	i wouldn't say that...why do ppl think linux distros are invincable against hackers?
2011-02-07T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	i don't, i just make ubottu give the factoid
2011-02-07T08:34:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	firewalls are sometimes not enough in my personal opinion, especially when their are apps designed to brute force them though
2011-02-07T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	good routers will block repeated failed connection attempts
2011-02-07T08:38:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	when you have ppl like Incom trying to learn how to crack wifi, who's not to say he will not learn other tricks in backtrack to brute force through your network??
2011-02-07T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	i dont really worry
2011-02-07T08:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	i could tell them, or they can use websearches and find out just the same, what's the difference?
2011-02-07T08:41:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	ActionParsnip	i wasn't saying tell him how to use air-crack and air-dump, i was saying when the kids these days are learning these things...it'll be soon when they learn how to break through.  when i was in school i didn't learn how to set up networks and break down binary...we had oregon trail
2011-02-07T08:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Us3r_Unfriendly	i guess but its of no interest tome
