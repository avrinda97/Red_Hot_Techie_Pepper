2012-06-21T14:06:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt		The forums are terrible... they keep logging me out in either browser
2012-06-21T14:06:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt		Its enough to make getting support really difficult
2012-06-21T14:07:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt		I been using Ubuntu since 8.04 and I really feel like abandoning it now
2012-06-21T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	have you made a new user to test if your settings are bad?
2012-06-21T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	its just to test, why is that funny?
2012-06-21T14:08:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt	ActionParsnip	Just funny because I feel like I am jumping through hoops to configure an IP address
2012-06-21T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	are you wanting to use static IP?
2012-06-21T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	should do, are you configuring it right?
2012-06-21T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	if you can pastebin the interfaces file, we can advise.
2012-06-21T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	you forgot to add:  auto eth0
2012-06-21T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	echo "auto eth0" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces > /dev/null
2012-08-31T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	could use the locate command after running:  sudo updatedb'
2012-08-31T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	minus the apostrophe
2012-08-31T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	yes
2012-08-31T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	sudo updatedb; locate pg_hba.conf
2012-08-31T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	echo "text to add" | tee -a `sudo updatedb; locate pg_hba.conf`
2012-08-31T13:58:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt	ActionParsnip	your losing me with the updatedb part, not sure what that means
2012-08-31T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	it updates a database of every file in the filesystem
2012-08-31T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	updatedb makes finding files fast
2012-08-31T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	the downside to it is that chages are not recorded so you need to run updatedb for searches to be accurate
2012-08-31T14:00:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt	ActionParsnip	Thanks I didnt know about that
2012-08-31T14:01:00.000Z	d1rkp1tt	ActionParsnip	What was the tee ?
2012-08-31T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	d1rkp1tt	its to add to the file. I thought you wanted to find the filename and add some text to it
