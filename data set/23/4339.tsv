2008-10-20T01:50:00.000Z	chaosrl		does anyone know if using the "hostname" command in terminal gives the correct hostname for use in ssh?
2008-10-20T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	I suppose you would have to have your hostname in /etc/hosts pointing to 127.0.0.1 (or 127.0.1.1)
2008-10-20T01:55:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	i don't have a /etc/hosts folder?
2008-10-20T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	it's a file
2008-10-20T01:58:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	i have two different names for 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1, the one for 127.0.1.1 doesn't work and the other prompts for a pw that i'm not sure i know
2008-10-20T01:59:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	be more specific.  You lost me.
2008-10-20T02:02:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	i have the hostname "localhost" for 127.0.0.1, but when i plug that into "scp "somefile.doc" jeff@localhost:Desktop/" it prompts me for a password, which is not my normal login password
2008-10-20T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	it should be the user jeff's password
2008-10-20T02:04:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	well, when i open terminal, i have "jeff@lenovomon:~$", but when i try to scp to jeff@lenovomon, it says that the "host/servname not found". i just "sudo passwd" and reset the password, but it still wont take it as localhost, root or jeff
2008-10-20T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	ok.  Lets troubleshoot a single case.  What happens when you do 'ssh localhost'?
2008-10-20T02:06:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused
2008-10-20T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	did you install openssh-server?
2008-10-20T02:07:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	i thought i did but asking it to install shows that i didn't
2008-10-20T02:07:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	now when i use "ssh localhost" it prompts me for a password
2008-10-20T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	your user's password (assuming you ran that as your user)
2008-10-20T02:08:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	when i use my user's pw, it brings me back to a prompt (after some stuff about ubuntu being free software, etc) with jeff@lenovomon:~$
2008-10-20T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	yeah.  You just sshed.  Type 'exit' to logout
2008-10-20T02:10:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	ah, i see. after logging into my university account via ssh, the command "scp "something.doc" jeff@localhost:Desktop/" still prompts for a password that isn't my user's password
2008-10-20T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	localhost is the machine you are running the command from.  If you are sshed into your uni account then you are just copying it back to that computer (the one with the uni account)
2008-10-20T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	did you try since you installed openssh-server?
2008-10-20T02:13:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	yeah, it still didn't work
2008-10-20T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	chaosrl	then dulak is probably on the right track with a firewall/router issue, listen to him
2008-10-20T02:14:00.000Z	chaosrl	jrib	alright, thanks for your help!
