2010-11-21T21:05:00.000Z	Sheepherd		hey guys ive got somehow a invisible partition. its mounted but its only accessible through the command line and i cant $umount it cuz its busy. thats my fstab http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294249/ dont think that anythings wrong with it but i guess it cant harm to check that.
2010-11-21T21:07:00.000Z	juk	Sheepherd	check lsof and kill who using it
2010-11-21T21:28:00.000Z	Sheepherd	juk	i think you meant $lsof /dump (since /dump is the mount point of that partition) but this gives me following error: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294260/
2010-11-21T21:29:00.000Z	juk	Sheepherd	what?
2010-11-21T21:30:00.000Z	Sheepherd	juk	to find out which process uses that partition so i can kill it and unmount and remount the partition
2010-11-21T21:32:00.000Z	juk	Sheepherd	reboot
2010-11-21T21:32:00.000Z	Sheepherd	juk	k... later
2010-11-21T21:37:00.000Z	Sheepherd	juk	ok i just realized why i couldnt $umount that partition... i was in a folder inside it. but that doesnt change the fact that this mount point isnt accessible through Places. how did that happen?
