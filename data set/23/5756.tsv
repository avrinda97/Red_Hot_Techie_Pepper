2006-10-12T08:19:00.000Z	effie_jayx		has anyone gotten SVG to work on firefox?
2006-10-12T08:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	most SVG works OK; some parts still aren't supported
2006-10-12T08:20:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	could you try a URL to see if it works on your box?
2006-10-12T08:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	sure - what is it?
2006-10-12T08:22:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 http://www.tomjewett.com/dbdesign/dbdesign.php?page=intro.html&imgsize=medium
2006-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	it looks fine in both FF & Opera 9.02 - which part is supposed to be SVG?
2006-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 all the UML diagrams on the site
2006-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 I can't see them on Firefox...

2006-10-12T08:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	neither can I, in either FF or Opera. I think the trouble is that "Adobe SVG" does not equal "Real SVG as understood by newer browsers"
2006-10-12T08:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	I'd email the author of that website, and ask him to redo his diagrams in something other than Adobe SVG.. note that according to Adobe's own SVG Plugin page, they're discontinuing support for it in Jan 1 2007
2006-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	please don't recommend that here, you don't want to be resposible for breaking people's Ubuntu, do you?
2006-10-24T09:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	interesting discovery - the automatix crew haven't changed very much, I see...
2006-10-24T09:17:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	I don't care... I won't lead anyone else to them...
2006-10-24T09:26:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	it is obvious someone had a run into with them... but it is no reason for disregarding people here in the channel
2006-10-24T09:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	there have been several run-ins with the Automatix developer
2006-10-24T09:28:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 what about easy ubuntu?
2006-10-24T09:28:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 can I tell andy about it?
2006-10-24T09:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	sure
2006-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 andy = one happy costumer
2006-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	 scratch that... one happy user...
2006-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	effie_jayx	good to know, and yes, MS might have customers, but Ubuntu has users. Users are better.
2006-10-24T09:42:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Madpilot	and HUMAN users ... humble... ready to learn and to to lead...
