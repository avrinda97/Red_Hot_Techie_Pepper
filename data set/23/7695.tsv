2005-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	you are a victim of bad packaging
2005-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	what can I do?
2005-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	this was the RC of breezy :\
2005-10-14T15:55:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	i did
2005-10-14T15:56:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	then d/l a newer daily http://cdimage.ubuntu.com
2005-10-14T15:56:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	or apt-get update
2005-10-14T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	yes please research at bugzilla.ubuntu.com and either add it or comment it
2005-10-14T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	np
2005-12-01T09:30:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	please dont advise permission changes on directories not owned by the user
2005-12-01T09:30:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	it was owned by him.. he chowned it
2005-12-01T09:30:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	i didnt see the directory involved , which one was it?
2005-12-01T09:31:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	no no. Skullb0x has a fstab issue, not a permission issue
2005-12-01T09:31:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	got me ;)  i didn't ask... i am guessing his/her usb drive is formatted NTFS rather than anything else
2005-12-01T09:31:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	changing the perms in /media/* won't work
2005-12-01T09:32:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	it works temporarily
2005-12-01T09:32:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	no it doesnt, cuz the mounted drive still has been mounted with no-entry perms
2005-12-01T09:33:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	possibly... but not necessarily... could just be the mount point itself is b0rkd
2005-12-01T09:33:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	usually problems in /media/ or /mnt/ are in the fstab, not system perms
2005-12-01T09:33:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	very true... i'll say it... you're right, i'm wrong ;)
2005-12-01T09:34:00.000Z	nalioth	burner	it's not about being right, using "chmod" on those dirs can damage the box
2005-12-01T09:34:00.000Z	burner	nalioth	i hear ya
