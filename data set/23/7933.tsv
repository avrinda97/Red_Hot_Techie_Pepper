2005-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	Marble2		How do I get my mouse working so I can use mouse3,4, and 5 like in windows?
2005-03-29T14:51:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	 Edit /etc/X/xorg.conf and put the following line in:
2005-03-29T14:53:00.000Z	Marble2	DarthFrog	there is no x folder
2005-03-29T14:53:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	 It's case sensitive.
2005-03-29T14:54:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Are you running Warty?  If so, it'll be called XFree86-4
2005-03-29T14:55:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	 Do "apt-get update" first.
2005-03-29T14:56:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	And then you might want to consider doing "apt-get dist-upgrade".
2005-03-29T14:56:00.000Z	Marble2	DarthFrog	what would that do?
2005-03-29T14:57:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	That would upgrade your installation to the latest & greatest.  And, perhaps, break something temporarily.
2005-03-29T14:57:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Don't worry about breakage, though.  Just do it. :-)
2005-03-29T14:59:00.000Z	Marble2	DarthFrog	how do I restart x
2005-03-29T15:00:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Logout, then hit CTL-ALT-Backspace.
2005-03-29T15:00:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Yes.
2005-03-29T15:04:00.000Z	Marble2	DarthFrog	what do I do now
2005-03-29T15:05:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	 Try it.  It probably works now.
2005-03-29T15:06:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Check xorg.conf for "ZAxis Mapping "4 5""
2005-03-29T15:07:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	In the section Section "InputDevice", there should be a line, Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
2005-03-29T15:08:00.000Z	Marble2	DarthFrog	I do have         Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "6 7"
2005-03-29T15:09:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Ah, I don't know.  I've never had such a fancy mouse. :-)
2005-03-29T15:09:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	I shouldn't think so.
2005-03-29T15:24:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	Configure Gnome to not save the current session upon logout.
2005-03-29T15:24:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	I don't know.  I don't run Gnome.
2005-04-14T12:26:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Marble2	 Suez, Juarez. :-)
