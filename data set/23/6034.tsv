2007-03-20T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	 wow what ?
2007-03-20T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	did you edit xorg.conf to add the resolution you wanted ?
2007-03-20T07:10:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Pelo	i did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg with the same options i used on dapper
2007-03-20T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	  then  you do  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and you add the resolutions you want to the list
2007-03-20T07:12:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Pelo	in using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg i selected resolutions that i want. these were then automatically written to my xorg conf
2007-03-20T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	  maybe you don'T have the right refresh rate for your screen or something
2007-03-20T07:14:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Pelo	it worked on dapper :(
2007-03-20T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	 you should have copied over your xorg.conf file from dapper
2007-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Pelo	tried that already. maybe fglrx has problems with x64?
2007-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	zahlerstreik	 that is a possiblility,  check to forum to see if anyone had the same issue , they might have found a solution
