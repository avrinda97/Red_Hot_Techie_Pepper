2005-04-06T07:04:00.000Z	MadHadron		Good heavens.  I haven't been in a channel this full in years...
2005-04-06T07:04:00.000Z	MadHadron		I mean, I knew there was a community, but when my client scrolls through two screens to print the member list.
2005-04-06T07:05:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	that is just the tip of the iceberg
2005-04-06T07:30:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Actually I just discovered that synaptic has a nice interface to adding the repositories as well.
2005-04-06T07:30:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	i always forget gui things, /me is a terminal fan :)
2005-04-06T07:31:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	I discovered it while helping someone.
2005-04-06T07:31:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	My default environment is larswm, which just about classifies me.
2005-04-06T07:46:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Oh, is that where they are?
2005-04-06T07:46:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	yep :)
2005-04-06T07:46:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Now I'm mildly embarrassed at having hard installed the thing.
2005-04-06T07:52:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	but at the cost of prepending that stupid K everywhere
2005-04-06T07:53:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Yes, but I'm about as impartial as you'll get.  I don't much care for color or mice on my desktop.
2005-04-06T08:03:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Amarok is a very well designed music player
2005-04-06T08:03:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	It also interfaces extremely nicely with k3b
2005-04-06T08:52:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	You know you're dated when your default mode of interaction is not longer common knowledge.
2005-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	nope
2005-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	as they should
2005-04-06T09:21:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	define obscure?
2005-04-06T09:22:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Classical music from the late 3rd to the early 19th century, and certain chamber and symphonic works of the 20th century.
2005-04-06T09:22:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	What I play myself, essentially.
2005-04-06T09:22:00.000Z	Seveas	MadHadron	that's not obscure
2005-04-06T09:22:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	Maybe I have an odd perspective since I'm on a university campus.
2005-04-06T09:23:00.000Z	MadHadron	Seveas	I think the other issue is that current encoding schemes don't handle multimovement works well
