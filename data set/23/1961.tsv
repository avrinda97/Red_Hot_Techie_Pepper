2009-08-21T03:15:00.000Z	dividebyzer0		I have a question: I have a laptop that has a subwoofer and the volume isnt nearly as loud as it was on windows.. how do i go about fixing this?
2009-08-21T03:16:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	have you visited the volume options?
2009-08-21T03:16:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	you mean the Alsa mixer?
2009-08-21T03:17:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	well yes, but have you been into prefs there and enabled all of your other channels?
2009-08-21T03:17:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	a lot of them will be disabled and set to zero be default
2009-08-21T03:18:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	which device do I use?
2009-08-21T03:18:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	can I PM you?
2009-08-21T03:18:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	right click on your volume icon, and choose prefs, then enable all your devices
2009-08-21T03:18:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	sure
2009-08-24T09:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	yes, you just need to specify it in your config
2009-08-24T09:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	for the virtualbox i mean
2009-08-24T09:21:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	its running tinyxp
2009-08-24T09:21:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	so I would need to shut the VB down first to change that configuration?
2009-08-24T09:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	yes you do. then you can map it in the virtual machines networking options
2009-08-24T09:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	easy ;)
2009-08-24T09:22:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	k Ill give that a shot thanks, brb

2009-08-24T09:29:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	hey I cant find the shared folder though.. for some reason
2009-08-24T09:30:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	dividebyzer0	did u navigate to your machine correctly? try IP if hostname isnt working
2009-08-24T09:30:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	one sec.. lemme shut down and verify the path
2009-08-24T09:31:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	b3rz3rk3r	the path is /home/dividebyzer0/.VirtualBox/Machines/TinyXP
