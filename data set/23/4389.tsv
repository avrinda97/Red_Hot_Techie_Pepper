2007-08-27T05:46:00.000Z	henkdetank		in order to allow apache to work with files and folders that I have made, i have set the user and group of apache to mine. Is this a dumb thing to do?
2007-08-27T05:48:00.000Z	henkdetank		does anyone know this???

2007-08-27T05:49:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	if its not production, you don't have to worry :)
2007-08-27T05:51:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	just set it back before you expose itto the net
2007-08-27T05:53:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	good practice
2007-08-27T05:53:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	from memory, apache drops privs to nobody so that if a vuln is found they can't compromise the box
2007-08-27T05:54:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	I mean its about exposure - if you don't really care too much about the data or the box, and you can always format it... then who cares :)
2007-08-27T05:55:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	just do sudo chown -R oldowner:oldgroup on the www folder before you open the port
2007-08-27T05:56:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	I think apache has a directive in it's config filethat sets what user/group it drops privs to
2007-08-27T05:57:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	better off adding yourself to the same group the apache user is in
2007-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	so which group was old group?
2007-08-27T06:01:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	go System->admin->users and groups
2007-08-27T06:03:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	yes
2007-08-27T06:03:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	so retry with "touch test" inside www folder
2007-08-27T06:06:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	you logged in with a shell? disconnect and reconnect
2007-08-27T06:07:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	yeah unmount remount
2007-08-27T06:07:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	possible... I can't remember if samba has default masks and accounts too
2007-08-27T06:08:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	one sec, I'll take a peep
2007-08-27T06:11:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	which one did it? reconnect?
2007-08-27T06:16:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	no prob man
2007-08-27T06:16:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	:)
2007-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	jeffferrari	henkdetank	sudo chown -R newowner:newgroup
