2008-11-05T19:00:00.000Z	apelgate		hello. what does it mean when a process is showing more thgan 100% cpu usage on "top" ? I thought 100% was the cpu usage limit.
2008-11-05T19:01:00.000Z	apelgate		ah I understand
2008-11-05T19:01:00.000Z	apelgate		how can I check how many cpus are working on that machine, mynous ?
2008-11-05T19:01:00.000Z	apelgate		ops it was Myrtti
2008-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	you might want to use htop instead of top
2009-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	what do you want to download?
2009-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	and what is wrong with installing them the normal way?
2009-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	how old?
2009-03-11T12:25:00.000Z	apelgate	ziroday	7.04 feisty
2009-03-11T12:26:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	right, thats because feisty is EOL
2009-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	if you want packages you need to upgrade or use old-releases (really not recommended)
2009-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	why can't you upgrade?
2009-03-11T12:28:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	well its just going to get nastier the longer you leave it :). If you need them badly you can get them from old-releases
2009-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	one sec
2009-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	you need to replace the current repo's with the ones outlined in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades. They will contain the postfix packages you need
2009-03-11T12:30:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	also, production servers should not be running old, possibly unsecure apps :)
2009-03-11T12:46:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	sendmail might be better, compared to a full MTA
2009-03-11T12:47:00.000Z	apelgate	ziroday	yes. maybe
2009-03-11T12:48:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	if you only need it to send you a mail when something fails thats a much better way then slapping in postfix
2009-03-11T12:54:00.000Z	apelgate	ziroday	I will test that.. it probably has less dependencies as well
2009-03-23T15:36:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	you need to upgrade
2009-03-23T15:37:00.000Z	apelgate	ziroday	It's not possible on this production environment. Do I need to download them somewhere?
2009-03-23T15:38:00.000Z	ziroday	apelgate	seriously, you need to upgrade :)
