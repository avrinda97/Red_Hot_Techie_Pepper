2010-01-31T06:35:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	Blue1 wanted to center window when opening??
2010-01-31T06:36:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	Blue1 you want window centering when  a particular app opens without configuring text files, is this right ?
2010-01-31T06:37:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	tired gconf-editor with apps > metecity > general change fullscreen to center didn't work
2010-01-31T06:38:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	Blue1, I admit that using the windows plugins in compiz makes this easier, but you'd have to be willing to use other ways to manage your workspaces
2010-01-31T06:39:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	are you ok compiz has loads of choices when it comes to managing windows drag object around cube to window
2010-01-31T06:39:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	cube is pointless in my opinion... there are stronger elements to compiz than the cube
2010-01-31T06:40:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	like grouping that is cool
2010-02-21T18:09:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	doesn't clonezilla fullfill the same task as nortons ghost ?
2010-02-21T18:11:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	or does clonezilla not provide the option to generate a cd/dvd image that is bootable for the purposes of a seelf contained restore solution
2010-02-21T18:11:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	where is there a hand book that explains this is a wrong solution,, I can think of probably 2 or 3 more solutions that are out side the box for backup linux
2010-02-21T18:11:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	thats not my question... just wondering if clonezilla does eactly the same things as nortons ghost
2010-02-21T18:13:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	i mean because i like how nortons ghost allows you to dump the resulting hdd image dump into an iso that is merged with its bootable image so you can have the hdd image on the same iso as the recovery image.
2010-02-21T18:13:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	yes clonezilla is said to do the same as nortons ghost and partition image... never used clonezilla sorry can't give you full specs..
2010-02-21T18:13:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	ok
2010-02-21T18:14:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	problem with Nortons Ghost is it has times when backups are unreilable
2010-02-21T18:14:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	what ghosting a hard drive software is 100% correct
2010-02-21T18:15:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	that is why I like zip drives with speed increase to burn a backup of the important information 3 mintues on a burn thats great...
2010-02-21T18:16:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	you mean iomega zip drives ?
2010-02-21T18:16:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	yes
2010-02-21T18:17:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	love that iomega zip drive ... hope the company will be around another 10 years
2010-02-21T18:20:00.000Z	archboxman	airtonix	seeing is how the iomega drive uses a usb 2.0 interface .... I'm going with an external drive that has 3.0 usb speeds of transfering files...
2010-02-21T18:21:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	its very appealing
2010-02-21T19:27:00.000Z	airtonix	archboxman	i keep my netbook in a state of suspension... bit faster than actually cold booting
