2005-07-26T13:47:00.000Z	robotgeek		alrite, l8r guys!
2005-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	robotgeek		zeedo, are you using pbbuttons?
2005-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	Are you refering to me? or zeedo?
2005-07-26T11:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	sorry
2005-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	It's alright, no I'm not using pbbuttons
2005-07-26T11:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	pbbuttons gave me options to change stuff, as in master/pcm, but the gnome tool doesn't
2005-07-26T11:13:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	Ah, well should I still use it, even though all the keys it "fixes" works on my laptop already (ie brightness, volume (even though it's the wrong one, the bar still moves)...not eject though, or crt/lcd
2005-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	i'll brb, gotta email :)
2005-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	heh alright
2005-07-26T11:47:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	did u figure something out?
2005-07-26T11:51:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	Nope
2005-07-26T11:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	same here :(
2005-07-26T11:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	but, atleast the volume control works, with some configuring
2005-07-26T11:52:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	The volume control does work, just not for pcm which is what i would like (since master does nothing)
2005-07-26T11:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	i meant the volume control in the notification area
2005-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	thanks for torrentflux, looks good
2005-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	You're looking for a good torrent proggy too?
2005-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	i am using the official client, works well on my slow ppc box
2005-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	I was using it, then I switched to Azureus but it has a horrible memory leak (I've gone from using 208 before running it to 274 when it started, to 346 now)
2005-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	azureus starts, and then crashes...on ppc, java sucks!
2005-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	zerboxx	robotgeek	hehe tuchez
2005-09-01T05:31:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	also a ralink chipset
2005-09-01T05:44:00.000Z	robotgeek	zerboxx	obviously everyone has been telling you about the niceties of having a Prism based card?
