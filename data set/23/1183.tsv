2011-08-24T20:33:00.000Z	grendal-prime		ya so this blows i have to use gksu to run nautilus now?
2011-08-24T20:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	you don't need to use gksu to run nautilus? why would you
2011-08-24T20:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	open a terminal and try running nautilus, tell me what happens
2011-08-24T20:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	by typing 'nautilus' in the terminal and hitting enter
2011-08-24T20:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	is nautilus running
2011-08-24T20:46:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	nothing i literally flashes the screen and nothing happens
2011-08-24T20:46:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	actually the screen doesnt even flash.
2011-08-24T20:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	is nautilus running in the system monitor?
2011-08-24T20:47:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	yep
2011-08-24T20:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	kill it, then try starting nautilus again
2011-08-24T20:48:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	that didnt work ither. (tried that earlyer as well)
2011-08-24T20:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	is it running as root?
2011-08-24T20:50:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	doesnt say in the system mon..let me look under htop
2011-08-24T20:53:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	not i got this desktop flashing thing that happens when i try and fire it off
2011-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	 ya so i can create a folder on the desktop and then open it with nautilus but i cannot creat a launcher for it and i cannot launch if from the menu
2011-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	dont know what that means but thought it might help
2011-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	have you tried logging out and seeing if it persists?
2011-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	yes several times.   Also everything will work so long as i dont go to my home dir...must be some sort of permissions problem?
2011-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	maybe
2011-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	your home directory is normal right?
2011-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	onlything in the dir not owned by the user is .htoprc  that is root:root   and .gvfs is werid...basically a bunch of ????????
2011-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	grendal-prime	that's probably not the problem
2011-08-24T21:19:00.000Z	grendal-prime	tensorpudding	ya that gvfs thing is werid
