2006-07-05T05:35:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		i got  a question, here it is, if i use gmailfs to hold files and then link to them from a webpage will the file go through my network or straight from gmail to the user?
2006-07-05T05:36:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		it is found in /etc/X11/
2006-07-05T05:36:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	that depends on what the anchor tag looks like I suppose
2006-07-05T05:37:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	<a href="/mountpoint/song.mp3" djmix </a>
2006-07-05T05:38:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	<a href="/mountpoint/song.mp3">djmix </a>
2006-07-05T05:38:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	yeah, that will go to your filesystem and will fail unless it's configured to be a web accessible area
2006-07-05T05:38:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	what would the anchor have to look like to get it right from gmail?
2006-07-05T05:39:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	it would have to look something like <a href="https://mail.google.com/path to stuff>link</a>
2006-07-05T05:39:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	so then every user would have to know the username/password =(
2006-07-05T05:39:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	which I suppose would not work at all because they would have to log into your gmail account
2006-07-05T05:40:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	right
2006-07-05T05:40:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	anyway yeah i kinda figured it would go from google to me to them
2006-07-05T05:40:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	if i used gmailfs
2006-07-05T05:40:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	which would suck even more for me heh
2006-07-05T05:41:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	as opposed to hosting it myself at least
2006-07-05T05:41:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	yeah, but again it would have to be a web accessible area so you would probably want to limit access
2006-07-05T05:41:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	if you were to host it yourself that is and use a file system anchor tag
2006-07-05T05:41:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	i guess what i could do is limit apache2's upload speed, you know what i should read up on to do that?
2006-07-05T05:42:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	i really dont want it to interfear with my quake3 matches =/
2006-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	sorry I stepped away there for a sec, let me take a look
2006-07-05T05:47:00.000Z	dgh1973	Lord-ChewY	try this out, I didn't look at it closely but it was the first hit on a goolge search of "apache upload throttling"... http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-networking/13664-upload-speed-limiting-apache.html
2006-07-05T05:50:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	dgh1973	thanks
