2011-02-20T17:52:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	mute it with the mixer
2011-02-20T17:52:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	 i done but i still active
2011-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	it still active i want say
2011-02-20T17:54:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	apps like skype have a 'let me control the mixer' if skype is running, then that over rides the mixer.
2011-02-20T17:58:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	i close skype but still have same problem
2011-02-20T17:59:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	you shut skype, you muted it in the mixer, and the mike is still on?
2011-02-20T18:00:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	yes! if i touch the micro i hear noise
2011-02-20T18:01:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	open your mixer, and make sure you can see all devices.
2011-02-20T18:02:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	there might be a second mike input
2011-02-20T18:03:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	no device now
2011-02-20T18:06:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	open a term and run alsamixer
2011-02-20T18:06:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	you should see all audio devices attached to the machine
2011-02-20T18:07:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	done and now?
2011-02-20T18:07:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	or mikes ?
2011-02-20T18:08:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	lets try the shotgun approach, MUTE EVERYTHING and start unmuting them one at a time
2011-02-20T18:10:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	i mute everything and now the mic is silent if i touch
2011-02-20T18:10:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	cool. now unmute ONE AT A TIME
2011-02-20T18:11:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	then you'll know which is the real mike.
2011-02-20T18:12:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	yes is the last one, the f-mic
2011-02-20T18:12:00.000Z	blkdg	volvering	there you go.
2011-02-20T18:13:00.000Z	volvering	blkdg	tanks
