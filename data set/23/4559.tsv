2007-07-26T10:04:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro		Anyone? '_'
2007-07-26T10:05:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro		Does anyone know how to edit sessions from the command line?  Like what file do I edit, and what text editor should I use?
2007-07-26T10:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 what sessions you refering to?
2007-07-26T10:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 properties menu? startup programs? Huh?
2007-07-26T10:07:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro	dr_willis	I'm not sure D:  Beryl messed up and I have Beryl as a startup program
2007-07-26T10:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 I dont touch Beryl. :P
2007-07-26T10:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 you are refering to the LOGIN SCREEN sessions?  in the gdm menus?
2007-07-26T10:12:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro	dr_willis	it has nothing to do with Beryl I'm asking a general question
2007-07-26T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 the GDM login manager, and KDM both get their desktop sessions listing from those files.
2007-07-26T10:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 there is no one file for the GDM sessions
2007-07-26T10:16:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro	dr_willis	I have it open right now
2007-07-26T10:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 there is no 'one' file.
2007-07-26T10:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 that 'session' is NOT the same session as the gdm/kdm desktop sessions
2007-07-26T10:19:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro	dr_willis	kay well how do I edit it
2007-07-26T10:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 not sure you mean by 'edit' it.
2007-07-26T10:20:00.000Z	Almighty_Henaro	dr_willis	how do I change the settings of it
2007-07-26T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 it may not even be a 'text'file you can edit for gnome. they have some compex setting files.
2007-07-26T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Almighty_Henaro	 you COULD just move/remove/remane the .gnome* dirs to some other dir.
