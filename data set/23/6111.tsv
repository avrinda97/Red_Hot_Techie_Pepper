2006-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	runlevel 2 is default in ubuntu
2007-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	you'd probably have to script that
2008-05-13T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	depends on the bug, usually only security bugs or big bugs are going to get fixed
2008-05-13T16:08:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	Hmmm, how easy is it to get the source of an ubuntu package and then rebuild that pkg (after fixing the bug, which is of course not part of my question ;-)
2008-05-13T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	erm, hold on
2008-05-13T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	you got the apt link, not the link to supybot right?
2008-05-13T16:11:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	I got a link to the Debian doc using `apt-get -b source <pkg>`
2008-05-13T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	yeah, that's what you want
2008-05-13T16:11:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	"-b" only to instantly build it ... I'll read that, thanks.
2008-05-13T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Contributing#head-b205c74e27fe15e79e10c9e7f14d3cdfb359d81d may be more useful if you actually want to help with bugs
2008-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	The relevant package is part of "main", not {un,mult}iverse.
2008-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	What's a reccommended way to manage both security updates from ubuntu and my own patch to a package? Will updates still be announced by `aptitude update`, for example?
2008-05-13T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	procedure for patching would be the same
2008-05-13T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	I just use 'dch -i' to increment the version.  There may be a better way to ensure that the security repository's version is preferred in case the increment the version in a different way.  Not sure how though
2009-01-23T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	gparted
2012-11-06T16:33:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	alocer: .cur is only 18 MB
2012-11-06T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	find out what exactly is taking up that space
2012-11-06T16:29:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	alocer: Itâ€™s the directory ~/.thunderbird/<uuid>/ImapMail/<imapp_account>  Do you need more specific data?
2012-11-06T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	yes
2012-11-06T16:32:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	alocer: The three largest files in that directory: 1353    ./Trash      629     ./sent      189     ./INBOX
2012-11-06T16:32:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	alocer: .Trash on the server is 25 MB
2012-11-06T16:40:00.000Z	vlt	jrib	Do you need more specific data?
2012-11-06T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	vlt	I would yeah.  But maybe at this point you may want to do some research about whether it's normal for whatever reason
