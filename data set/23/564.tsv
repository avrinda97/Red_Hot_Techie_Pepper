2011-06-04T05:48:00.000Z	djiefo	osse	not in ubuntu11 maybe
2011-06-04T05:49:00.000Z	osse	djiefo	where is the file now? Is it a menu item or just a file somewhere?
2011-06-04T05:50:00.000Z	djiefo		just a file somewhere
2011-06-04T05:50:00.000Z	osse		what happens when you right-click and choose Properties (at the bottom) from the menu that appears?
2011-06-04T05:51:00.000Z	osse	djiefo	see above
2011-06-04T05:52:00.000Z	djiefo	osse	i said its a file somewhere
2011-06-04T05:52:00.000Z	osse		Yes, but what happens when you right-click it and choose Properties from the menu that appears?
2011-06-04T05:53:00.000Z	djiefo		i dont have any opition to change icon
2011-06-04T05:53:00.000Z	djiefo		option*
2011-06-04T05:54:00.000Z	osse	djiefo	it doesn't say "Change icon" anywhere. After you choose properties, click the picture to the top left inside the small window that appears
2011-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	djiefo	osse	nothing happens
2011-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	djiefo		xubuntu 11
2011-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	osse	djiefo	ahhhh. Then I don't know, sorry. I thought you were on regular ubuntu
2011-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	djiefo	osse	:'(
2011-06-04T06:00:00.000Z	osse	djiefo	there is an IRC channel called #xubuntu. You can probably ask there.
