2006-04-10T16:36:00.000Z	gonzobrains		or get all my friends to just use IRC or KDX
2006-04-10T16:36:00.000Z	gonzobrains		anyone use KDX here?
2006-04-10T16:36:00.000Z	gonzobrains		http://www.haxial.com
2006-04-10T16:36:00.000Z	gonzobrains		like modern-day bbs'ing over the internet
2006-04-10T16:38:00.000Z	gonzobrains		weird chat protocols?
2006-04-10T16:38:00.000Z	gonzobrains		i use AIM, MSN, and Yahoo!
2006-04-10T16:38:00.000Z	gonzobrains		KDX: i dont mind using KDX standalone.  it's much more than just chat. it's file sharing, chatting, remote computer access, etc.
2006-04-10T16:38:00.000Z	gonzobrains		what is GAIM exactly? and why does it suck?
2006-04-10T16:39:00.000Z	gonzobrains		how did the makers reverse-engineer the msn, aim, etc. protocols?
2006-04-10T16:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	gaim is a IM chat client that handle many protocols such as aim, msn, yahoo
2006-04-10T16:39:00.000Z	gonzobrains	tristanmike	is gaim stable?
2006-04-10T16:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	yeah, of course
2006-04-10T16:40:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	it's included by default under Internet
2006-04-10T16:40:00.000Z	gonzobrains	tristanmike	does it only support limited chatting or everything like audibles, image sharing, etc.?
2006-04-10T16:40:00.000Z	gonzobrains	tristanmike	 i see it. i will hafta try it out
2006-04-10T16:41:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	...not sure about audibles, don't use yahoo that much, filesharing is semi-ok
2006-04-10T16:41:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	does not support web cam at this time
2006-04-10T16:41:00.000Z	gonzobrains	tristanmike	i guess basic chat will work for now.
2006-04-10T16:41:00.000Z	tristanmike	gonzobrains	that's where I'm at
