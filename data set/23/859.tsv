2011-01-21T19:28:00.000Z	ronr__		If VLC gives me this error: "Please update alsa-lib to version 1.0.23-2-g8d80d5f or higher to try to fix this issue." How do I fix it?

2011-01-21T19:29:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	cute ;) but how do I do that?
2011-01-21T19:29:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	have you done an apt-get update, upgrade lately?
2011-01-21T19:30:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	yup. last night.
2011-01-21T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	and what is the current version of alsa-lib?
2011-01-21T19:30:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	I don't even know how to check that :-/
2011-01-21T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	dpkg -l | grep -i alsa
2011-01-21T19:32:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	there's no alsa-lib in that list.
2011-01-21T19:33:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	probably called "libasound" or the like.
2011-01-21T19:34:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	right. all those are 1.0.23-lubuntu2.1
2011-01-21T19:34:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	it looks like there's an extra fix that isn't downloaded (1.0.23-2)
2011-01-21T19:35:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	are you running the latest vlc, by the way?
2011-01-21T19:35:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	the latest from the ubuntu repo, which is not the latest from the vlc site.
2011-01-21T19:35:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	and you see this error consistently?
2011-01-21T19:36:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	probably since the last update I did. I can hear sound, but only stereo.
2011-01-21T19:41:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	sorry to bother you but do you happen to have any other suggestions?
2011-01-21T19:42:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	i'm afraid i don't, sorry. if you're running the latest vlc and ancillary software, probably worth filing a bug report (check first to see if someone already has done)
2011-01-21T19:43:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	a bug report where though? is this a vlc issue? alsa? ubuntu?
2011-01-21T19:43:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	the error comes up when you run vlc, so start there.
2011-01-21T19:44:00.000Z	ronr__	sipior	alright, thanks for the help :)
2011-01-21T19:44:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	the bug should be submitted for the vlc package under ubuntu, to be clear
2011-01-21T19:44:00.000Z	sipior	ronr__	the vlc maintainers will just send you back to the ubuntu folks
