2012-07-26T21:26:00.000Z	treaver		Ok this is what happened. I installed the drivers I was looking for my wireless router sucessfully then I was following a tutorial to edit grub to make the resolution start screen not come up cause it kept saying "Rosolution doesn't fit" or something. So I saved it and restarted computer

2012-07-26T21:26:00.000Z	treaver		Is there a way to enter terminal from the start?

2012-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	treaver		Can someone please help me I'm desperate now my computer won't even start up
2012-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	What's the question?
2012-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	So you can't boot at all?
2012-07-26T21:32:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	hold shift while you boot, and when you get to the grub menu, see if you have a rescue mode you can boot into. That should give you CLI access to the machine, where you can fight with your X config.
2012-07-26T21:32:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Did you hold shift down during boot?
2012-07-26T21:35:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Can you ssh into the machine from another one?
2012-07-26T21:36:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Yes
2012-07-26T21:37:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	You can't ssh from the laptop to the desktop?
2012-07-26T21:37:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Do you know what "telnet" is?
2012-07-26T21:39:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Do you know what remote desktop is?
2012-07-26T21:39:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	It's like remote desktop, but for the command-line
2012-07-26T21:39:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	I assume you have Windows installed on your laptop?
2012-07-26T21:40:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Do you know what IP address your desktop machine has on the network?
2012-07-26T21:42:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Alt-F7 should take you back to the broken desktop
2012-07-26T21:44:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	treaver	Hold the Left Alt key and hit the left arraow until you get back to the hting where you can see your mouse
