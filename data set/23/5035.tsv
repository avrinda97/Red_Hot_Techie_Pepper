2007-09-21T09:45:00.000Z	riotkittie		uh. stupid question time.  wpa_supplicant.conf should be in /etc/wpa_supplicant and not /etc/ right? :o
2007-09-21T09:47:00.000Z	riotkittie		and wpa_supplicant.conf should exist if wpasupplicant's installed? si?

2007-09-21T09:48:00.000Z	riotkittie		then searched the list of compatible devices, chose one... and am getting nowhere
2007-09-21T09:48:00.000Z	riotkittie		and i'm so sick of being !wireless'ed
2007-09-21T09:49:00.000Z	riotkittie		it's not like i haven't read the documentation. it's not like i havent checked the forums. so !knockitoff ;P
