2008-12-30T21:43:00.000Z	Neurologic		sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0644, should be 0440
2008-12-30T21:43:00.000Z	Neurologic		What does this mean?
2008-12-30T21:44:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	Change the authorization for /etc/sudoerrs to r--r-----
2008-12-30T21:44:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	"sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoerrs"
2008-12-30T21:45:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	I can't use any sudo command, it returns that error
2008-12-30T21:45:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	Switch to root then
2008-12-30T21:45:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	use su -
2008-12-30T21:47:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	that's not working, any password I put in it gives me authentication failures
2008-12-30T21:47:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	Because you havent set any password for root yet then
2008-12-30T21:48:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	okay...so how do I set a root password then?
2008-12-30T21:54:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.backup
2008-12-30T21:49:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	well, you have no sudo authority, and no password for root... Looks like you have to blank the password for root in /etc/shadow, and reboot in recovery mode and set one
2008-12-30T21:50:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	I can't open /etc/shadow
2008-12-30T21:50:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	no permission =P
2008-12-30T21:50:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	Yes, this is why you have to use your Ub untu install CD
2008-12-30T21:51:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	boot up with that, go inside your installed Ubuntu, and blank the password with editing it with gedit
2008-12-30T21:51:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	ah ok...
2008-12-30T21:52:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	ok, I'll brb then =) Thanks
2008-12-30T21:53:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	Good luck, secury /etc/shadow before doing modifications
2008-12-30T21:53:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	secury?
2008-12-30T21:54:00.000Z	norbert79	Neurologic	"secure"
2008-12-30T21:54:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	uh, how would I do that?
2008-12-30T21:54:00.000Z	Neurologic	norbert79	OH! right righ
