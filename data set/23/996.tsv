2011-09-26T03:24:00.000Z	RocketLauncher		i think internet sharing doesnt work because ubuntu doesnt even recognize my ethernet.. what do i do? god..
2011-09-26T03:26:00.000Z	RocketLauncher		yeah og01
2011-09-26T03:26:00.000Z	RocketLauncher		under wired networks i never see anything even when i enable internet sharing
2011-09-26T03:26:00.000Z	RocketLauncher		i'm sharing this computer's connection to another one and i use wifi here.. but i want to share it with ethernet..
2011-09-26T03:28:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	is this computer hooked "directly" to the internet?
2011-09-26T03:28:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	yagoo	yes, through wifi
2011-09-26T03:28:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	it's probably better to get a wifi adapter for the other station..
2011-09-26T03:29:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	wifi is not a direct internet connection...
2011-09-26T03:29:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	i'm not sure if the tools support wifi as a NAT point..
2011-09-26T03:30:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	where's the AP ?
2011-09-26T03:30:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	that's windows.. but i'm not sure on linux..
2011-09-26T03:31:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	lookup NAT wifi
2011-09-26T03:31:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	problem is this..
2011-09-26T03:32:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	you need to have WIFI documented as the WAN interface..
2011-09-26T03:32:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	which means.. almost impossible documentation
2011-09-26T03:33:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	you can try it.. but treat the WAN wifi interface from documentation as its a LAN interface..
2011-09-26T03:33:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	so instead of eth0 mentioned in documentation, think of it as wlan0 or wifi0
2011-09-26T03:35:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	google "masquerade debian wiki"
2011-09-26T03:35:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	maybe this http://www.google.ca/search?q=masquerade+ubuntu+wiki&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a

2011-09-26T03:40:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	are you using a "cross-over" link rj45 cable? maybe u have to set it up with the driver.. or simply use a cross-over cable if the data-links don't light up
2011-09-26T03:41:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	yagoo	i dont have a crossover cable
2011-09-26T03:44:00.000Z	yagoo	RocketLauncher	i'm not sure if there's an option for cross-over somewhere, it's possible.. but I would use a cross-over cable to make things easier..
