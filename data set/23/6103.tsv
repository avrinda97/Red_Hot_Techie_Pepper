2006-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	faddat		Might there be a manual way to get flash onto my ubuntu-ness?
2006-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	the package is not working?
2006-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 Here's what happens, I'll do it right now so I can tell you exactly
2006-07-09T08:07:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 I'm going to follow www.ubuntuguide.org instructions
2006-07-09T08:08:00.000Z	faddat		now I'm selecting yes telling it I want it to download the package from the Internet
2006-07-09T08:09:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 Now, " Setting up flashplugin-nonfree (7.0.63.3ubuntu3) ..."  This is where it typically dies
2006-07-09T08:10:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 waiting......
2006-07-09T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	so does it eventually tell you it can't download the file?
2006-07-09T08:11:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 typically, it just does nothing
2006-07-09T08:11:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 Actually I've never had it tell me it can't download the file
2006-07-09T08:11:00.000Z	faddat		Jrib:  but I've figured that is the problem
2006-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	ok, download the file manually and put it on your desktop
2006-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	faddat		the .tar.gz file, right?
2006-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	right
2006-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	faddat		okay, one second....
2006-07-09T08:13:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 okay, done
2006-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	sudo update-flashplugin -l ~/Desktop
2006-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	faddat		oh, nice!
2006-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	faddat		Thanks man!
2006-07-09T08:15:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	I'm going to restart moz, and see what happens, thanks for the help though-- last step to a perfect PC :)
2006-07-09T08:16:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	np, remember it never hurts to check the man pages even though I'll admit they are hard to read through sometimes
2006-07-09T08:17:00.000Z	faddat	jrib	 Packages have man pages, or.... how would I do that in this context?  Typically, I know how to do that, but would it just be.... man update-flashplugin?
2006-07-09T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	faddat	yep, man update-flashplugin is what let me know about that -l switch
