2008-07-21T08:22:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	xorg changed drastically between the two versions.
2008-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Ah, that probably explains it.
2008-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	Blaqlight		as did the font rendering.
2008-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	Blaqlight		did you update to ff3?
2008-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	No, I'm using the FF3 that came with the 8.04 install.
2008-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	troythetechguy		It would not make a difference if I were to use KDE vs GNOME to correct the font issues, right?
2008-07-21T08:25:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	no as the WM do not render the fonts.
2008-07-21T08:26:00.000Z	troythetechguy		A lot of the forums I read said to use full hinting, but I don't notice any difference when I choose full vs medium.
2008-07-21T08:28:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	your only having font rendering issues with FF?
2008-07-21T08:29:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Yes.  I had issue earlier with xterm, but some change I made along the way fixed it.  Now I just need to fix FF.
2008-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	what is the minimum font size in FF?
2008-07-21T08:31:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Says "none"
2008-07-21T08:31:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	make it 16
2008-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	then close and reopen
2008-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	I know it makes no sense but ff3 is funny like that.
2008-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Wow, that really brightened things up!  :)
2008-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	did it fix your problem?
2008-07-21T08:35:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	It made the fonts bigger so I can read them now, but they still don't appear to render correct.  For example, the letter k is missing the part of the angled /
2008-07-21T08:35:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	whats the font name?
2008-07-21T08:36:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Verdana
2008-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	you'll just have better luck using a sans serif (explicitly) font. such as MS reference sans serif.
2008-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	troythetechguy	Blaqlight	Thanks.  I'll give that a try.
2008-07-21T08:39:00.000Z	Blaqlight	troythetechguy	even in windows ff3 doesn't use veranda as a the default font, but the sans serif.
