2009-03-07T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	no not at all,  that's the whole point of this, suppourt channel
2009-03-07T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	yep Ubuntu's unoffical version
2009-03-10T05:29:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	have you ever used unetbootin?
2009-03-10T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	no, but a guy told me how to do the netboot  ages ago on IM
2009-03-10T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	well I guess not that long ago
2009-03-10T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	I have some old logs some where, but I won't dig them up for you :d
2009-03-10T05:31:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	Thanks. ^_- Not that helpful, anyways.
2009-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	I have run it, and my partition is bootable.. but everything comes up like all encrypted.. I can't read any of the font it's just garbage characters.
2009-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	ok
2009-03-10T05:40:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	Doesn't wubi partition?..
2009-03-10T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	not properly no,  it puts Ubuntu inside the Windows NTFS partition
2009-03-10T05:41:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	what is the downfall to that?
2009-04-24T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	yep
2009-04-24T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	I guess the load is to much for the repos, so problems
2009-04-24T01:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	no
2009-04-24T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	not sure if the bot is useful for that, but
2009-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	yes, but  you won't get full Ext4
2009-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	infact you wont' get Ext4 at all
2009-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	something can be done to Ext3 for partial suppourt though
2009-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	That's ok for now because I am too lazy to go buy blank cds.:P
2009-04-24T02:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	also probably best to wait untill weekend or something  or maybe next week even, when the download servers are more quite
2009-04-24T02:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nalf	or your upgrade will be slow
2009-04-24T02:05:00.000Z	Nalf	sebsebseb	It's ok.. semester is almost over, have a lot of homework to do anyways.
