2008-10-31T01:19:00.000Z	nekostar		clean is super easier trust me ;d
2008-10-31T01:20:00.000Z	nekostar		i could have done it
2008-10-31T01:22:00.000Z	nekostar		like .xchat2 .gaim .purple .mozilla
2008-10-31T01:22:00.000Z	nekostar		oh yeah then wipe and format
2008-10-31T01:22:00.000Z	nekostar		i actually recommend if your hdd is large enough:
2008-10-31T01:23:00.000Z	nekostar		10GB 10GB doubleram rest
2008-10-31T01:23:00.000Z	nekostar		which lets you run two full distros and share home partition and share swap
2008-10-31T01:23:00.000Z	nekostar		naxa
2008-10-31T01:23:00.000Z	nekostar		just hold super and scroll down
2008-10-31T01:24:00.000Z	nekostar		thats a dual boot setup for partitioning
2008-10-31T01:24:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	it doesn't work... is there no other way?
2008-10-31T01:24:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	super is like windows key and scroll down
2008-10-31T01:24:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	i understand but it doesn't work, beleive me!
2008-10-31T01:25:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	if i disable zoom in compiz advanced settings manager, will it return to normal?
2008-10-31T01:26:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	lemme try it
2008-10-31T01:27:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	yeah looks like that should work
2008-10-31T01:32:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	i beleive that it works for you but not for me... my compiz allways functioned strange anyway... or maybe my button on my mouse is not configured in X...
2008-10-31T01:32:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	then go to console, stop gdm [X], and rm ~/.config ~/.compiz there might be another
2008-10-31T01:33:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	by the way, thank you for the tip, but it not works
2008-10-31T01:33:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	try #compiz-fusion the best help for that is there
2008-10-31T01:33:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	ok, thank you...
2008-10-31T01:33:00.000Z	nekostar	naxa	btw
2008-10-31T01:37:00.000Z	naxa	nekostar	i managed to do use your super+scrolldown! The problem was that I accidentally also enabled zoom lock with super+L when I tried all combinations available to make me unzoom! But there is no key for unzoom now i can see in ccsm but i locked the zoom level! Thank you for your help!
