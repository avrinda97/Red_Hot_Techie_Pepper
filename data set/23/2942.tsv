2012-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	you're missing dependencies
2012-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	how do I know which to install?
2012-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	meet the depencencies
2012-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	why are you building this from source ?
2012-05-25T16:26:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	I want to make a tiny linux image
2012-05-25T16:26:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	am I doing it wrong?
2012-05-25T16:26:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	what do you mean, tiny linux image ?
2012-05-25T16:27:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	I want to recreate the linux image used in the Javascript PC Emulator - http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html
2012-05-25T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	ok, so this really isn't anything to do with ubuntu
2012-05-25T16:28:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	I want to re-create (and then modify) this: http://bellard.org/jslinux/vmlinux-2.6.20.bin
2012-05-25T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	yeah, I've just read the URL, you're basically creating a linux boot envionment based on the jslinux source/provided data
2012-05-25T16:29:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	yes. am I in the wrong chat room for this?
2012-05-25T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	yeah, I'd try the guys who build jslinux
2012-05-25T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	they should be able to walk through issues/problems/questions with you
2012-05-25T16:30:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	it's just a standard busybox built with buildroot as far as I can tell
2012-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	looks like it sure
2012-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	but that's also nothing to do with ubuntu
2012-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	where should I ask then?
2012-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	no idea, the busy box guys ?
2012-05-25T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	sure, but it's an ubuntu support channel,
2012-05-25T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	hence why trying the busybox guys should be a better approach
2012-05-25T16:33:00.000Z	manixrock	ikonia	how do I find those guys? :)
2012-05-25T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	manixrock	read their website for their contact/support information
