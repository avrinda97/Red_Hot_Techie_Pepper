2006-08-24T10:41:00.000Z	acetoxy		Yow! I made a apt-get dist-upgrade this morning, and a reboot was required. After rebooting, I get this: http://fulhack.nu/~vigge/pub/P24-08-06_17.21.jpg
2006-08-24T10:41:00.000Z	acetoxy		Any ideas?
2006-08-24T10:43:00.000Z	lupine_85	acetoxy	erm, your filesystem looks hosed
2006-08-24T10:43:00.000Z	acetoxy	lupine_85	But why would it be like that after a dist-upgrade?
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	acetoxy	lupine_85	Couldn't it just be /dev?
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	lupine_85		oh no, it's failing to mount your filesystems - so they're probably OK
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	lupine_85		possible
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	acetoxy		Hehe
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	lupine_85		can you run 'MAKEDEV'?
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	lupine_85		(you might want to boot up the live CD and do it from there)
2006-08-24T10:44:00.000Z	acetoxy		I'm not sure... I'm in Windows right now, since ubuntu doesn't work.
2006-08-24T10:45:00.000Z	lupine_85		have you got a Ubuntu CD handy? live or install?
2006-08-24T10:45:00.000Z	lupine_85		and do you know what it installed...?
2006-08-24T10:45:00.000Z	acetoxy		I've been thinking about making a clean install of ubuntu, so I think I will do that and copy all important files from the old filesystem
2006-08-24T10:46:00.000Z	acetoxy	lupine_85	No, I dont. I'm downloading it right now. Dapper Drake is installed
2006-08-24T10:46:00.000Z	lupine_85		It's either /dev, or it's having problems initialising your IDE interface
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	acetoxy		Hm, okay...
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	acetoxy		Let's just hope that it will work with kubuntu. :)
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	lupine_85		will be fine, as you'll be in terminal :)
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	acetoxy		Yeah. :)
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	acetoxy		Thanks. :)
2006-08-24T10:48:00.000Z	lupine_85		so /dev/sda5 is your "/" ?
2006-08-24T10:50:00.000Z	acetoxy	lupine_85	Yeah
