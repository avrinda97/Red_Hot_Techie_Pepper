2006-12-04T07:50:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	jrib	 what is the find command on terminal ?
2006-12-04T07:51:00.000Z	jrib	x-r00t-x	find, or locate, or whereis
2006-12-04T07:51:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	jrib	 to find whole file system
2006-12-04T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	x-r00t-x	locate will work, or   find / -name foo     for example
2006-12-04T07:52:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	jrib	find -the command filename
2006-12-04T07:53:00.000Z	x-r00t-x	jrib	 nothing is work
2006-12-04T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	x-r00t-x	what is -h suppose to do?
2006-12-04T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	x-r00t-x	foo just means the thing you are searching for, so:  find / -name kxdocker_conf.xml    but  locate kxdocker_conf.xml  will be a lot faster
