2011-07-23T00:53:00.000Z	joki		How can i use my rams to help the performances of my system?
2011-07-23T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	the linux kernel will manage your ram to give you the best performance
2011-07-23T00:54:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	right now is only using 11% of it. Can't i do anything to use more of it, and make it efficient ?
2011-07-23T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	why do you think it's only using %11 ?
2011-07-23T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	that means it only needs %11 as "active" at thie moment, you'll find more will be use for things such as disk cache, and when it needs it will swap it to active
2011-07-23T00:57:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	so' in another words i can't use any ram space to make my experience smoother?
2011-07-23T00:57:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	is your machine behaving slow ?
2011-07-23T00:59:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	a bit slow, yes.
2011-07-23T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	how much ram do you have ?
2011-07-23T01:01:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	about 8gb ddr2 on a laptop
2011-07-23T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	ok - so is it visually slow, or slow at doing things
2011-07-23T01:02:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	visually
2011-07-23T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	so the most realistic option is your video card and xorgs compatability
2011-07-23T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	what video card do you have ?
2011-07-23T01:03:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	psh, is garbage some intel integrated....
2011-07-23T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	ok, the most obvious thing to me is that it's not configured to use it properly, or the card is not powered enough
2011-07-23T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	your issue is not ram related
2011-07-23T01:03:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	ik is most likely that, but i was asking if there was any way of putting my ram to use. It's always 10-20
2011-07-23T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	it's already in use, you'll find that ram that's not "needed" is used as disk cache and other things,
2011-07-23T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	then when it's needed it's returned to the active pool
2011-07-23T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	think of it as having 10 legs to pedal a bike with 2 pedals, you can only use 2 legs, no matter how many you've got
2011-07-23T01:06:00.000Z	joki	ikonia	lol, you're right.. I just seen it somewhere
2011-07-23T01:07:00.000Z	ikonia	joki	I know where you are going, but trust me, the linux kernel knows how to deal with it's memory best
