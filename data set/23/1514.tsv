2010-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	iFvwm		??????????  ? ?    ?       ?                ? .gvfs
2010-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	iFvwm		anybody know why
2010-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	.gvfs is a special file required by linux
2010-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	iFvwm	dpac_	yes, but why all attribute is ?
2010-09-07T11:24:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	required by GNOME to be specific. More info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS
2010-09-07T11:25:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	Thats weird. It shows right permissions in mine
2010-09-07T11:25:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	stat .gvfs
2010-09-07T11:26:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	try using sudo
2010-09-07T11:27:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	its inaccessible by root. Exit root and then try again
2010-09-07T11:28:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	in root, it shows the same ??? as permissions in mine.
2010-09-07T11:29:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	what are the permissions of your home directory stat /home/user
2010-09-07T11:31:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	When you exit the root and try to ls -la /home/exp , what error do you get?
2010-09-07T11:33:00.000Z	iFvwm	dpac_	not often, but sometimes, this thing,,,come
2010-09-07T11:33:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	whats the output of echo $TERM
2010-09-07T11:34:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	Quit the terminal and start another one.
2010-09-07T11:34:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	Yes.
2010-09-07T11:36:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	it has nothing to do with gvfs in my opinion
2010-09-07T11:37:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	I didn't get you. You mean you will do that or you already did that?
2010-09-07T11:39:00.000Z	iFvwm	dpac_	do not mind this. i would check it after next poweroff.
2010-09-07T11:39:00.000Z	dpac_	iFvwm	Sure. I have got to go anyways. Good luck.
2010-09-07T11:39:00.000Z	iFvwm	dpac_	:D thanks
