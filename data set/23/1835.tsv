2009-12-21T17:22:00.000Z	GNUtoo		hi,what is not compatible with 64bit nowadays?
2009-12-21T17:23:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ok so everyting including proprietary things like flash,ati driver,java,wine are compatible
2009-12-21T17:23:00.000Z	GNUtoo		altough wine and java are not proprietary
2009-12-21T17:23:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ok thanks
2009-12-21T17:24:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ah?
2009-12-21T17:24:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ok
2009-12-21T17:25:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ah ok so I need to manually install it
2009-12-21T17:25:00.000Z	GNUtoo		ok
2009-12-21T17:25:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	or use the gnu GNASH app. but dont bother if you actually want to use flash, as its in heavy development
2009-12-21T17:27:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	personnaly I use gnash but the person who asked me to install ubuntu wants flash
2009-12-21T17:33:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	you already have a swap partition, ubuntu requires one ;/
2009-12-21T17:45:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	http://pastebin.com/m53d3a490 <- which partition should I backup and remove...I bet I should keep SYSTEM and backup and remove recovery?
2009-12-21T17:46:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	and I bet tar wouldn't work as backup tool
2009-12-21T17:46:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	LOL HP_TOOLS.
2009-12-21T17:46:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	ok thanks can I also remove RECOVERY?
2009-12-21T17:47:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	yes, but make sure to disable hp tools in your bios, or youlll get stupid messages during boot
2009-12-21T17:47:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	ok is there a hint for disabling it into the BIOS...I'll look for hp tools string in the bios
2009-12-21T17:54:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	is there a doc on hp-tools somewhere?
2009-12-21T17:56:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	because I've no idea on what it is
2009-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	its a "feature" for newbs.
2009-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	ok but will it prevent the BIOS from working correctly?
2009-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	MASARUwota	GNUtoo	its an auto repeair feature for windows systems ;/
2009-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	GNUtoo	MASARUwota	ah ok thanks
