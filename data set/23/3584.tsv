2009-01-22T11:53:00.000Z	vince		No one here can help with a sound card issue?
2009-01-22T11:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	if you ask whats the problem then someone may
2009-01-22T11:54:00.000Z	vince		Arvind_khadri: I did earlier, I did not wish to spam the trouble by posting the same thing over and over agian
2009-01-22T11:55:00.000Z	vince	arvind_khadri	:  I have attempted to set the default sound card, I have attempted to change the settings in System -> Preferences -> Sound. I have also attempted to search google but most of the tutorials I find all apparently deal with older versions of Ubuntu with a different setup than mine and don't see, to apply to my setup
2009-01-22T11:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	oh ok, if no one replied maybe they dont know, try posting it again :)
2009-01-22T11:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri		vinve which sound card?
2009-01-22T11:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	which sound card?
2009-01-22T11:56:00.000Z	vince		I have one sound card working.  If I run cat /proc/asound/modules it shows both but its using the wrong card as the default
2009-01-22T11:56:00.000Z	vince		I have an onboard Intel Realteck card and an Add On Soundblaster Live!
2009-01-22T11:57:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	so you want to use soundblaster?
2009-01-22T11:57:00.000Z	vince		The Intel card should be the primay, I use the soundblaster for my headset for things like skype and Vent however everything is defaulting to the soundblaster by default
2009-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	oh ok... did you check the community documentation ?
2009-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	vince		arbinf_khadri : No the soundblaster is the secondary.  Onboard Intel should be the primary
2009-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	oh ok... did you check the community documentation ?
2009-01-22T11:59:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	and ya which Ubuntu??
2009-01-22T11:59:00.000Z	vince		arvind_khandri: I have searched.  Mos things say to use the asoundconf-gtk to change the default sound card or to go to System -> Preferences -> Sound to manually set the device.  I have done so and it still uses the soundblaster
2009-01-22T11:59:00.000Z	vince		Ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-22T12:02:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	even if you disable the one you dont want its being used??
2009-01-22T12:02:00.000Z	vince		I haven't tried to disable the Soundblaster, I need both to stay active
2009-01-22T12:03:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	activate them when you need it
2009-01-22T12:04:00.000Z	vince	arvind_khadri	But when I activate it won't it mess up the main imput?  I need them to be distinct and separate.  I want only what I specifically tell to use the sound blaster to use it.  Everything else SHOULD default to the Intel Realtek Card.  I can't just use one at a time otherise I might as well just be switching Jacks.
2009-01-22T12:05:00.000Z	vince		General : What kind of video card do you have?
2009-01-22T12:06:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	vince	just activate/deactivate and check out...
