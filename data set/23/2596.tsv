2009-01-28T04:42:00.000Z	BLZ		Hi everyone!  I have a headless machine (8.10) that i'd like to be able to shuttdown by pressing the power button.  How can i configure this via CLI?
2009-01-28T04:42:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	it doesn't already?
2009-01-28T04:43:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 no.  it asks me what i want to do
2009-01-28T04:44:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	how does it do that if it's headless?
2009-01-28T04:44:00.000Z	BLZ		well headless is relative...  it's a mythtv box so my monitor is my television
2009-01-28T04:44:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 headless is relative... it's a mythtv box, so my tv is my  monitor
2009-01-28T04:46:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	my xbmc-box shuts down when pressing the powerbutton ...
2009-01-28T04:46:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 well this one doesn't =)
2009-01-28T04:47:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	is there gnome-stuff or something?
2009-01-28T04:48:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 I installex mythtv over a xubuntu installation... so yeah, presumably there are some gnome apps
2009-01-28T04:48:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	gnome-power-preferences maybe, if you can start it
2009-01-28T04:48:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 i guess i could remote-desktop it?
2009-01-28T04:49:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	or poke in /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh
2009-01-28T04:49:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 hmm maybe i'll be ballsy and try that... =)  thanks for the suggestions
2009-01-28T04:50:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	studying that leads me to belive you should just be able to kill the power-manager-daemon
2009-01-28T04:50:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	and then it would go straight to shutting down
2009-01-28T04:50:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 okay. i'll try that if i can't make sense of the script
2009-01-28T04:51:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	or, try removing gnome-power-manager
2009-01-28T04:52:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 gnome-power-manager isn't the same as acpi, right?  gnome-power-manager just lets you chsoe between shuttdown, suspend, hibernate, etc...?
2009-01-28T04:52:00.000Z	BLZ		hello, gnufs!
2009-01-28T04:53:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	"GNOME Power Manager is a session daemon for the GNOME desktop environment yada yada"
2009-01-28T04:53:00.000Z	zash	BLZ	so it should be safe
2009-01-28T04:53:00.000Z	BLZ	zash	 sounds like it.  thanks for the help!
