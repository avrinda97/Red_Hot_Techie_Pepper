2010-03-17T21:06:00.000Z	Oasa	Emanon	: Everything was fine. Till i installed WIndows 7 that rewrote the MBR i followed the instructions from ubuntu which included finding my stage1 which gave me hd0,0 so i wrote root hd0,0 and setup (hd0) it said everything is fine but it did not work
2010-03-17T21:06:00.000Z	Oasa	Emanon	: I am using GRUB (not 2) (ubuntu hardy)
2010-03-17T21:06:00.000Z	Emanon		bummer Oasa you can use a live disc to recover your data to removable media
2010-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Emanon		then reinstall starting with windows this time
2010-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Emanon		as it is a pain to fix grub if you're not accustomed to it
2010-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Oasa	Emanon	: Thats not fair Ubuntu is still there I just want to boot >
2010-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Emanon		and im not either hehe
2010-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Oasa	Emanon	: please...
2010-03-17T21:08:00.000Z	Emanon		i dont know how someone else might but i find it is easier just to install windows first
2010-03-17T21:08:00.000Z	Oasa	Emanon	: i dont like to start ubuntu all over again i dont even remember what all repos i installed. I was just waiting for the next LTS (LUCID) so that i can directly upgrade
2010-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Emanon		you can back up your repos to Oasa
2010-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Oasa		Can some one please help me with grub. Okay let me try this again.
2010-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Emanon	Oasa	copy /etc/apt/sources.list along with your home directory
