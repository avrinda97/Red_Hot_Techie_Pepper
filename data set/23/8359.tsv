2004-10-11T09:08:00.000Z	Skreet		Anyone know if Ubuntu has support for SMP?
2004-10-11T09:10:00.000Z	Skreet		Joem: Where do I get the kernels?
2004-10-11T09:10:00.000Z	Skreet		I'm running it now and I wasnt sure it was using SMP.
2004-10-11T09:11:00.000Z	Skreet		Joem: you've lost me.
2004-10-11T09:11:00.000Z	Skreet		:P
2004-10-11T09:11:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	computer > system config > package manager 
2004-10-11T09:12:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	search for linux-image-686-smp
2004-10-11T09:12:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	Thanks.
2004-10-11T09:15:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	you don't need the headers unless you're compiling kernel modules
2004-10-11T09:16:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	I'm assuming they'd be good to download just in case I deside to recompile a custom kernel in the future though right?
2004-10-11T09:16:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	well the headers won't help you do that
2004-10-11T09:16:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	you need the source for that
2004-10-11T09:17:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	I need both really, right?
2004-10-11T09:17:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	nope
2004-10-11T09:17:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	Okay so if I just want a stock smp kernel just get kernel-smp?
2004-10-11T09:17:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	yeah
2004-10-11T09:18:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	This seems way too easy to be linux, am I doing everything right?
2004-10-11T09:19:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	you might need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst after installing it and move the entry's for the smp kernel to the top, but other than that....it really is that easy
2004-10-11T09:19:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	Cant complain :)
2004-10-11T09:19:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	You using Ubuntu or Gentoo?
2004-10-11T09:20:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	both. my amd64 machine is gentoo and i've got ubuntu on a dell and an ibm desktop at work
2004-10-11T09:25:00.000Z	Skreet	subterrific	Can I safely remove the 386 entries, the updater did put them at the bottom but I just assume get rid of them, right?
2004-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	subterrific	Skreet	it's a good idea to leave the 386 kernel around just in case :)
