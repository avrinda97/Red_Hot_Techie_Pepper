2006-09-13T12:05:00.000Z	bluefox83		i have an md5sum mismatch in my sources..how do i fix that?
2006-09-13T12:07:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	yes, that happened to me earlier too (I gave up and decided to try later)
2007-01-15T14:13:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	remove the splash option from your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-05-03T10:30:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	df -h
2007-05-03T10:30:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	you can use 'man df' to see all the options
2007-10-20T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	xmms is in universe
2007-11-15T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	tell me what you tried
2007-11-15T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	usermod
2007-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	what did you try?
2007-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	about a half dozen things. all of them around the lines of sudo usermod --g 1000 bluefox
2007-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	-g, not --g
2007-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	yes, so that tells you what is wrong
2007-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	so what is wrong?
2007-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	there's no such group... why do you want to do this?
2007-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	because i can't get the right permissions from nfs when i write to my share
2007-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	i have uid and gid 1000 on my system and 1001 on the server
2007-11-15T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	create a group with gid 1000 I guess then, but maybe you should wait for someone familiar with nfs to see if there is a better solution than this
2012-11-13T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	don't run that command
2012-11-13T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	what are you trying to accomplish?
2012-11-13T06:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	moving a file into /var/www with regular user privs
2012-11-13T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	ls -ld /var/www/
2012-11-13T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	bluefox83	are you just trying things at random?
2012-11-13T06:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	jrib	for a while i did, yeah...
