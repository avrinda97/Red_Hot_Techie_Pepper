2007-01-23T15:00:00.000Z	fredl		hmm it seems my mysql server is also using a PHENOMENAL amount of memory
2007-01-23T15:00:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	what numbers are you looking at ?
2007-01-23T15:00:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	- the RSS column in ps xal
2007-01-23T15:04:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	even the resident set is largely shared - or my machine wouldn't even be able to run the 8 mysqld's @ 28M per thread
2007-01-23T15:05:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	hmm.. unless the percentage is ram + swap...
2007-01-23T15:05:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	yeah I'm a bit familiar with it, but I'm fighting windmills trying to narrow down what's causing my system to be at a load of over 2 constantly
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	and you're complaining that you get "only" 4000 FPS ?
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	yes, the 7600GS should get more than the 6600 which comes in at about 8000FPS
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	you have seen this personally ?
2007-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	GS is about 50% worse than the GT - goes for both 6600 and 7600, so if you have a 6600GT and a 7600GS that would be perfectly normal
2007-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	sudo nvidia-xconfig
2007-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	(if using edgy, that is)
2007-01-27T09:13:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	yes
2007-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	which one?
2007-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	I'd start with apt-cache search ajax
2007-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	I did that.
2007-01-27T09:15:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	but since ajax is a combination of technologies and not any specific library or application, I'm not sure what you mean by "ajax API"
2007-01-27T09:16:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	well I don't specifically need 'Ajax' per say. Some XhtmlObject stuff packaged would be nice but what I'm really looking to do right now is some dynamic HTML to do nice little things on pictures like wipes and fades for example.
2007-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	you mean M$ proprietary extensions to HTML ?
2007-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	huh, no.
2007-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	fredl	adaptr	something like dynduo, but something that's actually supported.
2007-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	I have no clue, sorry
2007-02-25T09:57:00.000Z	adaptr	fredl	loop mount, man mount for details
