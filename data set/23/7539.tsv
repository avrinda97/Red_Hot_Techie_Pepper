2005-07-02T09:52:00.000Z	OverDriv3		this is what the synaptic package manager sais: This package contains the source needed to generate the kernel module. You can
2005-07-02T09:52:00.000Z	OverDriv3		compile it manually or using kernel-package.
2005-07-02T09:52:00.000Z	OverDriv3		How do i use the kernel-package?
2005-07-02T09:53:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	install kernel-package, and then see the docs in /usr/share/doc/kernel-package.  It will involve using make-kpkg with fakeroot.
2005-07-02T09:53:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	i am a windows user that has no idea about command line stuff : /
2005-07-02T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	do you really need a custom kernel?
2005-07-02T09:55:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	some kind of file system enhancement
2005-07-02T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	which?
2005-07-02T09:55:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	http://ftpfs.sourceforge.net/
2005-07-02T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	what for?
2005-07-02T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	can't gnome-vfs do that?
2005-07-02T09:57:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	i have tried, but i have no idea on how to do that..
2005-07-02T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	further, that projects says it's obsoleted by LUFS
2005-07-02T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	first, I'd suggest sftp over ftp, anyway.
2005-07-02T09:57:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	i managed to connect to ftp and so on, but i cannot change files like i want to. And it is the LUFS i am talking about
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	can you help me with gnome-vfs?
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	can you use sftp?
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	OverDriv3	tritium	what is sftp?
2005-07-02T10:00:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	I'd try: Places->Connect to Server
2005-07-02T10:00:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	then what's the problem?
2005-07-02T10:05:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	I took a look at it myself.  I can't save over gnome-vfs either.  Can you live with drag-n-drop?  Save changes locally, and copy them over with nautilus.
2005-07-02T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	okay, I need to get going.
2005-07-02T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	OverDriv3	sure.  See my last message.  That's the best you can do, I think.
