2007-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	jo_	roxlu	what do you want to do, like premiere pro??
2007-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	roxlu	jo_	yeah something like that indeed
2007-02-25T08:41:00.000Z	jo_	roxlu	thats the best i heard that even tv-stations in slowakia using cinerella, because free and good,,,,it is a bit like premiere pro or so, but in the syn-manager you'll find pivitv or so, which is ok but very very simple, so no multiple-tracks, cinerella has multi-tracks
2007-02-25T08:42:00.000Z	jo_	roxlu	question, your video-performance is good??
