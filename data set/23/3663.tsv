2009-10-25T15:02:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 if no one can answer here you might want to try the  ##linux channel
2009-10-25T15:03:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	thanx, i'll gona pay the a visit :)
2009-10-25T15:04:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 cool :)
2009-10-25T15:25:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 cool.... other than that I am sure which channels would deal with that specifically
2009-10-25T15:15:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	still no solution - even on ##linux
2009-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	where could i get some help with acpi? ;)
2009-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	  the  ##linux channel didnt help?
2009-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 let me check hold on
2009-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 if you switch to the EFnet server and go to the #linux channel there... I bet they can offer some help
2009-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 are these suspend issues ?
2009-10-25T15:25:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	oh yeh... gonna visit EFnet also soon ;)
2009-10-25T15:26:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	btw, nothing to do with suspend issues, but with the scripts just won't start after resume etc...
2009-10-25T15:26:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	but i think... i see a solution... maybe i should look int /etc/pm and not /etc/acpi ;)
2009-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 ok cool  I hope you can get this one resolved :)
2009-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	yeah, thx - it's linux - everything is possible ;)
2009-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 ")

2009-10-25T15:35:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	cool :) what was the issue solution?
2009-10-25T15:36:00.000Z	cybic	coz_	seems like every acpi script is working from /etc/pm and NOT from /etc/acpi lol
2009-10-25T15:36:00.000Z	coz_	cybic	 ok!
