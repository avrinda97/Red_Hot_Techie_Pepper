2008-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	that's a good idea :-P
2008-01-03T08:21:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	yeah, keep it in mind the next time you decide to play around with partitions.  I've even jumped between Debian Etch, two versions of Ubuntu with the same /home partition.
2008-01-03T08:25:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	I'm trying to install a program from repos that the wiki says is there but apt-get says it isn't.......
2008-01-03T08:25:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	which program?  sorry, just got here and didn't see your post
2008-01-03T08:25:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	3ddesktop
2008-01-03T08:26:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	I remember seeing it... maybe it's not in gutsy... is that what you're running?
2008-01-03T08:27:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	yep, Gusty
2008-01-03T08:27:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	I don't see it... just did a "sudo apt-cache search 3ddesktop" and it didn't come up... maybe it was only in feisty, then dropped from repos
2008-01-03T08:30:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	looks like it was dropped after feisty
2008-01-03T08:31:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	I don't know what 3ddesktop does, but it's probably replaced by compiz
2008-01-03T08:31:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	you're running Gusty?
2008-01-03T08:32:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	yep, gutsy... but I don't bother with any 3d stuff... I even use the generic nvidia driver. :D
2008-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	it's none of my business, but if you ask around, somebody's got to have a newer 3d card hanging around that they aren't using... I'm sure you can get your hands on a decent one (for free, probably!)
2008-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	would my motherboard support a video card upgrade?
2008-01-03T08:38:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	if you have an AGP slot, you're in luck... if not, you should be able to find a 128MB PCI card that'll give you a boost
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	Difference between AGP slot and PCI slot?
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	Keep in mind my motherboard is an HP from 200
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	er, 2000
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	I'm sure you can find a picture somewhere... it's really hard to describe... :D
2008-01-03T08:40:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	been so long since I've been a real computer nerd....still know more than you're average idiot though :-)
2008-01-03T08:40:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	I'm still running an AMD 1200, not sure which year it's from... but it's old.  I'm running with openbox and stuff, so I don't need to upgrade yet. :D
2008-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	FrostRat	disc	have a good one
2008-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	disc	FrostRat	You too, hope you have a happy new year ;-)
