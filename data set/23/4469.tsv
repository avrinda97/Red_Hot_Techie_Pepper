2007-12-25T14:19:00.000Z	finn		I am an extreme newbie to IRC.
2007-12-25T14:20:00.000Z	finn		I need to ask a question about installing an ubuntu server. can someone help me?
2007-12-25T14:20:00.000Z	finn		ok, I want to setup a Tor server. but I want to encrypt all the data to protect the users and myself simul....
2007-12-25T14:21:00.000Z	finn		ximal, the server will have 2 18 GB blank drives...
2007-12-25T14:21:00.000Z	finn		ximal ok :P
2007-12-25T14:22:00.000Z	finn		are you sure? I read that a guy working at an isp received a subpoena from the fbi about a tor server.....:(
2007-12-25T14:22:00.000Z	finn		yes I intend to setup lamp....
2007-12-25T14:23:00.000Z	finn		no no....... a tor server for that onion network..
2007-12-25T14:23:00.000Z	finn		oh ok
2007-12-25T14:23:00.000Z	finn		so the encryption is already a part of the tor software?
2007-12-25T14:24:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	thats the layers of the onion
2007-12-25T14:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	i haven't set one up myself, so i'm not sure whats packaged, but i'm sure there is something out there,  finn: you cant serve anonymously
2007-12-25T14:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	that is locally of course
2007-12-25T14:32:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	thats the beauty of encryption, is that symetric key is reverseable with the same key, layer after layer
2007-12-25T14:33:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	there is a good podcast about it from steve gibson somewhere
2007-12-25T14:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	if you are running a tor server, the data in and out is encrypted, except if you are an endpoint
2007-12-25T14:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	google security now tor server
2007-12-25T14:35:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	thats a risk then, because not having the data cannot stop the ISP's from being told to shut you off
2007-12-25T14:37:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	encfs is a common file system encryption as well
2007-12-25T14:39:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	lvm ?
2007-12-25T14:48:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	most servers don't need more than LAMP
2007-12-25T14:53:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	i am almost positive on that,  if not, LVM is what you were going to go for, hardware raid is supposed to be faster, but i think software raid (what you are doing with LVM) seems to be safer
2007-12-25T14:54:00.000Z	musikgoat	finn	i could be wrong tho
