2005-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	pho		anyone knows howto make the internet connection run properly? its really not nice to have to reset the router after each reboot...
2005-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	what do you mean exactly?
2005-09-09T06:57:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	when i have rebooted ubuntu... my browser cant load webpages... but updating the system over the ubuntu servers is working....
2005-09-09T06:58:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	messengers and irc clients dont have connection to the internet either....
2005-09-09T06:58:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	then i have to disconnect the connection by the router and reconnect....
2005-09-09T06:58:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	hmm can you ping web servers? like say google.com?
2005-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	after a while it runs...
2005-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	mostly not...
2005-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	managed it once ... but he only could ping google.... =)
2005-09-09T07:00:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	there must be a solution... i read a lot about similar problems...
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	hmm what does your /etc/resolv.conf say?
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	nameserver 192.168.2.1
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	thats the ip of the router
2005-09-09T07:02:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	is that the address of your router? if so try changing that to your isp's dns server or any dns server really
2005-09-09T07:03:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	where do i get to know my isp's dns server?
2005-09-09T07:03:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	web page? perhaps it is in your router's config?
2005-09-09T07:05:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	the routers says tehre is a primary and a secondary  DNS
2005-09-09T07:05:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	yeah and those ip's you should place into /etc/resolv.conf like this nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx
2005-09-09T07:06:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	both?
2005-09-09T07:06:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	yes both on seperate lines though... so two nameserver entries
2005-09-09T07:06:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	ok...
2005-09-09T07:07:00.000Z	pho	dbzdeath	gonna reboot now... =)
2005-09-09T07:07:00.000Z	dbzdeath	pho	good luck
