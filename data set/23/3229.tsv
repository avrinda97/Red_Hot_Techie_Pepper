2008-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	ubuntu can do that as can many distros
2008-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	wrong question
2008-06-12T07:11:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	you really want to be googling
2008-06-12T07:13:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	if you're running a gui then you want swap
2008-06-12T07:14:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	if you choose to run say debian etch server or ubuntu server then 1gb ram is more than enough without swap
2008-06-13T05:16:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	why do you want nautilus as root? out of curiosity
2008-06-13T05:16:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	if you are a seasoned user surely you'd be used to the terminal
2008-06-13T05:17:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	so i can edit a file. also sudo gedit does not work as well and i prefer a graphic client like nautilus
2008-06-13T05:17:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	gksudo gedit
2008-06-13T05:17:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	cleary vi is better though
2008-06-13T05:19:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	Also , so i can update my server, ya gksudo gedit doesnt work as well. kate does, but i like gnome. Vi is for complex stuff. And i want sudo nautilus because i need to place files in /var/www and well, thats long and hard code for terminal
2008-06-13T05:19:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	vi is simple :), and you can update it from terminal which is far easier
2008-06-13T05:19:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	its not long code in terminal at all
2008-06-13T05:20:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	as a seasoned user i hope you'd understand that having root run nautilus isn't a good idea
2008-06-13T05:20:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	care to eloborate, personally i have once used vi, i prefer nano over it.
2008-06-13T05:20:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	i've been running linux for a month only and would never dare open nautilus as root
2008-06-13T05:21:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	why not?
2008-06-13T05:21:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	nano is a lot easier i agree, elaborate about what?
2008-06-13T05:22:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	eloborate on how vi is simple. compared to nano and gedit ofcorse
2008-06-13T05:22:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	the security of the system is based on the fact that all things are not run as root, you pretty much open up a lot of stuff to be messed up running the whole thing as root rahter than a text editor and the config file
2008-06-13T05:24:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	well, what if you wanted to put files in a restricted directory, you would use sudo nautilus (when i say sudo asume gksudo when neccesay)
2008-06-13T05:24:00.000Z	rampageoberon	m_newton	sudo cp, or sudo mv
2008-06-13T05:25:00.000Z	m_newton	rampageoberon	longer than dragging...
