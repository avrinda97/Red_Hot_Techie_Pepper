2008-03-25T00:10:00.000Z	Nitramusa		a friend explained..but he had to go
2008-03-25T00:10:00.000Z	Nitramusa		his last words were: ask explication on booting grub manually
2008-03-25T00:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nitramusa	maybe it is easier to boot from a livecd and edit the file from there...
2008-03-25T00:11:00.000Z	Nitramusa	erUSUL	are u sure i wont have any issues with mounting the HD or something?
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	Nitramusa		1 disk
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	Nitramusa		no

2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nitramusa	if you are at a boot promt to boot a linux you need to set initrd ()path/to/initrd and kernel ()path/to/kernel root=/dev/whatever and finally cross fingers and run boot
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	Nitramusa		yeah ok
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nitramusa	no no issues mounting ext3 partitions
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	Nitramusa		i know wich disk
2008-03-25T00:12:00.000Z	Nitramusa		its on /dev/sda3
2008-03-25T00:13:00.000Z	Nitramusa		but nvm im just booting the ubuntu LiveCD, it will work without any probs eh?
2008-03-25T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nitramusa	findroot grub command will tell where the files are
