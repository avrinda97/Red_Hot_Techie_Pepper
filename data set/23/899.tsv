2011-04-07T12:12:00.000Z	MJBrune		how many packages are there in ubuntu and what is a site that can tell me this number?
2011-04-07T12:13:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Uh... a lot. Many thousand
2011-04-07T12:13:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	I understand this, freebsd has 22k in ports and tells this.
2011-04-07T12:14:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Hm, let me check. apt may give that info
2011-04-07T12:15:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	probably wont
2011-04-07T12:15:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Uh... why not? it has a cache file with the entire list
2011-04-07T12:15:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	ok sorry, i meant it might but that wont help me if its not on a website.
2011-04-07T12:15:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	well, at least of all the ones in the repos you have enabled
2011-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Uh... why?
2011-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	what are you trying to do?
2011-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	creating a report.
2011-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	i need hardcore statistics.
2011-04-07T12:17:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Well, cite it as being from apt in Ubuntu 10.10. Anyone who actually cares can look it up
2011-04-07T12:18:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	ok how many are there?
2011-04-07T12:18:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	thats a piss poor way to cite but meh im not a stickler
2011-04-07T12:21:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	So, incase you missed that - 35013 for my system with Universe/multiverse and some other bits enabled
2011-04-07T12:22:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	:/ thats not accurate.
2011-04-07T12:22:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	thanks anyways.
2011-04-07T12:23:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Uh... how is it not accurate? I mean... it's going to vary based on the version used, the repos enabled and such
2011-04-07T12:23:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Best you could get is a per-repo/version table... But even that's subject to change
2011-04-07T12:24:00.000Z	MJBrune	robbiethe1st	yeah your pull of wc -l could mean that the description took 2 lines or more
2011-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	Doesn't work that way. Pipe it through less witrh a wider console; they all are on one line excluding wordwrap
2011-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	robbiethe1st	MJBrune	and it doesn't count that.
