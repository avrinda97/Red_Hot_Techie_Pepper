2009-10-18T05:40:00.000Z	whocares		hey everybody
2009-10-18T05:40:00.000Z	whocares		does anybody know if Windows 7 and GRUB conflict if Win 7 is installed before ?
2009-10-18T05:42:00.000Z	whocares		but I mean if GRUB loads NTLDR correctly as Win 7 is rather new and Microsoft might have changed something about the NTLDR (?), too
2009-10-18T05:42:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	as long as you don
2009-10-18T05:43:00.000Z	whocares	arielCo	?
2009-10-18T05:43:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	sorry, typo. As long as you don't install GRUB on the partition (boot record), you should be able to "chainload" onto it.
2009-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	in other words, install on /dev/sda, not /dev/sda2 (for example)
2009-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	whocares	arielCo	I guess this is a misunderstanding, I don't wanna know if NTLDR is able to chainload GRUB but vice-versa ;)
2009-10-18T05:45:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	I know. When you chainload, you don't load  NTLDR but actually the boot record for the partition
2009-10-18T05:45:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	the boot record will take care of finding NTLDR
2009-10-18T05:46:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	just don't pick a partition - you must put GRUB on the MBR
2009-10-18T05:46:00.000Z	whocares	arielCo	k I'll do that
2009-10-18T05:47:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	luck
2009-10-18T05:52:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	yes, I went through a lot of pain upgrading (borked my jaunty setup and had to install anew), but there are lots of improvements
2009-10-18T05:53:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	the (failed) upgrade, about 9 hours downloading + a day trying to fix the mess. The clean install from the CD - about 30 min.
2009-10-18T05:55:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	It's the CD, though I don't remember clearly how long was it since it actually started installing packages
2009-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	whocares	arielCo	may I know the hardware (just interested) :) ?
2009-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	2 y/o laptop - Dell Inspiron 1520
2009-10-18T05:57:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	pretty fast once it's up. My boot time is 38 secs from GRUB to GNOME.
2009-10-18T05:57:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	compiz, bells, whistles and whatnot incliuded
2009-10-18T05:57:00.000Z	whocares	arielCo	Core 2 Duo T7300 ? is that right?
2009-10-18T05:58:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	hmmm, I think - 2.0 GHz
2009-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	arielCo	whocares	I suspect I could, and indeed booting is I/O-bound at times
