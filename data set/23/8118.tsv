2005-04-10T13:48:00.000Z	Seveas		:)
2005-04-10T13:48:00.000Z	Seveas		(mostly)
2005-04-10T13:49:00.000Z	Seveas		or actually: by JIT implementation...
2005-04-10T13:50:00.000Z	Seveas		lol topyli :)
2005-04-10T13:51:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	apt-get upgrade will hold packages back
2005-05-08T13:01:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	no, packages NEVER install in /usr/local
2005-05-08T13:03:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	I may be mistaken, but I thought I had a package that did that before...I don't think it was ubuntu though
2005-05-08T13:03:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	than it is broken
2005-05-08T13:09:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	no, that's for #ubuntu-motu
2005-05-08T13:09:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	yeah, sorry
2005-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	sudo -i
2005-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	yeah that too :)
2005-06-22T12:45:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	the ubuntu supplied one is also 1.0.4
2005-06-22T12:45:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	not entirely
2005-06-22T13:19:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	unless I'm mistaken it only includes 1.0.4's security updates, not everything else
2005-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	correct.
2005-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	then it isn't completely 1.0.4
2005-07-07T14:18:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	maybe ln -s the plugin...
2005-07-07T14:20:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	probably a symlink is missing
2005-07-07T14:20:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	possibly..I'll investigate, but it looks like the links are there
2005-07-07T14:20:00.000Z	Seveas	randabis	check for a link to libjavaplugin-oji.so
2005-07-07T14:25:00.000Z	randabis	Seveas	I think that might have been the problem. :)
