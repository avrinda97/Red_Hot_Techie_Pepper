2009-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	might as well get it right. What is the make & model of your PC?
2009-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	VIA EPIA - P4PB 400 Motherboard.  Only supports 32b chipcs.
2009-06-17T11:41:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	confirmed. P4 celeron, 32 bit processors
2009-06-17T11:41:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 I'll can try the amd64 build, but I can't see how it can work.
2009-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	which iso was it that you've already tried?
2009-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
2009-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	9.04 is a bit quirky. If I were you, I'd try 8.04 next....
2009-06-17T11:44:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	Really?  I got the impression it was stable now.  Okay.  I'll try that too.
2009-06-17T11:45:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	run it down for me one more time, cos I joined this discussion late. What exactly happens during boot?
2009-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 If I try booting from the CD, I get to ash (which I don't know how to use) but no further.  This also happens if I try to do a complete install from boot-up.
2009-06-17T11:47:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 If I install in Windows, or even just try installing the "boot from CD" optional program (since I can't normally), I get "wrong arch: i386 != amd64" but it continues with install for a while.
2009-06-17T11:48:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 Then it starts saying "ERROR  root: [Errno 22] Invalid argument"
2009-06-17T11:48:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	I'm confused. Is this a wubi install?
2009-06-17T11:48:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 I'm pasting from the log here
2009-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 Yes,
2009-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	ok, I recuse myself. I'm not qualified to help you with wubi. Best of luck...
2009-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 Thanks for trying.
2009-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	if it helps, I've had good luck with vmware, and others report good results with virtualbox
2009-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 Quick explanation:  vmware?  virtualbox?
2009-06-17T11:52:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	emulators which run as a windows application and allow you to install & run ubuntu inside them alongside windows
2009-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	most importantly, less troublesome than a wubi install...
2009-06-17T11:58:00.000Z	TheMythMaker	losher	 Less troublesome = win.
2009-06-17T11:58:00.000Z	losher	TheMythMaker	why I mentioned it...
