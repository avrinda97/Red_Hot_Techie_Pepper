2012-06-17T15:56:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	use a cd-r/dvd-r program and burn it as iso
2012-06-17T15:57:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	You will be able to make a double boot once you start to install it
2012-06-17T15:57:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	use www.imgburn.com, small program thats really fast for burning iso files
2012-06-17T15:59:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	you will be able to choose that form installation
2012-06-17T16:00:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	yes
2012-06-17T16:02:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	when you got your CD with that iso file in it you boot up from the CD
2012-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	first off you will be able to choose what you want to do, then you choose to install Ubuntu, after that (A few steps later) you will get to the Partition part
2012-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	once there you will get an option to make a dual boot from Lilo
2012-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	which mean you can choose which OS to start up from
2012-06-17T16:05:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	you need to make a new one
2012-06-17T16:05:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	C:\\ is the partition
2012-06-17T16:07:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	it will be a part of the installation
2012-06-17T16:07:00.000Z	Wheemp	tizzio	got nothing to do with the CD
