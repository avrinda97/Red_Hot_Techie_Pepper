2007-02-06T08:21:00.000Z	scabootssca		hey is there a way to add stuff to Places>Computer like other drives adn stuff
2007-02-06T08:22:00.000Z	scabootssca		like i have my windows drive mounted in /mnt/windows and would like it in computer
2007-02-06T08:22:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	I don't think so, but see if you can do it with apps-accessories-alacarte
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	scabootssca	n2diy	dont have that installed
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	scabootssca		gues i'll install it
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	scabootssca		i was jsut reading sometihng about that anyway
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	It is standard with Dapper, what version are you running?
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	scabootssca		edgy
2007-02-06T08:24:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	Ok, another reason for me not to "upgrade."
2007-02-06T08:24:00.000Z	scabootssca	n2diy	well i liek it since it's the only version i actually got my video drivers installed on
2007-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	Roger that, if it works for you it is cool. I just don't understand why alacarte would be missing, along with disk manager and some other stuff. Seems like I would be downgrading to Edgy, not upgrading.
2007-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	scabootssca	n2diy	ya i noticed the disc manager wasnt there
2007-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	scabootssca		mabye it's reanamed or something
2007-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	Growing pains I guess?
2007-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	scabootssca		hmm
2007-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	scabootssca		i saw alacarte
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	scabootssca		yep it's there
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	scabootssca		jsut ranemad
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	scabootssca		*renamed
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	scabootssca		atleast pretty sure thats it
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	what did they rename it to?
2007-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	scabootssca		System>Preferences>Menu Layout
2007-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	n2diy	scabootssca	Ok, that isn't so bad.
