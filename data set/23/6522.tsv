2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	youBun2		How would I go about running MSN Messenger from Ubuntu?
2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	youBun2		Without using crap Gaim
2006-03-24T17:21:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	why are you running it then...
2006-03-24T17:21:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	I decided to try it out =)
2006-03-24T17:27:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	I mean if you can suggest for me 'how' I can transfer
2006-03-24T17:23:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	To be honest, I like Ubuntu, however Windows XP has more workibility with OS X
2006-03-24T17:24:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	workibility with OSX?
2006-03-24T17:24:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	Yeah, Windows tends to work well with OS X i.e. networking - file compatibility
2006-03-24T17:24:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	ah
2006-03-24T17:25:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	I wouldn't have guessed that since OSX is unix based, but ok.
2006-03-24T17:26:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	Is there an entry in grub for it?
2006-03-24T17:26:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	If you can suggest for me to transfer files from Ubuntu over my wireless network to my PowerBook I would be much obliged
2006-03-24T17:27:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	There is an entry, yes
2006-03-24T17:27:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	I havn't seriously used OSX before, so I can't no.
2006-03-24T17:27:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	Oh I see
2006-03-24T17:28:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	There might be a way to do this but since this is my FIRST time using a Linux OS distribution and with the current problems I have of not being able to log into Windows, you can see I am left in a bit of a pickle =(
2006-03-24T17:30:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	If your osx box detects the ubuntu box on the network, you could use ftp or ssh to do it.
2006-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	can you not even burn them as data?
2006-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	Nope!
2006-03-24T17:33:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	tar -cvvf file.tar file, and then bunzip2 it, and THEN see if k3b will burn it :)
2006-03-24T17:34:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	Hm... heh it's OK actually I can suffice loosing that data since my other half has it on her computer
2006-03-24T17:36:00.000Z	narg	youBun2	Does even the window cripple-cd that you got with the computer not help?
2006-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	youBun2	narg	No... the idiotic CD itself will not read. I assume it must have scratches of some sort on it
