2007-06-06T16:52:00.000Z	illriginal		i just heard it really buggy.
2007-06-06T16:52:00.000Z	illriginal		see lol
2007-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	illriginal		i really need to get java installed, im sick of depending on windows.
2007-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	this works: sudo apt-get install --reinstall sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin
2007-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	illriginal	savvas	the problem is, it's not installing onto firefox.
2007-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	illriginal		maybe im not properly configurin java
2007-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	once you install java, close and restart firefox ;)
2007-06-06T16:54:00.000Z	illriginal		alright will do
2007-06-06T16:54:00.000Z	illriginal		lol kitche, i have that plug in, just firefox doesn't want to work with it, but im gonna listen to savvas and see if it works
2007-06-06T16:56:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	i'm amazed to see it doesn't work. so far, it didn't work only in windows xp sometimes after a format/install
2007-06-06T16:56:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	when you restart firefox, go to www.java.com and verify your installation
2007-06-06T16:56:00.000Z	illriginal	savvas	lol... that's a really really old plugin bro... supposedly i need: Version 6 Update 1
2007-06-06T16:57:00.000Z	illriginal		error from site: Oops! You don't have the recommended Java installed.
2007-06-06T16:57:00.000Z	illriginal		Your Java version is 1.6.0. Please click the button below to get the recommended Java for your computer.
2007-06-06T16:57:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	so it works.. where do you need the update 1?
2007-06-06T16:57:00.000Z	illriginal	savvas	true... it's good enough
2007-06-06T16:58:00.000Z	illriginal		i guess they're just recommending it but it's still working
2007-06-06T16:58:00.000Z	savvas	illriginal	so far, i haven't seen any online java programs to drop because it's not update 1 ;)
2007-06-06T16:58:00.000Z	illriginal	savvas	thank you, and thanks to the rest of you who helped :D
