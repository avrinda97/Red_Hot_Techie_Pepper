2011-02-21T14:20:00.000Z	CoNFuS3D		Doesn't seem to be one...
2011-02-21T14:20:00.000Z	CoNFuS3D		The only thing I have to access sound is the sound manager in system > prefs > sound.. but that doesn't work
2011-02-21T14:21:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	try right clicking the volume control and then advanced options
2011-02-21T14:22:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	do you have a volume control button on the keyboard?
2011-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	have you loaded the restricted-access package?
2011-02-21T14:26:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	I would do that then look for drivers, you might have one of those crazy cards, or mobo's that need a sounds driver for alsa to work
2011-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	you need the drivers then
2011-02-21T14:28:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	log out and then in it's the same
2011-02-21T14:30:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	no
2011-02-21T14:32:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	have you tried looking for drivers?
2011-02-21T14:32:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	display driver but no audio?
2011-02-21T14:33:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	just go thru it slowly.
2011-02-21T14:34:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	what kind of sound card do you have?
2011-02-21T14:41:00.000Z	Nitrohax	CoNFuS3D	you there?
