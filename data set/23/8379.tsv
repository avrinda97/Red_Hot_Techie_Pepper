2004-12-15T14:33:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	take it you have changed your PATH to point at java also?
2004-12-15T14:36:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	it points to /usr/local/java/bin
2004-12-15T14:40:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	any other suggestions
2004-12-15T14:40:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	yes
2004-12-15T14:44:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	maybe I will put it in there.
2004-12-15T10:04:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	vi .bashrc
2004-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	hrm thasts odd
2004-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	whats odd?
2004-12-15T10:09:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	I haven't stated a way to install Java... but here :
2004-12-15T10:10:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	its been the same on every other distro, run the bin backage and set the path in~/.bashrc or /etc/profile
2004-12-15T10:11:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	go to java.sun.com, click on JDK 5.0 on the right, click JRE, agree... download, chmod +x resulting jre file in home dir,  mv the resulting jre dir to /usr (just for shits) ... then ln -s /usr/jre1.5.0/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins'
2004-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	ugh... you edit the PATH line in your .bash_profile... log out and back in... or source the file...
2004-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	yeah
2004-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	if thats not working, I don't know what to tell you, thats how though.
2004-12-15T10:29:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	umm, Debian Stable would generally be a server... you likely wouldn't want X at all  :/
2004-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	yeah I use it as an example of everyone where to wait till software was "safe"
2004-12-15T10:38:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	thats really not the point... the true point is to not have to give out admin password, and to define how much administration another user can do...
2004-12-15T10:38:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	that too
2004-12-15T10:38:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	its not "that you dont have to login" because you do...
2004-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	is ubuntu truly debian or is it too far off
2004-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	its Sid with fixes and small changes...
2004-12-15T10:45:00.000Z	pastyhermit	|trey|	small changes like a real installer lol
2004-12-15T10:45:00.000Z	|trey|	pastyhermit	no, although they changes the default installer script... same installer as sarge though  :/
