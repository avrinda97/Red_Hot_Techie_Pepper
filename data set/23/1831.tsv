2010-06-15T08:13:00.000Z	plustax		im having an issue. I restarted my Ubuntu machine and it brought me to a black screen with initramfs and the fan is running really loud. Any suggestions?
2010-06-15T08:13:00.000Z	plustax		I have no idea what to put in the command.
2010-06-15T08:14:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	is it the BusyBox shell?
2010-06-15T08:14:00.000Z	plustax	codebrainz	it is indeed.
2010-06-15T08:14:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	what was the error just before BB shell started?
2010-06-15T08:14:00.000Z	plustax	codebrainz	im not sure
2010-06-15T08:15:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	reboot and look?  it should stay on the screen
2010-06-15T08:16:00.000Z	plustax	codebrainz	gave up waiting for root device
2010-06-15T08:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	is this a fresh install?
2010-06-15T08:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	did you change hard drives or tweak /etc/fstab?
2010-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	is your hard drive dead?
2010-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	did you do updates or anything?
2010-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	was there any errors during update?
2010-06-15T08:20:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	one thing to try would be to go into the grub menu, follow the instructions on screen for editing the boot menu (very simple), and tweak the root=UUID=blahblah part to say root=/dev/sda1 or replace /dev/sda1 with some other possible drive letter
2010-06-15T08:21:00.000Z	plustax	codebrainz	I'm sorry but I dont understand any part of that.
2010-06-15T08:22:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	yeah, it's kinda hard to troubleshoot then.  what's happening is, the initrd is like a "pre" OS that runs to get the linux kernel setup.  at the end of this init stuff, it switches to your real install (root filesystem), but it's currently failing to find the drive/partition/filesystem where your install is
2010-06-15T08:25:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	i can suggest a bunch of stuff, but it's kinda technical and whatnot.  One thing to do might be to use a LiveCD to get up to a GUI, and then go from there.
2010-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	I'd also ask the channel again, someone might have some good/simple ideas
2010-06-15T08:35:00.000Z	plustax	codebrainz	I put in a live cd
2010-06-15T08:39:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	did you "restart" or did you power off without shutting down properly?
2010-06-15T08:39:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	don't do that :)
2010-06-15T08:40:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	i don't mean the livecd, i mean your install
2010-06-15T08:43:00.000Z	codebrainz	plustax	pm me and I can have you try a few things if you want
