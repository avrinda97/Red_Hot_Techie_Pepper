2004-12-22T16:51:00.000Z	dcm		how do I reinstall GLIB?
2004-12-22T16:52:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	use synaptic?

2004-12-22T16:52:00.000Z	dcm		oh
2004-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	as tomchuk said: computer -> system Config -> synaptic
2004-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	dcm		I was using apt-get and aptitude
2004-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	dcm		Thanks
2004-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	dcm		I either don't have it, or it's broken
2004-12-22T16:54:00.000Z	dcm		I could not compile xchat 2.4.1
2004-12-22T16:54:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	why would you need to compile xchat?
2004-12-22T16:54:00.000Z	dcm		This is 2.0.8, the newest is 2.4.1
2004-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	ok, any great new features?
2004-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	dcm		mm i dunno
2004-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	why then go through all that trouble :o)
2004-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	dcm		I like to have the latest of stuff
2004-12-22T16:57:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	ok, ever thought about just upgrading to Hoary then?
2004-12-22T16:58:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	seems more reasonable than installing stuff the other way
2004-12-22T16:58:00.000Z	dcm	Fwiffo	I didn't know Hoary was out yet, where can I get it?
2004-12-22T16:58:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	try looking in the wiki, it real easy
2004-12-22T16:59:00.000Z	Fwiffo	dcm	but its in development so some things may break
