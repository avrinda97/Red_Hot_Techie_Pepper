2005-02-09T15:17:00.000Z	ubuntu		which package do i have to download to watch divx in totem movie player?
2005-02-09T15:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	you can try checking out ubuntuguide.org -- i'm not sure if they mention divx specifically
2005-06-11T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	that sounds unlikely to me. where did you hear that?
2005-06-11T13:21:00.000Z	ubuntu	HappyFool	at one forum.
2005-06-11T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	well, i see fdisk has a command to 'change a partition's system id'. you can try it, but i doubt it will do you any good
2005-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	type 'sudo fdisk /dev/<hdsomething>', then type 'm' to get a list of commands
2005-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	i do not recommend that you do this
2005-06-11T13:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	perhaps you should find a data recovery specialist, i.e., the people who recover data from crashed drives and so on
2005-06-11T13:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	if that partition has valuable data on it, the last thing you want to do is screw around with it more
2005-06-11T14:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	linux is supposed to be easy
2005-06-16T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	linux is not especially african
2005-06-24T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	look maybe in Places -> Computer; maybe it's there. otherwise use ka7ana command
2005-07-15T06:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	you can *try* installing the latest alsa from www.alsa-project.org
2005-07-15T06:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	they have a list of supported cards there
2005-07-15T06:37:00.000Z	ubuntu	HappyFool	I'll check there. :] 
2005-07-21T15:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	you can't install from the live cd
2005-07-21T15:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	using mkfs
2005-08-25T11:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	dvd image
2005-10-23T11:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	not recommended; if you really want to, google for 'captive-ntfs'
2005-11-19T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	64: ubuntu *64* hours a day
2005-11-19T12:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	please don't repeat yourself. and one question mark is fine ;)
2006-01-17T12:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	hello. You're using ubuntu?
2006-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	ubuntu	i don't think there is one
