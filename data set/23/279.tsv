2012-01-30T04:53:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	 i want to launch the torrent program so that I can access its web gui when I want to
2012-01-30T04:53:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	and then close it down
2012-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	Guest68409	you want it to appear on the server (the linux machine) or on the client (the windows machine)?
2012-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	the linux machine.. I'm well indulged with the xming/x11 forwarding but I haven't tried launching things on the server via the commando prompt
2012-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	Guest68409	what does the following command return: echo $DISPLAY
2012-01-30T04:55:00.000Z	Guest68409		echo $DISPLAY
2012-01-30T04:55:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	its blank
2012-01-30T04:55:00.000Z	jrib	Guest68409	set it to ':0'
2012-01-30T04:57:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	your thinking about export DISPLAY=:0?
2012-01-30T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	Guest68409	yes
2012-01-30T04:58:00.000Z	Guest68409	jrib	would probarbly have solved it myself after a few hours of grmphing but thanks for guiding me in the right direction, works fine.
