2006-03-28T16:52:00.000Z	Sophant		if i have multiple programs open, it seems that only one can play sound
2006-03-28T16:52:00.000Z	Sophant		example: firefox and gaim
2006-03-28T16:53:00.000Z	Sophant		firefox will play sounds until i open gaim, then only one will play sounds
2006-03-28T16:53:00.000Z	Sophant		its kind of a toss up as to which one will work
2006-03-28T16:54:00.000Z	Sophant		anyone have any suggestions?
