2011-04-13T04:56:00.000Z	Juv1228		is it possible to compile and use libusb as 32bit, on a 64bit ubuntu install?
2011-04-13T04:56:00.000Z	Juv1228		i have a python script that uses pyusb(which in turn uses libusb) and i have a feeling its libusb's fault
2011-04-13T04:56:00.000Z	itaylor57	Juv1228	you can download 32 bit libs for a 64bit system
2011-04-13T04:57:00.000Z	Juv1228		as the same exact setup works on 32bit
2011-04-13T04:57:00.000Z	Juv1228		wasnt aware libusb was available precompiled
2011-04-13T04:58:00.000Z	itaylor57		!info libusb
2011-04-13T04:59:00.000Z	Juv1228		!info libusb-1.0-0
2011-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	Juv1228		so how would i go about installing the 32bit version of that through apt?
2011-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	Juv1228		if thats how its done
2011-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	itaylor57	Juv1228	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libusb
2011-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	Juv1228	itaylor57	so i just grab the 32bit deb and run deb?
2011-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	Juv1228		<-- long time windows moron just switched to ubuntu
2011-04-13T05:03:00.000Z	itaylor57	Juv1228	you would want the 32 bit libs to be in a different location than the 64bit
2011-04-13T05:03:00.000Z	Juv1228		well, for now ill just overwrite them
2011-04-13T05:03:00.000Z	Juv1228		because i just want to see if this one script will work
2011-04-13T05:04:00.000Z	Juv1228		and if i moved them i would have to change pyusb to find them
2011-04-13T05:04:00.000Z	Juv1228		correct?
2011-04-13T05:04:00.000Z	itaylor57	Juv1228	this might help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit
2011-04-13T05:08:00.000Z	Juv1228		well, not sure how this would work. but python is 64bit, ubuntu is 64bit and i want python to load a 32bit lib
2011-04-13T05:08:00.000Z	Juv1228		so i would need to install a 32bit version of python too correct?
2011-04-13T05:09:00.000Z	itaylor57	Juv1228	I probably have led you down the wrong path
2011-04-13T05:09:00.000Z	Juv1228	itaylor57	probably, im pretty stupid
