2006-11-21T15:59:00.000Z	steveire		Anyone know much about installation options using the alternate cd?
2006-11-21T15:59:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	what is your exact question?
2006-11-21T16:00:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Can I do the installation more 'interactively'. I think there's a menu under there that most do not see with base install, extra applications, grub install etc.
2006-11-21T16:01:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	check the oem install
2006-11-21T16:01:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Do you think that's it?
2006-11-21T16:03:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	yeha think that's the option you want there is an explanition someplace on ubuntu site about what the options do

2006-11-21T16:09:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Very good. Thanks.
2007-05-29T09:57:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	you just go to the ip in a web browser or do you need sharing
2007-05-29T09:58:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	I want the apache server I've installed on my ubuntu laptop to be accessible to the windows laptops. We would need to be on the same network for an ip address to have any meaning, right?
2007-05-29T09:59:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	not really
2007-05-29T10:00:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	OK. Both laptops are in the same room, and both have wireless cards. What address do I go to on the windows one to access the apache server?
2007-05-29T10:01:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	the ip address of the apache server
2007-05-29T10:01:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	OK. How do I know that?
2007-05-29T10:02:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	umm ip should tell you on the apache server
2007-05-29T10:04:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Do you mean 'it' should tell me? The apache server(on my laptop) is on 127.0.0.1. I can access it on my laptop, but 127.0.0.1 on the windows machine is the loopback for the windows machine. How do I access the ubuntu laptop?
2007-05-29T10:04:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	127.0.0.1 is the loopback for any network
2007-05-29T10:05:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Right. I'm not sure you've understood my problem, but I don't know any other way to put it.
2007-05-29T10:06:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	I do understand it the apache server must have an outside ip 192.xx.xx. or so
2007-05-29T10:06:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Wouldn
2007-05-29T10:06:00.000Z	kitche	steveire	no just requires a wireless card on the laptop
2007-05-29T10:08:00.000Z	steveire	kitche	Thanks for the help
