2009-06-01T22:07:00.000Z	whazilla		instead of having troubleof having one root passwd use sudoers

2009-06-01T22:08:00.000Z	whazilla		better then guessing
2009-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	whazilla		so i got hoary then installed hardy repos cuz hoary is nomore .... now cant update cuz of dpkg -f
2009-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	you put hardy repos in hoary?
2009-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	well you can't upgrade like that
2009-06-01T22:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	you have to upgrade to  breezy and so on from there, untill you got dapper the first LTS, then you can directly upgrade to hardy
2009-06-01T22:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	anything else shoudn't work,  or it may go bad
2009-06-01T22:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	why are you installing form such an old ISO?
2009-06-01T22:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	500 CD's that you weren't able to give out to people?
2009-06-01T22:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	ok well hope that was a lot of Ubuntu converts, anyway going back on topic, you could have  ordered a later CD yourself, or  downloaded and burnt your own.  and  something can go wrong as I already said if you just use the hardy repos in 5.04
2009-06-01T22:18:00.000Z	whazilla	sebsebseb	its okey ... its rollin
2009-06-01T22:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	well something might go wrong after the updates have been installed
2009-06-01T22:19:00.000Z	whazilla	sebsebseb	what could go wrong when one userbase is replaced by another ? ... my guess is nothing ;)
2009-06-01T22:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	well Ubuntu/Canoncial do not advice doing what you did, and I assume they have good reasons for that
2009-06-01T22:20:00.000Z	whazilla	sebsebseb	good reasons to stop evolution? hoaryhardy har har
2009-06-01T22:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whazilla	what?
