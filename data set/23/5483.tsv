2008-03-21T18:24:00.000Z	wubrgamer		32bit, it's the most compatible, and there is no good flash on 64bit
2008-03-21T18:25:00.000Z	wubrgamer		anybody know how to get X running from scratch ? I just don't know what packages I need to install
2008-03-21T18:25:00.000Z	Slart	wubrgamer	in fact.. the current workaround with ndiswrapper works pretty well..
2008-03-21T18:25:00.000Z	Slart		!hardy | davek
2008-03-21T18:26:00.000Z	wubrgamer	Slart	that's funny
2008-03-21T18:26:00.000Z	wubrgamer		openbox isn't a DE
2008-03-21T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	wubrgamer	funny? it is?..  I don't think  I understand
2008-03-21T18:27:00.000Z	wubrgamer		you just said something about wireless cards to a question about X, anyway thanks Slart, you might want to take a break from helping these n00bs
2008-03-21T18:28:00.000Z	wubrgamer		haha, xserver doesn't pull in xorg ?
2008-03-21T18:28:00.000Z	wubrgamer		that's silly
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		what wouldn't a full X be ?
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I'm trying to keep it as minimal as possible,
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		and I don't want a window manager if I can help it
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		no no no
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I meant display manager
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		GDM, XDM, KDM, WDM etc
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	wubrgamer	hmm.. I was commenting on your "there is no good flash on 64bit".. at the moment it uses ndiswrapper to run 32 bit flash on 64 bit firefox... and it's working pretty well
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I thought ndiswrapper was a wireless thing exclusively...
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		huh
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		openbox doesn't pull in much
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		anyway, I JUST got it working
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		turns out I installed everything in the world BUT xorg
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	wubrgamer	I thought so too.. until firefox installed it for me =)
