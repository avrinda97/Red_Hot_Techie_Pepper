2006-10-11T10:35:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	what problem do you have?
2006-10-11T10:36:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	well i can login using SSL for some reason it wont let me, but i do can login with TLS protocol
2006-10-11T10:37:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	ok, cant help you. Haven't got ssl/tls to work. How did you get that to work?
2006-10-11T10:38:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	i configure it this way "./configure --with-everything --with-paranoidmsg --with-virtualchroot --with-tls --with-largefile --with-mysql"
2006-10-11T10:38:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	ok, you didn't use apt to install it?
2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	XplOzIon		no
2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	no i used source :P
2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	did you add anything to the config files to get it working?
2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	ok, isn't it the latest version in "universe"?
2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	no i didnt add anothyng, it depends how to start it my friend
2006-10-11T10:40:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	yes I know, but you can add things to the config dir instead
2006-10-11T10:41:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	i didnt add anything, just configured it like i told you, and to have TLS/SSL working you need to start it using -Y #
2006-10-11T10:42:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	ok
2006-10-11T10:42:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	becouse I use the config-directory, thinks it's easier
2006-10-11T10:44:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	what you mean using the configuration folder??
2006-10-11T10:44:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	Instead of starting it with flags you can add files with the values
2006-10-11T10:45:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	oh yeah thats right
2006-10-11T10:45:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	thinks it easier
2006-10-11T10:46:00.000Z	XplOzIon	chori	yeah, but since my server doesnt ever restart or reboot :P i wish i could fix this SSL problem, and FXP transfer speed
2006-10-11T10:46:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	:D
2006-10-11T10:46:00.000Z	chori	XplOzIon	sorry, but I cant help you
