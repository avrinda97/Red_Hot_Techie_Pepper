2008-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	ilmob	onetinsoldier	i am stupid and this is the first time I have ever used linux
2008-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	i've never disbaled ipv6 myself. just trying to give you a web page that shows how
2008-12-25T11:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	you can use whatever editor you want, you don't have to use 'vi'
2008-12-25T11:45:00.000Z	ilmob	onetinsoldier	I don't know what your talking about don;t I just type this in terminal?
2008-12-25T11:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	pretty close... what that web page says. yes,except one thing, as a newuser you aren't going to wanttobe using 'vi'. do this one the command line instead...   gksu  ...then type in --> gedit
2008-12-25T11:47:00.000Z	ilmob	onetinsoldier	i'm afraid I'm too stupid to understand your help
2008-12-25T11:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	sorry typo's. let me put that back in...   pretty close... what that web page says. yes, except one thing, as a new user you aren't going to want to be using 'vi'. do this on the command line instead...   gksu  ...then type in --> gedit    (my blasted space bar, lol)
2008-12-25T11:48:00.000Z	ilmob	onetinsoldier	I'm lost what is vi?
2008-12-25T11:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	vi is a text editor
2008-12-25T11:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	so is gedit
2008-12-25T11:49:00.000Z	ilmob	onetinsoldier	ok I cannot follow your help lol
2008-12-25T11:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	it sounds like your friend from china has not done you a favor by leaving you high and dry after installing linux on your machine.
2008-12-25T12:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	how come you can't copy and paste?
2008-12-25T12:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	your on a different computer i take it
2008-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	it's only because wireless is still fairly new territory for linux
2008-12-26T22:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	hello there
2008-12-26T22:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	Lol!
2008-12-26T22:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	if you keep using linux, you can expect to have some hours like that. however, eventually, you'll get over the hump
2008-12-26T22:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	some more*
2008-12-26T22:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	well, to set a desktop background i just use System --> Preferences --> Appearance --> Background(Tab)
2008-12-26T22:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ilmob	you can also install and use a command line app called 'feh'
