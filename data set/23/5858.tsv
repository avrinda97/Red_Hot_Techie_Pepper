2006-08-19T07:43:00.000Z	saint_551		So, is anyone else having trouble updating?
2006-08-19T07:44:00.000Z	saint_551		I click on the "Install Updates" button, but it only searches for more updates instead, as if I hit the "Check for Updates" button.
2006-08-19T07:44:00.000Z	saint_551		Synaptic won't start
2006-08-19T07:46:00.000Z	saint_551		amaroK can run on Gnome, but you need KDE libs
2006-08-19T07:47:00.000Z	saint_551		If you're trying to stay strictly Gnome, there's rhythmbox
2006-08-19T07:47:00.000Z	saint_551		so... Anyone else having problems updating?
2006-08-19T07:48:00.000Z	saint_551		Or am I the only one? ;/
2006-08-19T07:48:00.000Z	saint_551		wait...
2006-08-19T07:48:00.000Z	saint_551		What is libvte?
2006-08-19T07:49:00.000Z	Flamekebab	saint_551	I just had a problem with libvte
2006-08-19T07:50:00.000Z	Flamekebab		and we fixed it
2006-08-19T07:51:00.000Z	saint_551	Flamekebab	So I just need to wait for the update for that, and upgrade through the console?
2006-08-19T07:52:00.000Z	Flamekebab	saint_551	is synaptic not opening for you?
2006-08-19T07:52:00.000Z	saint_551		Not at all
2006-08-19T07:52:00.000Z	saint_551		Nor will system updates work
2006-08-19T07:52:00.000Z	saint_551		apt-get still works
2006-08-19T07:52:00.000Z	Flamekebab		okays, saint_551, if you try and launch synaptic from the console, what do you get?
2006-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	saint_551		It can't find libvte
2006-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	Flamekebab		right-o
2006-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	saint_551		synaptic: error while loading shared libraries: libvte.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	Flamekebab		I've a solution for that, thanks to voidy
2006-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	Flamekebab	saint_551	type the following
