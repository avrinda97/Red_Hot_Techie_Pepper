2007-10-03T12:39:00.000Z	cellofellow		I just installed Ubuntu on my new laptop. I'm used to Xubuntu. How do I add workspaces to GNOME? I can't find it for the life of me.
2007-10-03T12:40:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	I'm using Xfce, and I can't recall :(
2007-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	dang, I'm so used to the xfce way.
2007-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	oh I think I figured it out
2007-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	right click the workspace switcher applet, then preferences
2007-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	you can just middle click the desktop and "add Workspace".
2007-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	ah, didn't know that :)
2007-10-03T12:42:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	that just gives me a dialog that asks how many rows I want the workspaces to be displayed as.
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	isn't there a number of workspaces box?
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	not that I can see. :(
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	:(
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	using Gutsy, so that may be why.
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	ah
2007-10-03T12:46:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	OT, but are you connecting from work? and my Workspace Applet help page sez its something under Workspaces, but they must have changed in Gutsy's GNOME version
2007-10-03T12:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	I'm at home.
2007-10-03T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	ah, ok, your hostmask suggested some sort of corporation :)
2007-10-03T12:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	nah, just an odd ISP.
2007-10-03T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	can't you go SYstem -> Administration -> Mouse or something
2007-10-03T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	i forgot
2007-10-03T12:49:00.000Z	cellofellow	scguy318	yes, but that doesn't give enough options.
2007-10-26T04:38:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	about?
2007-10-26T04:38:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	I like Thunderbird better, if thats what you're asking
2007-10-26T04:40:00.000Z	scguy318	cellofellow	what do you mean?
