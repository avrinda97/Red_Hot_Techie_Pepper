2006-09-19T13:15:00.000Z	Dane_		anyone? .. :(
2006-09-19T13:15:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	recently bought means used?
2006-09-19T13:15:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	newest macs aren't g3
2006-09-19T13:16:00.000Z	Dane_		yes iapx8088, brought it today. it's an 333 MHz g3
2006-09-19T13:16:00.000Z	iapx8088		mmmh
2006-09-19T13:16:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-187056.html read this?
2006-09-19T13:18:00.000Z	Dane_	iapx8088	I've read the threads (I guess thats the first result when you google the error message) but I found nothing that was useful ..
2006-09-19T13:18:00.000Z	Dane_		or at least nothing *I* saw that was useful - but maybe I'm wrong ..
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	 givin the fact that it occurs at early stage, it may be a kernel issue rather than an ubuntu issue
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	Dane_	iapx8088	that means for me what? sorry, I'm new to linux
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/34508 here they say it was solved into 2.6.16
2006-09-19T13:21:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	ubuntu is a distro, but the heart of the operating system is the kernel, and that is not developed by ubuntu
2006-09-19T13:21:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	so probably (and https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/34508 here they say so) you should find a way to boot with a newer kernel
2006-09-19T13:22:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	I'm not a mac expert, but I believe the error occurs during installation right?
2006-09-19T13:23:00.000Z	Dane_	iapx8088	yeah it occurs rigth after the g3 tries to boot into ubuntu, like I said, I want to use it just as a live cd for now, no install
2006-09-19T13:23:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	I fear you shall wait for a new ubuntu version and a new kernel.
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	or so they say
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	Dane_	iapx8088	uhm, thanks, thats not really what I wanted to hear, but I guess I have to excerise patience
2006-09-19T13:25:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	 I don't like to say you to switch from ubuntu,  but I would try with a newer kernek
2006-09-19T13:26:00.000Z	Dane_	iapx8088	yea guess thats what I gotta do .. I just hoped it would work with ubuntu, cuz I've got it here on Cd .. anyway. thanks for your help!
2006-09-19T13:27:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	bye
2006-09-19T13:27:00.000Z	Dane_		bye all
2006-09-19T13:27:00.000Z	iapx8088	Dane_	I suggest to try with a distro with a newer kernel, if it works, just wait for the next ubuntu verison
