2010-08-08T21:24:00.000Z	pooper		what do you guys recommend alsa or pulseaudio??
2010-08-08T21:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	no sound comes out.  if you play like mp3 does it seem to play but no sound or not seeing any sound device and can't play?
2010-08-08T21:25:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	the device is recognized when i do an lspci, however there is no audio comming out
2010-08-08T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	I'm sure you checked that the sound is not muted
2010-08-08T21:26:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	i checked
2010-08-08T21:26:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	its not muted
2010-08-08T21:27:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	sshould i give alsa a try?
2010-08-08T21:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	so lspci what card is it.  I use pulseaudio  the now default.   I'm not sure alsa would be better or worse
2010-08-08T21:29:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	lspci outputs: "Audio device: VIA technologies, Inc. VT1708/A [Azalia HDAC] (VIA high Definition Audio Controller) (rev 10)
2010-08-08T21:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	well I've use via sound card in one system not that exact number so it should probly work.
2010-08-08T21:31:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	what if I reinstall pulse-audio??
2010-08-08T21:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	seems they have a bug in that device https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/476890
2010-08-08T21:33:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	any suggestions? Or should I look for another sound card :p
2010-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	 well did it work in a previose version?
2010-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	This machine had 8.04 on it... I did a fresh install of 10.04 and the sound is dead
2010-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	on 8.04 it worked
2010-08-08T21:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	well the driver is probly in the kernel so eather try to go back to your old kernel or try to go forward and get a newer kernel
2010-08-08T21:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	it looks like they have a fix linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic  not sure what they have for 10.04
2010-08-08T21:38:00.000Z	pooper		mmm
2010-08-08T21:39:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	so just to be sure, you're saying that installing alsa will not make a difference?
2010-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	 it won't kill you to try but it looks like alsa has a history of a bug in that model sound card
2010-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	pooper	sacarlson	and pulseaudio is the default controller in 10.04 correct?
2010-08-08T21:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	pooper	yes , I think I would try see about installing that latist kernel for 10.04 first,  if that fails go for the backport fix
