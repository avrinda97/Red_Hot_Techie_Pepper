2006-10-31T15:53:00.000Z	tlp__		what language is apt written in?
2006-10-31T15:53:00.000Z	tlp__		php5
2006-10-31T15:54:00.000Z	tlp__		i thought php was messy all the way around
2006-10-31T15:55:00.000Z	tlp__		oh, perl isn't messy?
2006-10-31T15:57:00.000Z	tlp__		i dont see any advantage of perl after ruby was written
2006-10-31T15:57:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	speed?
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	decent unicode support?
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: ruby doesnt have decent unicode support?
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	notoriously, no
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	tlp__		if you need speed write extensions in C
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	it's all because Ruby's from Japan. And Japan is annoyed at Han Unification.
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: hmm i would guess it would have it because it was made in japan
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	tlp__		oh
2006-10-31T15:59:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	Hopefully, it will be fixed in Ruby 1.9. Whether it will be fixed /well/ is unclear.
2006-10-31T15:59:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: i heard windows support is kind of lacking with ruby
2006-10-31T15:59:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	Other than that, ruby is pretty darn cool. But given most of what I code involves text processing and requires speed (e.g. speedy XML transformation), Ruby's not for me.
2006-10-31T16:00:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: mostly what i do is with python and C
2006-10-31T16:00:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: so you do a lot of perl?
2006-10-31T16:00:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	Don't know any C/C++. Wish I did. Currently fooling around with Django, which so far I prefer to Rails in some ways. (Although most of Rails's problems are actually /Ruby/ problems.)
2006-10-31T16:01:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: thats what i do, is django
2006-10-31T16:01:00.000Z	webben	tlp__	No, I don't do much Perl either tbh.
2006-10-31T16:01:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: i used rails, then i wanted to write my own framework, then i found django
2006-10-31T16:01:00.000Z	tlp__	webben	: pretty much all the frameworks in python before django are not good
