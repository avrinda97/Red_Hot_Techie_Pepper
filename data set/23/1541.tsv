2010-02-02T15:26:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	please be more specific
2010-02-02T15:28:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	i cant login go ubuntu after my login screen all i get is the brown logo screen and thats as far as i can get
2010-02-02T15:28:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	I find your description very unhelpful? At which point does the login screen fail you? Can you enter the password? Does it accept the password? What session are you attempting to use/
2010-02-02T15:29:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	after i type my username and login details then i get the brown scteen after that trying to boot
2010-02-02T15:30:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	so after you login it reboots (?)
2010-02-02T15:30:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	so when you enter your details it logs you into an empty screen of some kind?
2010-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	????? ubuntu is a gnome os
2010-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	you can use different ones. XFCE, awesome, openbox
2010-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	kubuntu = kde, openbox = crunchbang etc
2010-02-02T15:33:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	you can install them on ubuntu irregardless
2010-02-02T15:33:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	at the login screen you can select hte session type
2010-02-02T15:34:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	i cant get in to install anything like openbox etc
2010-02-02T15:34:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	so this is a fresh install of Ubuntu?
2010-02-02T15:34:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	that isn't helpful mohheh.
2010-02-02T15:35:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	i have a new install i updated it and installed my usual set of apps then on reboot is when i get error ^
2010-02-02T15:36:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	Ok. So what session manager are you selecting at the login screen? Have you tried different sessions (aside from xterm obviously)?
2010-02-02T15:36:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	hey there is only gnome and xterm in the default ubuntu os
2010-02-02T15:36:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	and Gnome failsafe
2010-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	asdff	mohheh	your problem seems to be beyond my scope of knowledge. More over your description of your problem is indescrpitive and your manner is abrasive
2010-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	yda failsafe gnomw i could get in but thats so limited it does not have any menus or stuff
2010-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	mohheh	asdff	ay i just need to get into my computer
