2009-08-03T21:29:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	you have to copy the contents of firefoxes profile folder, and then just replace them (after reinstall)
2009-08-03T21:30:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	ok... I just need to find those folders
2009-08-03T21:31:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	for firefox it's ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxx.default where xxxx -random letters and numbers
2009-08-03T21:31:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	for evolution i dunno, i prefer thunderbird
2009-08-03T21:31:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	k I use both.... but how can I find my messages? I have no previous backup of them
2009-08-03T21:33:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	afaik Evolution offers you to back up all your data, at least i got that from starting it up right now and it offered me to restore everything. So... I guess just search around Evolution itself :>
2009-08-03T21:33:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	ok but right now I can't access my installation. I'm on livecd. That's the problem. I had a grub error 18 so I decided to reformat
2009-08-03T21:34:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	okay, wait a second, i'll see what i can find :>
2009-08-03T21:35:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/12/03/how-to-backup-evolution/ might this be helpful?
2009-08-03T21:38:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	it is helpful. I'm gonna try it asap
2009-08-03T21:38:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	Any other things to backup in you opinion?
2009-08-03T21:39:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	I'd suggest splitting your hdd into partitions and creating a mount point under /home
2009-08-03T21:39:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	yeah I will do it
2009-08-03T21:40:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	I will create 4 partitions: /boot for grub, swap, / and /home
2009-08-03T21:40:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	why do you need one for grub?
2009-08-03T21:40:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	because I don't want error 18 to happen again
2009-08-03T21:40:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	where should I create it? Before the / one?
2009-08-03T21:41:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	um... error 18 sounds terrifying :D
2009-08-03T21:41:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	afaik the order doesn't matter
2009-08-03T21:41:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	well it is terrible :/
2009-08-03T21:43:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	i guess. In any case, i did only 3 mount points. /, /home and swap... There's another one, /var/www that's a bit useless now that i know that i'll be wiped on every reinstall.. so... :> never mind that :>
2009-08-03T21:44:00.000Z	bahh	nexsja	damn do you really think I should backup all the drive?
2009-08-03T21:45:00.000Z	nexsja	bahh	nope, not really, just the /home dir where all the configs are
