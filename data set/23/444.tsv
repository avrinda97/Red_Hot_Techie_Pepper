2011-08-29T10:08:00.000Z	mukti		I've been on my computer for about an hour and three times, a window has popped up that says "Debconf BlackMesa", then disappears after a second or two (BlackMesa is my computer name). Does anyone know why this is happening? Is it because I am installing software?
2011-08-29T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	what is the output of:  lsb_release -c
2011-08-29T10:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	it's a terminal command, you can copy /paste to the terminal
2011-08-29T10:13:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	natty
2011-08-29T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	probably caused by updates.
2011-08-29T10:14:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	Is there anything I can do about it? Or should I just leave it be?
2011-08-29T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	just let it fly for now, if its during updates/installs then itsok, if you get it randomly then I'd review the situation
2011-08-29T10:16:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	I think it is installs that I am doing
2011-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	Okay, that debconf thing just popped up about 6 times after I finished installing a program...
2011-08-29T10:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	ok let updates finish, then reboot. Use the OS as normal to see if t still happens
2011-08-29T11:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	unzip filename
2011-08-29T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	not by default
2011-08-29T11:26:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	Okay, I forget if I have it installed, how would I find out if it is?
2011-08-29T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	dpkg -l | grep jdk     may do it
2011-08-29T11:29:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	okay, that worked. I have a few openjdk's and default-jdk
2011-08-29T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	may help too http://www.multimediaboom.com/how-to-install-java-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-ppa/
2011-08-30T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	not really no
2011-08-30T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	+1 for distortion though, crank speakers rather than the app
2011-08-30T04:53:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	Well, I'm on a laptop
2011-09-18T00:47:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	I know about that, but I mean one that will display the temperature, then update them as they change
2011-09-18T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	there is xsensors as well as some conky code which will display it
2011-09-18T00:49:00.000Z	mukti	ActionParsnip	i don't really want to run it with conky, just through the command line. I guess I could just write a script
2011-09-18T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mukti	sudo sensors    will show the temps etc, you could make a script to loop it round
