2008-03-06T04:45:00.000Z	[FT]Alex		what are you trying to do, swatTX?
2008-03-06T04:46:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	save my system without having to reinstall
2008-03-06T04:48:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- you should be able to mount your partitions from the livecd. go to places > computer I think
2008-03-06T04:49:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- failing that you can do it from the partition manager in system > administration
2008-03-06T04:49:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	when i do that I see my CD drive and filesystem
2008-03-06T04:50:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- oh, well try it from system > administration > partition manager. right click on the partition and click "mount this" or whatever
2008-03-06T04:50:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	partition manager shows my whole HD as unallocated
2008-03-06T04:51:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- uh oh :S did you delete your partition table or something? not my area of expertise, I'm afraid
2008-03-06T04:52:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	i didn't delete it knowingly... i was just installing ATI drivers
2008-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	do you remember what you did before your hard drive disappeared?
2008-03-06T04:54:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	I was uninstalling the restricted drivers and trying to get the defaults back. during removal of the restricted drivers my system locked up and i've never been able to log back in
2008-03-06T04:55:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	what happens when you try to boot from the hard drive?
2008-03-06T04:56:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	it boots straight to a shell initramfs prompt
2008-03-06T04:57:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	oh, so linux is still there? did you try startx?
2008-03-06T04:57:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	I don't think that's an option. the commands are limited at the initramfs prompt
2008-03-06T05:00:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- oh yeah, that was stupid of me. I'm not sure what to do from the initramfs prompt :( sorry
2008-03-06T05:00:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	that's what most ppl end up saying. thanks for trying though
2008-03-06T05:14:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	what was the command you used to remove the ati drivers? maybe you deleted a module you shouldn't have?
2008-03-06T05:15:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	i was using the gui.. i went System -> Administration ->Restricted Drivers Manager and unchecked the restricted driver
2008-03-06T05:16:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	before it could finish the screen went blank and I had to power it off (ctrl+alt+SysRq+ various keys)
2008-03-06T05:17:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- hmm. tried "modprobe vesa" or something similar? I'm clutching at straws now... does initramfs give you an error?
2008-03-06T05:17:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	swatTX	- actually, have you tried just typing exit?
2008-03-06T05:18:00.000Z	swatTX	[FT]Alex	exit sends me right back to the prompt
