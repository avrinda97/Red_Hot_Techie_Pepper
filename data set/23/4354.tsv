2007-11-18T22:32:00.000Z	Sumsaren		can i join two partitions in ubuntu?
2007-11-18T22:32:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Not safely :)
2007-11-18T22:33:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	ok... hmm... wanted to delete my windows partition...
2007-11-18T22:33:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	You can delete it- but you can't merge it into another one.
2007-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	I'd wipe the whole computer clean and do a complete reinstall anyway :P
2007-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	That's what I'm going to have to do today or tmrw anyway.
2007-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	Yes maybe that should be the solution.
2007-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Set up a bitchin' file system then.
2007-11-18T22:34:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	bitchin'?
2007-11-18T22:35:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	I like one with journaling.
2007-11-18T22:35:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	I also like encrpytion; and a seperate /root, /boot and /home partitions
2007-11-18T22:36:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	Well i have a second HD with my data on..
2007-11-18T22:36:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Uhh...
2007-11-18T22:37:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	What?
2007-11-18T22:37:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	yes...
2007-11-18T22:38:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Yes :P
2007-11-18T22:38:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	maybe i should take at better look then..
2007-11-18T22:38:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Yeah; it's hidden and it's manual.
2007-11-18T22:40:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	the HD is only 80 GB and i have 512 mb ram
2007-11-18T22:40:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	The alternate cd is text based; it allows you to enable encryption; you don't have to do it - I haven't tried it yet anyway.
2007-11-18T22:41:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	Though; /swap should be double your RAM; so one Gig is good; and boot can be about half a gig of ram.
2007-11-18T22:41:00.000Z	Phill	Sumsaren	probably less; but half a gig is fine.
2007-11-18T22:42:00.000Z	Sumsaren	Phill	ok.. super
