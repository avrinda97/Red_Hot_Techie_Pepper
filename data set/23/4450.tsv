2007-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	MenZa	t0nedef	I think he has to get the alternate install CD
2007-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	t0nedef	MenZa	ah ok
2007-08-10T16:30:00.000Z	t0nedef	MenZa	its saying that no drivers are found and stuff
2007-08-10T16:30:00.000Z	MenZa	t0nedef	yes, he has to use the alternate install CD and then install it once the system is installed.
