2008-02-05T09:51:00.000Z	BioCore		Hi guys, I am a current mac user and wanted to experience or try out a Linux distro. People have told me that Ubuntu is very popular among new Linux users.

2008-02-05T09:51:00.000Z	BioCore		so was wondering anyone could tell me which version to download

2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	BioCore		or do I need the i86
2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	kupesoft	BioCore	What type of mac do you have?

2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	BioCore		32 bit
2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	kupesoft	BioCore	The 32-bit will be fine, you'll be able to better use some proprietary software (like Adobe Flash)
2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	BioCore		ok thanks a lot

2008-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	kupesoft	BioCore	unless you have lots of RAM (>3.5gb), then you'll need the 64bit version to use it all,
2008-02-05T09:53:00.000Z	BioCore		do the hardwares install properley?
2008-02-05T09:53:00.000Z	BioCore		properly?*
2008-02-05T09:53:00.000Z	kupesoft	BioCore	It should detect your hardware and work properly
2008-02-05T09:53:00.000Z	BioCore	kupesoft	do you mean I need to mor ethna 3.5gb to use 64bit?

2008-02-05T09:53:00.000Z	BioCore		k thnxs
2008-02-05T09:54:00.000Z	kupesoft	BioCore	No, I'm saying that 32bit only supports about 3.5GB of RAM, if you have more, you need a 64bit OS,
