2010-05-17T02:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	use pastebin to show the entire error you're getting

2010-05-17T02:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	for what package?
2010-05-17T02:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	that error message refers to a specific package. need to at least know the name of it
2010-05-17T02:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	it sould show as part of the messages from when you do 'dpkg-reconfigure -a'... there shuold be more than just one line to the error
2010-05-17T02:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	ok. well, now you need to use a command line text editor. ever used one before?
2010-05-17T02:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	can you use gedit right now?
2010-05-17T02:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	/var/lib/dpkg/status
2010-05-17T02:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	ok, cool. i didn't think you were in X Windows ;-)
2010-05-17T02:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	you see in there how every package has a 'section' in that file?
2010-05-17T02:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	ok, you need to find the section for linux-restricted-modules-generic, and just delete the entire section for it
2010-05-17T02:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	then save the file and try...  sudo apt-get -f install
2010-05-17T02:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	darn. try that command. what package is it giving en error for now?
2010-05-17T03:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	are you sure you took out the entire section in the file that refers to that package? and then saved it? you would have needed to edit the file as 'root'
2010-05-17T03:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	ok, sounds better
2010-05-17T03:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	try... sudo apt-get -f install
2010-05-17T03:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	you're trying to update to 9.10.. is that right?
2010-05-17T03:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	well what happens if you try.... apt-get install linux-image-2.6.28-18-generic
2010-05-17T03:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	i don't know
2010-05-18T06:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jahnkeanater	no
