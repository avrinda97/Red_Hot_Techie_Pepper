2009-09-28T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	You can use debsums to find out what files are zero size
2009-09-28T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Are you using ext4?
2009-09-28T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Did you lose power or force shut down recently?
2009-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Try running "sudo apt-get install --reinstall libvlc2 libvlccore"
2009-09-28T13:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Yes, use debsums, also use sysrq next time ( and tell your friend to as well )
2009-09-28T13:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	np
2009-09-28T13:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	"debsums -c" should give you a list of all of the packages you need to reinstall, unfortunately it will also give a *lot* of false positives. I'm looking for something better
2009-09-28T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	run "sudo apt-get install debsums && sudo debsums_init" It will take a while and require a lot of downloading, once it's done you can check what files are corrupted
2009-09-28T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Still here?
2009-09-28T13:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Well I have a way of detecting the files without false positives now
2009-09-28T13:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	No, that just prepares the checksums
2009-09-28T13:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Then you need to check if the files match the checksums
2009-09-28T13:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	which you should be able to do by running this ( after the debsums_init ): sudo bash -c 'debsums -c | { while read file; do if [[ ! -s "$file" ]]; then echo "$file" ; fi; done;  }'
2009-09-28T13:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	spaceBARbarian	Well I'm curious if it works :)
