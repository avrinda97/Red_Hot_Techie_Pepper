2007-09-14T15:26:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	you just want to kill the nm-applet?
2007-09-14T15:26:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	I am not sure. I don't want ubuntu to interfere, that's all
2007-09-14T15:26:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	A piece of software required "turning off the network manager"
2007-09-14T15:27:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	"killall nm-applet"
2007-09-14T15:28:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Ok, at the same time: How do I disable one wifi interface and enable another? As it is now, the "wrong" wifi interface has made a connection.
2007-09-14T15:28:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	Disabling the interfaces, use "gksudo network-admin"
2007-09-14T15:29:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Thanks a lot.
2007-09-14T15:29:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	Or you can do it through System -> Admin -> Network
2007-09-14T15:30:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Hm, I've been at this GUI before. I can't see no enable/disable stuff.
2007-09-14T15:31:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Ah, I did that but it still maintains a connection
2007-09-14T15:33:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-09-14T15:36:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	did you find the file?
2007-09-14T15:36:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Nope, sorry
2007-09-14T15:37:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Found it.
2007-09-14T15:37:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	ok, pastebin it please
2007-09-14T15:38:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	Ok, gimme a min
2007-09-14T15:41:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	I have to get the network to work first. 5 min :P
2007-09-14T15:45:00.000Z	shooters	arex\	Do a backup of that file (i.e. to /etc/network/interfaces.old) and then delete all lines in it and save it.  Then try disabling the interface using network-admin (by checking/unchecking the little check box near the interface name)
2007-09-14T15:46:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	wifi stuff doesn't have a checkbox
2007-09-14T15:50:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	http://pastebin.com/m46da53c5
2007-09-14T15:51:00.000Z	arex\	shooters	I pretty much want to disable everything except ath0
