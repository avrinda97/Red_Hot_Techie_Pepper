2007-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	if you don't use windows except for a few things, I would suggest it
2007-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	you can ether run samba server or ftp server on your ubuntu system, and the virtual windows can access it through the virtual network
2007-09-20T14:16:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	do you mean two different versions of windows?  or are you running vm from your real windows partiton?
2007-09-20T14:18:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	you are not going to be able to copy and paste your apps
2007-09-20T14:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	:) im the one who should apologising for giving you such a hard time this morning
2007-09-20T14:20:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	I would suggest making a backup, or image of your windows partition  (if you have room) and installing that in the VM
2007-09-20T14:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	hmmm kk thats new, how do i do that and I only want my important apps
2007-09-20T14:23:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	an image is the complete partition, a backup is a backup
2007-09-20T14:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	115GB - 40GB for windows (5GB limit on privilege accounts "yeha im evil") / 40GB for ubuntu and the rest is unassigned until i need it
2007-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	then you wont be able to use imaging easily, if your virtual box is smaller than your windows partition
2007-09-20T14:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	there must be a way to do this I know virtual box created a C: drive but where the heck is that. I should think if i placed items in there is should show when I start up the windows box?
2007-09-20T14:29:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	its "virtual"  that means it doesn't really exist as the same thing to the host
2007-09-20T14:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	keep in progression getting information overload already l0ol so is there a way around this
2007-09-20T14:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	hmmmm??? any ideas...

2007-09-20T15:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	samba can be new to setup, but if you search around all the guides, I'm sure you will find the one that you can understand the best
2007-09-20T15:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	yeah but i was just thinking of sending stuff to gmail drive and DVD its not geeky but does the job :( "remember im a geek in progression l0ol"
2007-09-20T15:36:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	thats a good way to do it
2007-09-20T15:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	musikgoat	lol would've thought you would be disappointed with that method... no finess
2007-09-20T15:37:00.000Z	musikgoat	Pirate_Hunter	well it does the job, so be it
