2009-03-23T20:07:00.000Z	jedimind		how would i go about setting Sun Java Runtimes as the default, rather than the OpenJDK Runtimes?
2009-03-23T20:08:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	use the "alternatives" method
2009-03-23T20:08:00.000Z	oCean_		!alternatives | jedimind
2009-03-23T20:09:00.000Z	jedimind	oCean_	thanks i'll give it a shot
2009-03-23T20:09:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	if you prefer gui - install "galternatives"
2009-03-23T20:10:00.000Z	jedimind	oCean_	okay, i went through it, and i changed the java default to sun (i saw it in the list) but when i do java -version ; i still get openSDK
2009-03-23T20:10:00.000Z	jedimind		err OpenJDK
2009-03-23T20:12:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	"which java" should return /usr/bin/java, which in turn is actually a link to /etc/alternatives/java
2009-03-23T20:12:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	The "java" in /etc/alternatives is set by the update-alternatives command to the java of your choice
2009-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	at least, it should be. So you could check "which java" and "ls -al /etc/alternatives/java"
2009-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	jedimind	oCean_	well it does return /usr/bin/java but it doesnt seem to be using it when im running ... ANT in this case
2009-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	jedimind		should i restart my gnome session?
2009-03-23T20:14:00.000Z	jedimind		though...
2009-03-23T20:14:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	ok, I'm not sure if ANT has a config, where (fr example) JAVA_HOME is set... I guess that'll override system defaults
2009-03-23T20:14:00.000Z	jedimind	oCean_	 doing ls /etc/alternatives/java returns  /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java
2009-03-23T20:14:00.000Z	jedimind		but which java returns /usr/bin/java
2009-03-23T20:15:00.000Z	jedimind		/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java
2009-03-23T20:15:00.000Z	jedimind		crap
2009-03-23T20:15:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	/usr/bin/java is link to /etc/alternatives/java, so it seems, that you update-alternatives have not changed the actual java version?
2009-03-23T20:15:00.000Z	jedimind		yeah it doesnt seem like it actually changed it even though i specifically selected it...
2009-03-23T20:16:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	also check if the update worked "update-alternatives --list java"
2009-03-23T20:17:00.000Z	jedimind	oCean_	can i msg you for a min?
2009-03-23T20:17:00.000Z	oCean_	jedimind	sure
