2009-12-09T05:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	gksudo needed?
2009-12-09T05:25:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	no, just a check for fsck
2009-12-09T05:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	Ah, ok
2010-01-15T12:27:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	apt-cache depends
2010-01-15T12:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	That's a good one too thanks
2010-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	that command will fail
2010-03-10T07:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	we shouldn't be using sudo to download or ./configure software
2010-03-10T07:51:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	we are in /usr/src
2010-03-10T07:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	and that is not a good idea. best to download as user, configure as user, compile as user and then use sudo to make install
2010-03-10T07:52:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	so software is spread randomly ?
2010-03-10T07:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	and that is not a good idea. best to download as user, configure as user, compile as user and then use sudo to make install
2010-03-10T07:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	software is to be compiled as normal user in a user folder, then installed using sudo.
2010-03-10T07:57:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	I still don't understand your advice, I used  to put software there, and then have to mention folders permission
2010-03-10T07:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	you had him downloading a package with sudo, that is bad security practice. we download, comfigure and compile as normal user, not sudo. sudo should not be used unless absolutely necessary
2010-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	the reason you have perms problems is beacuse you haven't learned proper permissions habits
2010-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	k, for downloading, a step more then
2010-03-10T08:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	if he has used sudo to ./configure or make, then he's going to have problems.
2010-03-10T08:01:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	so you want me to own that subdir to regar user then ? k..
2010-03-10T08:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	no, I feel that you need to go back and learn the proper way to handle Linux permissions before giving bad advice in this channel.
2010-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	yes, you distract me, i saw it
2010-03-10T08:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	DasEi	that is bad advice. he needs to be compiling the software in his $HOME as user
2010-03-10T08:05:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	k, I'm up to leave that to you then ?
2010-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	DasEi	ardchoille	can I see you for a moment in #ubuntu-offtopic ?
