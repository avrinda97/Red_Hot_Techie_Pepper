2009-01-08T04:27:00.000Z	Quagmire		its too hard to remember all the stuff I did to get to this point and I really don;t have a singhle problem in the world with wiping the program completely and starting over
2009-01-08T04:27:00.000Z	Quagmire		I was trying to change the theme and ran into problems after the fact
2009-01-08T04:27:00.000Z	Quagmire		I installed it from the add/remove
2009-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	Quagmire		I've uninstalled and reinstalled mutiple times
2009-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	Quagmire		evertime I reinstall it comes back with ALL the same settings
2009-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	Quagmire		because I could NOT find the program to remove the file I needed to remove and got totally frustrated
2009-01-08T04:30:00.000Z	Quagmire		its like trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together in the dark ...you can be a stinking genius, but turn all the lights out and you are just another idiot. ;)
2009-01-08T04:31:00.000Z	Quagmire		I just simply don't tremember it has unfolded over 2 days
2009-01-08T04:31:00.000Z	Quagmire		thats the isssue ...that folder is NOT in the home folder .LOL
2009-01-08T04:32:00.000Z	Quagmire		I uninstalled and reinstalled using using add/remove and synaptic
2009-01-08T04:32:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	do a ls -la in your home dir if you see .xchat2 thats where your settings are saved.
2009-01-08T04:34:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
2009-01-08T04:36:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	if you rm -rf ~/.xchat2   ...then run xchat from the menu you can start with fresh original settings.
2009-01-08T04:39:00.000Z	Quagmire	LtL	I ran the rm -fr ~/xchat2 coammand and when I restarted xchat ....all my settings are STILLthere
2009-01-08T04:40:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	rm -rf  the order may be important
2009-01-08T04:41:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	did you install xchat from a tarball or other archive rather than package manager?
2009-01-08T04:43:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	then run synaptic, search xchat and choose remove including configuration files
2009-01-08T04:44:00.000Z	Quagmire	LtL	...I've only down that about 3 times at this pount
2009-01-08T04:44:00.000Z	Quagmire	LtL	I'll reinstall it and it comes back EXACTLY the same way it was before I uninstalled it
2009-01-08T04:47:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	run this in terminal from your home dir, find -name '*xchat*'
2009-01-08T04:48:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	look for xchat.conf
2009-01-08T07:01:00.000Z	LtL	Quagmire	ctrl+h i think, to see hidden dirs in nautilus
2009-01-08T07:02:00.000Z	Quagmire	LtL	...you da man! Thanks
