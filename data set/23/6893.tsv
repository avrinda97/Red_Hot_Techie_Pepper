2005-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	moaltmann		can anyone help with a failed installation? how do i continue it?
2005-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	what's wrong with the installation. There has to be a reason why it failed.. if there isn't then we can't help you.
2005-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	I have just installed Ubuntu5.10 (i386), after the reboot the install screen installed/confgured further packages and then displayed "There was a problem installing the selected software...". after an erroneous keystroke I was thrown to the console I have the last msg from all consoles but then did a C-M-Del. The reboot went through the graphical startup and dumped me into the console (login). Any suggestions on how to finish the
2005-11-30T14:56:00.000Z	moaltmann		installation?
2005-11-30T14:57:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	you might have hardware incompatablities.
2005-11-30T14:58:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	unlikely, live cd works, knoppix worx
2005-11-30T14:59:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	well try installing knoppix or gentoo off knoppix maybe that'll work.. If it does, then you have a messed up CD.
2005-11-30T15:00:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	how would i continue an install
2005-11-30T15:00:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	as I said, you probably have a currupted CD if it isn't your hardware, did you download off slow net?
2005-11-30T15:01:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	yep, i'll do an MD5 check -- however, it's a torrent so it should check itself :-/
2005-11-30T15:02:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	well if your net was slow it'll probably be that. Why didn't you just get a regular iso? instead of the torrent..
2005-11-30T15:02:00.000Z	moaltmann		it is an iso. i simply shared it in a torrent and compared against others.
2005-11-30T15:03:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	^
2005-11-30T15:03:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	ahh right.
2005-11-30T15:03:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	sorry, wan't explaining well
2005-11-30T15:03:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	I wouldn't know then. :( You should ask a few others, or download straight from the site.
2005-11-30T15:04:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	maybe the link you acquired ubuntu from wasn't really authenticated. There are a whole lot of problems. Just try again.
2005-11-30T15:04:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	in any case -- if the install would hang, i then choose to reboot, and want to continue the install -- how would i do this?
2005-11-30T15:04:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	or would it do it automagically?
2005-11-30T15:05:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	you'd have to start from the beggining. You can't quit an install and hope for it to continue after a reboot.
2005-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	i see, ubuntu doesnt keep a log of where it last was and continues from there in case of a freeze (esp, during hardwrae detectiion)
2005-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	moaltmann	phin3as	i'll do a MD5 check and try again. thanks for your help
2005-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	phin3as	moaltmann	anytime.
