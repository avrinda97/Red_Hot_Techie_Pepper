2010-02-19T01:19:00.000Z	Sky35		Sure I guess, its a local network so I'm not really to worried about user-rights, but even setting up the shares as guest-access doesn't let me into them.
2010-02-19T01:20:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	samba troubles?
2010-02-19T01:21:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	 You got it. Windows/Ubuntu are not playing along at all.
2010-02-19T01:21:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	what's your 'security=' setting?
2010-02-19T01:23:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	 security = user, purpzey: thanks, ill try playing with it
2010-02-19T01:44:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	there's scp
2010-02-19T01:45:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	scp/rsync if you have cygwin on your windows machine
2010-02-19T01:45:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	there are no non-commercial versions of an NFS client for a windows environment
2010-02-19T01:46:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	I just wish I could get this stupid smb working, and I have NO idea why it doesn't want to work properly
2010-02-19T01:46:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	what is the value of the 'security=' line in your smb.conf
2010-02-19T01:50:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	why can't you get it to work, exactly? and what's the value of the line I asked you about
2010-02-19T01:51:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	the value was user. I guess you missed me saying it lol.
2010-02-19T01:51:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	oh dear, sorry - guess because I didnt see the red highlight in all this mess
2010-02-19T01:51:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	ok - have you run 'smbpasswd' on your desired user accounts?
2010-02-19T01:53:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	and also make sure the 'workgroup' value is the same in both systems
2010-02-19T01:53:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	toastedmilk: What I did was: Installed samba. Created unprivileged user accounts in ubuntu for the windows accounts. Ran smbpasswd on the user accounts and used the password of the windows machines.
2010-02-19T01:54:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	and security=share does not work as well?
2010-02-19T01:54:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	 toastedmilk: I then setup the shares, some as guest-access,and some as non-guest. The guest ones don't work at all. The non-guest ones sometimes pops up with a user/pw prompt and the proper user/pw doesn't work, but I did manage to get it to work using my ubuntu user/pw.
2010-02-19T01:54:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	 toastedmilk  What kind of file permissions do I need? And I'll try =share
2010-02-19T01:55:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	security=share if you don't have other people on your network etc..
2010-02-19T01:56:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	Other people as in people I don't want to give access? Nope, just a local-house network.
2010-02-19T01:57:00.000Z	Sky35	stdisease	hmm, I put share on, and now I get a password prompt (username locked on guest), and with on password I get an error 'More data is available'
2010-02-19T01:58:00.000Z	stdisease	Sky35	odd.
