2009-07-20T01:13:00.000Z	lorenzosu		Hi all is there a way to control via Ubuntu the function of the Wifi on/off "soft-button" on the laptop?
2009-07-20T01:13:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	on laptops with proper kernel support they *should* do the right thing out of the box
2009-07-20T01:13:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	I haven't looked into how much hassle it is to remap them to something else.
2009-07-20T01:14:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	Unfortunatelly hp laptops have a (hardware) faulty wifi button which means if it fails you're left with no connection
2009-07-20T01:15:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	there's a bunch of documentation on this in the kernel docs tree (the magic word is "rfkill"). Some of them are actually hardwired at the hardware level, so the kernel can't really fix those if they break.
2009-07-20T01:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	That's what I feared.
2009-07-20T01:36:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	define "a nasty error"
2009-07-20T01:39:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	soreau: Ok. http://paste.ubuntu.com/222195/
2009-07-20T01:39:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	soreau: Notice this happens any time I do some apt-get stuff
2009-07-20T01:40:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	is it correct about /usr/sbin/update-grub not existing?
2009-07-20T01:41:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	yes
2009-07-20T01:41:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	afaik the "grub" package is supposed to own that script, is that intentionally not installed?
2009-07-20T01:42:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	No.. The only "hackish" thing I did was to modify the menu.lst file
2009-07-20T01:43:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	I don't know where that script went, but consider reinstalling the "grub" package
2009-07-20T01:43:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	How can I "reinstall" it?
2009-07-20T01:44:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	not sure, but it's probably something like "apt-get install grub --reinstall"
2009-07-20T01:45:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	weird that you don't just have that script already though. It shouldn't just vanish, and iiuc it's just owned by jaunty's grub package here.
2009-07-20T01:45:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	Turns out grub was not officially "installed" ????
2009-07-20T01:45:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	weird, I had it installed after a straightforward jaunty install.
2009-07-20T01:45:00.000Z	mzz	lorenzosu	situation might be different in karmic though, which use grub 2, iirc.
2009-07-20T01:46:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	Now I'm going through the install I remember it was installed during upgrades, I updated to 9.04 recently
2009-07-20T01:48:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	(re)Installing grub seems to solve the problem.
2009-07-20T01:48:00.000Z	lorenzosu	mzz	thanks.
