2004-10-14T13:46:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	he said what does he need in sources.list, its in main  :/
2004-10-14T13:47:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	yes, but the package is 'linux-source' not 'kernel-source'
2004-10-14T13:48:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	still didn't answer his question... :/
2004-10-14T13:49:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	if he just did a "basic ubunut install" the he wouldnt have to add *anything* to his sources.list
2004-10-14T13:52:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	what medication? anything decent?  ;)
2004-11-12T06:40:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	blah... only reason I even have it installed is cuz the new mplayer packages in hoary depend it...
2004-11-12T06:41:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	replace the songs in your head with voices
2004-11-12T06:43:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	hmm, they should make something conflict it then  :(
2004-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	use a decent soundcard? my sb live has 32 dsps. i have no need of esd or any other shonky tat
2004-11-12T06:45:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	stfu, thats not helpful... enless you want to buy it for me... it works more often then not... I have my sound going 24/7, about once every other day it dies  :/
2004-11-12T06:46:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	dont use esd then and rely on alsa/oss to handle the audio without 'help' from esd?
2004-11-12T06:47:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	ugh... its not even esd that I'm using... its gstreamer...
2004-11-12T06:49:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	kill esd in the face and change the sink
2004-11-12T06:49:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	umm, the others have NEVER worked...
2004-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	probably because esd is grabbing the dsp, preventing anything else from using it?
2004-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	no, NOTHING BUT ESDSINK HAS EVER WORKED... EVEN WITH ESD NOT INSTALLED, WITHOUT IT, RHYTHMBOX JUST DOESN'T WORK... UNDERSTAND?
2004-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	thats alrihgt. i didnt actually put you on ignore. damn work interfered with irc
2004-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	see, now that you tried to help, I end up with NO sound, rather then just restarting and getting it back  :/
2004-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	helping isn't always useful  :/
2004-11-12T07:05:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	if you hadn't tried to help, no one would have recommended me a sound daemon that isn't working...
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	it might not make my sound start working, but it might make me feel better...
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	dredg	|trey|	seriously, i dont have time for this shit. nobody asked you to follow my (very vague) reccomendations - and they were RECOMMENDATIONS, not instructions - and i sure as hell didnt hold a gun to your head
2004-11-12T07:08:00.000Z	|trey|	dredg	afaik, you didn't even recommend the new sound daemon... but whatever  :/
