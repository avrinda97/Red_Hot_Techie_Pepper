2005-10-15T15:36:00.000Z	nalioth	sockpuppe1	no idea at all, sorry
2005-10-26T08:09:00.000Z	nalioth	sockpuppe1	install it by hand
2005-10-30T07:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sockpuppe1	it will work
2005-10-30T07:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sockpuppe1	find you a beat-up-486 and use it for a firewwall
2005-10-30T07:40:00.000Z	nalioth	sockpuppe1	using a 486 (or mini itx) allows more configuration then a "off the shelf" firewall
