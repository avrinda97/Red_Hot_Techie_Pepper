2012-03-07T15:02:00.000Z	luxius		hey, where can I get help getting to understand Ubuntu better? This channel or somewhere else?
2012-03-07T15:03:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Is there something in particular you wish to know/
2012-03-07T15:04:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	I have a few specific questions, yes. Yesterday I did 'sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop', updated and upgraded, then 'sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop' - but I don't see any difference, how can I check?
2012-03-07T15:04:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Log out. Then at the bottom of the screen, choose your desktop environment manually.
2012-03-07T15:05:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	I've literally just done the same. Trying out xfce
2012-03-07T15:07:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Did you run sudo apt-get update ?
2012-03-07T15:08:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Then remove the repo.
2012-03-07T15:13:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	ubuntu is Debian based. And releases much more often. However when Debian does release, it's a little more stable.
2012-03-07T16:29:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	yes.
2012-03-07T15:51:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Glad you could boot properly.
2012-03-07T15:52:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	do you know what that error message means? Why I can't access my home dir?
2012-03-07T15:53:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Not too sure on that one, I haven't had chance to learn the Linux file system well enough yet. sorry.
2012-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Right click on the desktop.
2012-03-07T16:32:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	have you tried it with root privelages/
2012-03-07T16:47:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	'Better' is subjective. It's all opinion based.
2012-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	how can you get duplicates on a Debian foundation? O.o
2012-03-07T17:45:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	that's probably because you need to fix some confs, once you get XFCE up and running I'm sure you'll like it =)
2012-03-07T17:45:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	I've removed it. Currently removing all the extras it installed and didn't remove when i uninstalled it.
2012-03-07T17:46:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	I'd remove ubuntu-desktop and then install xubuntu-desktop, but I'm not too sure if that's enough
2012-03-07T17:47:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	I'm aiming to revert to how it was before. ie gnome2.
2012-03-07T17:47:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	you chicken out already? ;)
2012-03-07T17:48:00.000Z	ndkelly	luxius	Pretty much. I need my environment to look somewhat pretty, something that Gnome allwos me.
2012-03-07T17:48:00.000Z	luxius	ndkelly	aim for Gnome3/xfce then
