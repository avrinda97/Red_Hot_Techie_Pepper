2008-11-29T13:17:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	i just installed 8.10 and gnome will not work nor reinstall.
2008-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	That is too vague. Please describe in greater detail your problem.
2008-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	and have you tried installing it?
2008-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	apt-get install xinit says i need to install xinit-common or something.
2008-11-29T13:19:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	Ok... have you tried installing xinit-common?
2008-11-29T13:19:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	and when i run xinit-common i get a message that says nothing was installed or updated etc
2008-11-29T13:19:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	it appears to be already installed.
2008-11-29T13:19:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	do you know how to use pastebin?
2008-11-29T13:20:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	unfortunately i cant use pastebin in the scenerio.  it's on another computyer.
2008-11-29T13:20:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	Ok, you'll have to do your best ... please post the output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
2008-11-29T13:21:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	ok, i will type it out..  i hope its not long
2008-11-29T13:21:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	 Yes... this doesn't sound like a killer problem. Patience sounds like the key to ubuntu bliss here. Too bad you are one of those for whom the default doesn't work well.
2008-11-29T13:22:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	all i see when i run that command are 6 entries that all start with 'deb" and say "interpid-security"
2008-11-29T13:23:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	that sounds like your problem
2008-11-29T13:23:00.000Z	amh	oOarthurOo	ok how do i fix this?
2008-11-29T13:23:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	maybe someone will pastebin a working ... intrepid? ... sources list for you.
2008-11-29T13:23:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	what country are you in and what ubuntu version do you have
2008-11-29T13:24:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	ask someone to post the output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list" who is from us or canada.
2008-11-29T13:25:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	that will likely say no package found.
2008-11-29T13:25:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	The problem seems to be that you are missing the repositories where all the software is stored. security doesn't have much. You nee the other repositories with all the software.
2008-11-29T13:26:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	amh	There is no need to disconnect the internet. When someone posts there /etc/apt/sources.list you will see what your file should look like. You can copy theirs onto your system, then save and close. Then update and upgrade and after that all should work well.
