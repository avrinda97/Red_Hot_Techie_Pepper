2007-08-22T12:29:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	Legal I hope
2007-08-22T12:30:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	that sounded like a no
2007-08-22T12:31:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	I put all of my rip on to 320 MP3
2007-08-22T12:31:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	You are obsessed with HQ music?
2007-08-22T12:31:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	yep
2007-08-22T12:31:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	Use lossless format
2007-08-22T12:32:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	why would I need that if I have the CDs? right?
2007-08-22T12:32:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	to have it digitally stored
2007-08-22T12:33:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	not that way
2007-08-22T12:34:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	You could rip to lossless and burn a dvd audio disc if you got dvd player capable
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	You should have gotten a meizu
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	never heard of it.
2007-08-22T12:36:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	Meizu. Chinese flavor to the ipod
2007-08-22T12:36:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	http://en.meizu.com/ M3 is Nano clone and M6 is way beyond ipod video clone
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	Meizu M3 supports WMA, WMA VBR, WMA LOSSLESS, OGG, WAV, FLAC Playback
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	cool
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	that's great
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	and m6 adds xvid support
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	and all for $150 for m6
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	but if I put all my cd into lossless I'd have over 600GB of music, way over my current capasicty.
2007-08-22T12:40:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	150-200
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z	kahrytan	Andrew250	How many cds do you have?
2007-08-22T12:42:00.000Z	Andrew250	kahrytan	more than I care to count and they are not all here.
