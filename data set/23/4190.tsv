2007-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Ok - I've got a minor problem
2007-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80		My keyboard has a volume up/down key
2007-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80		The keys work fine, but it increase/decreases volume to the wrong channel
2007-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Like it lowers the left speaker instead of both of them
2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Hello all
2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I would just like to say thanks
2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	ello
2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I moved to Ubuntu from SUSE yesterday
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Ubuntu is 10000x better
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	lol.  Really?  why's that?
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Everything just works
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I don't care about microphones
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80		My keyboard from MS works
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80		that was a big surprise
2007-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	interesting.   Yeah, I thought about trying openSuse... but I'm really comfortable with Ubuntu.
2007-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Like the fancy keys at the top
2007-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80	kolby	It's a good distro - but for whatever reason, it wouldn't put grub on the primary master HDD (SATA)
2007-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	 I'll be getting a fancy wireless keyboard soon.  lol
2007-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	 nicely put.  I still might give it a go-round then.
2007-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	Cpudan80	kolby	No matter how hard I tried - it wouldn't put grub on sda1
2007-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	 you know, I just wish I could find an extremely barebones version of Ubuntu.  Something like Damn Small.
2007-10-15T09:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	kolby	Ubuntu server doesn't work for you?
2007-10-15T09:14:00.000Z	kolby	Cpudan80	lol.  I'm a gui lover.  I probably should've went for the fluxbox instead of gnome when I went that way.
