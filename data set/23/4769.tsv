2007-05-11T10:54:00.000Z	Defian		ah, I gotcha.
2007-05-11T10:54:00.000Z	Defian		didn't work though, same error
2007-05-11T10:55:00.000Z	Defian		"Exiting due to error"... most unhelpful error message. ever.
2007-05-11T10:56:00.000Z	owh	Defian	I can beat that: "Keyboard missing, press F1 to continue."
2007-05-11T10:56:00.000Z	Defian	owh	oh hardy har.
2007-05-11T11:12:00.000Z	owh	Defian	I've been doing something else, can you give me a 30 second rundown you your challenges?
2007-05-11T11:13:00.000Z	Defian	owh	sure, one moment
2007-05-11T11:13:00.000Z	Defian	owh	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=439634 here, the first post sums it all up.
2007-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	owh	Defian	Well, the first thing to do is run it using strace, it might take a little while but it should give you some clues: strace ut2004-bin
2007-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	owh	Defian	That won't fix it, but it will show you what is happening.
2007-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	Defian	owh	it's done already
2007-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	owh	Defian	Pastebin the result.
2007-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	Defian	owh	i'm not sure what you mean by that
2007-05-11T11:18:00.000Z	Defian	owh	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20293/ here ya go
2007-05-11T11:21:00.000Z	Defian	owh	any thoughts?
2007-05-11T11:21:00.000Z	owh	Defian	there is a lot of references to files missing. I have never run ut2004, nor do I know what it does or how it works, but the .ut2004 directory in your home directory appears to have stuff missing. Perhaps you could rename it, then try to launch it again.
2007-05-11T11:22:00.000Z	Defian	owh	thanks, i'll do that.
2007-05-11T11:26:00.000Z	Defian	owh	ah HA! thank you soooo very much
2007-05-11T11:27:00.000Z	owh	Defian	I'm guessing that it now works :)
2007-05-11T11:28:00.000Z	Defian	owh	i've been slamming my head against concrete all day trying to figure this out. Now I know about strace, woo!
2007-05-11T11:28:00.000Z	owh	Defian	all good. Happy to help. Have fun.
2007-05-11T11:28:00.000Z	Defian	owh	Thanks. People in these linux communities are so much nicer than the gaming ones...
2007-05-11T11:29:00.000Z	owh	Defian	:-)
