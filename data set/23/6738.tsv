2006-01-22T10:13:00.000Z	GameOver		hey guys does anyonen know how to get a HP multimedia keyboard to work... so i can control the volume and stuff?... maybe get onscreen graphics too when i do so
2006-01-22T10:13:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	There was a package i found once. Look in Synaptic for hotkeys
2006-01-22T10:15:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Something to do with hotkeys, and not the one that comes with ubuntu
2006-01-22T10:15:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Let me look
2006-01-22T10:16:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Is Hotkey-setup already installed?
2006-01-22T10:17:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Ok, because hotkeys-setup comes bundled with Ubuntu, IIRC.
2006-01-22T10:18:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	If you already have the first one, then yes.
2006-01-22T10:18:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Are you on Gnome or KDE?
2006-01-22T10:20:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Ok, yeah. When I was using Kubuntu, I had to get the Hotkeys scripts
2006-01-22T10:20:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Do you have hotkey-setup already?
2006-01-22T10:20:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Yeah, go for the other one
2006-01-22T10:20:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Both
2006-01-22T10:21:00.000Z	GameOver	Shadyman	and should work once installed?
2006-01-22T10:21:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	May take some minimal configuring.
2006-01-22T10:21:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	It should have man pages though. I can try, but it's been a while.
2006-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	GameOver	Shadyman	can u help me configure the hotkeys
2006-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	I can try.
2006-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Try going in to terminal, do "man hotkeys". That should give you some info about it
2006-01-22T10:30:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Also, there should be a directory, either /etc/default/hotkeys, /etc/hotkeys, /usr/share/hotkeys, something like that
2006-01-22T10:31:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	This will have all the configuration files, as well as keyboard definitions
2006-01-22T10:44:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	There's a config file where you set all the commands for it
2006-01-22T10:44:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	It might be /etc/Hotkeys?
2006-01-22T10:46:00.000Z	Shadyman	GameOver	Nope, that's why we're doing it with the hotkeys package ;)
