2006-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	Jof		but i did that already
2006-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	Jof		Xhcat opens when i click at the link, but it does not connect to the server and chan
2006-09-30T09:30:00.000Z	Jof		and you should: sudo mount -t auto .....
2006-10-02T13:01:00.000Z	Jof		i have a problem with opening irc links in firefox with xchat
2006-10-02T13:01:00.000Z	Jof		hi
2006-10-02T13:02:00.000Z	Jof		Xchat opens when i klick on the link, but it does not connect to the server and chan
2006-10-02T13:03:00.000Z	Jof		so what do you use ivoks
2006-10-02T13:03:00.000Z	Jof		i think xchat is the best irc client
2006-10-02T13:03:00.000Z	Jof		except mirc..
2006-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	Jof		does nobody else have the problem with opening irc links in xchat?
2006-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	Jof		in firefox
2006-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	Jof		yes
2006-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	Jof		with breezy
2006-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	Jof		i didn't have the problem
2006-10-02T13:05:00.000Z	Jof		i think thats the xchat-gnome
2006-10-02T13:05:00.000Z	Jof		its very crappy
2006-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	Jof		i did that already
2006-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	Jof		but i think its not completely removed
2006-10-02T13:06:00.000Z	Jof		because the regular xchat has the same preferences as i had with xchat-gnome
2006-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	Jof	bluefox83	can i qry you?
