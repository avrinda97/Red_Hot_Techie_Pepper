2012-09-04T08:27:00.000Z	leidenfrost		Hello guys. I´m trying to install vmware tools in a virtualized Ubuntu. However, when I run vmware-user this error message shows up: http://i.imgur.com/XzybT.png
2012-09-04T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	what is the output of:  uname -a
2012-09-04T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	and the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-09-04T08:30:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	precise
2012-09-04T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	the Precise kernel is 3.2  not 2.3
2012-09-04T08:32:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	Lol sorry, that was a typo
2012-09-04T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	how is this an Ubuntu issue then?
2012-09-04T08:33:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	IMHO is a generic linux issue. I´m just searching for the ubuntu way to solve it. ¨Libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.9´ not found¨
2012-09-04T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	there is a channel for 'generic linux issues'  it's  #linux
2012-09-04T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	this is for Ubuntu specific issues only
2012-09-04T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	each distribution of GNU Linux has it's own channel
2012-09-04T08:36:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	That´s almost true. But there´s also the fact that some distros deal with library issues in different ways.
2012-09-04T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	yes tahts why they have their own channels
2012-09-04T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	as the users in said channels will have an appreciation of those issues and can advise
2012-09-04T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	why not try #redhat or #fedora   it appears to be a redhat kernel
2012-09-04T08:38:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	I thought the problem was ubuntu specific. But thanks for the help anyway.
2012-09-04T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	its not an ubuntu kernel
2012-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	Neither are the C libraries. But the packaging of the libraries are ubuntu indeed.
2012-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	you aren't using Ubuntu, therefore not supported here...its literally that simple
2012-09-04T08:41:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	How come I´m not using ubuntu? both uname-a and lsb_release outputs indicate I´m using Ubuntu.
2012-09-04T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	you aren't, Even warty warhog (the first release) uses 2.6
2012-09-04T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leidenfrost	if you wont listen to me
2012-09-04T08:45:00.000Z	leidenfrost	ActionParsnip	I get it. I´m sorry, maybe I have expressed wrong. The 2.3.9-29 was a typo (Indeed, 2.3.29 is ancient)
