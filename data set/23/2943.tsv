2008-09-15T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	i set up someones i810 yesterday and her xorg.conf was much simpler
2008-09-15T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	if you see someone called st3ph (fairly regular user) as her for her xorg.conf
2008-09-15T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	quite a lot, yes
2008-09-16T14:46:00.000Z	xtrememertx	ActionParsnip	i met st3ph
2008-09-16T14:47:00.000Z	xtrememertx	ActionParsnip	 I saw her config file  she has an 865  and i have 810
2008-09-16T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	do you mean st3ph's?
2008-09-16T14:48:00.000Z	xtrememertx	ActionParsnip	yes
2008-09-16T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	she has an i810 driver running which is giving her full res
2008-09-16T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	doesnt hurt to have a go, you can always roll back if you backup your current xorg.conf
2008-09-16T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	xorg.conf will always be the same
2008-09-16T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	then leave that line in yours and change the rest
2008-09-16T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	you just gotta play with that file dude, what graphics card do you have again?
2008-09-16T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	what does lspci say?
2008-09-16T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xtrememertx	just websearching
2008-09-16T15:25:00.000Z	xtrememertx	ActionParsnip	does it have anything to do with aiglx warnings ?
