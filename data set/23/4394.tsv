2007-09-13T14:18:00.000Z	Some_ux		I know there are many text editors in linux, which one is worth getting used to ?
2007-09-13T14:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	vi
2007-09-13T14:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	it may not mean 'core' as in cpu cores
2007-09-13T14:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	there is no way to tell and it's different for each mobo, it comes with a hardcoded list of possible sensor names for different chips
2007-09-13T14:47:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	I dont understand how Hyperthreading makes me get 2 readings for core temperature. Does Hyperthreading involve setting a second diode in the chipset ?
2007-09-13T14:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	the 'cores' that sensors talk about are probably not cpu cores
2007-09-13T14:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	your cpu may have two temperature probes, or sensors may be giving the wrong names
2007-09-13T14:51:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	I see, so most likely it is reffering to the MB and Core0 temperatures... at least by the numbers i get it makes sense
2007-09-13T14:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	there is a file in /etc/ that you can modify so the sensors are correctly labelled
2007-09-13T14:55:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	cool, assuming i know which is which :P
2007-09-13T14:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	all it does is detect sensor chips, there is no trivial way to detect which sensors are for what
2007-09-13T14:58:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	which /etc/ should i mess around with ?
2007-09-13T14:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	/etc/sensors or similar iirc
2007-09-13T15:00:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	/etc/sensors.conf ?
2007-09-13T15:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	that's the one
2007-09-13T15:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	so why do the sensor labels not match up?
2007-09-13T15:11:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	I meant that someone has already come accross my problem and edited the sensors.conf file, so i dont have to break my head which sensors does what
2007-09-13T15:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	so your sensors are labelled correctly?
2007-09-13T15:14:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	i am trying to understand which lines i need to edit
2007-09-13T15:18:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	apparently, the sensors.conf files does contain some of the correct labels, but they are commented out.
2007-09-13T15:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	ah i see
2007-09-13T15:20:00.000Z	Some_ux	dystopianray	the trick is figuring out what type of MB chipset you have, in my case, i believe it is "it8716-*" though the motherboard is ASUS M2NPV-VM
2007-09-13T15:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	Some_ux	sensors will tell you the chip it is reading from
