2010-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	rupert		i changed my name. i will repeat my question hopefully smb can see it and maybe help with it. btw i think it is not much to do. maybe just know where truecrypt looks for this library, thx
2010-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	rupert		got a problem - seeking assistance:  truecrypt 7.0 - ubuntu 10.10: when launching trucrypt it cannot find libfuse (libfuse is located in /lib and has simlinks to /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib) any ideas? ps. trucrypt installed from website via scrypt
2010-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	rupert		pls, anyone?
2010-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Yes?
2010-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Do you have the exact error, you get?
2010-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	rupert	Dabian	- i dont mind if you can do it in private also, any way you prefer
2010-12-15T07:53:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	But you have that file, its just a symlink?
2010-12-15T07:54:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	What does dpkg -S libfuse.so.2 give you?
2010-12-15T07:55:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Sounds like you have trouble with LDLIBRARY_PATH or something.
2010-12-15T07:56:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Did you compile truecrypt yourself?
2010-12-15T08:02:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	I am reading on the truecrypt website.
2010-12-15T08:03:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Where does truecrypt install?
2010-12-15T08:10:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	How did you fix it?
2010-12-15T08:12:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Interesting!
2010-12-15T08:15:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Whats does "file /lib/libfuse.so.2.8.4" give you?
2010-12-15T08:20:00.000Z	rupert	Dabian	this is wicked, check this out, the file gives (((((/lib/libfuse.so.2.8.4: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped)))) but the funny is i dlded the i386 pckage manually from repository and checked it and it only has 64 bit versions...
2010-12-15T08:21:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Thats probably a bug then!
2010-12-15T08:23:00.000Z	rupert	Dabian	nop actually the one i dlded is 32bit. sweet. finally lolz
2010-12-15T08:23:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	OK .. a word of advise .. keep a backup somewhere, before you crypt your stuff.
2010-12-15T08:24:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	People tend to loose their encrypted stuff, because they don't think it will happen to them.
2010-12-15T08:24:00.000Z	rupert	Dabian	thats good advice, but i am still waiting to get the big hdd delivered till then i cross my fingers
2010-12-15T08:25:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Good luck. :)
2010-12-15T08:25:00.000Z	Dabian	rupert	Had a friend that lost 5 years of data that way, because he was impatient. :)
