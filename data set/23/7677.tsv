2006-06-27T07:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		oh and why does apt sometimes tell you "the following packages have been kept back" but synaptic wont?
2006-06-27T07:51:00.000Z	wasabi	pppoe_dude	apt-get dist-upgrade?
2006-06-27T07:51:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	no i just want to make sure it never installs them by accident
2006-06-27T07:51:00.000Z	wasabi		synaptic uses dist-upgrade by default, which allows apt to consider removing packages to fulfil dependencies.
2006-06-27T07:52:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		i.e. can i guarantee that everytime i do an apt-get upgrade these packages will be kept
2006-06-27T07:52:00.000Z	wasabi		apt-get upgrade doesn't allow removing, which can prevent some new packages from being installed.
2006-06-27T07:52:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	oh i see... but linux-image doesnt require package removal
2006-06-27T07:52:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		and it was kept back
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		It was kept back because something it depended on couldn't be installed.
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		Because THAT conflicted with something that could be removed.
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		i see
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		well... its safe to just keep the old kernel right?
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		Sure.
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		Check the reason for the upgrade.
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		security upgrade, etc.
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	i also locked the versions in 'synaptic'... would that also lock them in apt-get?
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	how do i do that?
2006-06-27T07:53:00.000Z	wasabi		Yes.
2006-06-27T07:54:00.000Z	wasabi		synaptic should lsit the change log.
2006-06-27T07:54:00.000Z	wasabi		hm... apt-listchanges used to be around too, for the console.
2006-06-27T07:54:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	ok thanks
2006-06-27T07:54:00.000Z	wasabi		I'm not sure if it's still functional though.
2006-06-27T07:56:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	wasabi	ya according to the change log they['re all 'low urgency' updates that i probably dont need
