2005-02-08T07:15:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	it will.
2005-02-11T13:29:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	Try it out - download the live cd.
2005-02-11T13:30:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	i have, but seems really slow...:)
2005-02-17T13:05:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	yes
2005-02-17T13:05:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	can i install it on a root lvm parition though?
2005-02-17T13:05:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	install root on lvm rather
2005-02-17T13:07:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	the only space i have is on a LVM drive... in the past i recall you needed an initrd to boot from to have the LVM user space tools
2005-02-17T13:08:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	You need some kind of bootloader set up, yes; there is not MBR on an LVM volume.
2005-02-17T13:08:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	oh no, i have grub on my debian... i have a bootloader..
2005-02-17T13:08:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	i just have no non-LVM parition to donate to root... so if files are neded to "start" LVM before LVM is accessible then all is lost
2005-02-17T13:09:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	I believe you should be OK, but I'm not positive.
2005-02-17T13:09:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	ok
2005-02-17T13:09:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	If it was earlier I'd go check to verify that my roomie's machine is setup like that, but I think he's been asleep for a while now.
2005-02-17T13:10:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	*nods*
2005-02-17T13:10:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	i won't have the CD for horus and no CDRs here
2005-02-17T13:10:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	so oh well
2005-02-26T07:43:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	are you on hoary?
2005-02-26T07:43:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	Yes.
2005-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	does it have composre compiled into xorg by default?
2005-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	You just install libcomposite or some such.
2005-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	ah
2005-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ficusplanet	i use x.org, but a dri snapshot, don't think composite is compiled in
2005-02-26T07:46:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Dreamer3	Actually, libxcomposite, now that I look.  Yeah, composite is running pretty well for me - even on an i810.
