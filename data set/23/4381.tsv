2007-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	ScorpKing		does anyone here use a cellphone for their internet connection. mine is too slow. about 1MB traffic in a hour. :/
2007-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	ScorpKing	I used to use a cell phone to connect to the net, it was about 56k speed...like 4-5kB/sec
2007-08-29T15:52:00.000Z	Evanlec		but then i realized later that it was costing me a penny per kB, i found out i had an 800$ phone bill ! :( :(
2007-08-29T15:52:00.000Z	ScorpKing	Evanlec	i can connect to irc but thats it. have ping with 78% packet loss. how do i check the speed?

2007-08-29T15:54:00.000Z	Evanlec		78% packet loss...thats not good, i'm guessing weak signal
2007-08-29T15:54:00.000Z	ScorpKing	Evanlec	host not found in browser. can ping google.com.
2007-08-29T15:54:00.000Z	Evanlec		so you can ping or can't ?
2007-08-29T15:55:00.000Z	Evanlec		whats your ping time? you're probably timing out on file request
2007-08-29T15:55:00.000Z	ScorpKing	Evanlec	checking...
2007-08-29T15:56:00.000Z	Evanlec		why won't they? damn them

2007-08-29T15:57:00.000Z	Evanlec		Scorp, i'd search for settings on your phone that could improve data speeds
2007-08-29T15:57:00.000Z	ScorpKing	Evanlec	what i don't get is why konqueror don't have dns.:/ will do.
2007-08-29T15:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	ScorpKing	i dont understand, you can ping hosts, that means ur dns is working...
2007-08-29T15:58:00.000Z	Evanlec		perhaps just very slowly
2007-08-29T15:59:00.000Z	ScorpKing	Evanlec	i can ping google.com yes. browser say host not found.
