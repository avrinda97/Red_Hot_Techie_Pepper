2005-09-02T14:43:00.000Z	Homerr		im totally stumped by this :(
2005-09-02T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	tell me this can you boot using a live CD ?
2005-09-02T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	are you doing that at the moment?
2005-09-02T14:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	yeah if you can get a network connection it might be very useful
2005-09-02T14:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	what was with the boooork ?
2005-09-02T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	emmmm http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=326676
2005-09-02T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	does it say grub when it starts or just missing operating system?
2005-09-02T15:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	it won't your machine is trying to boot the windows disk that is where the error is coming from
2005-09-02T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	 cemc,  http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=45527
2005-09-02T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	cemc forget that
2005-09-02T15:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	that is a different error
2005-09-02T15:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	if I understand this the issue was that windows wanted to be on a master
2005-09-02T15:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	well it would be a good way to go
2005-09-02T15:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	but it would be better if you got rid of that other operating system* much better [* very loose use of language] 
2005-09-02T15:36:00.000Z	Homerr	ompaul	i would if more games were in linux
2005-09-02T15:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	that is cos you did it automagically on the last boot
2005-09-02T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	at 10:37pm you need coco :)
2005-09-02T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	or horlicks
2005-09-02T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	no we told you for the last 800 years it ain't :)
2005-09-02T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	that is good (kind of) it means your MoBo ain't is not seeing a boot sector
2005-09-02T15:46:00.000Z	Homerr	ompaul	would my idea work?
2005-09-02T15:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	have a shot at it - it might
2005-09-02T15:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Homerr	emole your contotions, tanguage limiothy :)
