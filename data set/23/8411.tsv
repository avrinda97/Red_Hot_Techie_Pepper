2009-08-03T04:39:00.000Z	jondavis		well can anybody help me .i just ask yall some ?????
2009-08-03T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 you just go to the linux mint web site and download it.. then right click -> burn. normally
2009-08-03T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 if you are using ubuntu.. i would just learn ubuntu. and leave mint alone
2009-08-03T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 you are not making sence.. did it burn sucesuffy? You dio realize you INSTLALL mint as you instlled ubuntu. its not a program.
2009-08-03T04:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 you need to start making more sence.  Ubuntu should be able to burn an iso file to disk quite easially.
2009-08-03T04:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 then clarify whats not working EXACTLY.
2009-08-03T04:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 clarify what you mean by not working.. You reboot the pc with the disk in the drive and it fails to boot properly?  the fact you are on ubuntu seems  to be irellavant.
2009-08-03T04:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 'yes i have' is not really an answer...
2009-08-03T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	  you DONT 'convert' ubuntu to linux mint.. You boot the mint cd and install linux mint.  its a different operating system.
2009-08-03T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 if the mint cd is failing to boot  - then it proberly gave some error messages. and you either 1) had a bad iso file. or 2) some sort of issue with the burn.
2009-08-03T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 i tend to use unetbootin to put iso files on a bootable flash drive. makes for a faster install media.   I would suggest checking the md5sum of the iso. and either reburn if its correct. or use unetbootin.
2009-08-03T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 you dont 'format ubuntu' you format a filesystem.
2009-08-03T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 if you got ubuntu installed.. then i suggest you spend some time learning Ubuntu and linux basics.
2009-08-03T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 you gain very little by using 'mint'  and techincally we DONT support mint in this channel.
2009-08-03T04:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 use Ubuntu.. ive said that 3+ times now.
2009-08-03T04:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 read, read, read, read... hang out here.. and read....
2009-08-03T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 print out documments/articals, put them in the bathroom.. eat lots of fiber...
2009-08-03T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 so? theres lots of free books also...
2009-08-03T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 then you have to go read and learn...
2009-08-03T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 linux is one thing.. Ubuntu is a specific Linux disrtobution.
2009-08-13T05:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jondavis	 thats a vague and pointless term. :)
