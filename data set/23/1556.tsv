2010-04-26T04:22:00.000Z	un214		sudo sshd
2010-04-26T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	un214	no, that is not the proper way to start sshd
2010-04-26T04:23:00.000Z	un214	jrib	it's good enough to bring it up when your display is hosed so you can remote in and fix it
2010-04-26T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	un214	use: sudo service ssh start
2010-06-05T08:22:00.000Z	jrib	un214	most of the things in your administrator menu will break for starters...
2010-06-05T08:23:00.000Z	jrib	un214	sudo is used in a console :/
2010-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	jrib	un214	it's your system, do whatever you want.  Running all the time as root is certainly not recommended though
2010-06-05T08:27:00.000Z	un214	jrib	you could postfix that with "that I tried"
2010-06-05T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	un214	you know you can just issue « sudo -i », if typing "sudo" repeatedly is what bothers you?
2010-06-05T08:30:00.000Z	un214	jrib	no, that's not it
2010-06-05T08:30:00.000Z	un214	jrib	I believe sudo is less secure than logging in to a secure console
2010-06-05T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	un214	that's the right package
2010-06-05T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	un214	erm, why?
2010-06-05T08:31:00.000Z	un214	jrib	trojan can easily patch bash in ram to run its own sudo, grab the password, and have a heyday
2010-06-05T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	un214	if I can easily patch X, I think you have more pressing issues....
2010-06-05T08:32:00.000Z	un214	jrib	patch bash, not X
2010-06-05T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	un214	oh, it's only easy to patch bash?
2010-06-05T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	un214	I meant X as a variable
2010-06-05T08:32:00.000Z	un214	jrib	ah
2010-06-05T08:33:00.000Z	un214	jrib	I've patched programs in RAM to do other things then the author intended before
2010-06-05T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	un214	but if you patch bash and when you login with root you use a bash shell...
2010-06-05T08:34:00.000Z	un214	jrib	you see, patching software on disk requires admin but patching the running image can be done by attaching as a debugger
2010-06-05T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	un214	I don't think this is a good reason to remove sudo in favor of logging in as root.  Just keep sudo installed.  If you prefer to login as root for some tasks, that's fine
