2006-08-09T07:00:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	u dont need to do all that
2006-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	did you say something to me?  If you don't use my full nick, I don't notice your messages
2006-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	it would be easier to just make cron create and output file for the script
2006-08-09T07:19:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	some of your advice is ill conceived.  This is a personal crontab.  Dumping it's output in the root directory and using 777 perms creates a security hole
2006-08-09T07:24:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	you are advising cowmilk without regard to his actual environment.  Please pay attention to what has been said before and what files he has actually created.
2006-08-09T07:26:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	u do need a space before and after the >
2006-08-09T07:28:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	incorrect.
2006-08-09T07:28:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	incorrect.  No spaces around > or >> are needed.  This is basic shell syntax: the > and >> are tokens that are distinguished without need of context.
2006-08-09T07:29:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	well i just added an entry without the spaces... in a sec i will see if the new upload.test.out file is created
2006-08-09T07:30:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	but i believe it is needed or cron thinks ur just running files together...
2006-08-09T07:30:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	i could be wrong but i just want to make sure now
2006-08-09T07:30:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	cowmilk: cron just invokes bash.  It doesn't have its own syntax.  Save yourself the trouble and test on the command line
2006-08-09T07:31:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	show me a command where you think the spaces are needed.
2006-08-09T07:33:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	just do this: echo blab>newfile   It will work.
2006-08-09T07:36:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	No!  do *not* instruct cowmilk to use relative pathnames in a crontab
2006-08-09T07:38:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	just out of curiousity... whats wrong with it? u say dont assume variables... a users cron doesn't care... it knows what user and assumes /home/user anyway
2006-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	man zenity
2006-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	btw, zenity is installed by default on by breezy badger
2006-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	using dapper
2006-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	so, zenity isn't present on your system?
2006-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	josh__	ic56	im sure it is... never knew about it though
2006-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	just type "which zenity" and give me a straight answer already
2006-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	ic56	josh__	ok. so it's installed by default.  So we can advise people in this channel to use it without having to go through installing it.  Thanks.
