2009-11-27T22:39:00.000Z	rseeber		Symptom: Since installing Karmic, my laptop randomly just slows down to an unusable state until I reboot. Anyone know of a way to fix that?
2009-11-27T22:41:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	WHEN does it slow down
2009-11-27T22:41:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	usually after just leaving it on for a day or so

2009-11-27T22:49:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	26gb or so
2009-11-27T22:49:00.000Z	Younder		eicholsher: no, but it's on the wiak lisp
2009-11-27T22:50:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	and the size of your disk?
2009-11-27T22:50:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	40gb
2009-11-27T22:52:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	ok so that's not it
2009-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	what processor do you have?
2009-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	model name : Mobile Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 2.00GHz
2009-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	ahh, a laptop
2009-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	it is probaly sleeping..
2009-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	it's been plugged in most of the time, and i shot off sleep on lid close
2009-11-27T22:56:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	right, but the problem is it doesn't wake up after a long pause right?
2009-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	Use hdparm; a command line tool to disable advanced power management (APM). This is achieved by running the following command :$ sudo hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda
2009-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	well after sitting around but being on, not in suspend or hibernate
2009-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	see if that helps
2009-11-27T22:59:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	i keep it plugged in most of the time, so i'm not too concerned with battery, but how much does it affect battery life?
2009-11-27T23:00:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	i just ran the command, so i'll see what happens when i come back to the computer later tonight
2009-11-27T23:00:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	I dons't have to do with battery, but more with what it DOES when it sleeps
2009-11-27T23:01:00.000Z	Younder	rseeber	well, good luck. report bak if it doesn't work
2009-11-27T23:01:00.000Z	rseeber	Younder	Thanks!
