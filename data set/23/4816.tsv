2008-08-26T03:23:00.000Z	mar1		mecha25 how exactly do i use x11 mode in vlc to improve video quality?
2008-08-26T03:23:00.000Z	mar1		i'm not sure where the setting is
2008-08-26T03:25:00.000Z	mar1		does anyone know how to set up vlc to use x11 mode and will this improve video quality (currently videos flicker quite dramatically with ati drivers installed)
2008-08-26T03:26:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	what mode are you using now?
2008-08-26T03:29:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	well, slow video is usually an indication of slow hardware or intensive resource allocation
2008-08-26T03:30:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	can you run glxgears?
2008-08-26T03:32:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	that's okay :) if you click on Applications->Accessories->Terminal, then type glxgears and press enter in the terminal, it should run and show you how many FPS
2008-08-26T03:33:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	oh, your video is quite fast indeed :)
2008-08-26T03:35:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	i'm not sure, but you could try turning overlay support on or off in vlc preference (Video settings)
2008-08-26T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	start typing the first 2 or 3 letters of someone's nickname then press tab
2008-08-26T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	you may have to press tab a few times to get it right
2008-08-26T03:38:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	cool thanks
2008-08-26T03:38:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	the overlay thing didn't really help
2008-08-26T03:38:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	any other ideas? if not i think i'll give up for now and try again tomorrow
2008-08-26T03:39:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	is it slow in fullscreen or just windowed mode?
2008-08-26T03:40:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	both although it seems to be worse in fullscreen
2008-08-26T03:41:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	try the solution the bottom of this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=381107
2008-08-26T03:41:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	ok thanks i'll give that a try
2008-08-26T03:44:00.000Z	mar1	Gnea	that seemed to help a bit but it's still pretty bad
2008-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	does that include home folder?
2008-09-04T06:44:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	ntfsfix
2008-09-04T06:45:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	just make sure it's unmounted before using it
2008-09-04T06:46:00.000Z	Gnea	mar1	but just FYI - you'll need to reboot it, and it will probably run chkdsk on it - let it run, that's normal (and good)
