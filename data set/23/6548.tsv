2006-03-19T06:29:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	that warning you posted just means that that particular function will not be used.
2006-03-19T06:38:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	you have build-essential installed ?
2006-03-19T06:41:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	in a terminal type    sudo apt-get install build-essential

2006-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	one line pastes are tolerated very well here    but do not flood.
2006-03-19T06:54:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	what do you mean what now ?   i didn't see any error message ?
2006-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	notice     warning != error
2006-03-19T06:56:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	that is a warning, not an error.
2006-03-19T06:57:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	it's telling you that that function is not going to be used.     i have no idea what the function will or wont do but the program should work.
2006-03-19T06:58:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	in linux   no error    generally means  no error.
2006-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	probably  what program are you installing there ?
2006-03-19T07:00:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	and did you follow the instruvtions provided by it's author ?
2006-03-19T07:01:00.000Z	intelikey	abhorsen	if it was a source package (file.tar.gz)  look for any files in the unpacked directory that are all caps.   README  INSTALL ...
