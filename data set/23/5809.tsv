2006-08-30T05:33:00.000Z	squelly		Does a typical fresh install have web access?
2006-08-30T05:34:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	if you have a wired network, yes. wireless may need some configuring
2006-08-30T05:38:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	is there only one network card in that computer? what does system > administration > networking say?
2006-08-30T05:39:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	right, only one network card. IN the connections it says 'eth0 The interface eth0 is active"
2006-08-30T05:40:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	what is on the other end of the ethernet cable? a cable/dsl home router or something else?
2006-08-30T05:40:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	verizon FIOS router.
2006-08-30T05:42:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	okay, i don't know much about fios. try what Jack_Sparrow said, then type "ifconfig" at a terminal and put the output in a pastebin for us to see
2006-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	, Jack_Sparrow: OK, I'll try now. dunno what a pastebin is, tho' sorry.
2006-08-30T05:47:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	was there any other output other than that from ifup?
2006-08-30T05:49:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	in the eth0 section, what does it say on the "inet addr" line?
2006-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	inet addr: 127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 in the "lo" section. That line is not present in eth0
2006-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	only an inet6 addr enttry.
2006-08-30T05:52:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	type "dmesg | grep eth0" to see if there are any kernel messages about your network card
2006-08-30T05:53:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	ahhh, actually, do you know if your router needs PPPoE to work? googling for verizon fios suggests it does..
2006-08-30T05:55:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	eth0 Xircom Carbus adapter.... eth0 link is up running at 100Mbit, half duplex ...eth0 noIPV6 routers present ... eth0 Link is up running at 100Mbit half duplex ...eth0 no IPV6 routers present ... eth0 MII transceiver #0 config 3100 status 7809 advertising 01el
2006-08-30T06:01:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	sorry for the delay, i've been reading up about how fios works but can't find much that's helpful. try "sudo pppoeconf" and answer any questions about your internet connection, there is possibly a bug where the live cd settings do not get saved correctly later on.
2006-08-30T06:02:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	OK, I;ll do that now.
2006-08-30T06:04:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	"Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access concentrator of you provider did not respond..."
2006-08-30T06:11:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	i have found a couple of old threads where people talk about that access concentrator error, but no fix
2006-08-30T06:11:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	have you tried powering off the pc and router, powering the router on and waiting for it to start, then powering the pc back on?
2006-08-30T06:12:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	I tried that earlier, no joy.
2006-08-30T06:13:00.000Z	longwave	squelly	sorry, i am stumped then :(
2006-08-30T06:14:00.000Z	squelly	longwave	s'ok. I appreciate you trying!
