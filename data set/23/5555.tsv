2008-02-06T02:07:00.000Z	JvA		Is there some way to completly remove Compiz from Ubuntu 7.10 or turn it off? With Kubuntu I got 8000 fps with glxgears, but now in Ubuntu with Compiz "almost" turned off I get 6000.
2008-02-06T02:07:00.000Z	JvA		How do I make it completly turned off?
2008-02-06T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	disable "desktop effects"
2008-02-06T02:08:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	did that. And then I got 6000 fps instead of 3000.
2008-02-06T02:08:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	still 2000 fps too slow.
2008-02-06T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	ati card ?
2008-02-06T02:08:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	NVIDIA 8600GT
2008-02-06T02:09:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	the support is good in the nivida-glx-new driver at least.
2008-02-06T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	not that good, your not getting the frame rates you want
2008-02-06T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	I've never used an 8600 so don't know if thats normal
2008-02-06T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	disabling it makes it "gone"
2008-02-06T02:11:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	but it doesn't :/
2008-02-06T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	how do you know it's compiz
2008-02-06T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	I agree
2008-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	nothing that points at compiz obviously though
2008-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	thats part of meta city
2008-02-06T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	does ps -ef | grep compiz show it as running
2008-02-06T02:13:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	nope
2008-02-06T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	good good, at least it's not running
2008-06-07T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	JvA	no problem, for video it's as simple as either a.) using the nast nvidia-settings tools along with the gnome desktop tools b.) changing the output dvice from pci:0:0:1 to pci:0:1:0 in the xorg.conf, for sound it's a little more complex, especially with pulse
2008-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	Sound is not prio 1, but the screen is. The pci:0:1:0 part. Should I put that under "Device" in xorg.conf, where the other pci-part normally is?
2008-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	that is, replace it
2008-06-07T12:51:00.000Z	JvA	ikonia	And what do you mena use the nvidia tool with the gnome-desktop tool? Don't they operate individually?
