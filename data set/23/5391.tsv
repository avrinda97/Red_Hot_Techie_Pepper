2007-03-21T16:28:00.000Z	beg1689		its ok mine finished
2007-03-21T16:29:00.000Z	beg1689		well, not *sure*
2007-03-21T16:30:00.000Z	beg1689		i woudlnt say that
2007-03-21T16:31:00.000Z	beg1689		but i use i386 on my 64 bit cpu because i dont feel like bothering with compatibility issues yet
2007-03-21T16:31:00.000Z	beg1689		and wine especially doesnt seem to like it
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	beg1689		how much ram?
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	beg1689		i dont really see the use in a 64 gb desktop system
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	beg1689		64 bit*
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	beg1689		how the hell do you get 64 gb?
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	linxeh	beg1689	I can see lots of point
2007-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	linxeh	beg1689	with a lot of money
2007-03-21T16:37:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	e17?
2007-03-21T16:38:00.000Z	linxeh	beg1689	I bet you've never seen the kernel crash eitehr
2007-03-21T16:38:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	i think maybe i have
2007-03-21T16:39:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	when i used kubuntu (ill never use that crap again) it crashed quite a few times, i believe the kernel itself crashed
2007-03-21T16:40:00.000Z	linxeh	beg1689	well that sounds like graphics card driver issues rather than anything else (maybe KDE did something your other WMs didn't, but X shouldnt be able to kill the kernel?)
2007-03-21T16:41:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	well it happened 2 or 3 times, i tried a frsh install, still happened
2007-03-21T16:41:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	using regular ubuntu now, never had the issue
2007-03-21T16:42:00.000Z	linxeh	beg1689	I run ubuntu, but have xubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop installed too - using kde at the moment, as I find gnome depressing (I hate the look of KDE, but it does actually let you do stuff...)
2007-03-21T16:43:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	well i prefer gnome over kde/xfce, but i just love e17 more than any of them
2007-03-21T16:43:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	only sad part is no beryl
2007-03-21T16:44:00.000Z	beg1689	linxeh	but further down the line, they play to have opengl rendering and effects built in, but not required
