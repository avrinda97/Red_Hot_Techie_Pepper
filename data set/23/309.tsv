2011-12-26T07:28:00.000Z	yofun		Just tell me like a program to do that?
2011-12-26T07:29:00.000Z	yofun		I mean for irc dnses
2011-12-26T07:29:00.000Z	yofun		Etc
2011-12-26T07:29:00.000Z	yofun		The vhost they see
2011-12-26T07:30:00.000Z	yofun		Nl
2011-12-26T07:30:00.000Z	yofun		No i want anything i connect useing a vhost
2011-12-26T07:31:00.000Z	yofun		Bots users etc
2011-12-26T07:31:00.000Z	yofun		And to show that vhost on websites
2011-12-26T07:31:00.000Z	yofun		Like eggdrops
2011-12-26T07:31:00.000Z	Resistance	yofun	 you'd need a special RDNS on the ip for that system
2011-12-26T07:32:00.000Z	yofun		Hmm RDNS i heard something about that
2011-12-26T07:32:00.000Z	Resistance	yofun	 yeah, something your ISP or IP provider sets on the IP
2011-12-26T07:32:00.000Z	Resistance		gimme a sec, i'll show ya an example
2011-12-26T07:33:00.000Z	yofun	Resistance	 knows what im talking about
2011-12-26T07:34:00.000Z	Resistance		yeah
2011-12-26T07:34:00.000Z	yofun		Cool
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	yofun		So would a home isp setup one?
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	Resistance		so basically, you'd have to talk to your ISP or whoever provides the IP for your machine(s) and get them to change the RDNS
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	Resistance	yofun	 most likely not
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	Resistance	yofun	 because those are  dynamic IPs
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	yofun		Suddenlink
2011-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	Resistance	yofun	 in all likelihood you'd have to upgrade to a plan with a static IP, like a business plan, and that can be expensive.  listen to e2b04836 here, a VPS might work
