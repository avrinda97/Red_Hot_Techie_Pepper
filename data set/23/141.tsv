2012-05-29T15:07:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 my advice is to install ubuntu using a live cd or usb, not wubi (inside windows)
2012-05-29T15:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 you're not, wubi is ;)
2012-05-29T15:11:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	How do I do new CD install without loosing my presently ENRICHED and PIMPED wubi version(settings, installed apps, etc)
2012-06-09T15:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 ssh is the easiest / fastest way to connect to another machine -- putty is a graphical tool to do it

2012-06-09T16:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 reduce the number of partitions, for a start
2012-06-09T16:32:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	feisar I was crazy.
2012-06-09T16:33:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	feisar I was toiling with sda while i meant to do sdb. that was for fdisk
2012-06-09T16:33:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 backup important data and start over, instead of repairing things
2012-06-09T16:35:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 delete all the partitions and re-create the ones you need
2012-06-09T16:35:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	I dont mind starting over. But how do i do that. I have a bad cdrom(that is why i am using wubi installed ubuntu)
2012-06-09T16:35:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	 what is it about wubi pls
2012-06-09T16:36:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	wubi is not a nice one innit?
2012-06-10T00:13:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	 Check this find command: I don't know why the -size option not working. Notice the file the cursor is on:  http://imagebin.org/215777
2012-06-10T00:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 no quotes around the {}
2012-06-10T00:15:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	if I dont put it, I get error "no argument for -exec"
2012-06-10T00:17:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 try ls -l so without the h
2012-06-10T00:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 escott this works for me     find / -size +1G -exec file {} \; 2>/dev/null
2012-10-07T16:20:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 I havent tried it, but first thing on my mind: mount the windows partition(s) in linux and then use rsync
2012-10-07T16:21:00.000Z	damms005	MonkeyDust	It is mounted (because I can use nautilus to browse it from the side panel)
2012-10-07T16:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	damms005	 sounds like a samba thingy to me
