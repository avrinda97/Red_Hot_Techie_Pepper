2008-12-17T21:49:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	upgrade? fresh install? live cd or alternate cd? which version of ubuntu
2008-12-17T21:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	try to answer all my questions on one line please , otherwise it is very hard to read
2008-12-17T21:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	ONE line
2008-12-17T21:53:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	okay; try to boot with the kernel parameters quiet and splash disabled then report the exact errors you get; you could also try the text based alternate cd installer disk
2008-12-17T21:53:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	is this the 32bit or the 64bit and what are your system specifications (ie how much ram, etc)
2008-12-17T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	well try the other steps I mentioned and paste any errors to paste.ubuntu.com (NOT here) and then give us the url
2008-12-18T07:05:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	did you try the steps I outlined for you?
2008-12-18T07:06:00.000Z	gizm0	bazhang	: i dont understand the step..
2008-12-18T07:06:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	which step is that? please clarify
2008-12-18T07:10:00.000Z	bazhang	gizm0	did you try the alternate cd?
