2008-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	sisif		Is there any other bloody way to load a module at boot time, EXCEPT /etc/modules ?
2008-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	sisif		Sans
2008-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	put the load line in rc.local  'modprobe <module>'  but /etc/modules is the best way
2008-04-30T18:18:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	I tried both. And none is working :(
2008-04-30T18:19:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	yup. And I can`t figure out what.
2008-04-30T18:19:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	you can load it manually once the machine is up?
2008-04-30T18:20:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	Dr_Willis : I can load it manually.
2008-04-30T18:20:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	what module?
2008-04-30T18:20:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	b44 (for broadcom 44100 ethernet wired)
2008-04-30T18:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	ew...hahaha
2008-04-30T18:21:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	?
2008-04-30T18:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	I hate broadcom.  always an issue
2008-04-30T18:22:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	Yeah. I get the same feeling
2008-04-30T18:23:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	did you check /var/log/syslog for errors after a boot?  or check dmesg output?
2008-04-30T18:23:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	dmesg shows nothing. Let me see in syslog
2008-04-30T18:25:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	this is what I get in syslog upon modprobing the module: "Apr 30 16:24:39 Sisif kernel: [ 6032.212285] eth0: Broadcom 44xx/47xx 10/100BaseT Ethernet 00:19:b9:85:80:f6"
2008-04-30T18:26:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	do you get that on boot?
2008-04-30T18:27:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	noup. I just "modprobe -r b44 && modprobe b44" now
2008-04-30T18:29:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	do you want me to pastebin my syslog so you can take a look there? I`m kinda of a noob to linux and I`m not sure what to look for.
2008-04-30T18:35:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	sorry boss is walking around in our pod... :)  go ahead and pastebin it...I'll take a peak
2008-04-30T18:38:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	there you go: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8928/
2008-04-30T18:45:00.000Z	v0lksman	sisif	it's going to be something related to ndiswrapper...unfortunately I can't help much more on that...I don't use wireless and never have so I am clueless....but I bet ndiswrapper is getting in the way....
2008-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	sisif	v0lksman	you know what`s weird? It was working fine until I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 :)
