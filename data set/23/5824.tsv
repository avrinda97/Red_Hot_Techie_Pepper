2006-08-28T10:39:00.000Z	ladydoor		i'm using irssi inside of GNU screen in ratpoison. and yeah
2006-08-28T10:40:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	: doesn't it ever get in the way being that minimal?
2006-08-28T10:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	my laptop touchpad works a little better in ubuntu than it did in windoze, but it's still unusable. if you go to ratpoison's website and wiki, there's lots of useful info
2006-08-28T10:41:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	I use icewm which is pretty damn lightweight, but the finger-memory (ctrl-esc etc keyboard short cuts) carry over well from M$ to icewm
2006-08-28T10:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	i hadn't used windoze very long when i switched over...my finger memory is 100% emacs/ratpoison
2006-08-28T10:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	lol
2006-08-28T10:42:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	x has a cool mode where the numberpad will do mouse cursory stuff btw.
2006-08-28T10:43:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	yeah, but i'm on a laptop, so numberlock gets in the way of letter keys :-(
2006-08-28T10:43:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	thank you though!
2006-08-28T10:47:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	if you wanna play around with it: " xmodmap -e "keysym Num_lock" = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys       and then shift-numlock  (or mebbe altshiftnumlock) will toggle mousekeys.
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	: hangon - ratpoison is not x?
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	ratpoison *is* x
2006-08-28T10:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	i just happen to use nongraphical stuff for most things other than watching movies and browsing the interweb (for that i use conkeror)
2006-08-28T10:49:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	I remember there was some weirdo wm that ran a sort of curses version of x. I was vaguely attracted to the idea.
2006-08-28T10:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	? i'm not familiar with that. lol
2006-08-28T10:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	are you thinking perhaps of GNU Screen? it lets you have a million terminals in one
2006-08-28T10:51:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	: nope.
2006-08-28T10:52:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	huh. weird
2006-08-28T10:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	sounds nifty :-)
2006-08-28T10:55:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	it's probably a lot like windows 1.0 or something ;-)
2006-08-28T10:56:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	was it twin?
2006-08-28T10:56:00.000Z	peej	ladydoor	nope. I'm searching for it, but unable to find it.
2006-08-28T10:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	peej	oh, ok. weird
