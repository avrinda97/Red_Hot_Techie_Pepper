2008-01-27T17:45:00.000Z	levander		The instructions for adding the medibuntu repositories on the Ubuntu Wiki look like they're for Dapper.  Are there any more up to date instructions?
2008-01-27T17:46:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	just follow the instructions on the medibuntu website
2008-01-27T17:47:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	And use medibuntu's Dapper repositories?
2008-01-27T17:48:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	The Medibuntu web site links to the Ubuntu Wiki for installation instructions.  That's why I quoted the Ubuntu Wiki.
2008-01-27T17:51:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/gutsy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list
2008-01-27T17:51:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	then, wget -q http://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update
2008-01-27T17:51:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	assuming you're running gutsy of course
2008-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	where are you getting those instructions from?
2008-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2008-01-27T17:54:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	So, you're just switching gutsy for dapper?
2008-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	no, i'm just following the instructions
2008-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	Oh hell, I misread them.  Thanks for letting me know.
2008-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	:P
2008-01-30T01:15:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	move the mount point out of /media
2008-01-30T01:16:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	The mount point is /mnt/multimedia...
2008-01-30T01:16:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	oh...
2008-01-30T01:32:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	heh, next time don't use enter
2008-01-30T01:32:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	Eventually he'll reboot and come back I bet.
2008-01-30T01:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	aww i feel sorry for that litle noob lost in the cli land
2008-01-30T01:33:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	I wonder if he knows how to reboot from the command line?  He's probably fighting the urge to pull the plug now....
2008-01-30T01:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	hahaha, oh god that is harsh.
2008-01-30T01:34:00.000Z	levander	DRebellion	He'll figure it out, all he has to do is hit the power button.
2008-01-30T01:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	levander	then he'll come back in a week and complain that is filesystem was corrupted.
