2012-03-11T02:50:00.000Z	ironm		hello :) Please allow me one question. I am going to install ubuntu 11.10 (server) on an SSD drive. Is there any recomendation for the appriopriate filesystem?
2012-03-11T02:50:00.000Z	ironm		thank you iceroot
2012-03-11T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	SSD in a server? strange. I hope you have a platter based storage for your data
2012-03-11T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	do you have a platter based drive for data storage too?
2012-03-11T02:51:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	it is just for short testing and creating some ubuntu live images. I am not really going to use a server with SSD (in ling term) n
2012-03-11T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	ask in #ubuntu+1 for Precise stuff
2012-03-11T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	I wouldn't put swap on an SSD
2012-03-11T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	If you are using it as a server, I'd install a platter based drive to store the user data, databases, mailserver database etc and have /var and swap on that
2012-03-11T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	and obviously put the browser webcache in tempfs :)
2012-03-11T03:15:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	I have to see how I can do it ... (put all the variable stuff in tmpfs)
2012-03-11T03:19:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	do you use such configuration already? ... [23:14:17] <ActionParsnip> ironm: If you are using it as a server, I'd install a platter based drive to store the user data, databases, mailserver database etc and have /var and swap on that
2012-03-11T03:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	that's how i'd set it up if I was setting up a sever using SSD for sure. I have a server but its al on a playyer based drive presently

2012-05-24T04:22:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	thank you :) ... ironm@sid:~$ md5sum -b ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso
2012-05-24T04:23:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	I guess, that I can dd this iso to a USB stick and boot from it, right?
2012-05-24T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	sure, you can use unetbootin
2012-05-24T04:24:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	is it no binary-hybrid image ?
2012-05-24T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ironm	you can use dd if you want
2012-05-24T04:37:00.000Z	ironm	ActionParsnip	is it a joke or is there really any possibility to open a terminal window without installing additional software?
