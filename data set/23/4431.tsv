2007-08-13T11:34:00.000Z	nessee		yes theo. it does
2007-08-13T11:35:00.000Z	nessee		mon^rch:you mean you wanna run it as daemon?
2007-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	nessee		I think you have to fiddle with one of the /etc/rc$ files....
2007-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	nessee		mostly the rc1
2007-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	I just want it ro run when I start my computer
2007-08-13T11:40:00.000Z	nessee		mon^arch, you still there mate?
2007-08-13T11:40:00.000Z	mon^rch		yup
2007-08-13T11:40:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	lo
2007-08-13T11:40:00.000Z	nessee		my friend by my side says you gotta open /etc/initab file
2007-08-13T11:41:00.000Z	nessee		its inittab actually
2007-08-13T11:41:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	I thought it might be something like that
2007-08-13T11:41:00.000Z	nessee		place you're command with a custom id, and appropriate run levels.. and then in terminal type init q to see changes without rebooting
2007-08-13T11:42:00.000Z	nessee		whats that command you wanted to place btw?
2007-08-13T11:42:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	tx for your help :)
2007-08-13T11:43:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	sudo mount --bind /dir /another dir
2007-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	for ftp purposes, I want to share folders via ftp that are in my home dir ;)
2007-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	nessee		id0:2345:wait:pathtomount/mount --bind /dir /another dir
2007-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	nessee		yea, place that at the end of your inittab file
2007-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	nessee		pathtomount would be /sbin or just do a find / -name mount. that should give you the path
2007-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	nessee	mon^rch	mate, still with me?
2007-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	mon^rch		yup
2007-08-13T11:46:00.000Z	nessee		okie good. well thats abt it. try that. should work :)
2007-08-13T11:46:00.000Z	mon^rch	nessee	thanks again.... that's much help
