2006-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	scalista		yeah
2006-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	negative, nano sucks, go with vi
2006-04-15T06:44:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	yes
2006-04-15T06:44:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	Steam works exceptionally well. i tried installing CS:S.. and it was horrible. just awful. i don't know about regular cs though. look into cedega instead, it's much more appropriate.
2006-04-15T06:45:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	i'll grab a guide for you
2006-04-15T06:46:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	sudo apt-get install linux-image-686 i think
2006-04-15T06:47:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	it's somewhere here.. there's a lot of guides and what not. http://www.linux-gamers.net/
2006-04-15T06:47:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	also check out #winehq on this server
2006-04-15T06:48:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	there aren't 686 packages
2006-04-15T06:48:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	because of running the new kernel/
2006-04-15T06:49:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	what errors? send them to pastebin.
2006-04-15T06:51:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	put my name before what you say, so it gets highlighted on my screen, and i don't miss your messages. type "kam" then hit "tab" and it should complete my name.
2006-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	did you sudo apt-get update?
2006-04-15T06:55:00.000Z	scalista	kameron	yeah i did and it worked thx
2006-04-15T06:55:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	cedega is not in repos, it's a non-free program (you have to pay for it)
2006-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	www.transgaming.com is the company behind cedega
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	scalista	kameron	 i use  bitcomet and utorrent as a bt client on windows, what is a good alternative for linux so i can download my linux iso's via bt
2006-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	azureus is my favorite, but it's a resource hog. other than that.. try "sudo apt-cache search torrent" for a list of other clients.
2006-04-15T07:10:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	don't worry about it.
2006-04-15T07:12:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	but yeah, try running cedega.. type "cedega" and enter at a command prompt. i don't think it actually needs xlibs.
2006-04-15T07:22:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	i've never heard of wolfenstein for linux. but you can try "sh filename.run"
2006-04-15T07:31:00.000Z	kameron	scalista	how goes it?
