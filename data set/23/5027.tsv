2007-03-09T12:47:00.000Z	kichigai		Say, anyone here have experience with nVidia and beryl?
2007-03-09T12:49:00.000Z	kichigai		Good lord! ATi 9000 at 1920x1200? That's... wow.
2007-03-09T12:50:00.000Z	kichigai		So, no one with experience with Beryl?
2007-03-09T12:50:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	what do you want to know?
2007-03-09T12:51:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	I'm following a guide to install Beryl on my friend's laptop.
2007-03-09T12:51:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	that's tricky. mainly because there's a million guides out there and all try to do things differently. =)
2007-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	It's the buide at UbuntuGuide.org
2007-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	I've got it installed, but it doesn't quite run right.
2007-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	I'd get a screenshot, but, well, you know.
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	describe "doesn't run right" =)
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	Colorspace gets thrown all out of wack, with each color channel splayed across the screen diagonally, slightly off from the others. The only thing that looks right is the cursor.
2007-03-09T12:54:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	hmm... are you use XGL?
2007-03-09T12:54:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	I believe so.
2007-03-09T12:55:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	normal X works, however?
2007-03-09T12:56:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	Yes. I'm restricting the system to execute beryl ONLY on my command.
2007-03-09T12:56:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	and it works before beryl is running?
2007-03-09T12:56:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	yes.
2007-03-09T12:56:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	see if another opengl appplication works fine on XGL
2007-03-09T12:57:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	the GL screensavers function.
2007-03-09T12:58:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	hmm in that case, where'd you get beryl from? source? packages?
2007-03-09T12:59:00.000Z	kichigai	adaran	http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org (their Ubuntu package repository)
2007-03-09T13:01:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	frankly, i have no idea, you could just try that other WM...
2007-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	adaran	kichigai	maybe give compiz a shot, see if it has the same issues. might tell you something
