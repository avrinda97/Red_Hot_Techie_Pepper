2009-01-09T01:29:00.000Z	Ardorin		Hey. I'm using xubuntu. I want my loader to show a menu, one for regular boot and other, the livecd of another distro, is this possible?
2009-01-09T01:30:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	your bios takes care of booting livecds. just make sure cds have priority over hard drives in the booting order
2009-01-09T01:31:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	I don't want to boot the actual livecd, I want it to boot from the hard drive.
2009-01-09T01:31:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	huh?
2009-01-09T01:33:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	so you want... to install it
2009-01-09T01:33:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	I guess...
2009-01-09T01:33:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	what distro is it anyway?
2009-01-09T01:35:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	It's backtrack.
2009-01-09T01:39:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	no idea how one would go about installing that
2009-01-09T01:41:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	http://wiki.remote-exploit.org/index.php/HowTo:Install_BackTrack_3_onto_hard_drive_from_the_shell
2009-01-09T01:42:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	that guide assumes you kinda know what it's doing, though
2009-01-09T01:43:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	That's awesome!
2009-01-09T01:43:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	ntfs-3g is stable
2009-01-09T01:44:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	what's that for?
2009-01-09T01:44:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	huh?
2009-01-09T01:45:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	ntfs-3g is stable, that's what you said.
2009-01-09T01:45:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	i highlighted the wrong nick. i meant to talk to Arthran. ntfs-3g is for writing to ntfs (windows) partitions
2009-01-09T01:46:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	the tutorial you refered me to can be done with an ubuntu installation in my hd?
2009-01-09T01:46:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	i suppose
2009-01-09T01:46:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	but it's not really a tutorial. more like a list of things that need to be done. it leaves a lot for you to figure out on your own
2009-01-09T01:47:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	ok, good luck
2009-01-09T01:47:00.000Z	raylu	Ardorin	do you know how to configure grub in ubuntu's /boot to handle backtrack?
2009-01-09T01:50:00.000Z	Ardorin	raylu	Yeah, I think I can do it.
