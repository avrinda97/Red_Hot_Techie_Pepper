2011-05-07T06:33:00.000Z	cypha		at the terminal prompt, I type "dir" and i see:
2011-05-07T06:33:00.000Z	cypha		Desktop    Downloads  examples.desktop Pictures  Templates
2011-05-07T06:33:00.000Z	cypha		Documents  Dropbox    Music  Public   Videos
2011-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	cypha		so i type "cd downloads"
2011-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	cypha		but it says directory doesn't exist
2011-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	cypha		OH YEAH
2011-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	escott	cypha	it is case sensitive
2011-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	escott	cypha	you can make it not case sensitive with the following addition to your bashrc shopt -s cdspell
2011-05-07T06:35:00.000Z	escott	cypha	that way you can type cd down[TAB] and it will correct it to Downloads
2011-05-07T06:37:00.000Z	cypha	escott	B0BBY, thanks for the help
2011-08-09T07:41:00.000Z	escott	cypha	unclear what you are asking? startx or sudo service gdm start to start the xserver
2011-08-09T07:42:00.000Z	cypha	escott	you know the settings window where you can set key bindings?
2011-08-09T07:43:00.000Z	escott	cypha	depends on the window manager, as it is a window-manager function. for compiz install ccsm
2011-08-09T07:45:00.000Z	cypha	escott	in your System menu at the top, there is an option for keybindings
2011-08-09T07:46:00.000Z	escott	cypha	i'm running 11.10/gnome3 so i dont think i have the same menu you are talking about
2011-08-09T08:01:00.000Z	escott	cypha	gtk shortcuts... like emacs vs windows style movement in textboxes?
2011-08-09T08:03:00.000Z	escott	cypha	what is ctrl+tab supposed to do
2011-08-09T08:09:00.000Z	escott	cypha	maybe .gtkrc... but doubtful
2011-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	escott	cypha	.gtkrc is a file where you can overload some gtk preferences (like themes)
2011-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	escott	cypha	it is normal not to have it
2011-10-22T23:12:00.000Z	escott	cypha	look for ubuntu linux framebuffer resolution. its usually a kernel option
2011-10-22T23:13:00.000Z	cypha	escott	like this? http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/changing-virtual-console-screen-resolution-860061/#post4250192
2011-10-22T23:14:00.000Z	escott	cypha	sure. haven't messed with that kind of stuff in years, but that would be the way to do it
