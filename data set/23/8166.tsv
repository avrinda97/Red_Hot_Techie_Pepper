2005-03-29T08:12:00.000Z	mdke		does anyone know of an easy document which will help me set up procmail for use with evolution?
2005-03-29T08:12:00.000Z	mdke		i don't know the first thing about email
2005-03-29T08:13:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	if you use evolution you can do filters in the application
2005-03-29T08:13:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	yeah i do that currently
2005-03-29T08:13:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	someone gave me a script for making stats out of the wiki subscription emails, and he said that I should use procmail
2005-03-29T08:16:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	do you have any suggestions for me, as I said I don't understand much about email
2005-03-29T08:18:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	read others that has setup procmail...the problem you have is that you might need to setup smtp, fetchmail and procmail
2005-03-29T08:18:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	:( sounds difficult
2005-03-29T08:18:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	_but_ maybe evolution can filter all mails through procmail
2005-03-29T08:18:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	what I don't understand is that if you are only using evolution...then why can't you use the system they have for filters?
2005-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	perhaps the problem is my lack of understanding how these systems work
2005-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	what exactly do you want to do?
2005-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	maybe that would help a lot...
2005-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	ok
2005-03-29T08:21:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	i access my email in a webinterface when at school, and with evolution at home, and I don't leave them on the remote server. I want to subscribe to the wiki, but I know that I will get hundreds of emails at a time, and really the only thing that interests me is to use the scripts that I have been given which can make stats out of the emails which arrive
2005-03-29T08:23:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	???????
2005-03-29T08:23:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	stats out of e-mail?
2005-03-29T08:23:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	what stats?
2005-03-29T08:23:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	the wiki subscriptions tell you who is doing what to which pages, and it makes stats out of that
2005-03-29T08:24:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	okej...look...what you can do is to filter them out into different folders if that is what you are looking for...
2005-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	scizzo	mdke	if not...then I don't know what you are talking about and how you are actually thinking about all this
2005-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	ok don't worry
2005-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	mdke	scizzo	sorry if I wasn't able to be clear
