2008-08-16T14:30:00.000Z	whitedox		Kind of new to ubuntu..Where do I find sources.list?
2008-08-16T14:30:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	/etc/apt/
2008-08-16T21:36:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	you might be behind an external firewall/router for gnutella to claim that
2008-08-16T21:38:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	in my house we have multiple pc's which use wireless, but I personally am in the room with modem, and I am connected through ethernet, which goes through the wireless router box, which is plugged into the modem.
2008-08-17T20:50:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	i'm not sure how to extract .7z files .. but something like this.    for i in *.7z; do extract_command "$i" && rm "$i"; done
2008-08-17T20:51:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	whats the worse that will happen if that command doesnt extract correctly?
2008-08-17T20:51:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	errm.  define correctly.
2008-08-17T20:52:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	correctly: files are out of the 7z file, and the original 7z file is deleted
2008-08-17T20:53:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	well, the command will only delete the .7z file if the extract_command executes properly
2008-08-17T20:54:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	alright. time to run it... Also, I need to cd to the folder before doing it, right?
2008-08-17T20:54:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	indeed
2008-08-17T20:54:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	for i in *.7z; do p7zip -d "$i" && rm "$i"; done
2008-08-17T20:55:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	would you like to create a directory for each of the .7z files?
2008-08-17T20:55:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	no. They can all be extracted into the folder they are all currently in
2008-08-17T20:55:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	cool
2008-08-17T21:01:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	lol. Is there a way to cancel the command as it is running? I don't have the p7zip thing installed, and it is going to keep saying "Type apt-get etc etc"  11,337 times
2008-08-17T21:02:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	hold down ctrl+c
2008-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	not a real big issue here, but it is printing that it cannot remove any of the 7z files. I mean, it is still extracting them, just after every one it is saying "rm: cannot remove `filename.7z': No such file or directory". But like I said, its not too big of an issue, as I can just open the folder later and organize by filetype and highlight them and delete them....just letting you know. lol
2008-08-17T21:17:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	perhaps p7zip -d deletes the original .7z file after extraction.
2008-08-17T21:18:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	so you think it is still deleting them, just it is trying to delete it twice?
2008-08-17T21:20:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	well, the rm is failing but p7zip is succeeding .. which leads me to believe that p7zip removes the .7z file
2008-08-17T21:27:00.000Z	whitedox	unop	it did delete the 7z files. Thanks for getting 16GB used on my linux box in under an hour :D
2008-08-17T21:27:00.000Z	unop	whitedox	heh, i absolve myself of any damage incurred during the process  of .. :)
