2007-08-25T10:23:00.000Z	Some_ux		well , here goes: I've just install ubuntu on my laptop. Bit overwhelmed by it. I cant enable desktop effects, as i get a white screen. I've searched the forums for a solution but did not find one which worked. To the best of my (limited knowledge) it would appear that GLX for my nvidia 7300GO card is not functioning properly. (I also get a: Failed to allocate mem message when the kernel boots)
2007-08-25T10:24:00.000Z	wailer	Some_ux	disable desktop effects then set your card up first

2007-08-25T10:53:00.000Z	wailer	Some_ux	there is an oppurtunity to have the chat page on one window & synaptic on another to avoid clutter - different to windows
