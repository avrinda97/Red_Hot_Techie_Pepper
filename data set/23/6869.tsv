2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	yoyo		hey... can anybody help me a little here
2006-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	yoyo		i'm having trouble with some ubuntu's applications
2006-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	yoyo		opening gedit with an html file causes gedit to crash
2006-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	yoyo		i type from a terminal #gedit file.html &
2006-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	yoyo		and gedit opens partially, then crashes
2006-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	yoyo		anybody has a similar problem?
2006-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	yoyo		about crashes?
2006-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	does it give you errors?
2006-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	does it do it with all files?
2006-02-22T16:05:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	if you turn those features off does it still crash?
2006-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	check .xsession-errors, don't know what else to tell you.  Haven't seen that kind of behavior before
2006-02-22T16:09:00.000Z	yoyo	_jason	something curious:
2006-02-22T16:09:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	what if you run 'gedit file.html' without the &, do you then get some output on the terminal?
2006-02-22T16:11:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	if I had to guess I would say working directory, but I have no clue
2006-02-22T16:15:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	but still no output to the terminal?
2006-02-23T17:35:00.000Z	yoyo	_jason	any ideas...?
2006-02-23T17:35:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	forget about gedit and use vim :)
2006-02-23T17:36:00.000Z	yoyo	_jason	do you happen to know where does it send the bug report?
2006-02-23T17:36:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	oh, I thought it sent it on its own
2006-02-23T17:36:00.000Z	yoyo	_jason	yeap it uses sendmail to send it, but I can send it manually too
2006-02-23T17:37:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	probably gnome's bugzilla
2006-02-23T07:02:00.000Z	_jason	yoyo	hi
