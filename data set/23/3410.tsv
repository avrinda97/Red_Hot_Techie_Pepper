2008-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	mdgeorge		hi
2008-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	mdgeorge		my power went out last night while I was upgrading to hardy.  I'm not sure how far it got, I have some trouble
2008-04-28T06:34:00.000Z	mdgeorge		first problem was none of my filesystems would mount.  I changed the entries in /etc to use /dev instead of UUIDs, does that cause a problem?
2008-04-28T06:34:00.000Z	mdgeorge		my second problem is I can't log in, but I think fixing the state of my packages will solve that (I hope)
2008-04-28T06:35:00.000Z	mdgeorge		my third problem is that when I run apt-get dist-upgrade it says there are 12 packages are partially installed.  Hald seems to be blocking the rest.  There's some kind of failure when it tries to run the configuration
2008-04-28T06:35:00.000Z	mdgeorge		so, can anyone help me?
2008-04-28T06:35:00.000Z	mdgeorge		please :)?
2008-04-28T06:36:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	First, I would try to back up the system at this point. Then run "apt-get -f install".
2008-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	I know this is a dumb question and I should just do the backup, but if all I care about is on my home partition, is it necessary?
2008-04-28T06:38:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	Not strictly, but in the partitioning menu, make sure to "keep" the home partition.
2008-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	I'll give that a try
2008-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	Good luck!
2008-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	that's odd, now hald seems to be installing without trouble.
2008-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	By using "apt-get -f install", or something else?
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	yes
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	apt-get -f install
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	Good. :-)
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	mdgeorge		it did the same thing as without the -f, except it seems to have worked
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	cky	mdgeorge	Yes, that command is supposed to try to be intelligent in detecting and fixing package dependency problems.
2008-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	I'm just confused because (at least as far as what it tells me) it did the same things in the same order.  I'm not complaining though :)
2008-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	so that seems to have worked.  Is there anything else I need to do to finish the upgrade?
2008-04-28T06:58:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	well, things seem to be working now
2008-04-28T06:59:00.000Z	mdgeorge	cky	thanks for your help
