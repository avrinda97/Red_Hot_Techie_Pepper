2005-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	can you tell me why you want to run g-s-d?
2005-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	this might help http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=32063&highlight=esd+alsa
2005-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	I set that up today and it works beautifully
2005-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	I don't - I jst want to use rhythmbox OR amarok
2005-05-16T14:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	thanks I'll look
2005-05-16T14:41:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	I read that your using xfce, I'm assuming that your also letting xfce manage the desktop?
2005-05-16T14:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	yes
2005-05-16T14:41:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	One of the things I love about gnome is gnome-volume-manager
2005-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	It is what interprets dbus device insertions and makes an icon on the desktop
2005-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	I can live without it...
2005-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	I've been using fluxbox until now
2005-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	I figured out how to get nautilus to manage an xfce desktop and g-v-m manage the hotplug for it pretty easily if your interested I'll walk you through it
2005-05-16T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	Thanks but nautilus is something about gnome I don't personally like :)
2005-05-16T14:43:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	Even in browser mode?
2005-05-16T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	I *much* prefer rox filer
2005-05-16T14:44:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	The beauty of oss and to each his own :) I dislike the idea of appfolders like rox does
2005-05-16T14:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	rox loads faster and is configurable to the nth degree
2005-05-16T14:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	appfolders are only used by the rox DE - which I don't use
2005-05-16T14:45:00.000Z	g14	thoreauputic	but rox still doesn't do hotplug
2005-05-16T14:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	true
2005-05-16T14:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	g14	I don't really need hotplug here: i don't have peripherals that require it
