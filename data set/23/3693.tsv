2008-02-20T05:34:00.000Z	spudratic0		I would like to know why they released this os as stable
2008-02-20T05:36:00.000Z	spudratic0		where is the support room for 7.04 going to try that I read it is more stable than this thing pretending to be an os
2008-02-20T05:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	i dont think there is a support room for that, 6.06 might be what you are looking for
2008-02-20T05:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	whats the problem, btw?
2008-02-20T05:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	you sound like you are in a bad position then.  I'm not sure downgrading will help that kind of problem
2008-02-20T05:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	have you thought of just reinstalling?  having a separate /home partition, etc
2008-02-20T05:47:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	are you using ubuntu?
2008-02-20T05:48:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	try this, exactly: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
2008-02-20T05:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	it checks all the dependencies on your ubuntu-desktop installation
2008-02-20T05:56:00.000Z	spudratic0	danbhfive	it stoped this is the last entry Setting up gnome-user-guide (2.20.0+svn20071003ubuntu2)
2008-02-20T05:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	if everything was ok, nothing should have happened
2008-02-20T05:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	it should have just listed all your packages, so to speak
2008-02-20T05:57:00.000Z	spudratic0	danbhfive	it did not find anything wrong
2008-02-20T05:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	spudratic0	did it install anything?
2008-02-20T05:57:00.000Z	spudratic0	danbhfive	just some help files
