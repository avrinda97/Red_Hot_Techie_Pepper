2006-01-08T14:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		How does Ubuntu decide how and when to use swap space?  It never seems to be using very much to me, and I was wondering if using more would free up more memory/speed thing up.
2006-01-08T14:02:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 using swap is *bad*
2006-01-08T14:02:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 its tens of thousands times slower than ram
2006-01-08T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	blue-frog: Ah, okay.  (Coming from Windows, where there is not such thing.)
2006-01-09T15:34:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 NFS is very nice for filesharing between 2 computers
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 mount the networked share
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 sudo mount -t (smbfs/nfs) -o user=XXX,password=XXX //computername/share /mountpoint
2006-01-09T16:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	Thanks.  Also, I have them connected via the Gnome Connect To dialogue; does that create a mounted share somewhere or does it work differently?
2006-01-09T16:35:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 dunno how that works.. dont think it actually mounts, but i dont know as i never really use it
2006-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 it might even go via ssh, for my "fix" you need either a Samba or NFS share
2006-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	It is via ssh, but I don't know how that works, just that it did.
2006-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 dont think you can actually mount stuff thru ssh
2006-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 i suppose it uses 'scp' over ssh...
2006-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 im not too familliar with it
2006-01-09T16:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	Okay, I'll tinker around.  I've done samba for something once before, thought I'd check out ssh to see what it did too.
2006-01-17T12:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	http://linux.suramya.com/tutorials/Install_GIMPShop/ - the deb package is listed in section 4.0 at the bottom.
2006-01-17T12:02:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 thx, but it's fo debian and breaks the ubuntugimp :(
2006-01-17T12:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	Really?  Would doing it from sorce be better then?
2006-01-17T12:03:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 thinking of compiliing itt yes

2006-01-17T12:06:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 think i'll compile it's dependancy and use the .deb  :)
2006-01-17T12:06:00.000Z	kemik	tonyyarusso	 ty tho :)
2006-01-17T12:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kemik	Okay, good luck.
