2004-12-14T06:03:00.000Z	wig		Can anyone help with lucent winmodems on Ubuntu?
2004-12-14T06:04:00.000Z	sladen	wig	if you ask, people probably will
2004-12-14T06:06:00.000Z	sladen	wig	have you tried telling it to ignore dial-tone
2004-12-14T06:06:00.000Z	wig	sladen	how would I do that?
2004-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	sladen	wig	hopefully there's a tickbox.  Failing that you can pass an AT command
2004-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	sladen	wig	more importantly, what /actual/ error message is it failing with?
2004-12-14T06:12:00.000Z	wig	sladen	it's talking about a tainted kernel?
2004-12-14T06:13:00.000Z	sladen	wig	the tainted kernel is in regard to you loading binary-only modules to drive the winmodem
2004-12-14T06:13:00.000Z	wig	sladen	could that be the problem, or is that nothing?
2004-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	sladen	wig	what message is the dialer-program giving?
2004-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	wig	sladen	can i give you this text file?
2004-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	sladen	wig	that's saying ''you're running with an unsupported setup, we cannot support it''
2004-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	sladen	wig	ubuntu@paul.sladen.org
2004-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	sladen	wig	you'll get it with all binary modules
2004-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	wig	sladen	did you notice anything in the thing i sent you?
2004-12-14T08:31:00.000Z	sladen	wig	the script can't handle spaces in filenames.  Do  'cd'  to get back to your home directory first
2004-12-14T08:31:00.000Z	wig	sladen	hrm?
2004-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	sladen	wig	you're running it from  /mnt/something/Documents and Settings/wig
2004-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	sladen	wig	just type  cd
2004-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	sladen	wig	on its own, which will take you back there
2004-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	sladen	wig	as to whether that'll change the final outcome, I don't know.  But it'll fix those 'File not found' errors
2004-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	wig	sladen	alright.
2004-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	wig	sladen	thanks. hopefully it "might" work, but nothing has worked this far, so my hopes aren't high :-P
