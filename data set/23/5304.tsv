2006-12-30T15:58:00.000Z	wireless_prob		I have been looking on ndiswrappers site and ubuntu forums
2006-12-30T15:58:00.000Z	wireless_prob		I have a belkin wireless pcmica card on a compaq laptop that uses the rt61 chipset
2006-12-30T15:59:00.000Z	wireless_prob		i have ndis installed with the driver, and it says everything is cool, but I still do not have wireless access
2006-12-30T15:59:00.000Z	wireless_prob		In network settings I have wmaster0 and wlan0 for some reason
2006-12-30T15:59:00.000Z	wireless_prob		yes
2006-12-30T15:59:00.000Z	wireless_prob		and setup to start on boot up
2006-12-30T16:00:00.000Z	wireless_prob		I have been referencing http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=272813
2006-12-30T16:00:00.000Z	wireless_prob		but I still only get lights on for a second at boot up then they never come back on
2006-12-30T16:01:00.000Z	wireless_prob		but this whole wmaster0 and wlan0 is really confusing me
2006-12-30T16:01:00.000Z	wireless_prob		why would I have both?
2006-12-30T16:01:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	did you enable the interface?
2006-12-30T16:01:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	hmm
2006-12-30T16:03:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	type ifconfig at a command prompt, and see if the system sees the interface.
2006-12-30T16:04:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	can you ping it?
2006-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	ping wlan0
2006-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	ok, ifconfig listed the numerical address of it, can you ping that?
2006-12-30T16:07:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	ctrl+z
2006-12-30T16:08:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	hang on.
2006-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	can you ping google.com?
2006-12-30T16:12:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	What is your AP?
2006-12-30T16:13:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	Ah a router eh? How can we you test your wireless card, if you aren't using it?
2006-12-30T16:13:00.000Z	wireless_prob	n2diy	what do you mean? the router is up and running and sending out the signal
2006-12-30T16:14:00.000Z	n2diy	wireless_prob	But you said you can ping google because you are online, we need to try and get the wireless card online.
