2005-06-02T08:27:00.000Z	jevidl		so, I tried upgrading to hoary from warty, but I don't quite things worked all the way. I have gotten past any errors resulting from my sourcs.list, but now when I try to run synaptics, and mark all upgrades.... it's not marking all upgrades. It shows them as upgradeable, but not marked for the upgrade.
2005-06-02T08:28:00.000Z	jevidl		any suggestions?
2005-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	jevidl		any suggestions why synaptics recognizes upgradeable packages, but won't mark them for upgrading?
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: The upgrade cause a bigish conflict
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	is there a way around this without reinstalling?
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	I have not been able to find hardly anything on the forums about this
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: Why do you need to upgrade?
2005-06-02T08:32:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	I was goign to try to get some of the new gnome layout and stuff that is in hoary. i am still (sort of) on warty at the moment
2005-06-02T08:33:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	thanks, I wasn't sure what the direct way to getting to synaptics was
2005-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: You should either use warty or hoary, not a combo
2005-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: Try installing each package manually in Synaptic and see where the error comes in
2005-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	I am trying to get to hoary. :) I have hoary for my sources
2005-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	hmm... it just doesn't make sense that it wouldn't mark them when I tell it to mark all upgrades
2005-06-02T08:35:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	but I guess I will go through manually this time and then see what happens in the future
2005-06-02T08:35:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: You probably have something non-standard installed
2005-06-02T08:35:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	oh well, maybe I will just do a reinstall. I have the media here
2005-06-02T08:36:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: Mark for upgrade and then manually do the rest. You will reach a point where it says it wont because of package XYZ
2005-06-02T08:36:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	Xine seems to have major issues
2005-06-02T08:36:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	maybe I will try removing it and then adding it
2005-06-02T08:36:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: Remove it. You can just install it again later
2005-06-02T08:37:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	k. I will go from here. I guess I didn't realize to what extent the upgrade broke some things. there's not much in the forums I could find either
2005-06-02T08:37:00.000Z	jevidl	JStrike	thansk
2005-06-02T08:37:00.000Z	JStrike	jevidl	: Good luck. Should work out alright in the end
