2009-07-11T20:17:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	Kangarooo	 noticed the following --->Driver version:     1.0.20 Library version:    1.0.17a Utilities version:  1.0.17
2009-07-11T20:17:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	Kangarooo	shouldnt they all be the same version?
2009-07-11T20:18:00.000Z	Kangarooo	ohletmeinnowjesu	are you trying commands like * find /lib/modules/`uname -r` | grep snd * from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting ? in log I coulnd recognize any sounddriver in that log. who can join this problem?
2009-07-11T20:20:00.000Z	Kangarooo	ohletmeinnowjesu	did you checked also sound properties? witch card and driver is put to work?
2009-07-11T20:21:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	Kangarooo	LOL i just skipped to the last command in the link that you sent me ; the re-load ALSA command...and its working now!

2009-07-11T20:23:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	Kangarooo	i think it was the libsmpeg0 package that i reinstalled needed ALSA to be restarted
