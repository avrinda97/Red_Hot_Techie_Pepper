2009-08-01T13:55:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Have you ever successfully started Ubuntu in "normal mode" (i.e., not low graphics mode)?
2009-08-01T13:56:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Then something has changed on your system lately -- you might have performed an upgrade, installed third party software, accidentally deleted some files...
2009-08-01T13:56:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Something has caused Ubuntu's graphics driver for your video card to fail, where it worked before.
2009-08-01T13:57:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Your computer "froze"? You mean everything, including the mouse cursor?
2009-08-01T13:57:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	That's called a kernel panic.
2009-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	When you experience a kernel panic, it's possible that you might lose data if the operating system has recently written to a file that hasn't been pushed out to disk.
2009-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	If you installed updates using Update Manager shortly before the panic, it's possible that the updates were only partially committed, which might put the graphics driver in a bad state.
2009-08-01T13:59:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	About how long have you been using this installation of Ubuntu?
2009-08-01T14:00:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Well, something _has_ certainly changed on your system to cause the graphics driver to go from a working state to a non working state. Without examining your configuration more closely, I can't tell you exactly what happened. But the kernel panic is indicative of possible data loss.
2009-08-01T14:01:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	No. I'm saying that the software on your hard drive that operates your graphics card from Ubuntu's side is defective.
2009-08-01T14:01:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	No, it's not. In fact, it's extremely possible.
2009-08-01T14:04:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	If Ubuntu displays a pop-up saying that it's starting in low graphics mode, it is a deeper problem than simply setting the screen resolution. The system is loading a fallback driver; you're lucky you have a graphical display at all.
2009-08-01T14:08:00.000Z	allquixotic	carboy87	Do you need instructions to post your Xorg.0.conf file? It's not difficult, especially if you are logged into that computer right now.
