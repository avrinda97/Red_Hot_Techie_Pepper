2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		Anyone aware of how to connect to a linksys wireless router from ubuntu?
2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		This has been the brunt of my passed few hours.
2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		I have tried every combination of ndiswrapper.
2009-01-20T09:49:00.000Z	cattlesnake		Is that the Chipset?
2009-01-20T09:50:00.000Z	cattlesnake		I too am new to Ubuntu.
2009-01-20T09:50:00.000Z	cattlesnake		A few hours new.
2009-01-20T09:50:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	go on firefox, and type this on the adress bar: 192.168.1.1  . I THINK you must be connected by a cable, not by wireless
2009-01-20T09:51:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	where do I find the chip here (if that's what I am looking for)?
2009-01-20T09:53:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	Oh :O I thought you needed to connect to the router, to configure it, not just to go online :( I'm sorry
2009-01-20T09:54:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	sorry for the confusion, I'll reiterate: I have a Linksys WRT54G hooked up to this computer, and need to be able to access the internet it provides.
2009-01-20T09:57:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	it really doesn't matter what router you've got, what you need to know is what your wireless card, or your ethernet card. to find out, you can type lshw -C network in the terminal
2009-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	I understand, I hate using a cable too :) We got wireless cards for a reason! :)
2009-01-20T10:11:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	okay, I took a bit here,
2009-01-20T10:13:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	 did it say what wireless card you've got?
2009-01-20T10:16:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	this is mine: http://paste.ubuntu.com/107221/ see where it says Intel Wireless? It lists the model.  You could paste what you got, and we can tell you
2009-01-20T10:17:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	I have nothing that says wireless interfact.
2009-01-20T10:18:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	I have network UNCLAIMED, network, and network DISABLED.
2009-01-20T10:18:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	oops
2009-01-20T10:19:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	 I don't know what to do from now, but maybe this could be usefull: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=890772
2009-01-20T10:23:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	 sorry if someone has already mentioned this, but, is this a fresh install of ubuntu? If so, have you checked for restricted drivers? System ->Administration->Hardware Drivers
2009-01-20T10:25:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver is the only one I see.
2009-01-20T10:29:00.000Z	Mimi	cattlesnake	 I can't find any help online that seems relevant :( Sorry
2009-01-20T10:29:00.000Z	cattlesnake	Mimi	I haven't been able to either.
