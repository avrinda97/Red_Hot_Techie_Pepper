2010-01-17T23:58:00.000Z	schasch		helo,anyone an idea to start one windows with 3 terminal inside? (for mutt,top and tail) ?
2010-01-17T23:59:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	multiple tabs for one terminal will not do for you? (ctrl-shift-t)
2010-01-18T00:00:00.000Z	schasch		oCean: if I can see them all?
2010-01-18T00:00:00.000Z	schasch		oCean:with tabs I only see one  :-(
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	well, you would have to "tab" through the tabs. I think you're looking for a split screen?
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	you could just open multiple terminalwindows, you know?
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	schasch		oCean: yes
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	why not open multiple terminals then? I have tons of 'em open during the day..
2010-01-18T00:02:00.000Z	schasch		oCean: 3 time gnome-terminal is no good solution
2010-01-18T00:02:00.000Z	oCean_		!info terminator | schasch, ok this might be something:
2010-01-18T00:03:00.000Z	schasch	oCean_	it suprises me that it do not exist (only terminator, a pythonscript)
2010-01-18T00:03:00.000Z	schasch		oCean;ubottu yes, terminator...but that could not be paramerter'd
2010-01-18T00:04:00.000Z	schasch		for 3 terminal and the 3 apps
2010-01-18T00:05:00.000Z	schasch		oCean;ubottu: and I am not succeeding to path it(too stupid)
2010-01-18T00:05:00.000Z	schasch		asked too on the IRC of terminator...not possible yet...
2010-01-18T00:06:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	what do you mean?
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	schasch		oCean;ubottu: i mean to patch...that it starts splitted in 3 terminals
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	schasch		my python is not goog enough
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	aha, dunno about that.
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	schasch		oCean; dunno?
2010-01-18T00:08:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	meaning don't know (sorry). Maybe this has something interesting? : http://www.64bitjungle.com/ubuntu/split-screen-gnome-terminals-with-terminator-in-ubuntu/
2010-01-18T00:09:00.000Z	schasch		oCean: I google the hole day....  grrrrr...  thanks I'll have a look
2010-01-18T00:10:00.000Z	oCean_	schasch	ok. Good luck with that. Have to leave...
