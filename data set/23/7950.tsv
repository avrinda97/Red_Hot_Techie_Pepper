2005-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_demian_	looks like you didn't install locales for nl properly when you first installed?
2005-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	_demian_	thoreauputic	it gave an error yes
2005-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	_demian_	thoreauputic	does that mean it's indeed best to reinstall and choose english
2005-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_demian_	it appears to be complaining that your locales don't exist on the system
2005-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_demian_	don' know - looks like you did something evil to your system...
2005-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_demian_	but I don't know, sorry
