2010-01-16T15:44:00.000Z	aliquerer		I have a blog in XML format, exported from blogger.com. how do i open it in ubuntu?
2010-01-16T15:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	open it in gedit
2010-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	it wont open correctly
2010-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	i want it to be viewed as a blog or diary
2010-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	if you're wanting it to look exactly like it looks in blogger, that won't happen
2010-01-16T15:47:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	ok, then how can i do to continue my blogging in a new software?
2010-01-16T15:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	you'll have to open it from your blogger.com page
2010-01-16T15:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	see if blogger.com allows "export", and then use that to import it to new software
2010-01-16T15:48:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	yes it allows export. that gets me the xml file
2010-01-16T15:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	then see if the new software allows importing of xml files
2010-01-16T15:49:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	do you know any good software for ubuntu which does that?
2010-01-16T15:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	no, I use blogger.com because it's easy and I don't have to maintain any software for it, plus I can access my blogger.com account from anywhere in the world
2010-01-16T15:50:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	yes thats true, my concern is i dont want others to read my notes
2010-01-16T15:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	if you're wanting something like a wiki-style diary, then try tomboy or gnote.. it's like a desktop wiki
2010-01-16T15:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	for personal diary, I simply use gedit and keep a folder of diary pages for each day
2010-01-16T15:52:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	I c, maybe i do that. but it would be good if i could import all my entries somehow :/
2010-01-16T15:53:00.000Z	aliquerer		Need diary software which can imprt XML-files
2010-01-16T15:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	I wrote a small tutorial about daily journals/dairies: http://ardchoille42.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-daily-journal-with-panel.html
2010-01-16T15:54:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	ty, seems a bit complicateed though :/
2010-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	once it's all set up, the work is over and you only need to edit the journal. the work takes four minutes
2010-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	there are other diary/journal apps in the repos. open a terminal and run:  apt-cache search diary
2010-01-16T15:57:00.000Z	aliquerer	ardchoille	ok thank you very much :)
2010-01-16T15:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	aliquerer	rednotebook is pretty good too
