2008-04-24T02:55:00.000Z	T-Hawk		hey... anybody got experience with NFS?
2008-04-24T02:57:00.000Z	T-Hawk		right... i've got a NFS export setup like this: /var/www 192.168.0.0/24(rw,sync,subtree_check) , i can mount it fine, and the files are owned by the same user, but when i try to change anything, even just a touch foo i get "Read only filesystem"
2008-04-24T02:57:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	is it writable on the host itself?
2008-04-24T02:57:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	yes
2008-04-24T02:57:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	did you mount it read-write?
2008-04-24T02:57:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	i didn't do either, rw should be default according to man nfs
2008-04-24T02:58:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	I thought so too, check the output of mount to be sure
2008-04-24T02:58:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	nfsd on /proc/fs/nfs type nfsd (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
2008-04-24T02:59:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	that's not the nfs mount :)
2008-04-24T02:59:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	right... stupid me...
2008-04-24T03:00:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	hehe nvm... seems the issue has vanished as i did a umount /mnt/www; mount /mnt/www :P
2008-04-24T03:00:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	hah :)
2008-04-24T03:03:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	funky
2008-04-24T03:03:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	and mount /mnt/www says it's already mounted :O
2008-04-24T03:05:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	http://pastebin.org/31613
2008-04-24T03:06:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	is /etc/mtab not a symlink to /proc/mounts in your system
2008-04-24T03:07:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	no
2008-04-24T03:07:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	should it be? it's a gentoo system locally
2008-04-24T03:07:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	is the mount listed in /proc/mtab?
2008-04-24T03:08:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	no... but this has never been an issue before
2008-04-24T03:08:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	well, it should be listed there, weird things are going on there
2008-04-24T03:08:00.000Z	Seveas	T-Hawk	may I suggest a windows solution (reboot)
2008-04-24T03:10:00.000Z	T-Hawk	Seveas	you tell me no :P any ideas on how to get /etc/mtab updated? since it seems it's actualy mounted
