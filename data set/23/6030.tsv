2006-07-04T08:52:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	i've seen online ones with 4 on one card
2006-07-04T08:56:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	i think he's in vmware
2006-07-04T08:57:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	i am and my network config is identical
2006-07-04T08:57:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	and i've had issues with running it in bridged mode, it will only work for me in NAT mode
2006-07-04T08:57:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	well, i never even tried virtul machines... who needs that...
2006-07-04T08:58:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	it's nice to be able to revert to snapshots
2006-07-04T08:58:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	well, i like to have the "full power" of pc in _one_ os, be it server or desktop...
2006-07-04T08:59:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	 it's not an "all the time" thing
2006-07-04T08:59:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	like right now I'm working on a project that requires a fresh ubuntu install
2006-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	that would suck to do on a machine with rebooting and everything, and anything i don't want to do to the vm i can escape out of and do in my host os
2006-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	ok, for that its good (playing a round, and saving hardware costs) but in "production" useless to me (lets continue in offtopic, if needs:)
2006-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	nah, that's fine, it really doesn't help either of us
2006-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	yeah, but maybe as in  "entertainment" ;)
2006-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	right right, i actually have some stuff to get to
2006-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	btw, are you using virtual machine under linux ?
2006-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	of course :)
2006-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	then its ok ;)
2006-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	i use suse for my desktop, ubuntu for dev, forensics, etc
2006-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	it's so slow in windows, ugh
2006-07-04T09:04:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	have you tried xen ? (i think we should stop or go to offtopic)
2006-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	do you think it could be a MAC address conflict?
2006-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	fowlduck	oskude	i leave it in your capable hands
2006-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	oskude	fowlduck	:/ ;)
