2011-07-13T20:07:00.000Z	Tigerboy		can someone come to my house and carefully reinstall Ubuntu 10.10-- porting over everything from the 11.04 install.
2011-07-13T20:08:00.000Z	ron34563654	Tigerboy	but i can't connect to the internet. why?
2011-07-13T20:08:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	can you tell me a little more-- what distro etc
2011-07-13T20:09:00.000Z	Tigerboy		Blueskaj: I thought it was a great idea... don't ruin it.
2011-07-13T20:09:00.000Z	ron34563654	Tigerboy	ubuntu. the latest
2011-07-13T20:11:00.000Z	ron34563654		computers are so complicated
2011-07-13T20:12:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	click the network icon on the task bar and select one of the ones available... make sure it is set up as auto... sometimes I have found that typing in a fixed IP which must be available on your subnet... the gateway(the same ip used to get your router settings page up) and even typing in the DNS ( you can use googles public dns) can help because sometimes the router's DHCP is not so great. With wireless the problem ca
2011-07-13T20:13:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	but best to try to make it work with auto settings
2011-07-13T20:14:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	for security on your router always use wpa2(personal) with AES encryption---
2011-07-13T20:15:00.000Z	ron34563654	Tigerboy	i don't understand you well enoght. i don't know how to make the internet work. i just want to visit some sites ;)
2011-07-13T20:16:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	also if it is your notebook make sure you have the wireless turned on(usually a switch on the very front)
2011-07-13T20:19:00.000Z	ron34563654	Tigerboy	it isn't. it's a desktop pc
2011-07-13T20:20:00.000Z	ron34563654		hell, why my internet never worked?
2011-07-13T20:21:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	Ok well make sure it is close enough to the router too.  I would go into the network icon and check what is going on with the settings.
2011-07-13T20:23:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	with that wireless you may want to make sure you have wpa_supplicant installed... use package manager to search
2011-07-13T20:24:00.000Z	ron34563654	Tigerboy	do you have other clues for what might make the internet not to work?
2011-07-13T20:27:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	 you need to get the router set up properly ... then use wpasupplicant and wireless tools to get the wireless working--- ALTERNATIVELY-- go out and get a new WIFI usb that you can plug in at Staples-- ask to make sure it supports linux but 99 percent will of the new ones. Your wireless is old.
2011-07-13T20:28:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	 if you get a new wireless you can also check into combo packs with a wirelessusb included with a new router... make sure it supports "N"
2011-07-13T20:28:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	 by going the route of getting a new wireless you should be plug and play.
2011-07-13T20:36:00.000Z	ron34563654		how can i make my wireless card work? it doesn't shows the list of wifi nets
2011-07-13T20:38:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	 if you got to staples get Netgear N300 gigabit router-- or cisco but don't bother with Belkin(junk) the N300 (model WNR3500L) is actually a mini- Linux box-- you can even add your own firmware.. Or even better is the buffalo routers which are available on the internet.
2011-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	Tigerboy	ron34563654	check the window I opened with you for links you can go to.
