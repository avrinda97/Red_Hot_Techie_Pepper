2005-05-05T05:24:00.000Z	shinu		what program lets me manage my services at startup?
2005-05-05T05:24:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	update-rc.d
2005-05-05T05:24:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	any other one? :D
2005-05-05T05:25:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	or sysv-rc-conf for a more interactive approach
2005-05-05T05:26:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	i dont have that command. did i have to apt-get something?
2005-05-05T05:26:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	yes. sysv-rc-conf :)
2005-05-05T05:27:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	thanks a lot! thats the one ive been looking for! youre a god!!! :D
2005-05-05T05:28:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	no problem. deity status seems to come easy these days :)
2005-05-05T05:29:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	:)
2005-08-07T12:26:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	perhaps you have totem-gstreamer and you have the codecs for gst but not for mplayer
2005-08-07T12:27:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	but i did the same thing i did on this comp on anyther comp and it worked perfectly fine
2005-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	it's weird but mplayer is a mystery anyway
2005-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	i very much like it 8)
2005-08-07T12:30:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	ubuntu has two totems, with different backends
2005-08-07T12:31:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	totet mis a dummy package that just depends on totem-xine
2005-08-07T12:31:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	oh...
2005-08-07T12:32:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	uhh. totem is...
2005-11-15T16:57:00.000Z	topyli	shinu	normally, the nameservers your isp provides should be enough. if not, you can blame them, not your system :)
2005-11-15T16:58:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	i see :D
2005-11-15T16:58:00.000Z	shinu	topyli	i just thought that for each system i >should< use their nameservers in case they block others or something... but that doesnt make sense now i think about it :P
