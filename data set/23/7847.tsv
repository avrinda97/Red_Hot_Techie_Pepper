2005-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	etzerd		Which Ubuntu recognize easily
2005-04-22T09:09:00.000Z	etzerd		I have no problem at all installing Ubuntu, but Debian is so hard.
2005-04-22T09:09:00.000Z	etzerd		What is so good about Debian anyway. Can anybody tell me
2005-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	you are installing woody.  the problem isn't with debian its the woody installer that requires you to manually pick the drivers.
2005-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	if you donload the d-i installer for sarge, its the exact same installer ubuntu uses
2005-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	therefore, you are basically using the wrong version, mostly as a result of debian being so huge and not really knowing what info to search for
2005-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	what problem did you have on debian? it sounds like you don't actually know what you are doing, and blaming it on debian
2005-04-22T09:12:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	lol, *cough* bullshit *cough* no offense dude, it's the same installer and same drivers
2005-04-22T09:13:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	so? dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree and you select the right one
2005-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	thats because there is a module that ends up being loaded up before your driver, you haveto add it to the driver blacklist
2005-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	just go away, and go use windows
2005-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	no, you just don't have a clue about what you are doing, and preffer to complain about it here instead of google
2005-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	next time you complain about debian, be prepared for some nasty commentary if i'm around
2005-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	if you have critique about debian it ought to be well researched before comment
2005-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	etzerd	holycow	don't get me wrong, I did my research about Debian. I heard it is one of the best distro.
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	it couldn't load the driver
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	one thing i ran into with nvidia driver on this mobo is that there is a driver that gets loaded by default, and even if everythign is correct your driver won't load and throw that error
2005-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	let me see if i have my old blacklist file, i might be able to point it out
2005-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	etzerd	holycow	one more thing what should I do for the Keyboard error I keep on getting
2005-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	the blacklist is in /etc/hotplug  *hmmm* i don't have the module that is being loaded up unfortunately  i think its called rivafb ... google for that and xserver problems, that might help
2005-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	for the keyboard thing, the keyboard module isn't being loaded up, you are using a wired keyboard to complete the install i guess?   if so unfortunately i can only suggest to google for the right drive so you can modprobe module i guess?
2005-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	i'm actually surprised ubuntu is loading it up by default to be honest
2005-04-22T09:30:00.000Z	holycow	etzerd	there are a few other things that can bring you to command line if you don't select the right things during install
