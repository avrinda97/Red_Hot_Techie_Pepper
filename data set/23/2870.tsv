2008-10-20T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	intrepid help in #ubuntu+1
2008-10-31T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	system -> administration -> software sources, or bum, or sysv-rc-conf, or just look at /etc/rc*
2008-10-31T15:30:00.000Z	Deadboys	jrib	-bash: cd: /etc/rc.local: Not a directory
2008-10-31T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	read 'man update-rc.d' if you to do it that way.  You only want the special directories there
2008-10-31T15:31:00.000Z	Deadboys	jrib	can i pm you
2008-10-31T15:33:00.000Z	Deadboys	jrib	is it okay if i pm you, if you dont mind
2008-10-31T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	sure, but if it's about support, I'd prefer if you talked here
2008-10-31T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	did you read the info ubottu gives with !boot?
2008-10-31T15:36:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	what directories exactly?
2008-10-31T15:37:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	that's a file, not a directory
2008-10-31T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	you can either use that file (add it before 'exit 0') or create a proper sysv script using /etc/init.d/skeleton as a guide.  Then you can use sysv-rc-conf (or bum or update-rc.d) to add it to the proper runlevels
2008-10-31T15:39:00.000Z	Deadboys	jrib	im completely helpless when it comes to ubuntu :(
2008-10-31T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	you get used to it, like anything new
2008-10-31T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	does it already have a script in /etc/init.d/ to start it?
2008-10-31T15:47:00.000Z	Deadboys	jrib	i dont have a script for it in init.d
2008-10-31T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	pick a person and address him.  You are all over the place
2009-01-07T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	how did you install miredo?
2009-01-07T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	Deadboys	pastebin 'apt-cache policy miredo'
