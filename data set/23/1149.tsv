2010-09-06T18:33:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	it invariably freezes when you disconnect and then reconnect the wireless network? no other time?
2010-09-06T18:34:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	the fact that the video behaves strangely would seem to point to a deeper root cause. does the machine get especially hot?
2010-09-06T18:34:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	it is dual boot with Vista and the other OS does not exhibit any issues when booted.
2010-09-06T18:36:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	the freeze is always preceded by losing my wireless internet connection and then it trying to reconnect
2010-09-06T18:38:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	ah, so you're not turning off the connection. the loss of wireless is a symptom, not a cause. does anything interesting turn up in your logs that corresponds to the timing of the crashes?
2010-09-06T18:38:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	which log would you like me to pastebin?
2010-09-06T18:39:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	i'm not scrounging through your logs for you. have a look in /var/log/messages to start, and match the times up with when the machine was known to be behaving strangely.
2010-09-06T18:39:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	ok thanks.  Will look in that log now.
2010-09-06T18:40:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	also, does the machine always crash after a certain amount of time?
2010-09-06T18:43:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	I do not know what I am looking for in those logs.  I just modified my /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base and added the line: "options snd-hda-intel model=acer" and that gives me an additional microphone in my sound properties.  I did this because I think it is a resource conflict.  I came across that setting in an unrelated issue and have now reapplied it and I guess I'll just have to wait and see if my laptop fr
2010-09-06T18:45:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	the log messages are individually timestamped. do any messages appear immediately before a time when the machine was known to be acting strangely? when did this behaviour start, by the way? (recently, i take it?)
2010-09-06T18:46:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	I just installed about 2 days ago and the issue is intermittent enough that it has likely been present the entire time.
2010-09-06T18:52:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	thank you for the responses.  Next time it freezes I will check /var/log/messages right away.  Are there any other specific logs I should check?  If not then I'll have to consider this all the help I can receive until it happens again..
2010-09-06T18:54:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	check /var/log/kern.log as well (i can't remember if those entries are copied in messages) does the machine always crash after a certain amount of time, or when you're running some specific program? without more data, it's difficult to speculate at the moment.
2010-09-06T18:57:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	I just checked that log.  In both that and messages there appears a line: "Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -249305204 ns)" perhaps that is it?  I just changed a hardware configuration for the sound (gives me an additional microphone which is correct) so I think I should wait and see now and if it happens again check both those logs and come back?
2010-09-06T18:59:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	i doubt the clock is the problem (that's only a quarter of a second delta anyway). i think you should wait until it happens again, and then pastebin the log entries immediately preceding the trouble, so we can have a look.
2010-09-06T19:00:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	ok - thank you for the help and that is what I will do.  If it happens again I will pastebin the tail of messages and kern.log.  So, again, thank you.
2010-09-06T19:00:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	best of luck, hopefully it will get sorted soon
2010-09-06T19:01:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	I hope so too as I greatly prefer Ubuntu to Vista! ;)  Thanks.
2010-09-07T21:17:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	what about it?
2010-09-07T21:17:00.000Z	headkase314	sipior	I thought that -s option gives you an interactive sudo?  Then sudo bash would be similar?
2010-09-07T21:18:00.000Z	sipior	headkase314	it would, though it's considered poor practise.
