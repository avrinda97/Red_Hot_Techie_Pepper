2008-02-16T23:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	there is one NOW, its called a calculator
2008-02-16T23:59:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	hahahah
2008-02-17T00:04:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	well, I personally like that at least the main packages are quite stable.  But my experience matches yours, once you go outside the main repos, the bug rate goes way up
2008-02-17T00:06:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	yeah, but the cool stuff are out of ubuntu repos
2008-02-17T00:08:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	a) tried the website, and it loaded.  b)  the cool stuff outside of the repos basically consists of all software out there.  My hope is that over time, those things will work better with ubuntu
2008-02-17T00:09:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	a..z) they are also my own hopes ;)
2008-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	I think you need to just change your fstab, and copy over the partition
2008-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	how do I do that?
2008-06-03T06:49:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	hmmm, you don't know how to work the fstab?  Take a peak at it, see if it makes sense to you
2008-06-03T06:52:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	I would change the mount point of /boot to something like /old_boot.   Then, sudo mount -a to reset the mount points.  Then, create a /boot directory (if its not there).  Then copy over the contents, with maybe cp -rA /old_boot /boot     then thats it i think
2008-06-03T06:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	do you have a separate /boot, or is that just an error message you are getting?
2008-06-03T06:53:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	I have a separated part just for /boot
2008-06-03T06:54:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	will that be a problem if i do that just for upgrading? I dont wanna risk getting ubuntu not bootable
2008-06-03T06:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	I dunno, it should be in your fstab
2008-06-03T06:55:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	it is, i found it
2008-06-03T06:55:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	I just need to change it temporarily, since upgrade wants to download new files into it
2008-06-03T06:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	hmmm, do you really want to keep it?  Maybe you should just make it bigger...
2008-06-03T06:56:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	i can't do that, my swap partition is inbetween them
2008-06-03T06:58:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	nevermind, i think I'll just download hardy and install it clean. I have just upgraded the video card and it's not working properly yet. Maybe a clean isntall will solve both problems
2008-06-03T06:59:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	or else, i'll soon be back with new probs ;)
2008-06-03T06:59:00.000Z	MrPiracy	danbhfive	thx
2008-06-03T06:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	well, I think what I said is true.  Its bit of work, but to get your separate /boot back, you would just reverse the process. Heh, ok.  You know, clean installs are usually better than upgrades, so I like your choice :P
2009-07-20T04:12:00.000Z	danbhfive	MrPiracy	restart gdm I think
