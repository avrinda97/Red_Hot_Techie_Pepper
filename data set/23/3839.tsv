2009-04-22T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	wassup
2009-04-22T15:03:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	I just got a new IP address issued to my box
2009-04-22T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	ok
2009-04-22T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	have you tried: sudo /etc/init.t/networking restart
2009-04-22T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	you could add an entry in /etc/hosts
2009-04-22T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	how many systems are we talking?
2009-04-22T15:05:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	2 IPs mapped to a single domain; infinitely many subdomains on IP[0], only primary service (i.e. domain.com/www.domain.com) on IP[1]
2009-04-22T15:06:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	i have run that command, yes
2009-04-22T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	you will need to either define the dns server as different for one half of your systems and add a different ip resolution on a different dns for the others
2009-04-22T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	if you use say 10 systems i would edit /etc/hosts and add the resolution manually there
2009-04-22T15:10:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	I create DNS records on-the-fly for one of the IPs
2009-04-22T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	if its for a single PC i would DEFINATELY use hosts file
2009-04-22T15:17:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	Adding the IP -> hostname -> alias relationship and restarting didn't help a whole lot (yes, i sudo-ed the init.d/networking restart), I'm reading into it now but do you have any immediate suggestions?
2009-04-22T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	gksudo gedit /etc/hosts
2009-04-22T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	add a line like:  80.77.43.1      fileserver
2009-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	or whatever the hostname is
2009-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	this will resolve the name to that IP locally and bypass any DNS
2009-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	ah, it is resolving properly just an apache virtualhost config issue
2009-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	ty =)
2009-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	kt	ActionParsnip	still around?
2009-04-22T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	sup
2009-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kt	sounds like an apache thing, try asking in #apache
