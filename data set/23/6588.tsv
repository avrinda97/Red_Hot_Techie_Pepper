2006-11-09T16:29:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	What do I need to do to get the X includes so I can compile gnash for ppc?
2006-11-09T16:31:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	search in synaptic for xorg and install the -dev pkgs
2006-11-09T16:32:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	Kewl thanks
2006-11-09T16:32:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	actually I will just apt-cache search xorg then install ;-)
2006-11-09T16:49:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	I came across a sticky in the PPC forum talking about a bug in the smp kernel for powerpc..it this good information? As I have a PowerPC dual and am currently running the smp kernel without issue
2006-11-09T16:50:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	as am I. no issues at all
2006-11-09T16:51:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	of course, i'm on dapper still
2006-11-09T16:51:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	Ok thanks...yeah this was an older post about dapper actually....
2006-11-11T17:28:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	excellent to hear :)
2006-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	The part that perturbs me is it is stating javascript... is there something I missed that I need to enable to get javascript up and running too?
2006-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	Are you able to go to youtube and play a video?
2006-11-11T17:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	your browser should support javascript
2006-11-11T17:30:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	: Yeah that was what I thought too...firefox 2 included in edgy
2006-11-11T17:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	i don't do audio/video on this box  :|
2006-11-11T17:32:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	: Ok thanks...I just checked and enable javascript is checked in prefs...
2006-11-11T17:32:00.000Z	nalioth	Zarephath	please keep in mind, gnash is still very much an in-development project
2006-11-11T17:33:00.000Z	Zarephath	nalioth	: Yes sir..I do know that...I can understand it not working..however I would have assumed I would be able to see something occur..heh
