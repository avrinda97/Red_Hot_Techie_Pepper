2010-11-18T11:17:00.000Z	cache_surplus		thanks though
2010-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	cache_surplus		can i create an image, then run foremost on it?
2010-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i never said its a failed drive lol... i said i deleted data on accident
2010-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	cache_surplus		a lot of data
2010-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	cache_surplus		27 gigs
2010-11-18T11:19:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i disagree... i have files in there that were recovered already manually
2010-11-18T11:21:00.000Z	cache_surplus		is the files in .Trash-1000 only pointer files?
2010-11-18T11:21:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i have never emptied the trash since deletion of those files
2010-11-18T11:21:00.000Z	limecat	cache_surplus	if you want to recover, ive heard testdisk is a pretty good tool if you know what kind of data
2010-11-18T11:21:00.000Z	cache_surplus		jpeg pics
2010-11-18T11:22:00.000Z	limecat		photorec is good for that
2010-11-18T11:22:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i deleted them using a smb share window in nautilus from this client
2010-11-18T11:22:00.000Z	limecat	cache_surplus	what was the other end?  what Filesystem, OS, etc?
2010-11-18T11:23:00.000Z	cache_surplus		linux to linux
2010-11-18T11:23:00.000Z	cache_surplus		ok, the file that holds the data or pointers is .Trash-1000 correct?
2010-11-18T11:23:00.000Z	cache_surplus		its a usb drive external, and i see that dir in there
2010-11-18T11:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus		du -sh .Trash-1000 shows 555megs
2010-11-18T11:24:00.000Z	limecat		browse it'
2010-11-18T11:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus		not 27gigs
2010-11-18T11:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus	maco	 agreed
2010-11-18T11:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus		thats what i asked earlier about smb
2010-11-18T11:25:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i wonder if it deleted the data differently than it would with nautilist
2010-11-18T11:25:00.000Z	limecat	cache_surplus	if this is an unknown, and youre unsure if it was actually deleted...
