2006-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	LethalSword		i just downloaded limewire but i guess ubuntu can't read rpm files?
2006-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	LethalSword		!frostwire
2006-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	LethalSword		!alien
2006-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	LethalSword		alien is dangerous?
2006-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	LethalSword		lol
2006-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	LethalSword		hmm
2006-08-09T09:20:00.000Z	bytecode	LethalSword	be careful with LimeWire, I gave up using it becuase there's mostly a load of rubbish on there, but also a load of bots that wait and monitor what you are searching for, and then they rename images and trojan infected .exe's to match waht you are looking for to make unwary users download and infect their (predominantly)Windows boxes.
2006-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	LethalSword	bytecode	does it really matter though?
2006-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	LethalSword		because linux has no viruses right?
2006-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	LethalSword		and ones that were made stayed in the development labs
2006-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	bytecode	LethalSword	depends upon what you want from gnutella though, The gnutella network is mostly full of dodgy porn and pirated rubbish.  You can end up wasting more time that it's worth.  Linux has a few "proof-of-concpet" viruses, but crrently nothing to really worry about.  I just don't personally value anything that you can find on Gnutella, that's all.
2006-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	LethalSword		lol
2006-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	LethalSword		Is there any other p2p program you use byetcode?
2006-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	bytecode	LethalSword	and I'm just saying "be careful" especially if it's not a homogenous linux netwrk that you're on.
2006-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	LethalSword		ok
2006-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	LethalSword		i installed bittornado
2006-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	LethalSword		:)
2006-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	bytecode		Lethalsword: it's not the program that's the problem, LimeWire seems pretty good as a client, it's just that the network isn't exactly crammed with bonafide content, and there are a lot of "people" and bots out there that have ulterior motives behind what they are sharing.
2006-08-09T09:26:00.000Z	bytecode	LethalSword	I've lost count of the number of times that I've ended up downloading what ends up being a JPG of an advert for some dodgy website or other, because a Bot has decided to pick up my search terms and rename it's dodgy Jpeg to make me thionk that it's a genuine search result.
2006-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	LethalSword		:(
2006-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	LethalSword		that sucks
2006-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	LethalSword		but the new limewire has content filtering
2006-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	bytecode	LethalSword	have you looked at http://www.legaltorrents.com/index.htm and used bittorrent?
