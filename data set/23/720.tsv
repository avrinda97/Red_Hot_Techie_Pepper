2011-05-07T17:21:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	from the package manager
2011-05-07T17:22:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	synaptic package manager
2011-05-07T17:41:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	you have more than one instance of apt running?
2011-05-07T17:41:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	I don't think so
2011-05-07T17:41:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	check in terminal: type top
2011-05-07T17:48:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	sorry
2011-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	what does sudo apt-get update return (paste.ubuntu.com with the results)
2011-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	a huge list
2011-05-07T17:53:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	I don't have package manager or anything open
2011-05-07T17:54:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	you clearly have another instance running, or did not use sudo apt-get install wine (did not use sudo)
2011-05-07T17:55:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	how do I kill it then?
2011-05-07T17:55:00.000Z	bazhang	mang0	you let it finish
2011-05-07T17:57:00.000Z	mang0	bazhang	even in system moniter there is no apt process...
