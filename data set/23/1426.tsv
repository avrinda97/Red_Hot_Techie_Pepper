2010-04-08T07:51:00.000Z	RP64	Pici	its showing errors
2010-04-08T07:51:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Can you pastebin them?
2010-04-08T07:52:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Did you just add medibuntu to your sources?
2010-04-08T07:55:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Yes, skype is in the medibuntu repos, you didn't add their gpg key as well.  This will do that: wget -q http://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
2010-04-08T07:56:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	No.. please run the command I just gave you.
2010-04-08T07:57:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Now run sudo apt-get update again
2010-04-08T07:57:00.000Z	RP64	Pici	OK
2010-04-08T07:58:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Now you can do whatever you needed to do in the first place.
2010-04-08T07:58:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	The warning won't come up now, we just fixed that.
2010-04-08T07:59:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Too much free time ;)
2010-04-08T08:00:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Do you remember the code that you used from the forums to get skype?
2010-04-08T08:01:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	So you already have skype installed, you're just doing regular updates?
2010-04-08T08:02:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Can you run: sudo apt-get upgrade    in a terminal and tell me if you get that same error, if so please use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste it.
2010-04-08T08:03:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	I know.
2010-04-08T08:04:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	give me the link that it created.
2010-04-08T08:04:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Please close update-manager and then run it that command again.
2010-04-08T08:06:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Great, can you pastebin that? Or just paste here the code that it says, somethimg like NEED PUBKEY BLEHH
2010-04-08T08:07:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Sorry, my brain is wonky tonight.  Can you run sudo apt-get update again and tell me if you get an error again?
2010-04-08T08:10:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	It means that it failed to contact the repository to double check that the update was genuine. You can either ignore it (and continue with the update) or I could remember how to fix it.
2010-04-08T08:26:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	Doesn't really matter.  The next time around it'll probably download the package list properly and you won't get an error.
2010-04-08T08:27:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	I mean when another skype update comes out.  And if you do get the error, feel free to poke me here, I'm always around.
2010-04-08T08:29:00.000Z	Pici	RP64	shouldn't be.
