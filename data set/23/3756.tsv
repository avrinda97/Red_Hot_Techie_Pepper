2011-03-24T19:33:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	what are you trying to do?
2011-03-24T19:34:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	I tried to boot up... but I have been geeting this error   /* Kernel panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount fs on unknown-block(0,0)*/
2011-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	you have remote drive added to mount on boot?
2011-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	no, its is just local drive on a laptop
2011-03-24T19:36:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	why is it VFS complaining then?
2011-03-24T19:37:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	I am not sure... Any idears to fix it
2011-03-24T19:37:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	fsck could do something about it... but make sure partition is not mounted since if will make problems
2011-03-24T19:40:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	Heh, I run sudo fsck.ext4 -v /dev/xxx . But I got this..., /dev/sda7:clean, 177507/2564096 files, xxxx/xxxxx blocks
2011-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	Anything else, I shld have done different
2011-03-24T19:42:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	U still there, Dont tell me.. you have also abandoned me like the others...
2011-03-24T19:43:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	am still here, just don't have a smart solution, is that system still usable?
2011-03-24T19:43:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	Yeah, i can log into the windows vista portion
2011-03-24T19:44:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	my suggestion would be to get some software for partition editing... like gparted or partition magic and see if that partition is still alive...
2011-03-24T19:45:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	if partition works, then maybe the problem is with configuration, otherwise, problem is with partition and data could be potentialy lost
2011-03-24T19:46:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	THe partition seems to be there.. i can mount it via LiveCD
2011-03-24T19:47:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	can you paste me your /etc/fstab ?!
2011-03-24T19:48:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	where is the /etc/fstab.. Cos I am in LiveCD now...
2011-03-24T19:49:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	on your root partition
2011-03-24T19:50:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	I just ran sudo e2fsck -b blockNum /dev/sda7
2011-03-24T19:56:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Ububegin	I don't know what that command does
2011-03-24T19:58:00.000Z	Ububegin	MeanEYE	I read this here...http://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/repair-a-broken-ext4-superblock-in-ubuntu/
