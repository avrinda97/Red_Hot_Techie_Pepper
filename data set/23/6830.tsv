2006-11-30T13:37:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	dual booting is pretty straightforward
2006-11-30T13:38:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	are you doing it with one HD or two?
2006-11-30T13:38:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	you need to install windows first
2006-11-30T13:39:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	 you probably need to shrink the windows partition to make room for linux
2006-11-30T13:39:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	you can only shrink ntfs
2006-11-30T13:39:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	xp is usually formatted in ntfs but it can be formatted into fat32
2006-11-30T13:40:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	in control panel, admistrative settings (or something like that), then disk management.
2006-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	if I were you I would let windows shrink the ntfs partition
2006-11-30T13:42:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	 just make sure to back up any data you have before messing around with the partitions.  Something might go wrong.
2006-11-30T13:43:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	which version of ubuntu did you download?  Was it dapper?
2006-11-30T13:44:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	since your new you should download 6.06 which is Dapper LTS  (Long Term Support)
2006-11-30T13:45:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	6.10 is the latest version but it's not as stable as 6.06.  I'm using 6.06 now because I'd rather have everything work right without too much tinkering.
2006-11-30T13:46:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	I would recommend 6.06 because that one has long term support but people are saying that 6.10 has been better than expected.
2006-11-30T13:48:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	but you can use the apps before installing it just to see what it's like.
2006-11-30T13:53:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	10 gigs should be enough.  Depends on how much stuff you are planning on installing and saving.
2006-11-30T13:53:00.000Z	nomin	imsickurdcure	things will be simplest if you tell ubuntu to use LVM.
