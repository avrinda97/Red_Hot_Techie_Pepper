2009-03-15T08:22:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	ubuntu is better for a desktop-system, because of the shorter release-times and the newer software. its based on debian unstable. Debian is better for servers, because its using very stable software. ubuntu is easier to handle, because of some nice guis (all my opinion)
2009-03-15T08:24:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	no
2009-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	just precompiled packages, but that a very much
2009-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	the standard-software you will find in the different repos
2009-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	no
2009-03-15T08:26:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	just the ubuntu repos for the correct-version
2009-03-15T08:26:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	but trust me there are many many many packages inside the ubuntu-repos
2009-03-15T08:27:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	which for example?
2009-03-15T08:29:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	yes but just the ose.edition
2009-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	open-source without usb-support
2009-03-15T08:39:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	no
2009-03-15T08:39:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	no, 8.10 is the newest stable one
2009-03-15T08:40:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	no, the newest is nt always the best
2009-03-15T08:40:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	if you like a stable system with long support, use ubuntu 8.04 hardy
2009-03-15T08:43:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	its ubuntu with kde
2009-03-15T08:43:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	i like kde more then gnome, but kubuntu is not a very good kde-implementation just as suse (as kde-implementation
2009-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	ubuntu is the second-easiest distri so its a good choice
2009-03-15T08:51:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	gui	opensuse
