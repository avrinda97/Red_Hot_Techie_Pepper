2008-01-07T08:05:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	ok :)_
2008-01-07T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	and what partition is your windows on?
2008-01-07T08:11:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	? :x
2008-01-07T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51042/ , I've added a stanza that will boot windows at the very end
2008-01-07T08:12:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	thanks a lot
2008-01-07T08:15:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	justin_'s source.list is screwed and i will dc soon, can you tale a look please? :9
2008-01-07T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	just put it on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org it's easier. And I can always call on help easier
2008-01-27T22:57:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	you mean networked?  netstat
2008-01-27T22:58:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	`ALL` if possible
2008-01-27T22:58:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	ps -aux  shows all processes running
2008-01-27T22:59:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	okey, thanks you, but what I ment was i wanted to know about the process as in what exactly each one is doing
2008-01-27T22:59:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	you would have to look at the list, then investigate each process to understand what it does
2008-01-27T23:00:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	ahh, okey, that was what i was about to do but thought there might be 1 place i could go to
2008-01-27T23:01:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	nah, there's no single place describing what each process is about.  man <process> is a place to start
2008-01-27T23:01:00.000Z	tinman	nickrud	sirsir 0/ :)
2008-01-27T23:02:00.000Z	nickrud	tinman	and each package a process comes in ( dpkg - S /path/to/processname will tell you the package name)  has some docs, better or worse, at /usr/share/doc/<packagename>
