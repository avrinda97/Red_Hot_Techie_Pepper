2005-06-19T11:44:00.000Z	peter2		let me checl
2005-06-19T11:45:00.000Z	peter2		that file is only 27KB
2005-06-19T11:45:00.000Z	peter2		impossible as i have huge amounts of mail
2005-06-19T11:47:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	do a "du -k ~/.evolution" - does it show a suitably big number at the end?
2005-06-19T11:48:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	I have never really used evolution - I have maybe 1 email, and that "du -k" shows that ~/.evolution is using 677 kb
2005-06-19T11:48:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	the last line shows the sum of all of them
2005-06-19T11:50:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	go to ~/.evolution/mail and run "du -k" again - you see your folders mentioned?
2005-06-19T11:57:00.000Z	peter2	dooglus	?
2005-06-19T11:57:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	yeah?
2005-06-19T11:58:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	I didn't see the start of your problem, I've been away from the keyboard for 5 days.  Let me scroll back.
2005-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	ok...
2005-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	can you still access the email using evolution as the old user?
2005-06-19T12:02:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	what if you run GNOME as the new user, but then "su" to the old user and run evolution from the command line as the old user?  does that get you back to your mail?
2005-06-19T12:06:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	I understand what you did.  It sounds like it didn't work.  What if you run Gnome as the new user, then run a terminal window, then "su" to the old user, and then run evolution, from the 'su'ed' window, as the old user?
2005-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	you know how to make a terminal window?
2005-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	in the terminal window, type "su peter1" (where 'peter1' is the name of the old account - the one which broke)
2005-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	at the password prompt, type peter1's password
2005-06-20T12:48:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	are you there?
2005-06-20T12:49:00.000Z	peter2	dooglus	?
2005-06-20T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	I was wondering what happened to your original account.  What happens when you try to log into Gnome with it?
2005-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	that's very odd.  I would have thought that by simply renaming all your files and directories out of the way you could have fixed it.
2005-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	dooglus	peter2	I guess by now you have the 'peter2' account all set up right anyway, right?
2005-06-21T06:44:00.000Z	peter2	dooglus	you are here everyday ?
