2009-07-21T12:53:00.000Z	icqn		why do all qt application looks so f.... ugly, not like qt apps and not like gnome apps, is something broken in 9.04? do i miss something?
2009-07-21T12:55:00.000Z	trakcyia	icqn	my solution to that, along with other problems associated with kde, is to not use anything related to kde
2009-07-21T12:55:00.000Z	trakcyia		the krash desktop environment is flawless; at krashing
2009-07-21T12:55:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	like to give up vlc player, right?
2009-07-21T12:55:00.000Z	icqn		i better give up gnome
2009-07-21T12:56:00.000Z	trakcyia		you dont need qt for vlc, you just need to not use the repositories to get it
2009-07-21T12:56:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	vlc uses qt interface
2009-07-21T12:57:00.000Z	trakcyia	icqn	i use VLC and I do not use qt. Nuff said?
2009-07-21T12:59:00.000Z	trakcyia		chobomog, that's a good question, though keep in mind you still have identifiable hardware specific information being transfered
2009-07-21T13:00:00.000Z	trakcyia		What's windows?
2009-07-21T13:00:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	what do you use instead? vlc-nox?
2009-07-21T13:02:00.000Z	trakcyia		chobomog the people in #remote-exploit were quite positive that hardware information was sent. I didn't ask what information it was
2009-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	maybe you have no idea that you uses a qt interface
2009-07-21T13:04:00.000Z	trakcyia		lol icqn, would that make you feel better?
2009-07-21T13:05:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	no, just do not tell garbage, if you have no idea...
2009-07-21T13:06:00.000Z	trakcyia	icqn	there there now, don't worry I have a link for you http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22vlc-gtk%22
2009-07-21T13:07:00.000Z	trakcyia		chobo-mog absolutely, you've encouraged me to do the same
2009-07-21T13:07:00.000Z	icqn		!info vlc-gtk
2009-07-21T13:07:00.000Z	trakcyia		actually chobo-mog i think it would be pretty easy to do that come to think of it
2009-07-21T13:08:00.000Z	trakcyia		chobo-mog because there's a function in macchanger to select a random mac, so just add that to your start up (ifconfig wlan0 down, macchanger -r wlan0, ifconfig wlan0 up) (something to that effect, im sure that's not exactly what it is)
2009-07-21T13:11:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	first of all, what do you want to tell me, vlc-gtk? muaahaaaa, is there a package in ubuntu 9.04 for vlc gtk, oooh wait, maybe things have change after many years... http://wiki.videolan.org/Qt_and_GTK
2009-07-21T13:12:00.000Z	trakcyia	icqn	you need a psychologist
2009-07-21T13:12:00.000Z	icqn	trakcyia	no, just do not tell garbage, if you have no idea...
