2012-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	rabbi1		if i install another ubuntu on the same system, will i be able to get the saved data from the old ubuntu installation
2012-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 yes. if you dont format the partions.
2012-02-13T17:27:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	will see to that, hopefully i won't ...
2012-02-22T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 there may be some zip command line tools that have a repair option
2012-02-22T21:44:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	thanks, will have a check
2012-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	any idea why ?
2012-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 perhaps due to the sme reason you had such a hassle installing..
2012-05-08T15:54:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	upgrade screwed, but from a CD with fresh installing erasing all data and previous version of ubuntu, ----> 12.04 installed and works good, but apt-get update hangs the OS.... :(
2012-05-08T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 huh? thats where they go with Unity
2012-05-08T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 or we are missundertanding you
2012-05-08T22:28:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	yeah, just like mac. but here i am unable to focus on title bar of a window :(
2012-05-08T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 try making a new user. see if the issue happens with them also.
2012-05-08T22:31:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	will try, but may be this problem will not occur only after loggin out and loggin in
2012-05-08T22:35:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	just by quiting FF and opening it back worked. but i just wanted a solid solution... I really hate when need to solve linux problem like windows, just restart, restart restart....
2012-05-08T22:53:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	i have, but may be only on initial versions, had lot of problems with blue chrome, so later versions, never remembered to use also....
2012-05-15T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 neat trick 101 - press and hold the SUPER key - it shows a shortcut cheat sheet.. :) not sure if that one is there .. lets see
2012-05-15T21:31:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	long press super key results nothing
2012-05-15T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 it works fine in unity 12.04 here.
2012-05-15T21:32:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	sorry, i am on u12.04 and g3
2012-05-15T21:33:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	i meant gnome 3
2012-05-15T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	rabbi1	 thats basically the same as in Unity then. but gnome-shell only has 'up/down' unity has a 2x2 block - so its got side to side as well. ;)
2012-05-15T21:42:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	perfect.. !
2012-05-15T22:11:00.000Z	rabbi1	Dr_willis	need some pills doc ?
