2005-06-24T05:43:00.000Z	flyingpenguin900		what is the equivelent of a FC3 rpm for ubuntu... because when I open my p2p rpm it comes up like a zip file
2005-06-24T05:44:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	a .deb file
2005-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	flyingpenguin900	djm62	and how do I run theas so called .deb files?
2005-06-24T06:01:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	yes
2005-06-24T06:01:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	search synaptic for "unrar"
2005-06-24T06:05:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	it depends on how it's programmed...it may or may not be portable
2005-06-24T06:07:00.000Z	flyingpenguin900	djm62	 http://gempond.com/odc
2005-06-24T06:16:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	there is no root user...you always use temporary privileges
2005-06-24T06:16:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	I said that wrong...there is no root passwd
2005-06-24T06:26:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	is it not the window title?
2005-06-24T06:30:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	you can do it from ctrl-L
2005-06-24T06:33:00.000Z	flyingpenguin900	djm62	don't want a pop up... I want to see it at the top like I did in FC3 like i do in windows.
2005-06-24T06:33:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	gconf-editor
2005-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	no, this is...
2005-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	flyingpenguin900	djm62	you know when you have an internet browser? and there is that adress bar at the top. well that in the normal browser
2005-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	once you've started gconf-editor...
2005-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	apps->nautilus->preferences
2005-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	then check the box "Always use browser"
2005-06-24T06:36:00.000Z	djm62	flyingpenguin900	it's the first box, and will make nautilus do what you want
