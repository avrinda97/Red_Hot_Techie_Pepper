2008-11-30T09:29:00.000Z	bbbthunda		i have /etc/default/wpasupplicant but no /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
2008-11-30T09:30:00.000Z	bbbthunda		is wpasupplicant the same as wpa_supplicant?
2008-11-30T09:31:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	yes... although I've been thinking about it since I told you that.  I'm not 100% sure if its used for WEP encryption
2008-11-30T09:32:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	from the research I've done so far it seems like it is
2008-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	whats your wireless card?
2008-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	broadcom b43
2008-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	ah
2008-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	what driver are you using? (I have the same card, btw)
2008-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	I already extracted the firmware, etc.
2008-11-30T10:03:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	I was using one that was called something like Broadcom B43 Wireless and now when I look at my hardware it just says wl
2008-11-30T10:04:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	i've tried about 20 different solutions at this point, so I'm sure there is some sort of mess that needs to be cleaned up
2008-11-30T10:04:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	at least now i can connect to unsecured wireless
2008-11-30T10:06:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	does the STA wireless driver require wpa_supplicant?
2008-11-30T10:10:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	when you go into restricted drivers what does it say?
2008-11-30T10:10:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	the STA driver is new in 2.6.24-21
2008-11-30T10:21:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	ok I'm using 2.6.24-22.  need to figure out how to install it
2008-11-30T10:22:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	what does the restricted drivers say
2008-11-30T10:22:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	system > administration > restricted drivers
2008-11-30T10:25:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	where is restricted drivers??? I don't see it in Administration
2008-11-30T10:26:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	in that case, the only thing that shows up there is wl
2008-11-30T10:27:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	it should be showing up, perhaps you need to upgrade jockey
2008-11-30T10:28:00.000Z	bbbthunda	mike4263	could it have to do with blacklisting bcm43xx?
2008-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	mike4263	bbbthunda	possibly
