2005-10-13T10:29:00.000Z	SuseUX		Is it gurb or ubuntu's fault that it cannot see symlinks to a kernel in /boot?
2005-10-13T10:29:00.000Z	SuseUX		grub*
2005-10-13T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 hmm.. in gentoo they had a symlink from /boot/boot to /boot for some reason. :P not sure why..
2005-10-13T10:31:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	strange how I set symlinks to bzImage and system.map, didnot see the files on boot
2005-10-13T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 i think ive seen similer things done befor....
2005-10-13T10:34:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	so it's a grub thing then, not used grub for a while, seems only likes the file not a link
2005-10-13T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 i think ive seen other disrtos use symlinks befor
2005-10-13T10:35:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	yer, lilo
2005-10-13T10:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 gentoo uses a symlink to boot even..  and it worked with grub.
2005-10-13T10:36:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	weird then because the copies only work, not the symlinks
2005-10-13T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 what filesystem is /boot on for you?
2005-10-13T10:38:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	reiserfs
2005-10-13T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 Bingo. :P
2005-10-13T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 i think grub has an issue with reiserfs -- at least i recall it having an issue in the past.
2005-10-13T10:40:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	I always wondered way some people use cp instead of ln -s for there kernel files
2005-10-13T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 i just make the boot menus use the actual file names. :P
2005-10-13T10:41:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	that explains it
2006-06-15T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 its diffrent for diffrent people depending on their video card/hardware
2006-06-15T07:56:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	I need to know where the H/V refresh is in ubuntu xorg.conf
2006-06-15T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SuseUX	 where its at in the file? or what its settings are?
2006-06-15T07:56:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	where it's at
2006-06-15T07:57:00.000Z	SuseUX	Dr_Willis	My mums xorg.conf refresh settings when missing on a update
