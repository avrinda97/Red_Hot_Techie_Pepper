2006-10-29T07:56:00.000Z	syock	tuskernini	i get your point. never found something like that yet. I`ll try to open synaptics again and see if my PC won`t crash
2006-10-29T07:57:00.000Z	tuskernini	syock	why does your system crash? oops
2006-10-29T07:57:00.000Z	syock	tuskernini	no idea. Actually i crashed it because it`s lagging so much. There`s so much disk activity I wonder what`s causing it
