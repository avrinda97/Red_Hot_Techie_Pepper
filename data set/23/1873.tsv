2010-11-02T09:38:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi guys, my gnome applications menu is empty...if I click on edit menu nothing happens
2010-11-02T09:39:00.000Z	Balsaq	dhruvasagar	i would do a repair installation
2010-11-02T09:39:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	repair installation ? how ?
2010-11-02T09:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	was that for me ? that sounds quote stupid to me
2010-11-02T09:42:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	yes I am aware of that
2010-11-02T09:42:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I am not sure if you are talking to me...
2010-11-02T09:42:00.000Z	Balsaq	dhruvasagar	di u ever have a good installation to begin with?
2010-11-02T09:43:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	of course
2010-11-02T09:44:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I have been upgrading since ubuntu 8.04 on this very machine, never had to re-install
2010-11-02T09:44:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I am on 10.04 right now
2010-11-02T09:45:00.000Z	Balsaq	dhruvasagar	i noticed some strange behavior when i installed 10.04, and i ended up sticking in ext 3 and for me the oddities disappeared ...coincidence..dunno.
2010-11-02T09:45:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	hmmm I am on ext4...
2010-11-02T09:46:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	ok, although I have a difficult time believing that the menu problem has got anything to do with it
2010-11-02T09:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I was having perfectly good menu, I think my system crashed because of some memory issue in the middle of when I was editing the menu
2010-11-02T09:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	its kinda clear to me that the config file or whatever the menu uses must have gotten corrupted then
2010-11-02T09:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I am trying to get some help fixing it
2010-11-02T09:48:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	that's unfortunate
2010-11-02T09:48:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	but how can I migrate to ext3 without destroying my data ?
2010-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	:)
2010-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	I will consider doing that sometime soon perhaps
2010-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	same issue ?
2010-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	ahh ok
2010-11-02T09:51:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Balsaq	hmm
