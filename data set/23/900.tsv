2010-12-23T16:40:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	thanks! now how can i make it so my "make" can compile C++?
2010-12-23T16:41:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	make what?
2010-12-23T16:41:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	to compile software you need the source code
2010-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	i have the source code... and i am trying to compile it
2010-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	i am trying to get the exact error again... hold on
2010-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	is it written in c++ or c?
2010-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	k
2010-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	i assume c++ because it is trying to compile in c++ (the given installer is)
2010-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	which program are you trying to compile?
2010-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	zoneminder
2010-12-23T16:44:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	yep thats c++
2010-12-23T16:44:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	i think you have to set the compiler flag to g++ or something
2010-12-23T16:44:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	does it have a readme or install file?
2010-12-23T16:45:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	yeah, i am following the INSTALL file but when i run ./configure like it says it it gives an error that i cannot compile c++ executables
2010-12-23T16:46:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	can you paste the out put to a pastebin?
2010-12-23T16:46:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	i will pastebin it

2010-12-23T16:49:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	sudo apt-get install g++
2010-12-23T16:50:00.000Z	kovid_	rs0832	installing now... what is g++?
2010-12-23T16:50:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	c++ compiler
2010-12-23T16:50:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	GNU C++ compiler... gcc is the GNU c compiler
2010-12-23T17:15:00.000Z	rs0832	kovid_	are you there ?
