2010-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	atude		Hi, I just tried to upgrade ubuntu though the package manager, and it seems to have failed... now i'm stuck in a dependency loop and cannot upgrade anything
2010-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	atude		what do I do?
2010-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	seidos	atude	did you upgrade to a new distro?  from what to what?
2010-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	atude	seidos	I tried to upgrade from 10.4 to 10.10
2010-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	atude	seidos	the upgrade aborted
2010-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	seidos	atude	sorry, i'm on a live usb testing out some stuff.  did someone answer your question?
2010-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	atude	seidos	no
2010-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	seidos	atude	well, i'm not really sure what the error is, but i just realized myself that trying out an upgrade version of ubuntu on a live usb first is a great idea before upgrading...if you can afford a live usb that is.  but let me check launchpad for you.  can you provide more details?
2010-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	atude	seidos	I have no other details.. what is it that you're looking for? Also, I'm not interested in wiping my entire partition just to update packages.. that's rediculous
2010-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	seidos	atude	no, not wiping out partitions.  just trying the distro out from a live usb to see how it works on your hardware.  i am checking launchpad to see if anyone else has had the same problem
2010-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	seidos	atude	then i do not understand your question.  i thought you upgraded from jaunty to maverick (10.04 to 10.10) and you were having a problem with it "looping"
2010-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	atude	seidos	I "attempted" to upgrade from 10.4 to 10.10, but the upgrade aborted (packaage manager)
2010-10-13T14:12:00.000Z	seidos	atude	oh, i see.  i thought the upgrade was botched and you couldn't boot.
2010-10-13T14:12:00.000Z	seidos	atude	did you get a specific error back from synaptic?
2010-10-13T14:13:00.000Z	atude	seidos	**
2010-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	atude	seidos	my fear is that why I reboot, I will not boot properly and will have to go into recovery mode.. that being said, trying to update or backtrack would be unlikely since I'm stuck in a dependency loop
2010-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	seidos	atude	i am searching here:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ for "upgrade to maverick failed"
2010-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	atude	seidos	.... okay
2010-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	atude	seidos	do you have any idea why i'd be stuck in a dependency loop?
2010-10-13T14:15:00.000Z	seidos	atude	no i don't.  i would have to google your problem.  do some research to see what i can find.
2010-10-13T14:22:00.000Z	seidos	atude	i don't think ignoring dependencies is a good idea.
2010-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	atude	seidos	okay, so how do I go about breaking this dependency loop? Ignoring the dependency and installing the dependents one by one seems to make a whole lot of sense
2010-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	atude	seidos	in fact, it's the only thing I can think of atm though would fix the problem
