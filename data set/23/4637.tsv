2007-07-09T15:16:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3		why did the font on firefox change when i installed and tried kubuntu-desktop? I have tried almost every possible font, but still this looks like crap :(

2007-07-09T15:19:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	no, i did nto
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	gee, I thought you said the problem occured when you loaded kubuntu?
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	omg
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	what are you trying to say?
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	you caused the problem?
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	by installing kubuntu?
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	it looks like that, no?
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	for fucks sake
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	no need to curse.
2007-07-09T15:23:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	i was asking a way to correct this and you just give some shit
2007-07-09T15:23:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	don't speak if you don't have anything constructive to say
2007-07-09T15:23:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	that is when your problem started, or you aren't telling the whole story.
2007-07-09T15:24:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	that is why i was asking WHY did the font change when i installed kubuntu...
2007-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	and my suggestion is, it changed because you installed kubuntu.
2007-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	omg.. are you einstein reborn?
2007-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	n2diy	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	for every action, there is an equall, and opposite reaction, no?
2007-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	f4rbr0r^KaLL3	n2diy	shut up already
