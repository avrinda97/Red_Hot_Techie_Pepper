2008-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	cypha		or maybe from the live cd

2008-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	cypha		is that a problem?
2008-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	cypha		ryanprior: ok, that sounds great!
2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	cypha		why would i need 20?
2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	cypha		i thought ubuntu comes with pretty much all software i would need
2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	cypha		i don't really plan on playings games

2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	tons and tons.
2008-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	cypha	Agent_bob	what's the difference?
2008-05-16T08:07:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	you don't change anything in the prtition  you just mount another fs on the point that you want more space.    (with the exception of /etc it's almost a no brainer)
2008-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	if a person has a working linux system and they are running out of room it makes no sense at all to monkey with the root fs.   not when it's so easy to add a line to the fstab and be done with it.
2008-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	cypha	Agent_bob	k...so that doesn't have any limitation anywhere?
2008-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	only the limitations of your physical disk/s avalable    it doesn't even need to be on the same "disk"
2008-05-16T08:11:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	it doesn't even have to be on the same computer
2008-05-16T08:11:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	nfs share
2008-05-16T08:13:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	nope
2008-05-16T08:14:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	and yes it can.
2008-05-16T08:14:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	if by "main partition" you mean root fs  then yes.
2008-05-16T08:15:00.000Z	Agent_bob	cypha	that's what i've been saying :)
2008-05-16T08:17:00.000Z	cypha	Agent_bob	RyanPrior, i'm not sure precisely what i'm asking either
