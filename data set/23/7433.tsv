2005-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	arbir		what is the function of the deb-src line in the sources.list file ? does it mean that when i update my machine, the sources would also be downloaded ?
2005-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	no, it refers to source code
2005-12-29T12:52:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	no, you just won't be able to get source code automatically for you packages
2005-12-29T12:52:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	well .. i dont think i really need source code on this box as i dont compile from source
2005-12-29T12:53:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	there should be no disadvantage to having the deb-src line there...is there an underlying problem?
2005-12-29T12:54:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	no it doesn't download the source every time you install a package...the only disk space you'd save would be about 20 bytes by not storing that line ;)
2005-12-29T12:56:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	the standard ones are in /etc/apt/sources.list (uncomment the universe/multiverse lines)
2005-12-29T12:58:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	to be honest, I don't know...nor would I know where to go for official support if I needed it ;)  the stuff in that file will get you many thousands of packages
2005-12-29T12:59:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	i was looking for mysql 5.0 in particular . and right now an apt-get -s install mysql-server tells me that it would install mysql 4.x
2005-12-29T12:59:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	 so i was looking into backports
2005-12-29T13:00:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	ah
2005-12-29T13:00:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	you can add backports, but they're unsupported (and possibly unsupportable)
2005-12-29T13:01:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	 i need mysql 5 somehow. is there an apt-get way of installing it ?
2005-12-29T13:02:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	or i just run it off the binary which i get at the mysql site ?
2005-12-29T13:03:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	backports are hard to support, but if you can find one, you are free to use it
2005-12-29T13:05:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	if you're the admin, you might be better finding some properly supported way
2005-12-29T13:06:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	 i just practice and learn and do all my development with this server
2005-12-29T13:08:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	well, you're well-enough informed to decide for yourself...I'm no dev :)
2005-12-29T13:09:00.000Z	arbir	djm62	my question was that is there any way i can install mysql thru apt-get. :-).. well let me figure this out myself... if i break the system.. i can always re-install it
2005-12-29T13:10:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	if it's a situation where you can afford to break the system, try to find backports
2005-12-29T13:12:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	I /think/ that security covers any packages
2005-12-29T13:14:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	any security updates get put on that server, with higher version numbers
2005-12-29T13:17:00.000Z	djm62	arbir	yes I think so
