2009-04-16T11:35:00.000Z	Mylisto		I've got this damn old laptop that I want to try to use an ubuntu live cd...

2009-04-16T11:36:00.000Z	Mylisto		its from like '01 I think...
2009-04-16T11:36:00.000Z	Mylisto		I just tried interpid...and it went so far...then got to a " run_program: '/lib/udev/vol_id' abnormal exit
2009-04-16T11:37:00.000Z	Mylisto		not sure aaditya:
2009-04-16T11:37:00.000Z	Mylisto		oh yeah..aaditya: the images are resized now :D
2009-04-16T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	did the iso you burned the cd from pass md5 check and did you run the cd verifier on the first cd boot to screen to verify the cd was ok
2009-04-16T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	did you burn the cd as slooow as as your burner would allow
2009-04-16T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	ok then try
2009-05-19T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	if you right click the cue file and open it with brasero it may work. If not you can always convert cue+bin to iso
2009-05-19T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	i think its bchunk
2009-05-19T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	yep
2009-05-19T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	sudo apt-get install bchunk
2009-05-19T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	thats its usage, te bin and cue files you will have as files, the iso file you can name anything you like
2009-05-19T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	mount it and see how you go, before burning it
2009-05-19T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	sudo mount -o loop /path/to/file.iso /media/cdrom0

2009-06-23T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	just ask
2009-06-23T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	you could use pastebin and write an essay if yu wish
2009-06-23T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	crazy stuff
2009-06-23T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mylisto	sounds complex
