2012-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	Darkenvy		how bad would it be for Jaunty-to-12.04?
2012-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	Darkenvy		server might I add. This is for a gaming server
2012-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I cannot reinstall. this is a VPN with a pre-install option.
2012-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	Darkenvy		yes VPS. I also have a VPN so I miscommunitated :P
2012-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	Darkenvy		no I cannot. if I reinstall it will be jaunty again
2012-06-08T06:44:00.000Z	Darkenvy		123systems.net
2012-06-08T06:44:00.000Z	Darkenvy		no. they have OLDER versions to choose from
2012-06-08T06:45:00.000Z	Darkenvy		how bad would it be to upgrade this many versions? it IS a fresh install by the way
2012-06-08T06:46:00.000Z	Darkenvy		which is jaunty?
2012-06-08T06:46:00.000Z	yeats	Darkenvy	jaunty - karmic - lucid would get you to a newer LTS at least
2012-06-08T06:47:00.000Z	Darkenvy		which is the shortest jump upgrade? I JUST finished my file transfers :S
2012-06-08T06:47:00.000Z	Darkenvy		and how can I selectivly upgrade?
2012-06-08T06:47:00.000Z	yeats	Darkenvy	both jaunty and karmic are eol, so even with old-releases the upgrade might be dicey
2012-06-08T06:48:00.000Z	Darkenvy		yikes
2012-06-08T06:48:00.000Z	Darkenvy		a downgrade?
2012-06-08T06:48:00.000Z	yeats	Darkenvy	I would seriously complain to your service provider - it's not like Ubuntu ISOs cost anything
2012-06-08T06:49:00.000Z	yeats		meh
2012-06-08T06:49:00.000Z	Darkenvy		okay thanks everyone for your help
2012-06-08T06:51:00.000Z	Darkenvy	smw	cant host my game on amazon :P
2012-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	Darkenvy		omg, I swear, there was NOT a 10.04 option on the purchase screen. it was 9.04 was the latest option. 10.04 is still supported?
2012-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	Darkenvy		oh wait there is 11.04
2012-06-08T06:54:00.000Z	Darkenvy		(it was not my stupidity I swear lol) thnks guys
2012-06-08T06:54:00.000Z	yeats	Darkenvy	I would go with 10.04 - supported through 2015
