2007-02-22T16:42:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	just ask your question, it's's easier
2007-02-22T16:45:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	yes, you need to put it in your xorg.conf
2007-02-22T16:45:00.000Z	ismail	dromer	how do u that exactly
2007-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	go in a terminal and type: sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	go down to the last few lines involving resolution (you should recognise)
2007-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	then you see the modes that are in that section
2007-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	I think you need 1280x1024 ?
2007-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	doesn't matter, this is how I do it
2007-02-22T16:49:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	you can use any texteditor, do sudo gedit <file> if you want that
2007-02-22T16:49:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	than add it
2007-02-22T16:50:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	maybe do gedit indeed, it might be easier for you
2007-02-22T16:50:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	no just the depth 24, that's the one you probably use
2007-02-22T16:52:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	done it? (vim or gedit?)
2007-02-22T16:52:00.000Z	ismail	dromer	done it in gedit
2007-02-22T16:53:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	ok, saved it?
2007-02-22T16:53:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	no, not ubuntu, you need to restart x
2007-02-22T16:53:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	do that with: ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-02-22T16:55:00.000Z	dromer	ismail	it worked? :)
2007-02-22T16:55:00.000Z	ismail	dromer	where can i read more about doing stuff like that
