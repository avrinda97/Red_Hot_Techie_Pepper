2004-10-19T16:47:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	would you like some sort of an icon for this app?
2004-10-19T05:07:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	thats what i did but i gave the launcher an icon of some app i dont use
2004-10-19T05:26:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	i think this little icon looks pretty slick

2004-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	more detail doesnt always come out when you are making icons
2004-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	if you are here tomoorrow i will show you an improved one
2004-10-19T14:46:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass	make sure to take a look at it when its tiny so you can see what it will look like as an icon in the panel
