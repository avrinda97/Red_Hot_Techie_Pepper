2006-04-28T10:48:00.000Z	twinge		no c compiler with gentoo?
2006-04-28T10:48:00.000Z	twinge		err
2006-04-28T10:48:00.000Z	twinge		ubuntu
2006-04-28T10:48:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	'sudo aptitude install build-essential'
2006-04-28T10:50:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	aptitude remembers dependencies (aptitude can be used like apt-get too) and will uninstall them if they are not needed when you remove the original package that pulled them in
2006-04-28T10:56:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	shouldn't need to... did gcc get installed? what does 'which gcc' say?
2006-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	did build-essential get successfully installed? apt-cache policy build-essential
2006-04-28T10:59:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	can you pastebin the output you got from the install command?
2006-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	did you see what ubotu said about a proxy?
2006-04-28T11:03:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	those errors are after fixing it?
2006-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	twinge	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12791
2006-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	twinge	_jason	a bunch of 404s
2006-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	uh, so there is probably some way to do this without rebooting, but I think something has to get restarted for apt to use that conf and I don't know what, so want to just reboot?
2006-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	twinge	_jason	I'm trying the update/upgrade first
2006-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	twinge	_jason	it seems to be working, meaning the proxy is working
2006-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	twinge	hmm ok
