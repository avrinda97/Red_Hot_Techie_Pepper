2010-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	Logicwax		because i just built another raid5 mdadm array....and im formatting it right now directly.  and i never made a partition table on it....and it works
2010-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	Logicwax		was wondering if theres a downside to it
2010-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	Logicwax		or something that will come and bite me in the ass down the road
2010-03-05T13:32:00.000Z	Logicwax		so writing a partition table and THEN formating isnt going to make any difference then just straight direct formating without a table?
2010-03-05T13:33:00.000Z	Logicwax		oh no this isnt going to be used for the OS, or be divided into partitions
2010-03-05T13:33:00.000Z	Logicwax		yea
2010-03-05T13:34:00.000Z	Logicwax		so i was just wondering if having no table will haunt me in the future......maybe cause problems
2010-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	Logicwax		well forget that its a RAID
2010-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	Logicwax		i just have it as one device right now.   or lets say this question pertains to my other single hdd
2010-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	Logicwax		im just wondering if the partition table matters
2010-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	after a few minutes with google, I've found a few offhand remarks about using the entire device, but nothing specific so far.
2010-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	remarks about it being a bad idea, i mean.
2010-03-05T13:36:00.000Z	Logicwax	brjann	bad idea?
2010-03-05T13:37:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	using the entire device unpartitioned.
2010-03-05T13:40:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	none of these newsgroup threads or anything mention specific bad things. I'd say you're probably fine, but if you're worried about it enough to ask here, why not just partition it with a single partition and be done with it?
2010-03-05T13:41:00.000Z	Logicwax	brjann	will do that.  i was curious for the education of it....and because ive done it to other drives that i havent backed up yet
2010-03-05T13:42:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	ah, okay. about the only thing i've found is a reference to one specific kind of drive that stored some kind of firmware after the partition table that would get nuked. i can't imagine that's common though.
2010-03-05T13:43:00.000Z	Logicwax		oh, weird
2010-03-05T13:43:00.000Z	Logicwax		HDDs store their firmware on the platter? wha???
2010-03-05T13:44:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	it may not have been an hdd
2010-03-05T13:44:00.000Z	Logicwax		ah
2010-03-05T13:45:00.000Z	Logicwax		[00:34] <ActionParsnip> Logicwax: sounds like a miniresearch project. I'd ask in #hardware too  <--- how do i get invite to #hardware ?
2010-03-05T13:45:00.000Z	brjann	Logicwax	probably don't need an invited, just a registered nick
