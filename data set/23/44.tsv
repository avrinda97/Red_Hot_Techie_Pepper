2012-10-03T03:35:00.000Z	user123abc_		is it harmful to restart the X server via Alt-PrntScrn-K ?
2012-10-03T03:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	i wouldn't if you can avoid it.
2012-10-03T03:35:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	could you explain?
2012-10-03T03:36:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	or are you just arguing from a common sense perspective?
2012-10-03T03:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	probably leaves most of your processes hanging, where a more normal quit would be more graceful.
2012-10-03T03:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	i think of alt-sysrq-k as -9 but worse...
2012-10-03T03:37:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	is it really implemented via kill -9? I guess it should be, but can anyone confirm?
2012-10-03T03:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	alt-sysrq-k != the old ctrl+alt+backspace IMO
2012-10-03T03:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	the sysrq is deeper then -9 in many ways!
2012-10-03T03:38:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	I'd be curious to know how
2012-10-03T03:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	"deeper" in this case meaning "worse" ;)
2012-10-03T03:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	sysrq can do CRAZY stuff, at almost the kernel level!  that's why it's used for the ultimate-last-ditch-effort restart.
2012-10-03T03:39:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	but yeah, to repeat, do you have more ideas about how it's actually implemented? or do you just mean that the timing of the signal is unfortunate
2012-10-03T03:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	sysrq is a different thing then signals.  it's, in my words only, "deeper"
2012-10-03T03:41:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	I'm trying to look up what syscall it might be using
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	alt+sysrq+k is fine, if "sudo service lightdm restart" has failed already.
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	do you happen to know?
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	no idea
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	nah, I guess I was hoping that I could just use it as a "too lazy to press the log-out button" type of thing
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	but as you say, that would be unwise
2012-10-03T03:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	i wouldn't recommend it ;)
2012-10-03T03:45:00.000Z	user123abc_	zykotick9	hmm, there doesn't seem to be a "murder_death_all()" syscall
2012-10-03T03:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	user123abc_	i'm sure there is ;)
