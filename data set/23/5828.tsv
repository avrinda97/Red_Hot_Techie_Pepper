2006-09-29T14:19:00.000Z	Malachi		I need help. I just installed kubuntu-desktop over my ubuntu-desktop. Now, Open Office won't work.
2006-09-29T14:20:00.000Z	Malachi		Yes, but I'm not sure exactly _which_ package to try to reinstall, B4L1STA
2006-09-29T14:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	"doesn't work," eh? what exactly is the problem? and what error messages does it spit out when you start it in the console?
2006-09-29T14:21:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	do this in the terminal:  which oowriter
2006-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	Nothing.
2006-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	ok, sounds like you uninstalled it. look for an openoffice metapackage in synaptic :-)
2006-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	metapackage?
2006-09-29T14:23:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	it'll say something about being a dummy package and will probably have a shorter name than all the rest of them
2006-09-29T14:23:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	that's its name...so actually do sudo aptitude install openoffice.org
2006-09-29T14:24:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	Tried it before....openoffice.org is already the newest version.
2006-09-29T14:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	oh...weird.
2006-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	Any ideas?
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	no, sorry...i'm not familiar with kde, so i don't know what it did to openoffice. which particular application do you need?
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	All of them :(
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	i mean this instant
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	Writer.
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	ok, install abiword. it's smaller and faster, and can read ooffice and m$-doc files. that'll let you work while you try to figure out what happened to openoffice.
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	Yeah, I've come to that solution. Abi works fine, but I really desire the OO suite.
2006-09-29T14:28:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	fair enough. try uninstalling that openoffice package i mentioned and then reinstalling it; that might help.
2006-09-29T15:49:00.000Z	Malachi	ladydoor	I've returned with no successed.
2006-09-29T15:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	that stinks...what was your problem again?
2006-09-29T15:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	(sorry)
2006-09-29T15:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	Malachi	aha. hmmm...perhaps try re-installing ubuntu-desktop? it won't uninstall kubuntu-desktop
