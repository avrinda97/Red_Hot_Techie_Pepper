2007-04-23T10:09:00.000Z	st00ner		but its not better software
2007-04-23T10:09:00.000Z	st00ner		i use wine because its no hassle.
2007-04-23T10:09:00.000Z	st00ner		yeah.
2007-04-23T10:09:00.000Z	st00ner		i agree
2007-04-23T10:09:00.000Z	st00ner		thats the problem with BSD
2007-04-23T10:10:00.000Z	st00ner		i dont use cedega. i have an nvidia card and i dont use their drivers
2007-04-23T10:10:00.000Z	st00ner		my system is 100% free
2007-04-23T10:11:00.000Z	st00ner		o.o
2007-04-23T10:11:00.000Z	st00ner		i dont use cedega. i have an nvidia card and i dont use their drivers. my system is 100% FOSS
2007-04-23T10:11:00.000Z	st00ner		firm believer in gpl, i was just saying liscense != quaility
2007-04-23T10:12:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	thats good, but its good to try 3d, try intel or ati radeon 9500 or less :)
2007-04-23T10:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	you have to use vesa for keeping that free, it sucks...
2007-04-23T10:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	i have seen their cards embedded in many motherboards and portables
2007-04-23T10:13:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	but you can still get the ati radeon 9500 or less :)
2007-04-23T10:14:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	and the effort for reverse engineering nvidia is progressing slowly but steady
2007-04-23T10:18:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	amd is the owner now, and they are going the open route, at least with the newer gpu cores inside cpus
2007-04-23T10:19:00.000Z	st00ner	Artemis3	does that mean we might see OSS drivers for new ATI cards?
2007-04-23T10:19:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	its a matter of time.... hopefully
2007-04-23T10:20:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	i think the newer gpus will mostly come embedded in the amd cpus, and those are having their instruction set documented
2007-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	and you can't audit a black box either... but usually secure box are servers not needing 3d anyway
2007-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	it should
2007-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	in my opinion, running openbsd as your desktop is quite cool
2007-04-23T10:27:00.000Z	Artemis3	st00ner	try it someday, openbsd has a zero blobs policy
