2009-11-02T07:00:00.000Z	Eddie_		Hi I'm trying to install ubuntu 8.04 on my scsi hdd, but they aren't being picked up in the partitioning part of the install
2009-11-02T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Are you using 8.04.4 ?
2009-11-02T07:01:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	I'm not sure. how do I tell
2009-11-02T07:01:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	All I know is that it's 8.04
2009-11-02T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Did you download the iso recently?
2009-11-02T07:02:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	I had the cd sent to me from ubuntu a while ago
2009-11-02T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Ubuntu releases new CD's with fixes and drivers for hardware that didn't exist or wasn't yet supported in 2008
2009-11-02T07:03:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	So does my version not support my hdd's
2009-11-02T07:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	I don't know, it's possible it doesn't support your motherboard
2009-11-02T07:04:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	oh. but a newer version might?
2009-11-02T07:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Yes, but I am not sure how likely it is that that is the problem
2009-11-02T07:05:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	ok. thanks
2009-11-02T07:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l" from the liveCD?
2009-11-02T07:06:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	sorry. I don't know what you mean
2009-11-02T07:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	Boot into the LiveCD and go to System > Administration > Disks and tell me if your disks are listed there.
2009-11-02T07:09:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	I don't see disks under administration
2009-11-02T07:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	I don't remember the exact name, was there anything in the menu about disks or partitions?
2009-11-02T07:11:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	there is partition editor
2009-11-02T07:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	That's it
2009-11-02T07:13:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	it says no devices detected
2009-11-02T07:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	I would try a newer CD, either the latest 8.04 CD ( 8.04.3 ) or if you don't mind upgrading in around six months 9.10
2009-11-02T07:17:00.000Z	Eddie_	Jordan_U	ok thanks
2009-11-02T07:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eddie_	np
