2007-11-21T08:59:00.000Z	Evanlec		mm
2007-11-21T08:59:00.000Z	Evanlec		is that for real?
2007-11-21T09:01:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	think you could help figure out my mouse/keyboard problem?
2007-11-21T09:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	i can try
2007-11-21T09:02:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	it seems that it locks up randomly but has always done it when going into a web browser (Epiphany or Firefox).
2007-11-21T09:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	which, they keyboard or the mouse?
2007-11-21T09:03:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	first the mouse will stop, but the keyboard will have functionality for just a bit more (I have alt+f4'd and and ctrl-s [saved] before losing function of the keyboard as well)
2007-11-21T09:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	sounds to me like the computer is locking up, not just the mouse/keyboard
2007-11-21T09:04:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	Actually, the keyboard is still working right now...
2007-11-21T09:07:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	and the mouse isn't losing its connection (Logitech G7) because the resolution does not revert to default
2007-11-21T09:09:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	im not sure what u mean
2007-11-21T09:10:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	the G7 has three DPI resolutions you can change on the fly with LED indicators.  When it loses the wireless connection it'll revert to the default one (middle setting).
2007-11-21T09:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	oh i see
2007-11-21T09:12:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	so is there any way (using just a keyboard) to somehow "restart" my mouse or something...or otherwise just figure out whats up?
2007-11-21T09:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	its a tough one, was it working after you first installed ubuntu?
2007-11-21T09:13:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	Yep.  Worked from the start.  It just has these moments every once in a while (which so far have always been in a browser...maybe just a coincidence)
2007-11-21T09:14:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	No issues in Vista or XP, unplugging and reseating the dongle does nothing at all.
2007-11-21T09:15:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	okay but it was never not having these "moments" correct?
2007-11-21T09:15:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	Right.  Was fine in Feisty though.
2007-11-21T09:16:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	im not sure, i would search the forums first
2007-11-21T09:16:00.000Z	Eric	Evanlec	Eh...any ideas what to use for a search term?  lol
2007-11-21T09:17:00.000Z	Evanlec	Eric	yea: gutsy keyboard mouse freeze
