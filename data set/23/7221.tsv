2005-09-26T09:47:00.000Z	stormie		how do i get help here with some boot problems after installing ubuntu?
2005-09-26T09:49:00.000Z	stormie		can someone help me with the following? ::: i havent been able to boot windows ever since installing ubuntu
2005-09-26T09:50:00.000Z	stormie		when i try to boot from the grub boot loader menu, a screen flashes saying Grub Loading Stage 2, then goes back to the boot menu
2005-09-26T09:51:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	How is your system set up? Where does the windows partition reside?
2005-09-26T09:51:00.000Z	stormie		1st hd, 1st partition
2005-09-26T09:51:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	And ubuntu?
2005-09-26T09:52:00.000Z	stormie		i believe its hd(0,4) at least thats where its booted from when i look at /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-09-26T09:52:00.000Z	stormie		i think i messed up the partitions, but i tried every partition on my hd for booting windows, 0,0 is the only 1 that gets me anywhere (the Grub Stage 2 Loading screen)
2005-09-26T09:53:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	Hmm.
2005-09-26T09:53:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	You can boot into Ubuntu ok?
2005-09-26T09:53:00.000Z	stormie		yes
2005-09-26T09:54:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	Perhaps try creating a rescue bootdisk
2005-09-26T09:54:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	And then clearing your master boot record.
2005-09-26T09:54:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	That *might* let you boot into windows, and if not you can still boot into Ubuntu.
2005-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	stormie		myrios: how do i create a rescue bootdisk/clear my master boot record :P
2005-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	The only issue may be that your Windows bootloader is hosed for some reason.
2005-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	:P
2005-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	One moment, I'll get some URLs for you.
2005-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	stormie		ok thanks
2005-09-26T09:58:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	Balls. Forgot Ubuntuguide was down.
2005-09-26T09:59:00.000Z	Myrios	stormie	Okay. You can create a grub floppy by going to a terminal and typing sudo grub-floppy
2005-09-26T09:59:00.000Z	stormie		hmm ok
2005-09-26T10:01:00.000Z	stormie	Myrios	when i run fdisk
