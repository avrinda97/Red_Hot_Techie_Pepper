2006-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	man iwconfig
2006-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	abuyazan		thanks TrendKi|| but there is no graphical interface for these like suse ?
2006-11-19T15:38:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	 system->administration->networking
2006-11-19T15:39:00.000Z	abuyazan	TrendKi||	i go there but i cannot find the wireless connections available
2006-11-19T15:39:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	your wireless network card is not displayed?
2006-11-19T15:39:00.000Z	abuyazan		i see just one connection that already connected which is not ours
2006-11-19T15:40:00.000Z	abuyazan	TrendKi||	no , what do you mean exactly
2006-11-19T15:41:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	once you are in the window system->administration->networking,  do you see wireless connection in the Connections tab?
2006-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	abuyazan	TrendKi||	i have WPA-PSK and TKIP
2006-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	abuyazan	TrendKi||	yes i have it there
2006-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	seletct the wireless connection and click on properties...you should be able to see the wireless network you want...unless its not broadcasting itself
2006-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	abuyazan	TrendKi||	i cannot see any connection there , but iwlist display all of them
2006-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	ok, im sorry, i thought that  system->administration->networking was just the GUI version of iwconfig... i'm not sure how to do it GUI-style...maybe someone else in the channel knows how to
2006-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	abuyazan		thnaks TrendKi||
2006-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	no worries...i think they're might be a package you can install...let me check
2006-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	abuyazan		thanks TrendKi||
2006-11-19T15:54:00.000Z	TrendKi||	abuyazan	well there appear to be quite a few apps for KDE to scan for wireless networks...do you want to stick to GNOME apps or do you not mind poluting your system with kde?
