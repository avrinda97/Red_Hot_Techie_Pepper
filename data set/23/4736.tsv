2008-06-22T05:19:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	+1
2008-06-22T05:20:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	if you interrupted the download phase, they aren't lost, but in /var/cache/apt/archive. apt will pick up where it left off
2008-06-22T05:21:00.000Z	shaba1	nickrud	HOW do I do that
2008-06-22T05:21:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	simply re run the command
2008-06-22T05:22:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	I lived at the bottom of a 3k pipe for a long time, took advantage of that a lot. vocx same thing, same backend
2008-06-22T05:23:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	just go back to add/remove, and start the install again
2008-06-22T05:23:00.000Z	shaba1	nickrud	that is my point
2008-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	if you have issues, I'll be around for a bit
2008-06-22T05:25:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	you do remember what you selected in add/remove, though?
2008-06-22T05:26:00.000Z	shaba1	nickrud	Well I am going thru the list again now and trying to figure out what I had picked
2008-06-22T05:29:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	yeah, I can imagine how frustrating that was ;)
2008-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	 sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree libflashsupport
2008-06-22T06:10:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	you would need to examine /var/log/Xorg.0.log to determine the driver. Wish there was an easier way
2008-06-22T06:11:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	yes
2008-06-22T06:12:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	but you don't need sudo simply to read it
2008-06-22T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	probably about 300-400 lines in, it will talk about recognizing the video card and what driver it's using. Probably radeon, vesa , nvidia , fglrx
2008-06-22T06:19:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	if you put it on paste.ubuntu.com , I'll take a look
2008-06-22T06:20:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	once you get the structure, it's pretty simple
2008-06-30T03:27:00.000Z	nickrud	shaba1	good afternoon
