2008-01-27T00:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	I assume your macbook has an intel processor?
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	That's correct.
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	The question is --- does your macbook support 64 bit? I don't think they do.... but I could be wrong
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	what kind of processor is it?
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	Core 2 Duo.
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Oh ok, you can use the AMD64 one if you want ---- then you get 64 bit support
2008-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	There are some headaches when running the 64 bit version though
2008-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	I was asking because the last time I attempted to install Ubuntu, I downloaded the 64 bit one and it wouldn't let me install.
2008-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Namely flash and firefox (flash is broken now anyway, due to Adobe's misstep)
2008-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Really? hmmm....
2008-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	So what does the 64 AMD/Intel version offer that makes it worth the Flash/FF hassle you're talking about?
2008-01-27T00:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Well - you get support for x86_64 applications, and you can install 4 GBs of ram (or more)
2008-01-27T00:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	for a lot of people, x86 is still just fine
2008-01-27T00:08:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	I only have a gig, and what kinds of applications are x86_64?
2008-01-27T00:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Pretty much all the major packages have an x86_64 counterpart -- basically it allows the app to address into higher memory ranges
2008-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	So I would only need 64bit/AMD/Intel if I had a log of RAM?
2008-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	But since you only have 1 GB of ram, it wouldnt matter anyway (as your highest address block is within the x86 cap)
2008-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	Pretty much (or if you were a developer)
2008-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	So "Standard personal computer" is the one for me?
2008-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	yeah - that'll be fine (keep in mind flash is broken right now)
2008-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	Thanks a bunch. The broken flash is for everybody, no?
2008-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Lapper	yep
2008-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	Lapper	Cpudan80	All right. Thanks for the help.
