2007-10-01T10:13:00.000Z	Ardin		mk, just a very quick question. Every time i try and install ubuntu, or kubuntu, i get to the partition part, and it just hangs. not the whole system, but the installer. could it be because of my ntfs partitions?
2007-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ardin	use gparted on live cd and manually resize the ntfs, leaving part of the disk unallocated.
2007-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ardin	and see if it still happens.
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ardin		uh... why would i mess with my partitons... that seems like a bad idea...
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ardin		it works FINE with slackware. could i just disconnect the drive?
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ardin	if you are Installing Ubuntu.. it WILL mess with the partitions..
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ardin	you are isntalling to a 2nd hd?  hmmm.. that IS od.
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ardin		NO
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ardin		i'm installing over it, i want it gone.
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ardin		... why will it mess with my partitions? i dont want it resizing anything other than /dev/hda
2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	Ardin		and even then i dont want it messing with much. io'
2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	Ardin		ergs. i got my partitions the way i want, i think
2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ardin	now ya got me all confused. :)    I am saying 'manually resize' whatever it is you want resized. to see if theres any errors/other messages.
2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	Ardin		fuck it, i'll just disconnect all drives other than /dev/hda and copy my home directory away. then i'll edit the fstab file
2007-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	Ardin		ubuntu has a /etc/fstab RIGHT?
2007-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	Ardin		no, no external drives
2007-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	Ardin		good, then i'll mess with it that way
2007-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	Ardin		wow.. uh.. ok, i realized it right as i typed it, theres no need to 'scold me' in public like that
2007-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		To the 'naughty chair' !  :)
2007-10-01T10:19:00.000Z	Ardin		by the way, if you want to keep out swearing, i do believe that theres a channel mode you can set to bleep that stuff out.
2007-10-01T10:19:00.000Z	Ardin		hmm, maybe not on hyperion
2007-10-01T10:19:00.000Z	Ardin		bullcrap
2007-10-01T10:19:00.000Z	Ardin	Dr_Willis	its mode +G on unrealircd
