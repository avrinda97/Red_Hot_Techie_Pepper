2011-11-09T13:56:00.000Z	ichbinder		hello. I have a friend's old laptop here, a Dell Inspiron 6400. It has major issues with Ubuntu 11.10 + Unity, i.e. it's extremely slow, unusable. So, I thought I'd install either KUbuntu or 10.04. Currently, the machine has dual-boot Ubuntu 11.10 and WinXP. Can I use Wubi, the windows ubuntu installer, to install a new ubuntu version over the existing one? Or should I burn a CD and boot from that?
2011-11-09T13:57:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	burn a CD and install over everything. Wubi would instlal in the windows partition which will not help running speed
2011-11-09T13:58:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	thanks for the answer! My friend wants the windows partition to be keep as it is... :-/ It's currently booted using grub.
2011-11-09T13:58:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	so install over the existin 11.10? And maybe considr lighter version, maybe lubuntu or xubutu. I've not used kubuntu but remember KDE used tobe heavy in days of yore
2011-11-09T13:59:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	yes, install over existing 11.10. Leave everything else the same, like paritions and stuff. That is done the easiest way by burning a CD?
2011-11-09T14:00:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	yep. Other options include from USB but sometimes that causes probs for people
2011-11-09T14:01:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	I'll take a look at those too. My friend has not a lot of clue of computers/linux, but I want him to use Linux for safety, etc... haven't seen xubuntu or lubuntu, are they as intuitive and easy to handle as old gnome-ubuntu or kubuntu?
2011-11-09T14:01:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	yeah, I've done from USB but not even sure if that old laptop supports booting from USB out of the box :)
2011-11-09T14:01:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	slightly different interface, but much lighter than Unity/Gnome or KDE. Screenshots will be on the homepages for both projects
2011-11-09T14:01:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	so maybe better for old-ish laptop
2011-11-09T14:06:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	just install any WM you want
2011-11-09T14:08:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	rather: install any WM that works... ^^
2011-11-09T14:08:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	plenty to chose from http://xwinman.org/
2011-11-09T14:08:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	and plenty missing from that link
2011-11-09T14:09:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	thanks!
2011-11-09T14:09:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	np - I moved off Unity and found something that works for me. It'e easy to do
2011-11-09T14:11:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	oh yes. Totally
2011-11-09T14:13:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	was that ironical? :)
2011-11-09T14:13:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	huh? No...
2011-11-09T14:14:00.000Z	ichbinder	somsip	ok. ^^ wasn't sure... yeah, well. You never know what people configure, especially when they have no clue about a system... so I rather have a clean install.
2011-11-09T14:14:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	I agree. no irony or sarcasm intended
2011-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	minimal install and the WM of your choice. I'd guess fluxbox/openbox are amongst the lightest
2011-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	somsip	ichbinder	np
