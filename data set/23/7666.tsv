2005-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	well put. and memoryleek's school probably paid $$$$$ for their licences.
2005-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	They pigeon hole you into using their operating system.
2005-09-02T09:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	there's a line somewhere between tech support and stalking... :)
2005-09-02T09:43:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	Well you only turn on viewing, duh.
2005-09-03T10:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	good point - but wiki.ubuntu.com is easy too, and UserDocumentation is right at the top of that page, strongly suggested as a starting point
2005-09-03T10:20:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	People do not know what a "Wiki" is.
2005-09-03T10:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	I guess - Burgundavia's "help.ubuntu.com" might help
2005-10-27T10:42:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	No, it has RC2 by default, no?
2005-10-27T10:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	no idea, it's some version of OOo2... is the full release out now?
2005-10-27T10:43:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	Yes.
2005-10-27T10:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	cool, just visited OOo website. Good to know. Whatever version is included in Breezy seems very stable, anyway...
2005-10-27T10:44:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	If there is to be made one exception to version incrementing, I believe this should definitely be one.
2005-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	Use repositories?
2005-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	The last time I tried them from ATI's site in Hoary, it did not work very well.
2005-10-27T12:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	I've tried the repo ones, redone the configs a couple of times, and still no 3d...
2005-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	You used sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and chose the fglrx driver?
2005-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	I do not believe fglrxconfig works.
2005-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	hmmm... I don't think I've done the dpkg route yet, I'll try that before i fool around with the website drivers...
2005-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	This is how I got 3D in breezy. It worked quite well.
2005-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	It was only a matter of selecting fglrx out of the driver list.
2005-10-27T12:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	kevogod	with the dpkg-reconfigure require a restart of the computer?
2005-10-27T12:22:00.000Z	kevogod	Madpilot	It may require restarting something.
