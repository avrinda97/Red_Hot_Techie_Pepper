2010-08-01T06:05:00.000Z	antonio_2		hey all
2010-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	antonio_2		I'm ready to set up a dual boot with win 7...I've got 9.04 as a livecd...
2010-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	antonio_2		What do I need to do?
2010-08-01T06:07:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	is it possible to get a newer livecd?
2010-08-01T06:07:00.000Z	antonio_2	phobiac	the thing is, I have 9.10 on the old lapppy..trying to back everything up...accidentally downloaded 9.04...
2010-08-01T06:07:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	9.04 is kind of old right now, it'd be best to at least used 10.04
2010-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	it's really better to get the version you want to use and install that. upgrading between versions CAN have potentional headaches
2010-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	I'm not saying you can't do it, it just causes less problems down the line
2010-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	antonio_2	phobiac	what about the fact that I have backed up my home folder, etc and usr from the 9.10 machine?
2010-08-01T06:10:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	you're MUCH more likely to have problems using settings from a 9.10 system on a 9.04 install
2010-08-01T06:11:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	Really, your best bet here is to get at least ubuntu 10.04
2010-08-01T06:13:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	Did you make /home a seperate partition on the old install?
2010-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	What you should do is backup everything in your /home/whateveryourusernameis folder, then install 10.04 completely clean (wipe everything! unless you're dual booting) and then put the backup stuff back in
2010-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	that only saves settings, not what you had installed
2010-08-01T06:16:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	the DVD is perfectly fine for installing
2010-08-01T06:17:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	if you have the DVD you're fine
2010-08-01T06:19:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	oh, yeah, you have the alternate install
2010-08-01T06:19:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	get the regular 10.04 CD
2010-08-01T06:19:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	you only need to jump through hoops and get the alternate installer in very limited and special cases
2010-08-01T06:20:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	the windows installer installs ubuntu as if it were a program. it isn't really a true install and isn't dual booting, it's more to test out ubuntu before doing a full install
2010-08-01T06:21:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	yes, exactly
2010-08-01T06:21:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	if you get the regular ubuntu 10.04 install CD and just load it up, the installer is very informative and will walk you through it
2010-08-01T06:22:00.000Z	phobiac	antonio_2	have you already backed up old settings?
