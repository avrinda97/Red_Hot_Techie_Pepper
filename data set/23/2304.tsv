2009-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	IT IS COMPILED INTO THE KERNEL
2009-04-27T11:57:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	you wouldn't think so if you lived in germany
2009-04-27T11:57:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	however, you don't get the point i guess, usually things like ipv6 can easily be compiled as modules
2009-04-27T11:58:00.000Z	simplexio	loomsen1	and in my nly running ubuntu kernel ipv6 is module
2009-04-27T11:58:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	but, as i said, some weirdos thought it might be a gd idea to bake it in
2009-04-27T11:59:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	 cat /boot/grub/config-`uname -r` | grep -i ipv6
2009-04-27T12:00:00.000Z	simplexio	loomsen1	2.6.27-11-server , lsmod|grep ipv6 find ipv6 module
2009-04-27T12:01:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	won't show the apropriate option the kernel was compiled with...  cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep -i ipv6
2009-04-27T12:01:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	does; CONFIG_IPV6=y
2009-04-27T12:02:00.000Z	simplexio	loomsen1	nope.. m
2009-04-27T12:02:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	there should've been an M instead
2009-04-27T12:02:00.000Z	simplexio	loomsen1	i have that ubuntu server kernel and its m
2009-04-27T12:03:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	yes, for that rather old kernel this is apropriate
2009-04-27T12:03:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	but a feature of jaunty is shipping with 2.6.28
2009-04-27T12:03:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	and i think it's embarassing calling that a feature
2009-04-27T12:05:00.000Z	simplexio	loomsen1	ah.. i have home compiled .28.7 in my desktop and it uses .config from very few years back. works like a charm whith ipv6=m
2009-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	well, maybe, but thats not the point... the point is you should leave it configured as M, as you said, your ipv6 works for you
2009-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	i wouldnt bother if we HAD iipv6 AT ALL neither prlly
2009-04-27T12:12:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	WOW, you wouldn't believe this took about 5 weeks till someone figured out would you=
2009-04-27T12:12:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	well, thats rather good to know
2009-04-27T12:12:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	thx
2009-04-27T12:16:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	well, it kinda felt like, no such option here
2009-04-27T12:17:00.000Z	loomsen1	simplexio	nevermind, just located elsewhere
