2011-06-22T22:04:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	you can add the entry to fstab, I am not sure if there is a simple gui method to do it~~~ I learned how to use fstab a long time ago and haven't paid any attention to the guis for disk management since then
2011-06-22T22:04:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	fstab what is that sorry I dont know
2011-06-22T22:05:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	Use ntfs-config - if it isn't installed you can install it by typying sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
2011-06-22T22:07:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	did you find the ntfs-config program?
2011-06-22T22:07:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	installing it
2011-06-22T22:07:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	Im on a slow connection
2011-06-22T22:07:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	finished installing let me try
2011-06-22T22:09:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	what to do with this program just type ntfs-config?
2011-06-22T22:10:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	your host may be mounted at /host, look at it. SpiLoT found his windows partition mounted there
2011-06-22T22:10:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	ok
2011-06-22T22:13:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	The problem is that it is not mounted by default when it is on.I have to mount it manually using disk utility.When mounting it gets mounted to /media/ubuntu
2011-06-22T22:13:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	then the ntfs-config to change that
2011-06-22T22:14:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	That returns an error
2011-06-22T22:14:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/hal/fdi/policy'
2011-06-22T22:15:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	launch ntfs-config with gksudo.  Close it, then press alt+F2 and type "gksudo ntfs-config" and see if that lets you past the error
2011-06-22T22:17:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	No that also gives error
2011-06-22T22:17:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	then I have no idea at that point
2011-06-22T22:18:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	Ok anyway thanks let me try something
2011-06-22T22:19:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	sometimes if you open nautilus as root (alt+F2, gsudo nautilus) it will give you the option to set a permanent mount point because you will actually have permissions to do so
2011-06-22T22:22:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	in the navigation pane to the right side of nautilus it should show the mounted partitions and mountable disks, simply right click on the partition you want to permanently mount and then it gives some options for messing with the mount point, which you don't normally have permission to do, but now since you are running nautilus as root you should be able to mess with it.
2011-06-22T22:24:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	is it mounted right now?  If so, do "cat /etc/mtab" in a terminal. You should be able to find the line that represents the options for that particular partition, then you can copy that line, and go add it to the end of the file at /etc/fstab
2011-06-22T22:25:00.000Z	newbeee	demonspork	let me try that
2011-06-22T22:26:00.000Z	demonspork	newbeee	you can also modify the line to mount it in whatever folder you want, but make sure that you create that folder before you mount the partition there, it doesn't like it if the folder doesn't exist
