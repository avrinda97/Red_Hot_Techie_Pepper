2010-07-11T08:06:00.000Z	phil_		Hey guys
2010-07-11T08:06:00.000Z	phil_		I've got a dependency error that says I need python (<< 2.6) can somebody tell me what that means?
2010-07-11T08:07:00.000Z	maco	phil_	it means your software wont run. ubuntu 10.04 uses python 2.6
2010-07-11T08:07:00.000Z	maco	phil_	if you use 9.10 itll run
2010-07-11T08:08:00.000Z	maco	phil_	youd python 2.4 will work, but you need to point the program at the right version of python now
2010-07-11T08:08:00.000Z	maco	phil_	you can have more than 1 version of python installed at once
2010-07-11T08:08:00.000Z	phil_	maco	I have 2.4 and 2.6 install RIGHT now and I'm getting that error
2010-07-11T08:08:00.000Z	maco	phil_	because 2.6 is default. you need to tell it to use 2.4
2010-07-11T08:09:00.000Z	phil_	maco	Oh, how do I do that
2010-07-11T08:09:00.000Z	phil_	maco	I just download 2.4 from the older repositories
2010-07-11T08:11:00.000Z	maco	phil_	i think you need to run:  PYTHONHOME=/path/to/your/new/python command
2010-07-11T08:11:00.000Z	maco	phil_	so if its /usr/bin/python2.4 then
2010-07-11T08:11:00.000Z	maco	phil_	PYTHONHOME=/usr/bin/python2.4 yourcommand
2010-07-11T08:11:00.000Z	phil_	maco	Thanks!
2010-07-11T08:33:00.000Z	phil_	maco	you still here?
2010-07-11T09:01:00.000Z	maco	phil_	you may want to try #python
2010-07-11T09:02:00.000Z	maco	phil_	OH
2010-07-11T09:02:00.000Z	maco	phil_	dpkg -i --force-depens-version
2010-07-11T09:02:00.000Z	maco	phil_	i thought it was python itself saying 2.6 is too new. if its the deb, then use that dpkg flag
2010-07-11T09:02:00.000Z	phil_	maco	I tried that, It told me my dependecies were broken
2010-07-11T09:03:00.000Z	phil_	maco	After I tried to install
2010-07-11T09:04:00.000Z	maco	phil_	better idea might just be looking for an updated version of that software that works with current python
2010-07-11T09:06:00.000Z	phil_	maco	I just downloaded the latest version, so I'm SOL haha
