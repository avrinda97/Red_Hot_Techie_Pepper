2009-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	evolution comes with a calendar
2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	yeah, I meant something like one of the taskbar applets
2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	by default the gnome time (in systray/whatver)  should remind you of your calendar appointments
2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	I could use Evolution I suppose, but I switched to Thunderbird - one of the first things I do ;-)
2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	hmmm, haven't seen an option for that
2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	setup an appointment and click on the time tray
2009-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	in Evolution?
2009-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	yeah
2009-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	I don't use Evolution, and it seems like overkill for just an appointment reminder ;-)
2009-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	google for calendar apps in linux
2009-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	you should get a ton .. I know there is one for kde .. haven't used ubuntu much
2009-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	I've just knocked something together with a bit of shell script ;-)
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	trust me .. that would suck compared to waht you can achieve with evolution
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	no, it wouldn't
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	and the stupid thing is gonna run in the bg anyways .. so might as well use it ..
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	nope
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	I remembered .. lightning is an extension for thunderbird
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	I have prevented Evolution from running
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	not evolution .. the gnome time thingie
2009-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	I don't use it, and would actually pay money for a version of Ubuntu with all traces of Evolution removed
2009-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	good for you
2009-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	duryodhan	like I said, since all I need is something to pop up at a couple of predetermined times read from a file, I don't immediately see how Evolution would help ;-)
2009-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	duryodhan	gordonjcp	then "at" command might help
