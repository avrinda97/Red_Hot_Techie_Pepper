2006-11-09T09:09:00.000Z	Trixsey		#1) Does Ubuntu work well in a Windows-network?
2006-11-09T09:10:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	there is Samba included by default, with graphical frontends
2006-11-09T09:12:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	and you want to...?
2006-11-09T09:12:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	there are a few "advanced calculators" for linux.
2006-11-09T09:12:00.000Z	Trixsey	LjL	This calculator is very specifically designed for one thing though.. calculating attacks in a game I play :P
2006-11-09T09:13:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	well, Wine means Wine Is Not an Emulator
2006-11-09T09:14:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	when people say "emulator", they usually mean something that simulates a computer architecture. WINE on the other hand just executes Windows binary files, and has a (mostly) Windows-compatible API. that's different
2006-11-09T09:14:00.000Z	Trixsey	LjL	is wine free?
2006-11-09T09:14:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	wine is free, dc++ doesn't run at all on Ubuntu AFAIK, but there are alternatives
2006-11-09T09:16:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	the current KDE one is called valknut actually, but anyway there are at least three or four different clients in the repos
2006-11-09T09:17:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	uh?
2006-11-09T09:17:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	".exe", if that's what you mean, is just the extension Windows and other operating systems (not Ubuntu) use for executable programs
2006-11-09T09:18:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	no.
2006-11-09T09:18:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	the fact that it's open source doesn't mean you can take it and compile it unmodified on any system.
2006-11-09T09:18:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	the Linux and Windows APIs are totally different. you'd have to rewrite it to work on Ubuntu
2006-11-09T09:19:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	anyway, why don't you just try out the other clients we have?
2006-11-09T09:29:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	i ruled out anything that didn't use APT, since i was already so used to it on Debian and liked it. Ubuntu was the most obious choice for a desktop computer. anyway, i think this is not a support question and should be taken to #ubuntu-offtopic instead
2006-11-09T09:33:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	a release comes out every 6 months. meanwhile, packages are *not* updated, i.e. you won't get new versions. the only updates you get are fixes to security vulnerabilities and to very serious bugs
2006-11-09T09:34:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	then there is an (unsupported) "backports" repository where some packages from the next (development) version are ported back to the current version. but only a few packages end up there
2006-11-15T12:59:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	cd /media/cdrom most likely
2006-11-15T13:01:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	cp
2007-05-16T08:17:00.000Z	Trixsey	LjL	how about pre-released stuff? Is that even more bleeding edge (but unstable?)
2007-05-16T08:18:00.000Z	LjL	Trixsey	no official repositories for that
