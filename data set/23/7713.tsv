2005-05-23T09:02:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	what's your problem? I use LVM
2005-05-23T09:04:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	which paritiion though?
2005-05-23T09:04:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	/ and /var and /tmp are ESSENTIAL to the system and cannot be unmounted for some operations
2005-05-23T09:04:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	/var is REQUIRED for LVM operations
2005-05-23T09:05:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	can u boot from livce cd and do the resizing?
2005-05-23T09:05:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	that's the simplest solution
2005-05-23T09:06:00.000Z	slept	goofrider	I could but I don't whant to the keyboard is broken - I use ssh
2005-05-23T09:06:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	othersie, try unmount .var in singler user mode, then mkdir /var/lock/lvm (I think)
2005-05-23T09:06:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	u'll have to use single user mode of umounting any essentail mountpoints
2005-05-23T09:06:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	and I think sshd isn't running @ runlevel 1
2005-05-23T09:06:00.000Z	slept	goofrider	no singleuser with ssh
2005-05-23T09:07:00.000Z	slept	goofrider	so I have to get a keyboard and chroot :(
2005-05-23T09:07:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	I don't think there's any other options other than runlevel 1. You'll probably have to do it in a console
2005-05-23T09:07:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	u don't need chroot, just mkdir /var/lock
2005-05-23T09:08:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	u don't need chroot, just mkdir /var/lock/lvm
2005-05-23T09:08:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	you LVM /var will mount @ /var normally and the new dir you made wouldn't have a effect for the system normally.
2005-05-23T09:11:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	but u can't chroot since there'll be processes opened stuff in /var at boot time
2005-05-23T09:11:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	I've tried the chroot route, it didn't work  :)
2005-05-23T09:12:00.000Z	slept	goofrider	after shutdown and boot with cd it should - why shouldn't it
2005-05-23T09:12:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	I couldn't unmount /var no matter what I do unlesss I boot in runlevel 1
2005-05-23T09:15:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	if I were to go thru the trouble to boot from cd, I might was well boot using live cd and resize from there, and don't have to deal with A LOT OF other problems
2005-05-23T09:15:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	and if u boot froma live cd that has shhd built-in, then u can still do it remotely  :)
2005-05-23T09:18:00.000Z	goofrider	slept	Carlfk, but if I were to do this remotely, i'd just boot using SysresqCD (200MB< with LVM, HFS, JFS, XFS, Reiser, etc in kernel) and do it over ssh
