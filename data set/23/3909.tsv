2008-01-09T02:32:00.000Z	graft		huh, why pidgin instead of gaim?
2008-01-09T02:33:00.000Z	graft		what's wrong with it, then? it's one of the best IM clients out there
2008-01-09T02:33:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	I don't like it.
2008-01-09T02:39:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	are you trying to resize a partition? or just make new ones?
2008-01-09T02:34:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	can you be more articulate?
2008-01-09T02:34:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	About what exactly?
2008-01-09T02:34:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	about what's wrong with it
2008-01-09T02:35:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	The interface is a little bland. I don't like all the flashy flashy that has occured in WLM, etc, but I would like to see SOME colour (then again, I'm only running the default XFCE theme, so maybe that's why?).
2008-01-09T02:36:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	try kopete.. gnome stuff is bland
2008-01-09T02:38:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	Can you point me to a good guide for editing my partition table via parted, fdisk, or something?
2008-01-09T02:38:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	nope... but fdisk is pretty braindead, isn't it?
2008-01-09T02:39:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	I know, but I'd rather not leave anything to chance. I guess I'll just read the man pages.
2008-01-09T02:40:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	resize existing to make space for a new one. I'm not worried about data loss (already backed up), but would like to not make the drive unbootable. I have 2 partitions currently.
2008-01-09T02:43:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	gparted from a live-cd not warm and fuzzy enough?
2008-01-09T02:46:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	yeah, compiz is default for gutsy
2008-01-09T02:46:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	Does that mean that my LiveCD environment does cool compiz stuffs?
2008-01-09T02:47:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	hmm dunno... i guess it must
2008-01-09T02:53:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	What's a quick command to compare two files?
2008-01-09T02:53:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	diff?
2008-01-09T02:53:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	by files I do mean folders >.<
2008-01-09T02:54:00.000Z	graft	DWSR2	redirect the output from ls to two files and do a diff?
2008-01-09T02:54:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	heh, thanks. :-)
2008-01-09T03:05:00.000Z	DWSR2	graft	yeah
