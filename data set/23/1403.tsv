2010-06-06T23:24:00.000Z	abuayyoub		 how can i fix this?
2010-06-06T23:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	libsigc++-2.0-...  you can try installing that and running configure again
2010-06-06T23:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	hellanzb has been abandoned based upon their website... a
2010-06-06T23:28:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	 yea i see. that's sad. is Nzbget what replaced it? what's the best one now?
2010-06-06T23:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	sabnzbd  is the recommended app on their site you can read it if you go there http://hellanzb.com/trac
2010-06-06T23:30:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	yea i loved it on windows but i cant seem to get it to work good on my linux box
2010-06-06T23:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	you do know their is one in the repo why you building from source?
2010-06-06T23:32:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	 NZBget is in the repo? i havent seen it i cant even find a .deb of it
2010-06-06T23:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	I meant hellanzb it may not have any new releases from now on but if it is good you can still use it
2010-06-06T23:35:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	 ah yea, I have it but it keeps throwing errors at me. LottaNZB works nicely but i can only download one file at a time because it locks up or the speed drops to like 5k or something, nzb dosent really work, pan dosent work at all, sabnzb dosen't gives me something like 45kbps not sure what my problem is with usenet on linux
2010-06-06T23:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	http://bugmonkeyblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/nzbget-install-on-ubuntu-server.html I found this by searching on google it didn't take long
2010-06-06T23:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	I wouldn't know how to help you, you could start by pasting the actual error(s) into pastebin than someone could look at it I am sure that if you search on it you might find that someone might have posted a fix for it
2010-07-03T19:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	no one will help unless they know what is your problem with the program
2010-07-03T19:36:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	 thank you, i thought I would see if anyone here even knew the program before I started writing my question. Anyhow, the question is I just setup hellanzb and it is not taking the nzbs from my queue folder. it worked the first time then it wont work again
2010-07-03T19:39:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	thinking i might have made a mistake in the hellanzb.conf file I redid it and changed all the dir's. again, i dropped a nzb into the folder and it caught it downloaded, par2'ed, rar'ed and everything worked perfect. dropped a new nzb in and nothing, just says hellanzb - Now monitoring queue...
2010-07-03T19:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	well your assumption is wrong I have no clue about that program but I do know you have to compile it yet I am sure this aint your first time asking about the same app also I assume your compiling or are you using the one from the repos
2010-07-03T19:41:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Pirate_Hunter	 this is why I asked if somoene could help me with this specific program before I went into a long description about what the problem is.
2010-07-03T19:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	did you backup before editing? If not can you change it to the way it was and check if it works that way? You can check the logs if it has any
2010-07-03T19:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	it is better to explain the problem than ask if they know about hellanzb now you have more chances of getting help
2010-07-03T19:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	I knew I remembered you yup you're probably not getting much help because that package has been abadoned
2010-07-03T19:45:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	have you tried  sabnzbd as the site suggests and like I said I really don't know much about it best bet is the logs and trying to redo your old setup
2010-07-03T19:47:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	you can also try pan which is a designed news reader which works with usenet not sure weather it is still being worked on
2010-07-03T20:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	abuayyoub	screenlest, gkdesklets and a few
