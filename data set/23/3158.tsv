2008-08-08T07:44:00.000Z	hal_v2		I have no idea what fspot phot man is
2008-08-08T07:45:00.000Z	hal_v2		Yes I am.
2008-08-08T07:47:00.000Z	hal_v2		I don't feel I should have to purchase extra equipment for something as simple as the operating system not recognizing my memory card.
2008-08-08T07:48:00.000Z	hal_v2		In other words, if I wanted to waste money I would have windows.
2008-08-08T07:49:00.000Z	hal_v2		There should be a workaround, or something.
2008-08-08T07:49:00.000Z	hal_v2		Everyone's so eager to give up.
2008-08-08T07:51:00.000Z	hal_v2		Camera wont mount with memory card in it.
2008-08-08T07:51:00.000Z	hal_v2		Everything works fine when the card isn't in it.

2008-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	Coded1	hal_v2	i think the easiest thing to do is get an external card reader, if the company that you bought your camera from does not want anyone to know how to work with it no one can force them
2008-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	Coded1	hal_v2	the card reader is like $10 or less at your local electronics store
2008-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	hal_v2	Coded1	is that the case? is it the company's fault for building a camera that's too difficult to understand?
2008-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	Coded1	hal_v2	 when some one makes something especially in electronics there is really no way of knowing how it works on the inside, if the company does not tell anyone what pin does what it takes monts /years to guess and test
2008-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	hal_v2	Coded1	the camera works fine without the card, so it's not their fault.
2008-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	Coded1	hal_v2	sorry buddy, grab a debugger and have at her
