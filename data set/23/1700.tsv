2010-12-17T10:58:00.000Z	Gigacore		and guys, after I install nVidia drivers on my Dell XPS 15, it starts only with the CLI. It needs me to boot using failsafe mode and then delete the xorg.conf file. Performing nvidia-xconfig doesn't help either. Any fix?
2010-12-17T10:58:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	 so will it run X yes or no
2010-12-17T10:59:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	like try  xinit from the command line
2010-12-17T10:59:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	it does not run X after installing the driver, it requires me to delete xorg.conf files
2010-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	Gigacore		and so it gets back to integrated intel hd gfx
2010-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	   did you delete xorg.conf?
2010-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	yes there is no other way.. even reconfiguring the file and restarting the X server doesnt work
2010-12-17T11:01:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	so you have a native adapter and an nvidia adapter?
2010-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	yes.. my laptop has integrated intel hd gfx and nvidia gpu
2010-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	I believe this has something to do with the new nVidia Optimus which switches from integrated gfx to nVidia whenever it needs (it works fine on windows)
2010-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	 that makes little sense.   laptops dont have both very often.    If you do    lspci -v   | grep -i nvidia   do you see anything?
2010-12-17T11:03:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	 it switches driving the native LCD?
2010-12-17T11:04:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	  did the driver install correctly?
2010-12-17T11:05:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	i've not connected any external display to my laptop.. so it switches between each other and displays on the same inbuilt display on laptop
2010-12-17T11:06:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	the driver has been installed correctly, but there is some issue with the configuration
2010-12-17T11:06:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	 I have heard of the switching.    But I dont know how to do it linux.   I would check in bios and see if there is a way to force it to be nvidia all the time.    Try to boot up in  non-graphics mode.    safe vga mode or whatever.

2010-12-17T11:07:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	I tried that in bios, but there is no option to set nvidia to default.. but in windows, in nvidia setup tool there is an option to set the nvidia gpu as default
2010-12-17T11:07:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	  I would try to make sure that linux is in plain text console mode until  its ready to run full X.    Try to turn off all bootsplash stuff.
2010-12-17T11:09:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	 try to stay non-graphics until the last second and then fire up the nvidia drivers.
2010-12-17T11:09:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	ok.. i will try
2010-12-17T11:09:00.000Z	Gigacore	sync3times	thank you!
2010-12-17T11:09:00.000Z	sync3times	Gigacore	good luck
