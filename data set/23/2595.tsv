2009-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	try gpsdrive
2009-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	can you download maps for it?
2009-01-11T10:55:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	yep
2009-01-11T10:58:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	i'm not familiar with the GPS chipsets available, is there anythign that works best with gpsdrive?
2009-01-11T10:59:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	try to get the thing to output in NEMA and GPSD will read it just fine
2009-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	Sorry i misread it,  I have a Magellin SportTrak Map that works great (other than battery life)
2009-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	okay i see; well i'll give you the gist of the project i'm trying to do; basically pulling apart an old laptop at the moment (P3 997.5MHz, 504Mb mem - no HD) and I was considering just booting with ubuntu (perhaps puppy linux if that doesn't work) and try and get a GPS chipset to slot in via the PCMIA card slot :p
2009-01-11T11:04:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	I got no exp. with pcmcia gps'es Mine just connect thru the serial port
2009-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	mattycoze		oh okay yeah i have a 22pin printer serial port at the back of this one
2009-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	mattycoze		hehe showing its age
2009-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	mattycoze		friend gave it to me and i figured it wouldn't take long to do something useful with it...
2009-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	I would suggest looking up gpsd as well it's the deamon that talks to the gps
2009-01-11T11:05:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	I mean the 9 pin com port
2009-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	ahh okay; fair enough;
2009-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	mattycoze		well i'll expeirment.
2009-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	i used to like gpsdrive up with kismet to log where all the wifi hotspots were in town bout 6 years ago
2009-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	hehe yeah i was just reading something about that; looks like a mean wardriving setupo
2009-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	yah it was fun
2009-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	would still do it but II can't patch my wifi card for moniter mode anymore
2009-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	mattycoze	DarkSotM	yeah i know; i think it can still be done on atheros wifi cards
2009-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	mattycoze	lots of cards still can, just not mine ;-(
