2010-03-25T12:15:00.000Z	darkk^		After update udev at my initrd is broken - it does not even create /dev/sda* disks, /dev is almost empty.
2010-03-25T12:16:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	thats not done on initrd
2010-03-25T12:16:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	ah, you're right, that's formally called initramfs.
2010-03-25T12:18:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	anyway, that does not create any difference - my /dev is empty and initramfs script can't find root device (/proc/devices has proper devices, so kernel is ok)
2010-03-25T12:19:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	your problem is with other partitions or is with your system partitions like / /usr /home /boot ...
2010-03-25T12:20:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	I'm quite confident that the issue is udev-related as I can mount everything by hands (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/450620/comments/18 for details)
2010-03-25T12:22:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	looking at you bug post I only can assume that the problem is on your lvm partition
2010-03-25T12:23:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	this isn't exaclty a bug. Do you know what you're doing when using LVM fs?
2010-03-25T12:24:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	yes. I set it up using usual text install, evreything was ok, then I installed all suggested updates - and voila, I have to rescue system from bare bash shell :-)
2010-03-25T12:24:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	Hmm did you updated the kernel too?
2010-03-25T12:25:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	yes, according to /var/log/apt/term.log my kernel was upgraded from 2.6.31.14.27 to 2.6.31.20.33
2010-03-25T12:27:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	if your lvm partition was working fine, and it says okay there, them the problem is with your NTFS drive
2010-03-25T12:29:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	do you have any idea why initramfs may be interested in NTFS partition? :-)
2010-03-25T12:34:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	did you read my last 3 comments? My irc just droped here
2010-03-25T12:35:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	the last comment I see was about NTFS - I'm sure, it's not the reason. As you can see, I find out that udevadm script was broken (see comment #20), now I've just understood WHY it is broken and have some idea how to repair it :-)
2010-03-25T13:05:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	I've resolved the issue - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/450620/comments/21
2010-03-25T13:05:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	was about your ntfs kernel drive?
2010-03-25T13:06:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	not at all :-)
2010-03-25T13:07:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	it was half-upgraded udev
2010-03-25T13:08:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	good solution
2010-03-25T13:10:00.000Z	maginot	darkk^	I just don't get it why did you had to created those nods  by hand
2010-03-25T13:11:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	broken udev could not create them ;)
2010-03-25T13:13:00.000Z	darkk^	maginot	no, udev was broken as dpkg was interrupted for some reason (don't know why, I have some assumption though) I had to run dpkg --configure -a
