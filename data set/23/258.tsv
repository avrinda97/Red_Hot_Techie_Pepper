2012-02-27T02:34:00.000Z	TomV-415		I'm at the grub rescue> prompt, but can't get past that.
2012-02-27T02:35:00.000Z	TomV-415		Seems like it may be an fstab thing..
2012-02-27T02:36:00.000Z	TomV-415		Long time ago on this same box, similar problem was resolved by editing the fstab file, I think.. using IDs or something.
2012-02-27T02:37:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	what OS's do you have?
2012-02-27T02:37:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Nothing but ubuntu now, was a dual boot box previously.
2012-02-27T02:38:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	you can chroot in and reload grub to the mbr. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2012-02-27T02:38:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	sounds like a good place to start. thanks!
2012-02-27T02:39:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	no problem right above it is a srtaight reload with a cd equal to the install that works quite well without the chroot.
2012-02-27T02:41:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Yeah, looks like a good path.  I'm loading liveCD now..  (Unfortunately LiveCD sucks a bit cause it does not load the Nvida driver..weird screen rendering., but it works)
2012-02-27T02:42:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	you can use nomodeset from the f6 menu.
2012-02-27T02:44:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	make the resolution default big though, no gallses needed. lol
2012-02-27T02:47:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Thanks that nomodeset was a big help!  Much better than default.
2012-02-27T02:47:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	it is a cool trick. :)
2012-02-27T03:28:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Just went through the steps you suggested (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot ) no luck.  also tried the one before it, and the one after it (purge and reinstall grub)  Still when I mount without liveCD, I get error: out of disk.
2012-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	is the setup a ide, with a slave, rather then a sata, just guessing here.
2012-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Not sure.  Here's a snapshot I took with boot-repair, BEFORE trying the above stuff.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/858407/
2012-02-27T03:35:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	the correct files are in ubuntu and the fstab looks good, some are better at reading the bootscript though. I would post a thread on the Ubuntu Forums, that is where I learned all this several of the mods are experts in this area and are on daily
2012-02-27T03:37:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	run the bootscript now don't mess with it ubuntu thats is and post it on the forums and wait fro help would be my advice, or at least if you mess with it run a new bootscript, and post it. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2012-02-27T03:37:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Thanks for your help!
2012-02-27T03:38:00.000Z	urfr332gO	TomV-415	no problem the mbr and bootstuff can be a pain in the booty. :)
2012-02-27T03:38:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	I'm starting to suspect something with the MBR is the problem..
2012-02-27T03:38:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	Yes, pain in the boot-ty is right!  No boot joy.
2012-02-27T03:47:00.000Z	TomV-415	urfr332gO	I'm wondering if I can just format the drive and do a install.. will that clear the problem I'm unable to resolve?
