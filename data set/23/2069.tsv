2009-07-13T13:26:00.000Z	em056		why my compiz fusion is not working
2009-07-13T13:26:00.000Z	em056		?
2009-07-13T13:27:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	be specific. did it STOP working? or has it never worked before?
2009-07-13T13:27:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	what video card do you have?
2009-07-13T13:28:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	is that card capable of 3D? there might be a driver for you.. lemme send you the driver page
2009-07-13T13:29:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	nvidia.com/object/unix.html see if your card is supported by one of these drivers
2009-07-13T13:39:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	is that an old card?
2009-07-13T13:40:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	you might need one of the legacy ones.. but first, press ALT+F2 and run jockey-gtk
2009-07-13T13:41:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	does recommend any drivers for you to install?
2009-07-13T13:41:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	or "activate"?
2009-07-13T13:44:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	it's compatible .. but jockey isn't recommending any drivers.. either you're already using an open source one in the kernel already or your vcard isn't capable of 3D effects (i think it's ulikely though)
2009-07-13T13:44:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	let me see which one you should use
2009-07-13T13:45:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	what card did you have again?
2009-07-13T13:46:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	aren't Riva and TNT two different things?
2009-07-13T13:46:00.000Z	moymoy	em056	two different product series
