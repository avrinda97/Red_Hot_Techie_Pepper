2009-12-06T08:44:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	each user can choose their own default session
2009-12-06T08:45:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	 not sure which itll try to put her in on her next login, but she can manually select gnome and re-set that as her default
2009-12-06T08:45:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	there will be more applications available in the menus
2009-12-06T08:46:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	nah you can use them all regardless which you're logged into
2009-12-06T08:46:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	FloodBot is a bot ;)
2009-12-06T08:46:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	the libraries it uses
2009-12-06T08:46:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	aside from plain gtk, there's actual gnome libraries used by gnome apps just like aside from qt there are kde libs used by kde apps
2009-12-06T08:47:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	yes, you can use any app no problem
2009-12-06T08:47:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	if you *do* find a problem, please report it as a bug
2009-12-06T08:47:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	i prefer kde. and the reason they arent all installed by default is that ubuntu already takes 698 of 700 mb of its disc space :P
2009-12-06T08:48:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	yes
2009-12-06T08:51:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	emerald is an unsupported and unmaintained window decorator for compiz
2009-12-06T08:51:00.000Z	maco	brandon`	but yes, you can use compiz with xfce
