2005-11-26T14:06:00.000Z	levander		I think I smeared some Artic Silver thermal compound on my motherboard where it shouldn't be.  Can I clean the motherboard with isopryl alcohol and a lint free cloth?  Or, is that dangerous?
2005-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	levander		I've also got this new ArctiClean "thermal material remover" that you're supposed to use on CPU's, anybody know *for sure* if I can use that on my motherboard?  It does a much better job than isopryl alcohol, at least it did on the CPU.
2005-11-26T14:09:00.000Z	sethk	levander	I second that, definitely don't use it
2005-11-26T14:10:00.000Z	levander	sethk	sky_monkey00: thanks, I'm doing it the hard way with isopryl.  Thanks guys.
2005-12-19T12:41:00.000Z	sethk	levander	if you understand the risks, back up your repository state and go for it.
2005-12-19T12:41:00.000Z	levander	sethk	well, actually i'm wondering if nalioth isn't right, i already can't find the hot-babe package they claim on their web page to have in there
2005-12-19T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	levander	I tend towards the conservative and, personally, I'd prefer to install from source rather than use an unofficial repository
2005-12-19T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	levander	of course if you back up you can revert, but why risk your package database state, even if the risk is small?
2005-12-19T12:43:00.000Z	levander	sethk	nalioth: yeah, i'll just compile, thanks guys
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	levander	ls?  I don't know, you have to press two different keys ...
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	levander	and you have to press the l first
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	levander	kind of tough  :)
2006-10-19T12:01:00.000Z	sethk	levander	you are installing a kernel module.  kernel modules must be built for a specific kernel.
2006-10-19T12:02:00.000Z	levander	sethk	thanks
2006-10-19T12:02:00.000Z	levander	sethk	but, it makes me a little leary of installing it now...
2006-10-19T12:02:00.000Z	sethk	levander	yes, it could certainly happen.
2006-10-19T12:06:00.000Z	levander	sethk	why does upgrading the graphics card make business graphics faster? I'm still trying to figure this out.
2006-10-19T12:07:00.000Z	sethk	levander	business graphics are still graphcis.  If you dramatically improve the performance of modifying what's on the screen, then things go faster.
2006-10-19T12:07:00.000Z	sethk	levander	the card can move video data much more quickly.
2006-10-19T12:08:00.000Z	levander	sethk	k, thanks.  I didn't know business graphics did any real work on the graphics card, i thought the CPU just told the video card what pixels to render, and the video card did it.  Have never read about 2D video card features, have only heard about 3D ones
2006-12-11T09:44:00.000Z	levander	sethk	but then don't you get a huge headache when you want one little thing to work?
2006-12-11T09:44:00.000Z	sethk	levander	no
2006-12-11T09:44:00.000Z	sethk	levander	at least, not so far
