2009-06-13T05:21:00.000Z	Dethroned		What's the best way to install java on 9.04?
2009-06-13T05:22:00.000Z	Dethroned		flannel:  I don't know how to run the bin
2009-06-13T05:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	a java program itself? or what?
2009-06-13T05:24:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	 I want the runtime environment...will the one in the add apps database work?
2009-06-13T05:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	It will.  The package you're looking for is sun-java6-jre
2009-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	It's in /opt right?
2009-06-13T06:09:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	 It saved in usr/local/games/armyops
2009-06-13T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	How was it installed? (not a deb, right? but a bin file?)
2009-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	well, the fact its in /local/ makes me think it wasn't, but we'll go ahead and check to make sure.  Fire up synaptic, and search for an americas army package.
2009-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	Ah, AA apparently includes an uninstall script.  So, poke around the AA folders in /usr/local/* (probably lib?) and look for 'uninstall'
2009-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	Assuming you're in the same folder as it: sudo ./uninstall
2009-06-13T06:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	What's it called in the current directory?
2009-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	Ah.  Ok.  What folder is it in, and what's the file called?
2009-06-13T06:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	alright, in a terminal: sudo /usr/local/games/armyops/uninstall
2009-06-13T06:22:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	hmm, alright, apparently it might work if we open a root terminal (but I'm not holding my breath), so lets try this: sudo -i, then cd /usr/local/games/armyops, then ./uninstall
2009-06-13T06:23:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	Wow...Thanks so much for your help!  I think I'm beginning to understand linux...sort of
2009-06-13T06:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	Did that actually work?
2009-06-13T06:24:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	yeah...went off without a hitch...and really fast
2009-06-13T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	Alright.  That just means the uninstaller is *creative*.  Alright, once its done, type 'exit' to get back to a regular (your user) terminal (or just close the whole thing, if you already did)
2009-06-13T06:25:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	 I did that. Thanks again for your help.
2009-06-13T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	No problem
2009-06-13T06:25:00.000Z	Dethroned	Flannel	 Do you recommend any method for teaching myself that kind of stuff?  I pretty much only know windows commands
2009-06-13T06:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Dethroned	It's just all about familiarity.  Don't worry if it doesn't stick.  Actually, more important than terminal commands is permissions.    Once you understand file permissions, lots of other issues make more sense: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
