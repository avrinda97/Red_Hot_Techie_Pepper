2006-12-21T06:13:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	update-manager
2006-12-21T06:15:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	sorry, I didn't get you? "update-manager" =? I didn't ask anything.
2007-01-15T14:16:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	why not?
2007-01-15T14:16:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	Bullshit
2007-01-15T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	nope, it's the truth.
2007-01-15T14:17:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	never happened to me
2007-01-15T14:17:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	you got lucky
2007-01-15T14:17:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	Just click on the stuff you really need, leave the rest untouched and you're fine.
2007-01-15T14:17:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	no, the entire thing is rubbish
2007-01-15T14:17:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	luck has nothing to do with it. I know what I do :-)
2007-01-15T14:18:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	you can go ahead and use it, makes no difference to me.  But do not recommend it here.  It's not fair to break peoples systems without them knowing any better
2007-01-15T14:19:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	just how did Automatix hose your system?
2007-01-15T14:19:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	not mine.  But we recieve lots of people in here that have to reinstall because they used automatix.
2007-01-15T14:19:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	as I said, I never had that problem. I just grab what I need and leave the rest untouched.
2007-01-15T14:20:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	right, and again, just because somethign works for you doesnt mean its stable, or works for anyone else.  Anyway, this is -offtopic
2007-06-16T15:38:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	#ubuntu-offtopic for non-support chatter, thanks.
2007-06-16T15:38:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	sorry dude, but this is so funny :)
2007-06-17T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	that's not true.  Just the default.
2007-06-17T16:11:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	On Ubuntu it always uses "your" password ... simple explanation. Not everyone is interested in the details :-)
2007-06-17T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	scorp123	no, that's not true either.  On Ubuntu you can set it to use the root password.  Just not by default.
2007-06-17T16:12:00.000Z	scorp123	Flannel	"just not by default" is exactly what I mean. It can be changed, yes. But out of the box it uses "your password". Don't confuse people ;-)
