2007-11-02T08:22:00.000Z	Jacob		Hello. I'm sorry, but I've encountered a rather large problem....Nothing will open when I doube click on it and I don't know why
2007-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	Jacob		It just barely started, but when I double click on a picture it'll lose it's icon, if I doube click on an mp3 it'll lose it's icon...They both just turn into sheets of paper
2007-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Have you rebooted yet?
2007-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Not yet, since I'm in the middle of working on a document, and I'm afraid that if I reboot I won't be able to get back into Ubuntu or something :\
2007-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Is the mouse USB or PS/2?
2007-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Mouse is USB
2007-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Have you unplugged/replugged it in?
2007-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	No, I haven't. I'll do that now, but why would that help?
2007-11-02T08:26:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	I guess just kind of power-cycling the mouse.  It probably needs a reboot.  That doesn't sound like something that would keep you from booting again.
2007-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Did we lose you?
2007-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	I'm not sure if I described the problem. The mouse works fine: It's just that nothing at all will open. When I look at properties, everything has become "type: unknown". I can still open actual programs (through the terminal or the applications menu), but not by double clicking
2007-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Hmm. When I open folders, it tells me that it can't display the contents of anything
2007-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	That's odd.  If you have another system, email that document to yourself and try a reboot.
2007-11-02T08:30:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	It isn't rebooting.
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Should I press the power button on my computer? :\ I've heard that it is best to let the OS handle that sort of thing, but Ubuntu is just sitting there
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Did the menu for shut down/restart, etc show up?
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	No, it didn't. I click on the icon but nothing happens
2007-11-02T08:32:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Hit alt+ctrl+del to bring it up
2007-11-02T08:32:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Alright, it comes up that way. I'm going to try rebooting now...Will I be able to use a Live CD or something to come back in case something bad happens?
2007-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	Ebiggs		Yeah, you should.
2007-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	Jacob		Alright. Be right back, hopefully
2007-11-02T08:36:00.000Z	Jacob	Ebiggs	Hello again. Rebooting seems to have solved whatever the issue was, so I guess nothing too bad happened :) Thanks for your help, though :)
2007-11-02T08:36:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Jacob	Always glad to help.  I didn't think it sounded serious.
