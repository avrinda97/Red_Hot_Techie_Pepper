2008-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	LSG	shyster317	Can't find the package, just like with fusion-icon.
2008-04-28T08:12:00.000Z	LSG	shyster317	I tried Hardy last night, and that fusion-icon seemed really handy. But i went back to Gutsy cause i was having serious problems with animations and video playback
2008-04-28T08:12:00.000Z	shyster317	LSG	I like fusion-icon myself
2008-04-28T08:13:00.000Z	shyster317	LSG	I don't think it's around for gutsy

2008-04-28T08:38:00.000Z	LSG	shyster317	Yeah it wasn't an obvious method...at all. But i made it. Save for an annoying folder inside my home dir., it's perfect!
