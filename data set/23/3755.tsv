2008-02-01T21:06:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	you could simply export CC="gcc-3.4" , or maybe change the gcc link to point to gcc-3.4
2008-02-08T06:45:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	but before you do that, you might want to read up on nice , so you can see why the fact it's using 90% isn't really relevant
2008-02-08T06:45:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	read up on nice?
2008-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	it's a way to tell an app "As long as nothing else wants to use the cpu, you can use as much of it as you like, but as soon as another app wants to do something you WILL yield up the cycles"
2008-02-08T06:47:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	why can't programs just remain dormant if not being used?
2008-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	it's a daemon, it does stuff in the background. That's the whole point of a multitasking os, more than one app can run at a time.
2008-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	another way to look at it is if your processor is doing nothing, it's wasting time. Find something for it to do when nothing else needs it
2008-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	what I don't like is my cpu temps being as high as they are on max load.
2008-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	then true, you can go to system->prefs->session and turn off the tracker. It won't run at the next login
2008-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	thanks.
2008-02-09T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	a wine app that couldn't run because your direct rendering is broken
2008-02-09T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	if you have xserver-xgl running that would cause it
2008-02-09T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	me.
2008-02-09T09:31:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	seriously?
2008-02-09T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	yes, its in my laptop. Instructions follow (unless you used the one from the ati.amd site, then all bets are off)
2008-02-09T09:32:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	if you have to go, then I won't hold ya here.
2008-02-09T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	nah, Jack was leaving
2008-02-09T09:32:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	alright I'm ready for instructions.
2008-02-09T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	system->admin->restricted manager, install ati . Reboot.  Log in, run fglrxinfo in a terminal, make sure you're using ati driver 8.37.6 . Done
2008-02-09T09:33:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	how can I be sure i'm using 8.37?
2008-02-09T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	broken__	fgrlxinfo will tell you
2008-02-09T09:38:00.000Z	broken__	nickrud	... it seems I was already using dri.. lol!
