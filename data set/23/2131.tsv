2009-07-19T21:23:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	platinum is the best.. then gold, silver, bronze... there used to be a page about this but I can't find it any more
2009-07-19T21:24:00.000Z	VirusTB	Slart	 erUSUL: question how to i update my WINE to the newest one? I am on version 1.0.1
2009-12-24T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	get a router what does some good encryption.. use a good password/passphrase.. then it won't matter if it doesn't advertise itself
2009-12-24T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	ouch.. hiding your SSID won't help you much then.. it's like locking your door with piece of string and then remove the name plate on the door..
2009-12-24T03:36:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	yes.. WEP will take minutes to crack with a modern computer
2009-12-24T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	hmm..I only get auto eth0.. not sure what auto ethernet is about
2009-12-24T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	the green light on the network card itself?
2009-12-24T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	I think that just means your cable is connected properly.. I doubt it checks anything more sophisticated than that
2009-12-24T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	ahm..  I would guess something like 8 bits per character.. but I'm not sure you can count like that
2009-12-24T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	VirusTB	I have no idea.. you might want to look that up on wikipedia or similar
