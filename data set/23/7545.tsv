2005-07-31T07:07:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	have you plugged in any usb-devices?
2005-07-31T07:07:00.000Z	wizo	slask3n	my mouse
2005-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	any new sound devices then?
2005-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	wizo		errr nope, im running a laptop
2005-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	try unplugging the mouse and reboot.. i have the same problem after i rebooot with the usb webcam plugged in...
2005-07-31T07:09:00.000Z	wizo		but er
2005-07-31T07:09:00.000Z	wizo		my mouse was plugged in all the time and the movie could play
2005-07-31T07:09:00.000Z	wizo		pretty laggy though
2005-07-31T07:11:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	its possible to fix by setting up the sound devices again, but i dont know how to do so.. in my case my usb webcam has a built-in microphone and ubuntu thinks its a soundcard when booting with the webcam plugged in..
2005-07-31T07:11:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	so ubuntu stes the webcam as a primary soundcard and the real soundcard as an secondary wich is not in use..
2005-07-31T07:11:00.000Z	wizo		ohhh
2005-07-31T07:12:00.000Z	wizo		hwo do i turn on that esd again?
2005-07-31T07:12:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	but try unplugging the usb mouse and reboot, and after logging in again you can plug the mouse back in.. try that please.. and im almost sure its going to work..
2005-07-31T07:13:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	its a bit clumsy and much extra work, but at least it works temporary until a better solution is found..
2005-07-31T07:13:00.000Z	wizo		mm ok
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	wizo		awesome
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	wizo		i typed esd in my konsole and how it plays
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	wizo		now*
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	slask3n	wizo	OK :) thats good :)
