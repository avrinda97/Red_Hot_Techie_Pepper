2008-02-19T23:16:00.000Z	tafkaz		hi there... i have a really strange problem here with davfs2...but maybe it is not so much davfs2 related as i thought...
2008-02-19T23:16:00.000Z	tafkaz		i want to copy files from a davfs2 mounted webdav share to a local folder on my harddrive
2008-02-19T23:17:00.000Z	tafkaz		mounting and everything worx absolutely flawless
2008-02-19T23:17:00.000Z	tafkaz		but after a while i get loads of these here:
2008-02-19T23:18:00.000Z	tafkaz		cp: cannot open `/mnt/webdav/foo/bar/foo/foo bar/foo/foo.bar' for reading: Input/output error
2008-02-19T23:19:00.000Z	tafkaz		what really seems strange to me is the ` at the beginning....isnt that supposed to be a ' instead ?
2008-02-19T23:19:00.000Z	tafkaz		cause when i do a cd `/mnt/webdav/foo/bar/foo/foo bar/foo/'
2008-02-19T23:19:00.000Z	tafkaz		this does not work
2008-02-19T23:19:00.000Z	tafkaz		any idea is greatly appreciated

2008-02-19T23:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	tafkaz	well, I don't think you need to use ' or `
