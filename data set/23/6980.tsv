2005-11-07T12:39:00.000Z	ompaul	rise	you said "rise: how should i uninstall completely ubuntu?" << reads like remove
2005-11-07T12:39:00.000Z	rise		hehe yes
2005-11-07T12:40:00.000Z	rise		and what about the boot loader thingie ubuntu installs?
2005-11-07T12:40:00.000Z	ompaul	rise	is that what you want?
2005-11-07T12:40:00.000Z	rise		that will go away too after i delete the partition?

2005-11-07T12:42:00.000Z	ompaul	rise	well just reinstall windows
2005-11-07T12:43:00.000Z	rise		:(
2005-11-07T12:43:00.000Z	ompaul	rise	I suggest you do to #windows the rest of your questions are not really linux based
2005-11-07T12:43:00.000Z	rise		there must be a way to remove manually the boot loader option ubuntu installs
2005-11-07T12:43:00.000Z	ompaul	rise	you can use grub to remove itself
