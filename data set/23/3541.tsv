2008-03-24T08:00:00.000Z	xanderp		Help please!! I just applied some updates, rebooted and now my system boots to a busybox cli!
2008-03-24T08:02:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	Are you sure it's busybox? or do you just mean CLI?
2008-03-24T08:03:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	Can you boot normally in recovery mode?
2008-03-24T08:04:00.000Z	xanderp	mssever	nope.  I hit esc on the grub, turned off spash and quiet, and it shows mounting problems for root.  I'm wondering if my uuid changed?
2008-03-24T08:05:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	were these just run-of-the-mill updates?
2008-03-24T08:07:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	Well, your UUID isn't *supposed* to change... Have you tried recovery mode (If you answered that already, I apologize)
2008-03-24T08:07:00.000Z	xanderp	mssever	i tried recovery, it barfs too
2008-03-24T08:08:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	you have to specify your partitions grub-style
2008-03-24T08:08:00.000Z	xanderp	mssever	I didn't change anything, the defaults that ubuntu put in grub are what i was using.
2008-03-24T08:08:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	Or maybe not...I don't remember
2008-03-24T08:09:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	I was saying that in answer to your question about changing the root to /
2008-03-24T08:10:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	Honestly, though, I'd be surprised if your UUID changed. Why do you think it did?
2008-03-24T08:11:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	how far along in the boot process do you get?
2008-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	yes
2008-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	unless you decide to phically change how your drives are connected, you'll be fint
2008-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	no, in fstab
2008-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	xanderp	mssever	hehe... talking to your self is the first sign of impending mental collapse!!
2008-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	:)
2008-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	which version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	I had that kind of trouble between dapper and edgy
2008-03-24T08:32:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	now you know to watch fstab closely, lest updates conspire against you
2008-03-24T08:34:00.000Z	mssever	xanderp	it marks a file as immutable. read the chattr man page
2008-03-24T08:35:00.000Z	xanderp	mssever	already there
