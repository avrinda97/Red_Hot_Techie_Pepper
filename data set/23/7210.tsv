2008-11-29T14:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	you might want to run a light window manager on the 128m ram box, something like openbox or fluxbox
2008-12-20T19:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	no
2008-12-22T14:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	why are you using wine to run utorrent when there are many native Linux torrent clients?
2008-12-23T16:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	update simply updates your software sources, it's a good thing
2008-12-25T09:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2008-12-25T10:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-12-25T10:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	don't need sudo for this
2008-12-25T10:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	ok, in terminal do:  sudo apt-get update
2008-12-25T10:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	updating your sources is a good thing to do now and then
2008-12-25T10:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	this won't take you to the next ubuntu release, it just updates your sources
2008-12-25T10:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	I don't see how that can happen, update just refreshes your sources list, trust me, it's safe
2008-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	if you're not going to accept advice from people, how do you expect to resolve problems?
2008-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	terryx	nevermind then
