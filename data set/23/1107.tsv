2011-02-12T08:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		Hey guys, I'm having serious issues with VNC keyboard layouts being mixed up.

2011-02-12T08:34:00.000Z	WACOMalt		is there a way to manually assign each key an output on ubuntu? I need to tell it what each key on my keyboard is.
2011-02-12T08:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		Anybody know of conflicts between gnome and vncserver?
2011-02-12T08:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		its set to US 105
2011-02-12T08:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		but it is not working that way
2011-02-12T08:36:00.000Z	WACOMalt		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=37564 found this issue, which is the same. The bottom fix kinda worked but the s was still messed up, and the m
2011-02-12T08:36:00.000Z	WACOMalt		tried the one above it with 0 success
2011-02-12T08:37:00.000Z	WACOMalt		Is there a way to literally kit a key, click on the input it corresponds to and build your own custom keymap?
2011-02-12T08:38:00.000Z	WACOMalt		Anybody able to help with complete manual defining of keyboard layout?
2011-02-12T08:38:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	what about http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=411949
2011-02-12T08:43:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	didn't you check http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2539412&postcount=4
2011-02-12T08:44:00.000Z	WACOMalt	pksadiq	tried that
2011-02-12T08:45:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	you can type that by virtual keyboard, I think
2011-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	if you can type numbers you might do CTRL+SHIFT+U and type the correponding hex values, irritating ;)
2011-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	might be you could type gconf-   and the tab key
2011-02-12T08:49:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	from eindows make a script that contain all what you need to execute and  exe in ubuntu ;), might be some easier way around
2011-02-12T08:56:00.000Z	WACOMalt	pksadiq	Tried that fix, definitely closer now. Everything but M and S are correctly mapped now. both of those seem to be pointing to the "Super" key
2011-02-12T11:05:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	what does sudo apt-get install -f            do?
2011-02-12T11:06:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	this might be just because you have installed a later version
2011-02-12T11:07:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	I mean an older version
2011-02-12T11:07:00.000Z	WACOMalt	pksadiq	apparantly I had a non finished email install that caused it, thanks!
2011-02-12T11:45:00.000Z	pksadiq	WACOMalt	I think ssh -X does any way check man ssh
