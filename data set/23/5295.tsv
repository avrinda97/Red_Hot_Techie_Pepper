2007-05-25T14:34:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	sometimes is muted. Or low. start alsamixer with -V capture
2007-05-25T14:35:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	what is the command? alsamixer -V?
2007-05-25T14:35:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	alsamixer -V capture
2007-05-25T14:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	what do i do there?
2007-05-25T14:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	i set line to 100%
2007-05-25T14:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	i selected mic
2007-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	mic is muted here by default
2007-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	how do i unmute it
2007-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	if MM is showing at the bottom, hit spacebar
2007-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	navigate with arrows
2007-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	i went to MIC and hit spacebar and the L R Capture (red thing) stayed where it was, ie nothing happened
2007-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	the L R CAPTURE thing is already on the mic
2007-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	and even if i take it to Line nothing happens
2007-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	I started alsamixer -V capture, went to the right and put the control for capture up
2007-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	then alsamixer without options. unmuted mic and put up the volume on that
2007-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	both are 100%
2007-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	it must be somewhere in the alsa settings. I've been messing with it myself, but eventually I found it
2007-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	johns^		just don't remember exactly where.
2007-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	johns^	kenthomson	did you dubbleclick on the volume control in the panel? It gives some options also
2007-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	i have been at this since 2-3hours. nothing works
2007-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	kenthomson	johns^	yeah did that GUI thing too
