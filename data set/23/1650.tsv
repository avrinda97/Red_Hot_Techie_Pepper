2010-05-14T00:22:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Another point to remember is that when a computer motherboard was manufactured, it was wave soldered at high temperatures. Much hotter than what the computer runs at.
2010-05-14T00:23:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Acidchild, true. An ongoing temp process will affect the overall change in components.
2010-05-14T00:23:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	a lot of soldering is done sonically these days
2010-05-14T00:28:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	testing a component by touching it is baseless.  What we consider hot or warm is relative according to manufacturers specifications.
2010-05-14T00:29:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	i don't test if my cpu is 90*C by touching it! i've already been burned doing that
2010-05-14T00:31:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	is this a laptop or desktop?
2010-05-14T00:31:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	laptop
2010-05-14T00:32:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	please make sure that your fan motor is not blocked by papers and stuff. Many people put paper on top of the keyboard and so. Also I in some cases use a cookie grill to sit on to allow the heat dispersion.
2010-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	the fan is not blocked, i actually pulled out a nice clump of dust when i took off the heat sink when i replaced the mobo; it's in a cabinet but the bottom is propped up and i've been keeping the doors open; i've also forced the fan to stay on high speed all the time; it just gets hot when streaming video
2010-05-14T00:37:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	streaming video uses up a lot of CPU though. That is not unusual.
2010-05-14T00:37:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	so its ok to be 90*C then?
2010-05-14T00:38:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	i'm probably going to get rid of the cabinet altogether once we get a new tv, since the tv will hang on the wall
2010-05-14T00:39:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	putting a computer in a cabinet is not the best thing. There is restricted ventilation.
2010-05-14T00:40:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	i was going to get 200mm fans for ventilation, but i thikn it'll just end up on a shelf
2010-05-14T00:41:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	we're being admonished
2010-05-14T00:43:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	anyway, the point is the 90* isn't sustained under normal conditions, so it shoudl be ok for now
2010-05-14T00:45:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	the main point is that the fan speed increases whether in Ubuntu or Windows with the increase of CPU usage. It is just a preventive measure to stop burnout.
2010-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	i was able to force the fan to high with umm... some package in the repos, but it only did it for a second, so i set up a script on startup to run the command every .5 seconds :)
2010-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	one of them monitoring programs, not gkrellm though
2010-05-14T00:48:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	there are Windows software to test the extreme usage of the CPU, I don't know if there is one for Ubuntu. Perhaps someone can enlighten us on that.
2010-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	what the software does is exhausts every conceivable mathematical computation that a CPU can make and tests the heat of the component and the durability of the CPU.
2010-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Curly_Q	i just stream 720p video to stress it
2010-05-14T00:51:00.000Z	Curly_Q	LzrdKing	I don't see any problem with your system. On a very hot day, your CPU will be cooking.
