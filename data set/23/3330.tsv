2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	ChrizC		hi, I just got my CD for 8.04 LTS desktop in the post today, I opened it, slapped it into my drive, rebooted the computer to go into auto-install, and about 5-10mins into the install, a lot of text comes up, saying "zlib_inflate" or something like that failed. I checked the cd for defects and it said 2 files had errors. Any help so I can install it asap?
2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; impossible.
2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	either way, you need another disc.  Either you have a bad download, or a bad burned disc.
2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	where di you get this disc?
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	From Ubuntu's "Request a free CD" page.
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	it's possible, yes.  I mean, they make 1000s of discs, they're bound to be some bad ones
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	that doesn't make sense
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	my drive won't burn ISO's properly.
2008-09-22T20:29:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	that's irc etiquette, there are many users here.  we should highlight before each message
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	where do you live, out of curiosity?
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	I don't get it, don't you have internet?
2008-09-22T20:31:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	well, you say you live in the UK?
2008-09-22T20:32:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	if you use torrents, you can recover the torrent where you left off
2008-09-22T20:33:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	can't you read? I've got no torrent software!
2008-09-22T20:33:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	then get some!
2008-09-22T20:33:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	if you can't download anything, then we can't really help you here.
2008-09-22T20:35:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	so why can't you download a small file?
2008-09-22T20:35:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	is that small file an iso?
2008-09-22T20:36:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	you know what, we really can't do anything for you here
2008-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	if you download the iso, you could try burning it from the broken live cd
2008-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	i don't think you're right
2008-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	how so
2008-09-22T20:43:00.000Z	_Zeus_	ChrizC	of course they don't
