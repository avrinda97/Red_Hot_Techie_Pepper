2005-08-06T06:58:00.000Z	WildMagic		hey guys, i am using hoary and my entire sound setup sucks...i'd like to use ALSA..i apt-get'ed all the alsa* things that apt-cache search threw up, then did /etc/init.d/alsa start. then I pointed xmms output pluging to ALSA, but it says "no alsa device present" am I missing anything?
2005-08-06T07:00:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	You may have to go into the ALSA config in xmms and select your soundcard, rahter than on "default"
2005-08-06T07:13:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	Read what I said
2005-08-06T07:14:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	okay
2005-08-06T07:19:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	now xmms plays the music, but there is no sound...as if everything is muted
2005-08-06T07:20:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	OPen your volume control (by the clock in the top-right)
2005-08-06T07:20:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	it is set to peak volume
2005-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	Did you right-click and "Open Volume Control"?
2005-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	yep. and i get only PCM and speaker
2005-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	both of them are about 80 %
2005-08-06T07:23:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	there is one NVidia nForce (Alsa Mixer) there
2005-08-06T07:23:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	selecting which givems me a Master, a PCM and a Speaker, all of which are set to max
2005-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	hang on
2005-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	yeah...but it does not help..however, I am using GNOME and it makes all those funny noises when i minimise/maximise a window
2005-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	should I try rebooting ;-) ?
2005-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	Did hoary not automatically use ALSA instead of OSS?
2005-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	nope...i don't think so
2005-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	actually, I am not sure what it did.  Iam not an expert about thises things
2005-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	but i di know that there wasn;t even an /etc/asound
2005-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	i had to do that manually from some wiki i saw on the net
2005-08-06T07:50:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	hey, i got sound in xmms using alsa now..but when i load any flash file using firefox, i still don't get sound...how do i tackle that?
2005-08-06T07:51:00.000Z	moogman	WildMagic	System->Preferences->Multimedia Selector may help
2005-08-06T07:52:00.000Z	WildMagic	moogman	okay
