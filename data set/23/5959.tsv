2006-09-26T13:48:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	I have not read this, but it might help:
2006-09-26T13:50:00.000Z	cpk1	spasmodo	thanks, reading a forum post right now, iwconfig doesnt seem to pay attention to me when i tell it what essid to use
2006-09-26T13:52:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	does your network show up with 'iwlist scan' ?
2006-09-26T13:52:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	good, is it working?
2006-09-26T13:52:00.000Z	cpk1	spasmodo	still havent touched the winbox yet =P
2006-09-26T13:53:00.000Z	cpk1	spasmodo	but iwlist scan doesnt bring up the essid that this box is using
2006-09-26T13:54:00.000Z	cpk1	spasmodo	i think i just got it too work!
2006-09-26T13:54:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	sweet

2006-09-26T13:55:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	good job
2006-09-26T13:56:00.000Z	spasmodo	cpk1	I would rather be embarrassed with a working solution than frustrated :d
