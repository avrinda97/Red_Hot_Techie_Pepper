2008-09-18T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	you should have a backup system anyways
2008-09-18T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	you can write to ntfs with ntfs-3g
2008-09-18T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	so you could wipe it, format ntfs then write to it then
2008-09-18T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	you might not be able to in linux, i guess you could rename it if you wanted to keep it
2008-09-18T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	depends if you gots enough space
2008-09-18T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	your choice, think about how much space you need for the system OS
2008-09-18T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	you could parttion the 500 1 for OS and 1 for data then use a small partition for temp stuff and swap file to make your system faster
2008-09-18T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	id just backup what you need and remove it all but if theres stuff you need, then harvest that too
2008-09-18T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	if you do you might miss something. I wouldnt scrimp in any way on a project like that
2008-09-18T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	/etc i guess but there are files all over the place, you should just copy your home folder and you should be fine
2008-09-18T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	yes
2008-09-18T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	piracy sucks
2008-09-18T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	it doesnt work for everybody, but if you wanna use an OS you must pay in some way
2008-09-18T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	i use ktorrent, its got a php web interface too
2008-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	its only better to you, millions would disagree
2008-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	thats nothing to do with your client
2008-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nathanielneall	thats you seeding
