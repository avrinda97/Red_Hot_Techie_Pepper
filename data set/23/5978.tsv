2008-05-31T04:00:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	My KERNEL PANIC is about mobo issues
2008-05-31T04:00:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- explain 'mobo issues'
2008-05-31T04:01:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	As in apparently at least two dozen people with the same mobo and a similiar CPU have the same issue, but no solution as of yet.
2008-05-31T04:01:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Earliest of these are from 6.10
2008-05-31T04:03:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Latest stable.
2008-05-31T04:06:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	This is happening on hardy?
2008-05-31T04:06:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Yes.
2008-05-31T04:15:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- Add anything you can to help here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/125925
2008-05-31T04:16:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Gah, know any better distro than Ubuntu with about the same learning curve?
2008-05-31T04:16:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- If you buy one from Dell or System76 you will have no issues
2008-05-31T04:16:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	These ancient "medium importance" bugs which completely cripple my asus hardware are getting BORING
2008-05-31T04:16:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- You bought a system without researching hardware components, so now you deal with that choice, or just run windows
2008-05-31T04:17:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Actually, I just expected Ubuntu to WORK on relatively new hardware which isn't exotic in any way.
2008-05-31T04:17:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Y'know, like I've been used to with linux since, uh, 2003?
2008-05-31T04:18:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- I sympathize with you, I really do, and next time if you buy from a Linux system integrator it will be 0 fuss.  Until then, please add everything you can to the bug report.
2008-05-31T04:18:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	I'll do it later on, now I'm just wanting to fix it.
2008-05-31T04:19:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	To anything as detailed as launchpad it'll take a while. I guess it's Debian next.
2008-05-31T04:19:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	 We pull from Debian when we make a new release, it is highly unlikely it will work for Debian if Ubuntu failed
2008-05-31T04:20:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Seen it done (a lot of times) before. Ubuntu sometimes adds it's own exotic bugs.
2008-05-31T04:21:00.000Z	sharms	Taza	- while briefly looking into it, it appears not just Ubuntu had the issue, so I would assume it probably exists in all distros at this point
2008-05-31T04:22:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	And yet I've never had a compaq that failed. Irony.
2008-05-31T04:30:00.000Z	Taza	sharms	Do you know if wildly abusive language is accepted in launchpad?
