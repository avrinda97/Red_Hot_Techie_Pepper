2008-05-23T02:42:00.000Z	afallenhope		hey anyone know if it's available on Mac if I can get the driver for Ubuntu?
2008-05-23T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	drivers? what drivers? for mac???
2008-05-23T02:44:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	I want to get this camera it's supported by Mac & Windows wanted to see if there was drivers for Linux
2008-05-23T02:45:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	don't get your hopes up to much though.. mac and linux isn't exactly the same
2008-08-17T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	Xorg.0.log is the newest one.. the others are older
2008-08-17T14:24:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	thanks. okay I'm confused as to why I'm in there. all I asked was if there was a tutorial I could follow to install the envyng and incase that jacks up go back to the one I have now.
2008-08-17T14:25:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	hmm.. don't know of a tutorial to go back.. but you could always see what the bot says to !nvidia
2008-08-17T14:25:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	and installing envyng is just "sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk"
2008-08-17T14:26:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	envyng itself is a point a click application
2008-08-17T14:27:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	so it's just "sudo apt-get install envyng envyng-gtk"
2008-08-17T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	yes
2008-08-17T14:28:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	will it automatically blacklist the driver I'm using now?
2008-08-17T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	I think it will uninstall your current driver and install a new one
2008-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	php6th I don't know what you were talking about no point click.. lol.
2008-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	did you run envyng?
2008-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	the GTK
2008-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	yes
2008-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	yeah.. got it working.. forgot to update.
2008-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	thanks lol.
2008-08-17T14:46:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	php6th, MikeSeth thanks installing envyng worked.
2008-08-17T14:47:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	nice
2008-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	afallenhope	Slart	fixed a lot of issues actually.. Now to configure it and stuff I can still use the nvidia-settings right?
2008-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	Slart	afallenhope	you can still use nvidia-settings, yes
