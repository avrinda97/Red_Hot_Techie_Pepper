2009-11-12T04:19:00.000Z	hcook		i'm completely stumped. granted i'm a total noob w/ sed, but can anybody tell me why this command doesn't replace the first ip w/ the second one?
2009-11-12T04:19:00.000Z	hcook		sed -i 's/10.10.10.10/192.168.1.10/g' /etc/namedb/zones.new/d/domain.com.a

2009-11-12T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	your command and the output
2009-11-12T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	it does
2009-11-12T04:20:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	good to know, since i've been running it and it doesn't
2009-11-12T04:20:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	i get: "sed: 1: "/etc/namedb/zones.new/d ...": extra characters at the end of n command"
2009-11-12T04:21:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	i already posted the command and output above?
2009-11-12T04:21:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	the file is not changed
2009-11-12T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	i'm asking you to take your mouse, highlight what is in your terminal, and paste it in pastebin
2009-11-12T04:23:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	i understood your request. my reply is that there was one line of command and one line of output...and i gave both above
2009-11-12T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	you're asking me for help.  This is what I need to help you.
2009-11-12T04:24:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	http://www.pastebin.ca/1667240
2009-11-12T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	is this ubuntu?
2009-11-12T04:26:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	no, it's on a freebsd server
2009-11-12T04:26:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	isn't sed pretty standard?
2009-11-12T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	ask on a bsd channel, it's probably not gnu sed
2009-11-12T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	I hate using sed on macs
2009-11-12T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	by the way, you should escape the '.' in the 10.10.10.10 as it also matches things like 10x10x10x10
2009-11-12T04:28:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	yeah, actually i started with 's/\s10\.10\.10\.10\s/\s192\.168\.1\.1\s/g' and kept simplifying it to see if it would work....
2009-11-12T04:30:00.000Z	hcook	jrib	that could be...this server is ancient
2009-11-12T04:30:00.000Z	jrib	hcook	ah
