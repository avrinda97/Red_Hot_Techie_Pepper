2007-04-21T10:42:00.000Z	whta		just upgraded. my main problem is that my login screen is in a bad resolution, causing the screen to flicker and my monitor to display a nice big blue box saying "out of range!" blocking some things that i might need to see. once i actually log in the resolution is fine.
2007-04-21T10:42:00.000Z	rulus	whta	you must change your /etc/X11/Xorg.conf
2007-04-21T10:43:00.000Z	rulus	whta	you see a section with screen resolutions in it, on every line the correct resolution should be at the beginning
2007-04-21T10:43:00.000Z	whta	rulus	this is only on the splash screen. it's fine when i'm logged in.
2007-04-21T10:43:00.000Z	rulus	whta	splash screen or login screen?
2007-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	whta	rulus	well, whichever it is that comes up and prompts me for my username
2007-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	rulus	whta	that's the login screen, you should follow the earlier posted method
2007-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	whta	rulus	i didn't see that. is it on the forums?
2007-04-21T10:45:00.000Z	rulus		no, I just explained it a little bit ;)
2007-04-21T10:45:00.000Z	rulus	whta	^
2007-04-21T10:46:00.000Z	whta	rulus	i've already checked xorg.conf
2007-04-21T10:46:00.000Z	rulus	whta	and the correct resolution is at the beginning of the line?
2007-04-21T10:47:00.000Z	whta	rulus	yes, 1680x1050 on all
2007-04-21T10:47:00.000Z	rulus	whta	if you changed that right now, you should restart X with ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-04-21T10:47:00.000Z	whta	rulus	i didn't change anything. it was already correct.
2007-04-21T10:48:00.000Z	rulus	whta	strange, it should use that resolution for the login screen..
2007-04-21T10:48:00.000Z	whta	rulus	i don't know why it doesn't :(
2007-04-21T10:48:00.000Z	rulus	whta	can you paste your xorg.conf?
2007-04-21T10:48:00.000Z	rulus		!paste | whta
2007-04-21T10:48:00.000Z	whta		jordan: when i upgraded, it gave me a new message about restricted drivers for an ATI card which i promptly enabled. the issue was there before and after enabling these drivers.
2007-04-21T10:49:00.000Z	whta	rulus	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16724/
2007-04-21T10:50:00.000Z	rulus	whta	that does look good to me.
2007-04-21T10:50:00.000Z	rulus	whta	I'm sorry, I really don't know then
