2010-07-17T08:15:00.000Z	blitzo		hi - i have a wubi question - a friend has loaded it on her windows7 machine and everytime she goes to update/upgrade the machine freezes up and gives back no status.  i want her to use a tty but nothing happens where you do ctrl-alt-f key.  (A) does anyone have a suggestion what to look out for when update/upgrade barfs off, and (b) how do we get to a tyy console?
2010-07-17T08:16:00.000Z	blitzo		anyone here know wubi?
2010-07-17T08:17:00.000Z	blitzo		kurogane: man tar
2010-07-17T08:18:00.000Z	blitzo		kurogane: owners are by id number, not name, if the owner doesn't have an account the files will belong to a nameless number
2010-07-17T08:20:00.000Z	blitzo		anybody answer a WUBI question?
2010-07-17T08:21:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	People here don't really like to help out with wubi.  It's usually far more complicated.  A lot of us see the solution to most wubi problems as "just install ubuntu normally" :)
2010-07-17T08:21:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	i can appreciate that - i am trying to gently wean my friend off windows :-)
2010-07-17T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	What's the problem?
2010-07-17T08:22:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	i have told her to update/upgrade using synaptic.  she tells me the machine freezes up.
2010-07-17T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	Every time?  Does it give any errors?
2010-07-17T08:23:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	well, actually it is the package manager automated process and no there are no errors
2010-07-17T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	run it at the cli and see if you can get errors
2010-07-17T08:24:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	tell me how to get a tty console?  not an xterm
2010-07-17T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	ctrl + alt + F2
2010-07-17T08:25:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	she says that doesn't work - and it doesn't work on my ubuntu either - i get a blank screen
2010-07-17T08:26:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	just use a terminal?
2010-07-17T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	applications -> accessories -> terminal
2010-07-17T08:27:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	that is an xterm.  i want a tty console not under x
2010-07-17T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	Why?  What's the difference?
2010-07-17T08:27:00.000Z	blitzo	edbian	because x seems to be crashing
2010-07-17T08:28:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	You should have ctrl + alt + F(1-6) as tty's maybe not on wubi though...
2010-08-01T20:28:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	sudo caches the password for like 5 minutes or something.
2010-08-01T20:29:00.000Z	edbian	blitzo	If you wait a while it will ask again. If you log out and log back in it will ask again.
