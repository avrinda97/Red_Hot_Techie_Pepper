2005-05-15T11:53:00.000Z	XhyldazhK		I cannot login to my box!
2005-05-15T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	have you managed to login to your box before?
2005-05-15T11:59:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	yes, until yesterday
2005-05-15T12:00:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	I interrupted a checkinstall and all went crazy
2005-05-15T12:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	what happens if you cd /home/xhyldazhk as root?
2005-05-15T12:05:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	I can do that without problems
2005-05-15T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	sorry, your error sounds really bizarre
2005-05-15T12:07:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	I've thought of that maybe could be that a lock is still active, a lock created by sudo or by checkinstall
2005-05-15T12:08:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	sudo checkinstall}
2005-05-15T12:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	i'm not a guru, but I don't *think* there are lock files involved for login
2005-05-15T12:10:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	my shell seems to be null
2005-05-15T12:10:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	is this line correct in my shadow:
2005-05-15T12:16:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	why cannot I login to my new system? i even did a fsck
2005-05-15T12:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	i have no idea. and error like 'cannot cd to <existing directory>' sounds very scary to me
2005-06-04T08:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	what error do you get ?
2005-06-04T08:26:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	when I am as root and I try to change user by example 'su - xhyldazhk' it saysm me that permission denied
2005-06-04T08:31:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	do you have any clue on my error?
2005-06-04T08:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	no, sorry...
2005-07-08T11:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	you should probably not run breezy if you don't want problems
2005-07-08T11:29:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	I like to mess around with things, if I didn't liked it, I were running windows, I like cutting edge
2005-07-08T11:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	then you should like figuring out how to install the nvidia driver ;)
2005-07-08T11:30:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	HappyFool	I know... download it from nvidia and blah blah blah... but there isn't a ubuntu deb with it anymore?
2005-07-08T11:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	XhyldazhK	not a clue, sorry
