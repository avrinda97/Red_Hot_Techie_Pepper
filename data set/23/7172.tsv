2008-03-08T06:54:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	no invoking deities please. Didn't follow the whole conversation -- do you know about safe MagicSysRq rebooting?
2008-03-08T06:55:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	don't let your frustration spoil your good manners
2008-03-08T06:55:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	which editor were you using?
2008-03-08T06:56:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	you've tried Ctrl-Alt-F2?
2008-03-08T06:57:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	can you still do a VM snapshot?
2008-03-08T07:00:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	what OS is the host?
2008-03-08T07:02:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	do you still see it on screen?
2008-03-08T07:02:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	what about your important document?
2008-03-08T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	try Ctrl-Alt-PrintScreen-R -- this should take the keyboard away from X. Then you can switch to a console.
2008-03-08T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	why didn't you listen to my advice?
2008-03-08T07:17:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	blame whoever you want to, but do stay on topic
2008-03-08T07:17:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	and do get in touch with the steam people, they must be flexible in a situation like that
2008-03-08T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	blake__	so, ask the person who the account belongs to to get in touch
