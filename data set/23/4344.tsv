2007-09-14T16:15:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	thats exactly what I did, hooray for external drives
2007-09-14T16:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	add the driver module to MODULES in /etc/default/acpi-support might fix it
2007-09-14T16:41:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	could you give any more instruction? I am real new to linux...
2007-09-14T16:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	what's the name of the wireless interface?
2007-09-14T16:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	lsmod |grep 3945 gives what?
2007-09-14T16:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	gksu gedit /etc/default/acpi-support      find the line MODULES=""       and make it read     MODULES="ipw3945"
2007-09-14T16:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	then reboot & see if that fixed it
2007-09-14T16:54:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	did not fix it. Boot froze in the same spot
2007-09-14T05:01:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	do you have any other suggestion?
2007-09-14T05:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	yes, change the STOP_SERVICES=""    to     STOP_SERVICES="networking"
2007-09-14T05:06:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	what was the command to get there?
2007-09-14T05:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	gksu gedit /etc/default/acpi-support      find the line STOP_SERVICES=""       and make it read     STOP_SERVICES="networking"
2007-09-14T05:10:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	it has STOP_SERVICES="mysql" already there. What do I do to add to that?
2007-09-14T05:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	STOP_SERVICES="mysql networking"
2007-09-14T05:11:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	done. restart?
2007-09-14T05:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	sure
2007-09-14T05:16:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	no change after that
2007-09-14T05:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	BernieMac	grrr..

2007-09-14T05:22:00.000Z	BernieMac	Frogzoo	Thanks for trying! I really appreciate it. But if you don't have any more suggestions I'm gonna head to bed. Class in 2 and a half hours
