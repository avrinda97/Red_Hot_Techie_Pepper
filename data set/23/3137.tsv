2008-09-03T18:43:00.000Z	hagus		Does any linux email support http protocol (rather than pop or imap)?
2008-09-03T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	there are ways you can grab httpmail

2008-09-03T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	what account do you want to read with httpmail?
2010-11-25T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	if you run: sudo lshw -C network   you will see the chip used, the make / model is moot.
2010-11-25T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	you can use the chip make / model to find guides
2010-11-25T23:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	if it's usb based you can use: lsusb   and websearch the 8 character hex id to find guides
2010-11-26T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	boot to root recovery mode and run: passwd foo ,change foo for your username. Reboot and login as foo with the password you set
2010-11-26T01:07:00.000Z	hagus	ActionParsnip	you are a saint!  Thanks very much.
2010-11-26T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	youcan get root recovery by holding shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root
2010-11-26T01:16:00.000Z	hagus	ActionParsnip	Thanks very much - that worked like a dream :)
2010-11-26T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	nice way to fix stuff when it goes mental.
2011-09-23T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	try:  file /usr/bin/\[
2011-10-16T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	in what way?
2011-10-16T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	there are some controls in ccsm
2011-10-23T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	run:  system-config-printing
2011-10-23T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	use TAB to complete the command
2011-10-26T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	is it a data dvd or a video dvd?
2011-10-26T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	then it doesn't need mounting
2011-10-26T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	in VLC you can click file -> play disk
2011-10-26T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hagus	you will have obviously needed to install the DVD decoder
