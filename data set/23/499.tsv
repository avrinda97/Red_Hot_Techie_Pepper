2011-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	thephased		If I install Ubuntu 10.04 and choose to install updates, will any of those updates include a kernel update?
2011-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	thephased		I'm having problems with the kernel in 11.04
2011-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	thephased		so I want to try 10.04
2011-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	thephased		every time i boot
2011-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	thephased		It doesn't hurt to try. Process of elimination
2011-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	thephased		I've searched all around the web for what "net: registered protocol family 1"
2011-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	thephased		actually means
2011-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	thephased		everyone says to just boot acpi=off or maxcpus=1
2011-07-21T06:11:00.000Z	DanaG	thephased	what's the actual problem?
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	DanaG		Is it booting to there and then hanging?
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	thephased		yeah DanaG, just hangs
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	DanaG		Ah.
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	thephased		can i make it bypass the hang?
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	thephased		if i hit a key it will still boot
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	thephased		performance wise there isn't a problem with 11.04 for me
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	DanaG		try booting with "ignore_loglevel debug" instead of "quiet splash"?
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	thephased		yes at least for amd64
2011-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	thephased		ill try that DanaG: thanks
2011-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	thephased	DanaG	if i boot without queit splash will that get rid of the splash screen all together?
2011-07-21T06:14:00.000Z	DanaG		yeah.
2011-07-21T06:14:00.000Z	DanaG		And "ignore_loglevel debug" makes sure it'll show all messages.
2011-07-21T06:14:00.000Z	thephased		oh so it won't make it stop hanging then DanaG?
2011-07-21T06:15:00.000Z	DanaG	thephased	who knows... it might help the hang, but even if it doesn't, it'll let you see what it's doing before the hang.
