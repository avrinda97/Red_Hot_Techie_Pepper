2006-07-04T14:59:00.000Z	tufsy		my ati card only shows 128mb whereas it should be 256 mb
2006-07-04T14:59:00.000Z	tufsy		can someone pls help?#
2006-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	If that is what the xserver config says then just leave it blank and it should use the right amount (unless it is onboard, in which case it usually doesn't have any RAM at all)
2006-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	i have tried to leave xorg.conf blank for mem - but it won't recognise 256mb
2006-07-04T15:02:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	it only shows 128 - but windows shows full 256
2006-07-04T15:02:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	So what? My Radeon 9200 show up as a Radeon Mobility 9000, doesn;t affect the performance though
2006-07-04T15:03:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	yeah but it is not using 256mb ... is it?
2006-07-04T15:03:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	I don;t know. Only one way to test, try a stupidly hungry game
2006-07-04T15:04:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	i ran glxgears but am only getting:
2006-07-04T15:05:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	319 frames in 5.0 seconds = 63.660 FPS
2006-07-04T15:05:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	that's when glxgears is full screen
2006-07-04T15:05:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	You have the right driver set up?
2006-07-04T15:06:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	OpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 Generic
2006-07-04T15:06:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	Well I don;t get the FPS (and it should not be taken as a definitive benchmark) so I don;t know if it is working fully or not
2006-07-04T15:06:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	OpenGL version string: 2.0.5879 (8.26.18)
2006-07-04T15:07:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	try: glxgears -printfps
2006-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	any luck?
2006-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	-printfps doesn't seem to be an option
2006-07-04T15:09:00.000Z	tufsy	Warbo	glxgears -printfps
2006-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	Warbo	tufsy	Doesn;t work (just gives me a list of options like -display and stuff)
