2006-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Chousuke		ages?
2006-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Chousuke		compiling a kernel?
2006-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Chousuke		hardly
2006-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	do you know whether I can compile the kernel on one machine and install it one another?
2006-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	it's possible.
2006-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	is your machine very slow, then?
2006-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	so what should I keep in mind? I intend to follow the CustomKernelBuild wiki page.
2006-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	Chousuke		it takes about 10 minutes to compile a kernel on a 1GHz machine
2006-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	no..not very slow.... just that I have a much faster machine at school that I have access to that I rather use than my own laptop
2006-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	that's all?
2006-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	Chousuke		yeah
2006-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	oh very well then :)
2006-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	Just read the helps on all options and make sure you know what you need to have in your kernel.
2006-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	compile root file system support in statically.
2006-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	indeed.. I am familiar with kernel compilation .. I wanted to add a feature to enhance iptables ...
2006-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	also, make sure you have a way to boot into the old kernel if something goes wrong.
2006-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	ah, okay, then :)
2006-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	so I am going to use the ubuntu kernel itself..
2006-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	and not a vanilla source... from kernel.og or somethng.. thanks for your suggestions !
2006-10-03T14:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	you could make a debian package out of the kernel
2006-10-03T14:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	with make-kpkg
2006-10-03T14:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	hsunda3	it's in the kernel-package package iirc.
2006-10-03T14:01:00.000Z	hsunda3	Chousuke	yes, I think I am going to do that.. with make--kpkg and fakeroot and all that..
