2007-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Ahhh yes.. I've wrestled with udev before..
2007-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	i used udev a bit when i wanted 2 webcams to come up with fixed names
2007-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	i set it to make a symlink for both
2007-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	so id allways have a symlink /dev/3com pointing to the real video device of the cam
2007-10-26T11:46:00.000Z	zcat[1]	clever	yeah.. a friend of mine has four soundcards.. when I upgraded to dapper (iirc) they all started jumping around randomly every reboot. Had to grok udev so we could make them get allocated to /dev/dspx the same order every boot..
2007-10-26T11:46:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	yeah i have the same problem with my 2 sound cards
2007-10-26T11:46:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	been too lazy to fix it in udev so i made a bash script
2007-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	the script simply rmmod's both drivers then loads them back in a fixed order
2007-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	udev loads all drivers in paralel(causing race conditions for the names and faster performance)
2007-10-26T11:57:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	yeah i know how slow it makes things(sync option)
2007-10-26T11:57:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	in linux i can write to an entire floppy in seconds(and the slow part is umount)
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	in winblows it takes several mins(longer because it keeps seeking to the fat table)
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	clever	well, no.. You can dump 1.44M of files to cache really fast.. the slow part is the kernel moving them to floppy when you unmount :)
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	yep
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	but its still faster because the kernel does it in 1 big seq write
2007-10-26T11:59:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	winblow slowly writes to a file,seek,update fat,write to file,seek,update fat....
2007-10-26T11:59:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	causing it to take a great deal longer
2007-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	the vob files can be read normaly BUT the decryption is based on the position of the file on the raw device
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	only root can view that info from the fs layer
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	so most dvd playing progs emulate the whole fs layer in userspace(reading the raw device)
2008-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	but winscp sucks an oddly high ammount of cpu and because of that gets poor transfer rates over 100mbit
2008-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	zcat[1]	clever	encryption overhead? or more than that?
2008-08-15T12:07:00.000Z	clever	zcat[1]	that doesnt explain why scp on linux uses much less cpu and goes much faster
