2012-10-23T03:33:00.000Z	vivid	bekks	name one reason to leave old drivers in the release

2012-10-23T03:36:00.000Z	bekks	vivid	I dont see a "vital" reason there. Some "cool to have it", bbut no vital.

2012-10-23T03:46:00.000Z	vivid	bekks	the answers you give were literally sidestepping the question.  thats not how we make progress
2012-10-23T03:47:00.000Z	bekks	vivid	We're not making progress in providing official packages for bleeding edge drivers, though. And I am out of this discussion at this point.
2012-10-23T03:48:00.000Z	vivid	bekks	theres nothing bleeding about it.
2012-10-23T03:48:00.000Z	vivid	bekks	in fact, you "officially" provide a bleeding/broken driver for quantal
