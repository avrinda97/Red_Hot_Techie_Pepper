2010-03-04T11:03:00.000Z	Flyzoola		thank you, dsnyders
2010-03-04T11:03:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	did that work?
2010-03-04T10:52:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	can you get to telinit 1?
2010-03-04T10:55:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	define telinit 1? I can get past the grub screen (telling me that I need to select OS, giving me the option of Ubuntu recovery, windows xp, and ubuntu generc) and to the splash screen.
2010-03-04T10:57:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	what is telinit 1?
2010-03-04T10:57:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	user mode 1
2010-03-04T11:00:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	do that
2010-03-04T11:01:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	are the steps the same though, even though that's not an ubuntu guide? :o
2010-03-04T11:01:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	yes
2010-03-04T11:02:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	it's in the same screen as where the splash and quiet are right?
2010-03-04T11:02:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	it's in grub...when it loads to grub do that
2010-03-04T11:05:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	I have to restart the PC in order to check. I'm going to try this, as well as anything that dsnyders suggests
2010-03-04T11:06:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	I just dont want to be gone if he finds something that can potentially help me as well :D
2010-03-04T11:06:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	i had that problem just had to go and setup my own xorg.conf in single user mode
2010-03-04T11:10:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	ok, so are there any other steps I need to take after I boot in single mode?
2010-03-04T11:13:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	Alright I'm going to try it! Wish me luck. If nothing happens, I'll be back haha
2010-03-04T11:27:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	lol, that only left me more confused and with less answers than before
2010-03-04T11:28:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	did it keep rebooting?
2010-03-04T11:29:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	check out what it said "minimal bash-like line editing supported" and it told me to press TAB for commands, which I did, and they all looked like chinese to me (I didn't understand what they meant) so I pressed "boot" and it told me "no kernel loaded"
2010-03-04T11:30:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	then you didnt get into the recovery terminal
2010-03-04T11:31:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	I followed the guide exactly as it said. and it did that :o now I can't even access the GRUB menu
2010-03-04T11:44:00.000Z	celthunder	Flyzoola	you can still get in grub..
2010-03-04T11:45:00.000Z	Flyzoola	celthunder	yes, if I wasn't a complete newbie I could. I just simply don't have the time/energy to try to learn all the ins and outs of ubuntu atm. I just need a reliable OS that will work (which neither Ubuntu nor Windows are doing) :/
