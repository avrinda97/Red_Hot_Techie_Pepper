2011-11-25T14:08:00.000Z	SpyderZ		Looking at my graphics adapter and it says Unknownâ€¦anyways to find a driver for my system that will allow my second extended display to work?
2011-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	how is this 2nd display attached? both displays on the same card?
2011-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	It's a laptop with a VGA LCD Monitor hooked up.
2011-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	oh, ok.. well you want to toy with xrandr or something similar then
2011-11-25T14:10:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	generally something like xrandr --output VGA -auto or something.. I forget right now.. its 4am here.. heh see the manpage
2011-11-25T14:11:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	I'm all new to Ubuntu, it's day 1 for me. I'll Google it I guess.
2011-11-25T14:12:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	ah, well typically you can enable it from the monitor prefs gui
2011-11-25T14:34:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	What do I do when Xandr is not a found command?
2011-11-25T14:35:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	its xrandr and just typing that should show you what displays you have
2011-11-25T14:35:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	typically the vga output is called VGA and can be enabled by saying xrandr --output VGA --auto
2011-11-25T14:36:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	Thanks!
2011-11-25T14:36:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	I'm at a loss for how to do that graphically due to ubuntu's crappy unity interface I have little interest in learning to use and it being so much different than plain gnome.. heh.. but the command line tricks are the same on any distro.. ;)
2011-11-25T14:38:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	I tried the command and it says it could not find the VGA and is ignoring it.
2011-11-25T14:38:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	I guess I'm at the dead end of this machine.
2011-11-25T14:38:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	well thats why I said run xrandr first with no arguments, to see what the displays are called, on my netbook for example its VGA1 for some reason
2011-11-25T14:39:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	typically one is called LVDS and one VGA on a notebook.. but it varies
2011-11-25T14:40:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	Thanks, I think this one is coming down to a driver issue, that's why the VGA is not showing up at all in the list.
2011-11-25T14:40:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	well also some notebooks are strange about that and have a fn key to enable it, sometimes it is easiest to just boot with the display connected and have it enabled that way
2011-11-25T14:41:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	there may also be an issue with the driver though.. perhaps you could get further help if you check lspci to figure out what the graphics adapter is, and find out which driver X is using
2011-11-25T14:42:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	The main LCD screen is cracked so I disabled it and left the CRT only option on. Ubuntu boots and it displays on the external monitor at first, but then turns off as it hits the login screen.
2011-11-25T14:44:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	ah.. well that significantly changes things.. heh. I'm no X guru by any means.. but I think if you better explain the problem again using those details someone else might be of better assitance. I personally need to run across the street to the store.. its going on 5am, been up all night and need a lil something.. heh
2011-11-25T14:44:00.000Z	nvz	SpyderZ	I could figure it out, but would have to look up some things after I get back.. which will only be a few min
2011-11-25T14:44:00.000Z	SpyderZ	nvz	Thanks for the help, much appreciated.
