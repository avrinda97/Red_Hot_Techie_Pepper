2009-02-07T05:09:00.000Z	jobless		Hey, can anyone help me with adding startup programs in ubuntu?
2009-02-07T05:10:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	startup meaning from the time the computer starts or from the time you login?
2009-02-07T05:11:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	yes, I added a startup program in ubuntu using system->preferences->session .. the program runs fine, but I cannot redirect the stdout of the program
2009-02-07T05:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	um let me try and see
2009-02-07T05:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	you might just want to put it in .xinitrc
2009-02-07T05:12:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	so I added this line in the sessions /pathtomyprogram/program options > /pathtomylogfile/mylogfile 2>&1 .. I don't see the log :(
2009-02-07T05:13:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	let me try, I'm going to log in and out brb
2009-02-07T05:17:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	I would use ~/.xinitrc instead
2009-02-07T05:17:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	thanks for doing this
2009-02-07T05:18:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	so just add the command to ~/.xinitrc?
2009-02-07T05:18:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	yep :)
2009-02-07T05:19:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	let me try it :) .. oh can I create the file if it doesn't already exist?
2009-02-07T05:19:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	ya, I'm going to try it too just to make sure
2009-02-07T05:20:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	 cool
2009-02-07T05:21:00.000Z	binarymutant		how come .xinitrc doesn't work?
2009-02-07T05:21:00.000Z	binarymutant		do I need to link .xinitrc to .Xsession?
2009-02-07T05:23:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	it didn't work either hang on, .xinitrc works in other distros I use
2009-02-07T05:25:00.000Z	binarymutant		why doesn't .xinitrc work for me? I've linked it to .xsession, what's going on?
2009-02-07T05:27:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	 It did not work for me either, so added it to ~/.profile and made it run in the background. It works!
2009-02-07T05:27:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	.profile aye, well thanks for the help :)
2009-02-07T05:27:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	I still don't understand what happens to the stdout and stderr when the programs are added to the sessions
2009-02-07T05:28:00.000Z	binarymutant	jobless	no clue, but I think it's because the sessions thing doesn't run it from a shell
2009-02-07T05:28:00.000Z	jobless	binarymutant	hmm, maybe they are sent to the endless void called /dev/null ;)
