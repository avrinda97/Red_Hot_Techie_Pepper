2011-07-06T22:06:00.000Z	toothpick		Where can I install mysql-server to make !lamp (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) run?
2011-07-06T22:07:00.000Z	toothpick		err how can I, or where can I get it. something, http://pastebin.com/w64QsMaY apt-get sure as hell isn't working
2011-07-06T22:08:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	did you install LAMP by issueing  sudo tasksel install lamp-server ?
2011-07-06T22:08:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	yes and it says that it depends on mysql-server
2011-07-06T22:10:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	installing lamp-server through tasksel will install all required components. Have you any idea what *is* installed and what is not?
2011-07-06T22:11:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	I've tried, it says $ sudo tasksel install lamp-server
2011-07-06T22:13:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	have you edited your sources.list recently?
2011-07-06T22:13:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	yes to remove a screw up, and afterwords I updated
2011-07-06T22:14:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	did you run 'sudo apt-get update' ?
2011-07-06T22:15:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	ok. Just checking.
2011-07-06T22:16:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	the thing is, the aptitude (100) error often disappears when an extra sudo apt-get update is done
2011-07-06T22:18:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	another one, have you done a   sudo dpkg --configure -a
2011-07-06T22:20:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	you can try that, it'll try to 'reconfigure' any packages that are not in a configured state currently. Anyway there's tons of information on the aptitude 100 error, meaning that the package metadata is not updated.
2011-07-06T22:23:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	 sudo dpkg --configure -a   doesn't do anything
2011-07-06T22:24:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	if it just returns the command prompt, it has run. you're fine. You are sure your source.list don't contain any non-standard repositories?
2011-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	you dualboot with mint?
2011-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	no I fresh installed ubuntu last night, I thought that I had graduated and put on my big boy pants..
2011-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	haha, ok. So the sources.list is completely fresh also
2011-07-06T22:28:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	ok. Are you sure there is no other instance of a packagemanager running?
2011-07-06T22:29:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	how can I check? just to restart?
2011-07-06T22:30:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	well you could do a restart of course, but with the command 'ps' you can search for running processes. For example  ps axuww | grep -i synap   will search for processes such as Synaptic packagemanager
2011-07-06T23:42:00.000Z	toothpick	oCean	I just reformatted and everything installed just fine. so I had screwed something up
2011-07-06T23:44:00.000Z	oCean	toothpick	aha! Good to hear it's fixed. Nice that you came back to tell :)
