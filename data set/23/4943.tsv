2008-05-10T18:38:00.000Z	Jafet		gnome-terminal --working-directory="/home/jafet/arbitrarydirectory" now sets my home directory to ~.
2008-05-10T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	ah wait, it fails if I use "" as well
2008-05-10T18:40:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	sorry, um, that was x-terminal-emulator which I also tried and which also seems to have developed its own quirks.
2008-05-10T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	I imagine it is because cd is a shell built-in
2008-05-10T18:33:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	but it is still a valid "command" is it not?
2008-05-10T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	working directory works fine here by the way
2008-05-10T18:34:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	and for the record --working-directory doesn't work either.
2008-05-10T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	try: gnome-terminal --working-directory=/home
2008-05-10T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	so what isn't working?
2008-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	many things, for example gnome-terminal --working-directory="~/arbitrarydirectory"
2008-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	don't use ~, give the actual path
2008-05-10T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	are you sure what you are typing exists?
2008-05-10T18:39:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	very.
2008-05-10T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	what exactly are you typing so I can try here
2008-05-10T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	erm never mind, I made a typo.  "" seem to work too
2008-05-10T18:41:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	instead of ~, you can use $HOME though if you want a variable
2008-05-10T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	using working-directory instead.  It doesn't accept shell built-ins.  File bugs of coures and submit patches if you want this behavior to change
2008-05-10T18:50:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	would this "child process" of gnome-terminal be bash?
2008-05-10T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	no idea, you'd have to look at the source code
2008-05-10T18:52:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	well, you were right about the absolute pathing.
2008-08-28T16:59:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	it can't open the Applications menu, can it?
2008-08-28T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Jafet	isn't that what alt-f1 does by default?
2008-08-28T17:01:00.000Z	Jafet	jrib	oh, it does.
