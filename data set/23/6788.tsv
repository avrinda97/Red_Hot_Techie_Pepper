2006-01-04T13:20:00.000Z	QMario		If I install the KDE Library on my computer, nothing will happen to it,  right?
2006-01-04T13:21:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	It will happen something.
2006-01-04T13:21:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	It will then have KDE.
2006-01-04T13:21:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	really?
2006-01-04T13:21:00.000Z	Sturgeon		With high probability, yes.
2006-01-04T13:21:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	but I only installed the kdelibs, will it crash?
2006-01-04T13:22:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	Why would it crash?
2006-01-04T13:22:00.000Z	QMario		Strugeon, can GNOME and KDE coexist without problems?
2006-01-04T13:22:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	yes
2006-01-04T13:22:00.000Z	QMario		Have you done it?
2006-01-04T13:23:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	yes. You'll find info about that in the docs
2006-01-04T13:23:00.000Z	QMario		Annibis, were you answering me?
2006-01-04T13:25:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	where do I get the KDE Headers from?
2006-01-04T13:25:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	you can use synaptic to install kde
2006-01-04T13:26:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	will I still be able to use GNOME?
2006-01-04T13:27:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	YES!
2006-01-04T13:27:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	I can't be too careful. ;)
2006-01-04T13:27:00.000Z	QMario	Sturgeon	sorry for the hassle. :'(
2006-01-04T13:28:00.000Z	QMario		Intelikey, I just want the KDE Headers.
2006-01-04T13:29:00.000Z	QMario		Intelikey,  "you've chosen, are no KDE headers installed".
2006-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	QMario		Intelikey, so how will I tell Ubuntu to run GNOME, not KDE?
2006-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	QMario		Intelikey?
2006-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	Sturgeon	QMario	You can choose when you start the session
