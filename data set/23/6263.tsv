2006-07-15T15:32:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	glad to see we are in agreement ;)
2006-07-15T15:33:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	:)
2006-07-15T15:36:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	Ok, no....
2006-12-01T13:53:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	meantime, use the accent and the space bar to get an apostrophe, or define yourself an apostrophe key.
2006-12-01T13:53:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	how do I 'define' an apostrophe?
2006-12-01T13:54:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	I don't know, the need hasn't arisen for me so far.
2006-12-01T13:54:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	You aren multilingual, huh? :D That is okay :3
2006-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	I am, in fact.
2006-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	what languages?
2006-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	that's the attitude.
2006-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	German, English and un peu de French. But we're going offtopic.
2006-12-01T13:56:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	I know :P
2006-12-01T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	not that anyone would be in grave danger of misreading you if you said "espanol", at least on IRC.
2006-12-01T13:56:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	what about the qu and que example?
2006-12-01T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	you've found out how Ubuntu provides for that. Sorry it took you a while.
2006-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	Yes, I know, I just wish I could turn off some accents, but I will ask on the forums :)
2007-02-15T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	are you still looking for advice on removing ubuntu? Or has the desire to fight taken over?
2007-02-15T13:36:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	still would like an explanation...
2007-02-15T13:38:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	boot the desktop CD, open gparted, remove the ubuntu partitions and resize the Windows one to cover the freed space.
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	ok, I heard somewhere you should defrag windows first, is this true?
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	no
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	SonicChao	soundray	ok, thanks :3 I wrote down what you said and will try it when I have free time
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	soundray	SonicChao	it used to be true, when you were downsizing, but not any more
