2010-06-24T03:23:00.000Z	pcp		Hi, does anyone know how to get Network Manager to complete ignore an interface? I've tried setting the iface down in /etc/networking/interfaces, blacklisting module and i cant do this
2010-06-24T03:23:00.000Z	pcp		everytime i load the module the NetworkManager tries to connect using that setup
2010-06-24T03:25:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	maybe set the interface to manual in /etc/networking/interfaces?
2010-06-24T03:26:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	right now i have manual wlan1 down
2010-06-24T03:26:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	ok, and it still shows up?
2010-06-24T03:26:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	yep
2010-06-24T03:27:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	I'm using my internal wifi as my main interface and im using an usb device to run it in monitor mode
2010-06-24T03:28:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	problem is that everytime i load the module for the usb netowrk manager tries to manage it
2010-06-24T03:31:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	I'm doing a little searching...really adding it to the interfaces file should make network manager ignore it...hmmm
2010-06-24T03:32:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	maybe i got the syntax wrong? i have 'manual wlan1 down'
2010-06-24T03:38:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	I think it needs to be something like "iface wlan1 down"
2010-06-24T03:39:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	maybe it's "iface wlan1 manual"
2010-06-24T03:39:00.000Z	Bob3		"down"
2010-06-24T03:39:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	let me try that
2010-06-24T03:39:00.000Z	Bob3		k
2010-06-24T03:40:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	I'm not expert at the /etc/network/interfaces file...man interfaces might help
2010-06-24T03:40:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	ty
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	i will look at more doc
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	just wanted to make sure i was on the right way
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	Bob3	pcp	np..glad I could be of assistance
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	Bob3		sure
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	since first attempts with /network/interfaces didnt work
2010-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	pcp	Bob3	ty
