2012-01-13T01:20:00.000Z	haylo		yeah that ssd is for root so your programs run faster
2012-01-13T01:20:00.000Z	haylo		that home folder is just a directory- you can stick it anywhere really
2012-01-13T01:22:00.000Z	haylo		type "adobe" in software center amt0101
2012-01-13T01:23:00.000Z	haylo		yeah i have accidently installed that adobe pdf reader lol
2012-01-13T01:23:00.000Z	haylo		man i was pissed
2012-01-13T01:23:00.000Z	haylo		yeah dont use chrome
2012-01-13T01:24:00.000Z	haylo		well chromium is fine but dont use google chrome
2012-01-13T01:25:00.000Z	haylo		it is called chromium-browser in apt-get, you need to enable backports repo i think
2012-01-13T01:25:00.000Z	haylo		maybe its in the software center though, im not sure
2012-01-13T01:25:00.000Z	haylo		yeah chromium is real fast
2012-01-13T01:25:00.000Z	pp7	haylo	faster than google-chrome?
2012-01-13T01:26:00.000Z	haylo		for linux i would say yes
2012-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	haylo	Danno7	i use 11.04 for that reason
2012-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	haylo		i think the next long term ubuntu release will be similiar to 11.04 not .10
2012-01-13T01:28:00.000Z	haylo		that is a fine way to go Danno7
2012-01-13T01:29:00.000Z	haylo	Danno7	i noticed xfce isnt in the repos anymore you will have to search for a good repo that has it. open your software sources and add it
2012-01-13T01:30:00.000Z	haylo		yeah if you get 40 in windows there is no  hope for graphics in linux as that 40 is obtained by a special integrated driver
2012-01-13T01:32:00.000Z	haylo		growl just dual boot leave wins for your games. i wont run anything but linux- if it doesnt work than i just dont get to use it
2012-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	haylo		you are a linux user growl, i can tell because you want it.
2012-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	haylo		you will get it eventually
2012-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	haylo		you just need some different hardware
2012-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	haylo		:)
2012-01-13T01:34:00.000Z	pp7	haylo	i get the same problem with chromium :(
