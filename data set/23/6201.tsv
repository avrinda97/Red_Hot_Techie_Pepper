2007-04-18T10:17:00.000Z	peepsalot		does anyone know what role the metacity process plays, verses Xorg?  where does the actual window rendering happen?
2007-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	  try looking metacity and xwindows in wikipedia , the defs are pretty decent
2007-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	  sudo cp
2007-05-05T09:29:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	 just pluggin it in should automount it , or maybe you need to put a cd in for it to mount
2007-05-05T09:29:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	i need to run a LiveCD from it
2007-05-05T09:30:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	it boots the liveCD, but eventually it wants to configure the CD Drive
2007-05-05T09:30:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	I don't understand why, it works enough to get it to that point
2007-05-05T09:30:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	 ah ,  I donT' know about that ,  try checking in the forum
2007-05-31T08:16:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	what is your videocard ?
2007-05-31T08:16:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	via unichrome pro onboard
2007-05-31T08:16:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	errrr.....
2007-05-31T08:17:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	you think it might be the drivers?
2007-05-31T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	try menu > system > admin > restricted drivers see if one is available, if not play around with the settings in system > prefs> fonts
2007-05-31T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	 in the font dialog box you can play aournd with the subpixel order in the details screen
2007-06-01T05:40:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	you need to copy the url and use the stand alone mplayer to view it,   and the video isnT' worth it,  just a line of wave on a lake
2007-06-01T05:40:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	yeah, i figured it's probably a dumb vid, but i have had this problem before
2007-06-01T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	streaming from tv network sites never seem to work well from me in the browser
2007-06-01T05:41:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	i stopped it, then tried playing again and then it worked for some reason.  but at first, it looked like it kept starting over loading the file every 2 seconds
2007-06-01T05:42:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	 that's pretty much what I get with those kinds of stream
2008-04-10T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	  you also need the -pluggin package
2008-04-10T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	in backport ,  make sure it is enalbed,   just search for java and browse until you find the -plugin one
2008-04-10T06:36:00.000Z	peepsalot	Pelo	 backport? what is that?
2008-04-10T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	peepsalot	one of the repos,  close synaptic,  open  Menu > system > admin > software sources,  check all the boxes on the first tab and all the boxes on the third tab as well , reload,   open synaptic and search
