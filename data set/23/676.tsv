2012-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	luckysmack		anyone know how I can fix apt-get in 12.04 ? my router crashed when installing java, and now i cant install or recover apt-get. http://bpaste.net/show/6JksJM2aZVpv6dgyN9zT/
2012-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	tried "apt-get install -f"?
2012-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	yea tried that. did some stiff but didnt work.
2012-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	what errors are you getting?
2012-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	i pasted them in my link. but closing and reopening the terminal after those were run, seems to have fixed it.
2012-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	good! :)
2012-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	try to uninstall the package that's causing the issue (using -f)
2012-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	you have a stale aptitude process
2012-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	look for any aptitude processes using ps
2012-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	then kill that sucker :)
2012-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	some proc is using that config.dat. lsof|grep <whatever> file and see if that process is something that should be running
2012-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	kill -9 <pid>
2012-09-15T10:08:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	`lsof | grep config.dat` doesnt come up with any results
2012-09-15T10:09:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	kill -9 pid killed aptitude, but still same error.
2012-09-15T10:09:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	tried to uninstall the package you were trying to install?
2012-09-15T10:13:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	sudo apt-get remove --purge man-db
2012-09-15T10:13:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	it's getting stuck at that point
2012-09-15T10:19:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	running `sudo apt-get remove --purge man-db` will uninstall my ubuntu-desktop and a lot of other things. : gnome-user-guide* man-db* ubuntu-desktop* ubuntu-docs* ubuntu-standard* yelp*
2012-09-15T10:19:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	wow, use dpkg instead
2012-09-15T10:21:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	dpkg -r
2012-09-15T10:25:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	tried the -f flag?
2012-09-15T10:25:00.000Z	luckysmack	daklan	aptitude install -f  ? yea i have
2012-09-15T10:29:00.000Z	daklan	luckysmack	i'd do a dpkg -rf man-db, but i'd make sure it doesn't take the other dependent packages with it
