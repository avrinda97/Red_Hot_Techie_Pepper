2008-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	Starfish		I'm a bit confused as to why entering a command in a terminal works, but using the same shortcut in one of the drop-down menus doesn't do anything ?
2008-02-18T09:24:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	What is acting oddly on the menu, but fine in cli?
2008-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	methinks you need to do: ruby /home/user/.rubyripper/rubyripper_gtk2.rb
2008-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: I tried that as well, same effect
2008-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Did you try it with quotes?
2008-02-18T09:27:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: quotes don't change it
2008-02-18T09:27:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	as in ruby "/home/user/etc" or "ruby /home/user/etc" I'm not sure which one does it, but one of them should...
2008-02-18T09:28:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: the first has no effect, the second gives an error as the file doesn't exist
2008-02-18T09:28:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Quotes change how it's read when you click. Like for me, to run WoW from a shortcut, I have to tell it: wine "/home/me/WoW/WoW.exe" --opengl
2008-02-18T09:29:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: yeh, I know, everything inside the quotes is read as one parameter
2008-02-18T09:29:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Hmm...so you have ruby installed, but it's not working by calling on ruby...hmmm...
2008-02-18T09:29:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: I'll enumerate that it does work from a command-line
2008-02-18T09:29:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: my nautilus is non-functional, that might have something to do with it, I'm not sure
2008-02-18T09:29:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Hmmm....and you don't need to do a ./ to run it, or even a "run" command?
2008-02-18T09:30:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: executing from a command-line via '/home/user/...' or 'ruby /home/user/...' both work fine
2008-02-18T09:30:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Because genereally, I can't get ANYTHING to run cli without telling it ./ or run or sh or python etc.
2008-02-18T09:30:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Okay, that's farqed up. ruby "/home/user/.." should work fine then.
2008-02-18T09:31:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: yeh, it doesn't
2008-02-18T09:31:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Okay, here's a weird attempt to try...
2008-02-18T09:34:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	So what happened when you used ALT+F2 and ran it?
2008-02-18T09:34:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: it doesn't do anything visible
2008-02-18T09:34:00.000Z	Starfish	Ghost|BTFH	:: how can I make the terminal stay open if I've run it via alt-f2 ?
2008-02-18T09:43:00.000Z	Ghost|BTFH	Starfish	Find the issue?
