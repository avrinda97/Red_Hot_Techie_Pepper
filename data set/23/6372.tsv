2006-04-30T09:45:00.000Z	steel		does elder scrolls work in cedega?
2006-04-30T09:45:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Morrowind should...you'll have to check their site to see if Oblivion's working yet
2006-04-30T09:46:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	I will say, even if it is, you're better off dual booting for this one game...it's worth it entirely

2006-04-30T10:08:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Shouldn't need it
2006-04-30T09:53:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	I've used captive a bit, and I've never had problems with it...just a liability thing. Same as any alpha software
2006-04-30T10:03:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Nah. We can help!
2006-04-30T10:04:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	apt-get install samba, then go to...something. Hold on =P
2006-04-30T10:05:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Once you've got samba installed, right click a folder, select Sharing..., select samba, and wotk from there
2006-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Make sure it's on the same domain/workgroup
2006-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Whatever you want =) It's a personal thing
2006-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Try sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2006-04-30T10:11:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Oh, yeah, you actually needa make a share, too =P
2006-04-30T10:11:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Make sure you actually have a folder shared
2006-04-30T10:12:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	System>Administration>Shared Folders
2006-04-30T10:30:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Probably something along the lines of /etc/init.d/proftpd
2006-04-30T10:31:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	/etc/init.d/xinted restart, then
2006-04-30T10:32:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	/etc/init.d/inted restart, then =)
2006-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Really? inetd should be installed...
2006-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Yeah, check through the config file...probably a setting in there
2006-04-30T10:37:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	That just means it runs independant of inetd or xinetd. It's what you want
2006-04-30T10:42:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Glad to help =)
2006-04-30T10:50:00.000Z	DarkElf109	steel	Sorry, I haven't configured FTP in a while...
