2012-10-05T21:59:00.000Z	Westz		okay, does anyone here run, or know a lot about, Asus 1215n or Optimus/ION2?
2012-10-05T22:01:00.000Z	Westz		i've got an Asus 1215n with Lucid that has an Intel 6230 wireless/bluetooth combo card. i can't connect to the internet however, not even with an ethernet cable
2012-10-05T22:03:00.000Z	Westz		What packages are necessary to get an Asus 1215n or an Intel 6230 wireless/bluetooth combo card connected to the internet
2012-10-05T22:03:00.000Z	Westz		*?
2012-10-05T22:04:00.000Z	Westz		my ethernet connection isn't showing up at all. as if i never plugged it in. it works perfectly in wondoze.
2012-10-05T22:04:00.000Z	Westz		and the 6230 card isn't active. no drivers whatsoever.
2012-10-05T22:05:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	you need to see if the card is detected or not.  is it built into the mb? do you just have the one NIC?
2012-10-05T22:06:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	sounds like you have two nics.  one built-in, one which you added.
2012-10-05T22:07:00.000Z	Westz	thufir_	yes. one is a mini ci-e card, one is the built in ethernet
2012-10-05T22:08:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	not sure the details, but modprob can show you which modules the kernel loads.  you might need to add some modules and reboot.
2012-10-05T22:10:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	this might help: http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration
2012-10-05T22:12:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	actually, not, nm.
2012-10-05T22:17:00.000Z	Westz	thufir_	any ideas? i just popped a USB wireless card in and it's working, so i can download packages, but i don't know what i need; this laptop has only ever known windoze 7
2012-10-05T22:25:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	all I know is that modprobe can fix this for you.  if you restate your question, a more knowledgeable person may help.
2012-10-05T23:42:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	I wonder if authentication refers to that, err, "secure computing" or something which microsoft touts?
2012-10-05T23:42:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	security built into the motherboard to prevent mucking with the OS...?
2012-10-05T23:43:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	I think you have the wrong module. but that's just a guess.
2012-10-05T23:44:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	oooh, yeah, don't do that!  why are you doing that!?
2012-10-05T23:46:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD  I use lxde.  be aware that I'm also mucking about with codecs and drivers precisely because I don't want to use whatever GUI regulular ubuntu uses.
2012-10-05T23:47:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	that minimal cd allows that easily.
2012-10-05T23:48:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	sure.  I don't think another distro would magically pick up the driver for your NIC better magically, just something *newer* might do the trick.
2012-10-05T23:53:00.000Z	Westz	thufir_	it's the issue that i know how to update better with Arch. if i just need a newer kernel because it's got the mods i need, i can do that with Arch.
2012-10-05T23:53:00.000Z	thufir_	Westz	ubuntu does the same update thing, by the way.  ok, well, good luck :)
