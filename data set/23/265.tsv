2012-02-14T02:45:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	 you can do cp -r /home/username /home/newusername
2012-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	make a new user, then move your files over to that?
2012-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	it's that easy??
2012-02-14T02:39:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	on my system I have home on a sepperate partition, so if I reinstall linux I can just mount that partition to home. but in your case it might be easier to just make a new user and cp files that you need
2012-02-14T02:41:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	that is quite brilliant. I think I will setup similar to that after this. could you by chance tell me if "everything" will be the same in the new user?
2012-02-14T02:44:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	would flags would be good with cp for this? cp -r? cp -f -r?
2012-02-14T02:45:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	thankyou so much for the excellent idea of having home on a seperate partition.
2012-02-14T02:45:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	and you may need to edit a few files. don't over write files in the new user's directory unless you know its ok to do so
2012-02-14T02:46:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	excellent! thank-you so much!
2012-02-14T02:46:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	ooo yeh, any way I can skip those?
2012-02-14T02:49:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	 you can use the -u flag to only update missing files in the new user's home
2012-02-14T02:49:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	 you can stop something in the terminal by "ctrl c"
2012-02-14T02:50:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	this was from nautilus I think
2012-02-14T02:50:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	oh. I don't use nautilus so I"m not sure
2012-02-14T02:51:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	it's no longer a problem, I force quit it from system monitor phewww! :)
2012-02-14T02:52:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	okay then, as per your & Innxis instructions I will use cp -ru thanks again for your help. :)
2012-02-14T03:03:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	I'm using "cp -urv /root /home/zillow and it is making a directory labeled root in zillow.
2012-02-14T03:03:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	you shouldn't need to copy over root. just your own users files
2012-02-14T03:04:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	I've been in root
2012-02-14T03:10:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	& zykotic10, thank-you so much for your help in this but is there any reason why a directory labeled root would be being put in phase? "cp -urv /root/ /home/phase"
2012-02-14T03:12:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	you copied /root to your home directory. taht is why. you don't need /root in that line. ONLY /home/phase
2012-02-14T03:12:00.000Z	Zillow	meskarune	okay, so I only need the destination then?
2012-02-14T03:13:00.000Z	meskarune	Zillow	to copy from one user's home to another do this: "cp -urv /home/username /home/newusername
