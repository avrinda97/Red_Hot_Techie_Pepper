2007-10-01T09:12:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	prob sun-java6-jre tbh
2007-10-01T09:12:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	its in my repo, and its what he/she prob wants
2007-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	i think I accidentally directed towards the responder, sry :)
2007-10-01T09:29:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	like...hosting?
2007-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	no
2007-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	Nero works pretty well.
2007-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	but you have to pay for it ;)
2007-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	Well, you have to admit, that even though the name Linux specifically referrs to the kernel, we use the word to describe much more.  We use the word Linux to describe the entire operating system and all the various OpenSource apps.
2007-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	yep
2007-10-04T10:29:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	well, Firestarter is just frontend, iptables is the magic :P
2007-10-04T10:31:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	sure it is, it lets me control what happens to the packets that flow into the interfaces
2007-10-04T10:35:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	i think he needs to reinstall nvidia-glx
2007-10-04T10:39:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	so could you explain how iptables is not a firewall? all the stuff I'm looking at seems to say that
2007-10-04T10:42:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	Well, it's like this;  You can build firewall rules with iptables.  In fact, it is almost exclusivly through the use of iptables that software firewalls are built.
2007-10-04T10:42:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	true
2007-10-04T10:43:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	The term firewall can be used to describe a software firewall or a hardware firewall and there is a difference with a distinction.
2007-10-04T10:43:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	I'm aware
2007-10-04T10:46:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	Iptable rules implements a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack and allows us to re-direct and network packets.
2007-10-04T10:47:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	gotcha
2007-10-04T10:48:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	Firestarter is an example of a firewall application, a software firewall application, and it is a GUI application that will write iptables rules, load those rules into the running kernel for you, and also wites them to a script so that they are loaded each time you start your computer.
2007-10-04T10:49:00.000Z	scguy318	usr13	got it, thanks for the info
2007-10-04T10:51:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	One more detail.  You can build a custom hardware firewall on your own OR, you can download a Firewall distribution like Ipcop, monowall, smothwall,   etc.
2007-10-04T10:52:00.000Z	usr13	scguy318	The above are examples of "stand alone"  "hardware" "NAT" firewalls.
