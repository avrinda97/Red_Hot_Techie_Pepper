2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	cjae		how do I search executables because its not in my usr/bin'
2007-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	dpkg -L packagename | grep bin, perhaps
2007-08-20T12:19:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	nothing
2007-08-20T12:20:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	did you substitute the right package name?  try dropping the pipe to grep
2007-08-20T12:23:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	nothing
2007-08-20T12:26:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	in synaptic, check the installed files tab of the package's properties
2007-08-20T12:29:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	it's in /usr/games, which might not be in your path
2007-08-20T12:29:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	kinda figured wasn't on path
2007-08-20T12:30:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	where does the info come from under the properties installed files tab
2007-08-20T12:30:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	it's the output of dpkg -L
2007-08-20T12:30:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	causethe files it has listed
2007-08-20T12:31:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	there are more on my box when using slocate
2007-08-20T12:31:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	opps locate
2007-08-20T12:31:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	that doesn't mean much
2007-08-20T12:35:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	that's a fine idea.  you could also just put a launcher for the game somewhere in your desktop environment
2007-08-20T12:36:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	want add it too applications drop down games but using xubuntu and is had to manipulate the apps menu
2007-08-20T12:36:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	hard
2007-08-20T12:37:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	I don't think it's as hard as you think it is, but it's been a while since I've used Xfce, so I can't help you with that
2007-08-20T12:37:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	never added anyhting to path before...
2007-08-20T12:37:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	sorry annoying
2007-08-20T12:39:00.000Z	kriebz	cjae	use Google to look into methods for editing Xfce menus or setting your path in bash
2007-08-20T12:40:00.000Z	cjae	kriebz	thanks
