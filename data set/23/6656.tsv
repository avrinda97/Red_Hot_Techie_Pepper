2007-05-22T13:51:00.000Z	Enverex		Are the FGLRX drivers on the Feisty install CD itself? (as it has a mini-repo on it)
2007-05-22T13:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	why not take a look at the cd?
2007-05-22T13:52:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	Because I'm trying to limit movement right now, heh
2007-05-22T05:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	have you installed the cpufreqd applet? that will show your MHz
2007-05-22T05:33:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	It says my processor doesn't support Scaling, which it obviously does, which makes me think I'm missing a kernel module or app
2007-05-22T05:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	is C2D based on the Pmobile's scaling or something different? my mobile scales out of the box
2007-05-22T05:35:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	Erm, no idea, It's a Core 2 Duo T7200 and idles at 1Ghz in Windows.

2007-05-22T05:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	maybe

2007-05-23T07:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	I'd be insstalling smartmontools about now - it might be just one bad sector, more likely the disk's on the way out
2007-05-23T07:06:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	... it's a DVD drive
2007-05-23T07:07:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	I've spent the last hour trying to make the damn OS play DVDs rather than actually watching one and now it's 2am :(
2007-05-23T07:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	google for the 'make/model + linux' - maybe there's a fix
2007-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	What's the easiest way of seeing the model from inside Linux? dmesg is flooded with those messages :/
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	sudo lshw | less
2007-05-23T15:23:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	Already been through those
2007-05-23T15:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	w32codecs ?
2007-05-23T15:25:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	It's an x86_64 machine but I have w64codecs installed
2007-05-23T15:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	it's libdvdcss2 btw
2007-05-23T15:26:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	Yeah, that's installed too
2007-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Enverex	if you follow that guide, your dvd will work
2007-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	Enverex	Frogzoo	I have and it doesn't
