2009-03-19T00:00:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	USB microphone?
2009-03-19T00:01:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	you need to explicitly choose it, that's all
2009-03-19T00:03:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	Preferences -> Sound
2009-03-19T00:03:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	This will let you explicitly choose which devices for playback and recording
2009-03-19T00:05:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	if you type the first few letters of my nickname then press TAB it should autocomplete for you =]
2009-03-19T00:05:00.000Z	lycan	Geek`N`Proud`	 here im
2009-03-19T00:11:00.000Z	lycan	Geek`N`Proud`	hey someone can help me with my microphone because i really don't want to go back to vista
2009-03-19T00:12:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	did you have any luck with the sound settings?
2009-03-19T00:13:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	is the webcam built into the computer?
2009-03-19T00:14:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	it could be one that isn't supported in the kernel included with 8.10
2009-03-19T00:15:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	it's two separate subsystems. sound and video are cleanly separated in GNU/Linux
2009-03-19T00:15:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	my advice is to ask in the forums, as it's too fast-paced in here to give detailed help
2009-03-19T00:15:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	try ubuntuforums.org
2009-03-19T00:17:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	it's not all Bill Gates.. it's the hardware manufacturers.. I don't know if you've seen the hype around OpenSolaris - but that has proprietary-only drivers for most things too
2009-03-19T00:17:00.000Z	Geek`N`Proud`	lycan	Linux makes it very hard for proprietary drivers to be usable for any period of time though (that's almost by design!)
