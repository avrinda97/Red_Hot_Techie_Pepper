2005-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	_blue		its like this
2005-04-05T15:23:00.000Z	_blue		computer---wired--->router {wrt54g}----wireless--->main router---wired {modem}
2005-04-05T15:23:00.000Z	_blue		it works on ANY linux distro as long as it supports your wired NIC
2005-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	_blue		the only hackable firmware out there is for htelinksys
2005-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	_blue		its just a wired connection to a router and wirelessly to the other router
2005-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	_blue		you need TWO routers for it to work
2005-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	_blue		its like connecting a usb cable to a wireless adapter like the linksys wusb11
2005-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	_blue		except the adapter is bigger and the cable is variable, so you can maximize range and speed
2005-04-05T15:26:00.000Z	_blue		it essentially works OUTTA THE BOX for any distro you try as long as it supports your NIC
2005-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	_blue		can anyone point me to a multiboot tutorial for ubuntu, specifically using lilo to triple boot mandrake, xp, and ubuntu
2005-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	_chavo	_blue	do you have xp and mandrake installed already?
2005-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	_blue	_chavo	yes...
2005-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	_chavo		have you installed ubuntu?
2005-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	_blue		does the ncurses ubuntu installer require you to install THEIR bootloader?
2005-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	_blue	_chavo	no i just got my ubuntu cd's
2005-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	_chavo	_blue	it will set up grub for you.
2005-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	_blue		leejunfan: so i have to use the entire install in expert mode?
2005-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	_blue		or i have to do just that section in expert mode
2005-04-05T15:31:00.000Z	_chavo	_blue	I have mandrake and xp on this box, and the installer set up grub for me. well it was the kubutu installer.
2005-04-05T15:31:00.000Z	_chavo		I'm not sure if lilo is even on the cd's
2005-04-05T15:31:00.000Z	_blue	_chavo	so kubuntu just lets you triple boot?
2005-04-05T15:31:00.000Z	_blue		automatically?
2005-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	_chavo	_blue	yes and then some
