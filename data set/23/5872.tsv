2006-08-24T05:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	you can move your home dir to another partition
2006-08-24T05:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	yes, why not?
2006-08-24T05:46:00.000Z	shaantanu	erUSUL	that wont mess up my existing install ??
2006-08-24T05:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	no you have to copy de data to the new partition and then add an entry in fstab for that partition
2006-08-24T05:48:00.000Z	shaantanu	erUSUL	I m quite a n00b to understand that
2006-08-24T05:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	well i do not know how to explain it better... You copy the data that is under home/ to the new partition and then add this new partition to /etc/fstab and tell it to mount under /home.
2006-08-24T05:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	take a look at my fstab to see what i mean i have three main partitions for my system... / /boot and /home
2006-08-24T05:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	i found a how to in the web http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/
2006-08-24T05:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	making this is worth if it is the files under home the ones that takes most of the space of course. du -hs /home to see
2006-08-24T05:59:00.000Z	shaantanu	erUSUL	u there ??
2006-08-24T05:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	yes
2006-08-24T06:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	take a look at the how to i gave you... http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/
2006-08-24T06:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	there you can see the entire process explained
2006-08-24T06:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	shaantanu	no problem
