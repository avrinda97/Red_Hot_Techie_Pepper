2009-09-02T08:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	well  yeah,  unless  kingjames  wants the faster booting Ext4 or something
2009-09-02T08:09:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	seeing he doesn't understand what no root system is I decided to lead him into the install the easiest way possible so that he can get Ubuntu running and have a play :)
2009-09-02T08:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	yes I already know :)    since used    Linux  since 2004, but yeah he doesnt know
2009-09-02T08:17:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	I would recommend that he installs the OS with the minimal complication, gparted will bork his windows partition if he clicks the wrong button
2009-09-02T08:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	well if he applys
2009-09-02T08:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	something silly
2009-09-02T08:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	yeah  I  was just thinking, gparted can probably be skipped, plus he is saying it closes on him
2009-09-02T08:19:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	You are not there with him, DON'T get him doing potentially dangerous stuff... Remember when you first started... I know I started with the standard install
2009-09-02T08:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	want to help him instead?   I want to go away from computer soon anyway
2009-09-25T11:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	he got banned by the looks of it
2009-09-25T11:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	or someone did
2010-06-08T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	see above at bot
2010-06-08T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	give it a try even, nice app
2010-06-08T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	there are quite a few apps in the repo with Tux though, that are really for kids
2010-06-08T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	they are good also
2010-06-08T07:56:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	thanks, got it running, very neat... but rather hard in the higher levels :)
2010-06-08T07:57:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	Thanks shall have a look
2010-06-08T07:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	whilst on about Tux apps though, Tuxpaint is rather nice :)
2010-06-08T07:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	an theres supertux kart or wahtever raceing game and  so on
2010-06-09T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	9.04 is a lovely release, still supported untill the end of October :)  and 10.10 comes out on the 10th October, so if going to do a clean install, may as well wait untill that
2010-06-09T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mechdave	also you got 1GB RAM, thats enough RAM to  virtual machine try 10.04 :)
2010-06-09T04:53:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	I have him trying 10.04, just showing him docs for partitioning from 7.04 so he can get an idea of what is going on
2010-06-09T04:53:00.000Z	mechdave	sebsebseb	I have also shown him the install guide for 10.04
