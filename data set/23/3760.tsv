2008-01-28T19:14:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		and what if i dont run it?
2008-01-28T19:15:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		then is there a coomand to explicitly tell mail x to use my isp's mail server?
2008-01-28T19:16:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		nik@dell:~$ mail -s "hello friend" nikos1337@gmail.com [use that isp]
2008-01-28T19:16:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		so a comamnd like the above isnt implemented in mailx i guess
2008-01-28T19:18:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		which one do i want?
2008-01-28T19:18:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		i ema new to linxu dont ask me to amke choices!
2008-01-28T19:19:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		iam oming from xp :)
2008-01-28T19:20:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		let me see tha analogy here
2008-01-28T19:20:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		mailx for linux is what outlokk express is for windows ?
2008-01-28T19:20:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		iam tryign to analogically understand things
2008-01-28T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	no, evolution is about as close to outlook express as it gets - calendar is setup differently
2008-01-28T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	mailx is a CLI mail client
2008-01-28T19:22:00.000Z	Nik0la0s	Gnea	i need a way to be able to send maisl from commandl line
2008-01-28T19:22:00.000Z	Nik0la0s	Gnea	great!
2008-01-28T19:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	you might also want to check out mutt
2008-01-28T19:22:00.000Z	Nik0la0s	Gnea	but as folsk here told me this mailx xleint doenst use by default some mail server to actually sent the mail
2008-01-28T19:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	you'd need to setup your MTA separately (exim, sendmail, qmail, etc)
2008-01-28T19:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	yes.
2008-01-28T19:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	yes - the user agent takes care of forumulating and reading the emails, the mail server (aka MTA) takes care of actually transporting the email to/from the system itself
2008-01-28T19:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	yup
2008-01-28T19:34:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	you are correct.
2008-01-28T19:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	'server' is ambiguous - it means one thing in a sense, and something else in another
2008-01-28T19:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Nik0la0s	the MTA usually dumps the email in an mbox file and the MUA reads from that file
