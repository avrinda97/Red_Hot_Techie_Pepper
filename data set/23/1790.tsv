2010-03-15T16:13:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Friend, just go to Synaptic, and search for Flash Plugin installer there,
2010-03-15T16:15:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Which version are you using? 9.10?
2010-03-15T16:16:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Ok, then download the package from http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=flashplugin-nonfree
2010-03-15T16:16:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Or, you can get it from Software Centre too
2010-03-15T16:17:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Search for "Ubuntu restricted areas" in Software centre and install it
2010-03-15T16:18:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	That will do it,
2010-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Yes, they will keep on asking. Just install the Restricted extras, that will do
2010-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	psychuil	rocket16	where do i search for it?
2010-03-15T16:23:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	In software centre. Search for Ubuntu restricted extras and install it. Or, try "sudo apt-get install nspluginwrapper"
2010-03-15T16:23:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Got it?
2010-03-15T16:24:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	That means you have some other process using the installer. Ok, restart the Computer and then install ubuntu restricted extras
2010-03-15T16:25:00.000Z	psychuil	rocket16	that was the synaptic, i closed it and got another error
2010-03-15T16:25:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	I recommend, simply restart, connect to internet again, and then install ubuntu restricted extras
2010-03-15T16:26:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	This is the easiest way, to me,
2010-03-15T16:26:00.000Z	psychuil	rocket16	if i try to install it via the software center it says "not available in the current data"
2010-03-15T16:29:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	You need to start Multiverse and universe support
2010-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Ok, open Software centre, then go to edit menu, and select Software sources.
2010-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Then check all the boxes in the dialogue box, especially the two containing "universe" and "multiverse"
2010-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Started successfully?
2010-03-15T16:33:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	That was downloading the new data,
2010-03-15T16:33:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	Now, it will start,
2010-03-15T16:35:00.000Z	rocket16	psychuil	After the downloading, just install the restricted extras from software centre, and that will do
2010-03-15T16:35:00.000Z	psychuil	rocket16	already doing that
