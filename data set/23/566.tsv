2011-06-03T20:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	FernandoTertiary	When the automic update tool has a lock, you get this problem

2011-06-03T20:25:00.000Z	FernandoTertiary	schnuffle	it reads the same thing in the Terminal
2011-06-03T20:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	FernandoTertiary	normally it asks you if you want to upgrade the packages and you can accept with yes
2011-06-03T20:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	FernandoTertiary	can you paste the output
2011-06-03T20:27:00.000Z	FernandoTertiary	schnuffle	yes, then it stops with a /tmp location, then suggests "end" then posteri pressing "s" it reads "log file: "
