2006-08-17T10:16:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		hey
2006-08-17T10:17:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		i have a really n00b question, involving how to see my windows partition on my hdd from a ubuntu live cd? can anyone help?
2006-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	you want to add a line to /etc/fstab like this: /dev/hda2       /media/hda2     ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1 , then mount -a
2006-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	have a look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-08-17T10:20:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	thanks 1680x1050 was not one of the live cd default options =/
2006-08-17T10:21:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	i can't find fstab in etc, maybe because its a live cd?
2006-08-17T10:22:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	if it's not already there you should be safe to "touch /etc/fstab" then edit it
2006-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	it says permission denied, when i try to touch it, whats the command to change permissions (sorry i'm really a linux n00b)
2006-08-17T10:25:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	what dose touch do, the command ran but nothign really happened
2006-08-17T10:27:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	chmod 777 filename
2006-08-17T10:27:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	777?
2006-08-17T10:28:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	ok
2006-08-17T10:30:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	i can't save file chagnes cause it's a live cd =//....
2006-08-17T10:31:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	if i were to copy the contents of the cd to an external hdd and set the bios to boot to usb would that work?
2006-08-17T10:32:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	there is a way of using usb with the live CD, my best advice is go to a bookshop and look in "Ubuntu Hacks" from O'reilly, take your camera
2006-08-17T10:33:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	I can guarantee it's not a purchase you will regret ;-)
2006-08-17T10:56:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	good chance
2006-08-17T10:57:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	fat32 is more portable, for the future
2006-08-17T10:59:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	DanaG, the partition im moving is fat32, but the drive i was going to move it to is ntfs =/
2006-08-17T11:00:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	is the ntfs partition blank?
2006-08-17T11:00:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	yes
2006-08-17T11:01:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	chaddy	when im done is linux able to format it back to an ntfs? im borrowing it
2006-08-17T11:02:00.000Z	chaddy	Jamminpotato	you might want Hiren's boot disk to return it to ntfs
