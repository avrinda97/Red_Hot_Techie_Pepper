2009-12-12T20:32:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	thank you
2009-12-12T20:32:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	it doesnt tell me what slot it uses (PCI/AGP or whatever)?
2009-12-12T20:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	maybe "sudo lshw" or "sudo dmidecode"
2009-12-12T20:33:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	ok thakn you
2009-12-12T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	look at the complete lspci output
2009-12-12T20:40:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	ok thanks
2009-12-12T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	you should see something like 00:01.0 PCI bridge: ALi Corporation PCI Express Root Port
2009-12-12T20:41:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	does this mean that i REALLY have a PCI-e slot: 00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82G33/G31/P35/P31 Express PCI Express Root Port (rev 02)
2009-12-12T20:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	yep; you can consult the otherboard manual too (online)
2009-12-12T20:43:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	do I need to consult the otherboard manual if I have this PCI Express thing listed? i mean, can i allready be sure that i have an PCI-e thingy on my mainboard?
2009-12-12T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	i would be sure
2009-12-12T20:47:00.000Z	freaky[t]	erUSUL	ok thank you very much ;D ill order my christmas present now then ;DD
2010-10-12T19:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	freaky[t]	find out what xchat uses ( aspell; ispell another program) then install the dict ( i.e. aspell-de )
