2007-04-06T05:41:00.000Z	Andrew250		I'm just trying to create a good Ext3 partition.  I know PartitionMagic can but it's called a Linux Ext3 and I'm worried about using it with XP.
2007-04-06T05:43:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	It is just tring to frighten you away from it. Windows can read/write to linux partitions.
2007-04-06T05:44:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	For the driver, see pm from ubotu.
2007-04-06T05:46:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Yes.
2007-04-06T05:47:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Like ubotu said, you will need a driver. http://www.fs-driver.org
2007-04-06T05:49:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	After. Or before. Dosnt really matter.
2007-04-06T05:49:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Logical.
2007-04-06T05:51:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	What do you mean?
2007-04-06T05:52:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Oooh.... Well, windows cannot run ext3 if that is teh ONLY partition...
2007-04-06T05:54:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	What are their sizes?
2007-04-06T05:57:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	So, you are repartitioning the second drive, but not the first?
2007-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Ok, so make the second drive be all ext3 AFTER you install the driver.
2007-04-06T05:59:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Dont worry, it is not broken, it is just easier this way.
2007-04-06T05:59:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	It is ok.
2007-04-06T06:00:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Yes.
2007-04-06T06:00:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Did you have any data on that drive? Because if so, it is gone.
2007-04-06T06:03:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	It is easy, aslong as you do it from windows.
2007-04-06T06:04:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	np
2007-04-06T06:07:00.000Z	firefoxman	Andrew250	Type the first few letters, like firefox, and then tab.
