2008-05-23T00:24:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	but the shift key works with other letters?
2008-05-23T00:24:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	yes
2008-05-23T00:25:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	weird problem. Did you try the keyboard with a different OS or computer?
2008-05-23T00:27:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	previous ubuntu versions, works fine. but this one, 8.04, problems occur.   Note the cc's left...   occur. AaBbcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz  (as you can see, the capital c doesn't work??
2008-05-23T00:28:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	any ideas?
2008-05-23T00:28:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	try going to system>preferences>keyboard and see if you have the correct layout and everything
2008-05-23T00:29:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	otherwise I got to solutions
2008-05-23T00:29:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	okay, stand by...
2008-05-23T00:32:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	can't find the problem?  The keyboard is a Generic 105-Key (intl) Pc, with UK layout
2008-05-23T00:33:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	i don't really know where to go from there.... maybe you could run dmesg in terminal and see if there are any errors
2008-05-23T00:34:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	where do I look out for from dmesg?
2008-05-23T00:35:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	anything that has to do with keyboards...
2008-05-23T00:37:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	what's the correct syntax to cut out the rest and show only the ones that i am looking for?  i.e.  look for the line 'input', so dmesg | grep input???
2008-05-23T00:39:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	?
2008-05-23T00:39:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	sorry man, i'm not sure.
2008-05-23T00:41:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	found the line which reads: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input1
2008-05-23T00:42:00.000Z	tushyd	TimMatrix	I assume you'd see some sort of error with the keyboard if something was wrong. You've tried a different keyboard? It sounds like a hardware issue
2008-05-23T00:42:00.000Z	TimMatrix	tushyd	okay, i will try the other spare keyboard to see if that cures the problem.  thanks for your help.
