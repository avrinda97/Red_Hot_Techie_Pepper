2005-10-08T09:02:00.000Z	yaaar		nalioth; that script put a pretty weird line in my fstab....i mounted it, and for a minute it acted like it was working right.....i deleted a file from it, and moved one to it....but after those two operations, i can't delete any more files off it. wtf?
2005-10-08T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	what script?
2005-10-08T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	winmac_fstab?
2005-10-08T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	the script has worked for hundreds of folks
2005-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	is it fat32?
2005-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	open a terminal and type "man chmod"
2005-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	if it's fat32, change the permissions
2005-10-08T09:12:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	the system makes a trash folder on each mounted partition, i believe
2005-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	you dont like that. use kde. it hides trash(es) everywhere
2005-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	nfs is a *nix standard and is fairly bulletproof
2005-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	samba is a condesension to windowd standards

2005-10-22T15:55:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	i recommend the installsmeg script from the smeg homepage
2005-10-22T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	if it's not in the repos, check sourceforge.net or freshmeat.net (i'm sure there is something)
2005-10-22T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	backports? for what?
2005-10-23T16:04:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	that is entirely up to you
2005-10-23T16:06:00.000Z	nalioth	yaaar	if you desire a more modern distro, upgrade. if you are happy with your systems performance now, stay with it
