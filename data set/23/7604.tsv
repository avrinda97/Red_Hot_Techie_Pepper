2006-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	.xchat2/
2008-09-03T18:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	convert from imagemagik ?
2009-07-09T01:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	iftop
2010-07-11T14:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	use gconftool-2
2010-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	maybe --> gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel/orientation "top"
2010-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	great! then I'd have to killall gnome-panel?
2010-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	check that it is actually of type string in the editor etc
2010-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	yep
2010-07-11T14:57:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	saves the day! Give me something to play with for a while anyway
2010-07-11T14:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	no problem good luck ;P
2010-07-11T15:19:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	I made a batch file, ran it, and it worked! Her screen jumped a little bit, and gnome-panel came back up with it at the top
2010-07-11T15:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	why not run it in System>Preferences>initial apps ( or similar)
2010-07-11T15:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	I don't need to run it every time, just after her daughter uses her machine :-)
2010-07-11T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	ok
2010-07-11T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	right click on the menu. choose edit
2010-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	yes, I have one filename per line; no spaces in filenames
2010-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	on file per line? no space in filenames?
2010-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	yes, I have one filename per line
2010-09-07T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	then maybe « pdftk $( tr '\n' ' ' < temp.txt ) cat output merged.pdf » could work.
2010-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	jimcooncat	erUSUL	it actually worked! I didn't know the command line would take so much text.
2010-09-07T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimcooncat	well there is actually a limit but it is quite high ;P
