2012-01-30T21:26:00.000Z	Gallomimia		hello. i'm about to run some updates on a server which i admin. should i do a do-release-update or just simply update my packages and consider an OS update later?
2012-01-30T21:27:00.000Z	Gallomimia		uh..... what's the command i can use to see which version is running?
2012-01-30T21:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	lsb_release -sc
2012-01-30T21:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	you never said...
2012-01-30T21:29:00.000Z	Gallomimia	ActionParsnip	well the questions i'm asking should tell you i'm quite the nub, and codenames won't mean jack to me. just sayin'
2012-01-30T21:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	cat /etc/lsb-release | grep -i release | grep -v grep
2012-01-30T21:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	simple bash command
2012-01-30T21:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	mine is a bit prettier
2012-01-30T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	10.04 server is supported until 2015 so I'd hang on that. Precise is also LTS so you can upgrade directly to that in April if you wish
2012-01-30T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	sure upgrade away
2012-01-30T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	you should schedule a regular outage window of an hour or so, so you can perform maintenance. Servers need love
2012-01-30T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	there is a tool to slip in kernel updates so you don't need to reboot, but I can't remember its name
2012-01-30T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	ksplice will slipstream in kernel updates for you, negating the need to reboot to load the newest kernel
2012-01-30T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	then you need a scheduled outage window
2012-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	just use your backups...
2012-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	Gallomimia	ActionParsnip	its not my computer and i don't care about backups.
2012-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	i see
2012-06-14T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	in theory yes
2012-06-14T03:55:00.000Z	Gallomimia	ActionParsnip	is it easy?

2012-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	I usinstaled the old first, installed ok :)
2012-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	Gallomimia	ActionParsnip	i'm sorry the old what? i think it's been a few days since i spoke to you last...
2012-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gallomimia	the skype, if you uninstall old skype and install the new deb it installs ok
