2011-07-05T03:03:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	mint xfce
2011-07-05T03:03:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	does the compiz function as in 10.10 ? and does it have 64 bit ?
2011-07-05T03:03:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	thers also xubuntu thats xfce based
2011-07-05T03:03:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	yes
2011-07-05T03:04:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	ok i ll try that out in future so far i love ubuntu 10.10 =) i just wondered what were the plans for the future, like are they gonna suicide and leave 11.04 as it is ?! rhetoric question :P
2011-07-05T03:05:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	yep gnome 3 is gonna smoke em i have seen cleaned up versionb to make it more gnome 2 like and its epic
2011-07-05T03:05:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	unlike unity gnome 3 can be compeatly changed its just the stock look that sucks
2011-07-05T03:06:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	is gnome 3 ubuntu plan ? or which distro does utilize gnome 3 the best way ?
2011-07-05T03:06:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	you can try xubuntu to its xfce with compiz
2011-07-05T03:06:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	everyone but ubuntu stock
2011-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	every other distro will be using gnome 3
2011-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	oh i thought it was only on fedora and suse
2011-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	im a resorce whore so i dont like all the compiz junk so i use xfce and turn it off
2011-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	whats lxde for example ? even though i ll try xface mint i guess
2011-07-05T03:08:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	lxde is even lighter then xfce in terms of memery use. but xfce is a good middle gound has plenty of features compiz etc
2011-07-05T03:08:00.000Z	gogeta	lasha	but not trying to remkae the desktop like unity and gnome 3
2011-07-05T03:09:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	ok i see, no lxde for me :P
2011-07-05T03:12:00.000Z	lasha	gogeta	ok thank u man see u going off
