2005-07-03T11:12:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	Maybe when my ears unclench.
2005-07-03T11:12:00.000Z	lcarlos		sorry
2005-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	;) What is the port configuring you need to figure out? I don't use amule, but if it's a basic question, I'm your man.
2005-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	lcarlos		the problem is that i have lowID and i wanna hava HiID
2005-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	If you're behind a router/firewall, you'll need to set it up to forward the appropriate ports to yoru computer. If you're not, then it shoudl work with no extra config from you.
2005-07-03T11:14:00.000Z	lcarlos		but i don't have a firewall
2005-07-03T11:15:00.000Z	lcarlos		and i have lowID and the downloads are too slow
2005-07-03T11:15:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	Then you shouldn't require any messing with ports for Amule to work.
2005-07-03T11:15:00.000Z	lcarlos		yes but i dont know haw to do that
2005-07-03T11:16:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	A lot of p2p systems rank you based on how much sharing you do. The more files you share, the better your downloads.
2005-07-03T11:16:00.000Z	lcarlos		whats si gtk-gnutella???
2005-07-03T11:16:00.000Z	lcarlos		maybe let my try
2005-07-03T11:17:00.000Z	tkiesel	lcarlos	gnutella is another p2p app, I think.
2005-07-03T11:25:00.000Z	lcarlos		hay thanks the genutella works good
2005-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	tkiesel		Anyone had good/bad/neutral experiences with apt-build?
