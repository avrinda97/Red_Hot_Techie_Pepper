2006-03-18T15:38:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Click cancel.
2006-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	OK... so your problem was, it just sits there are doesn't do anything when you plug the drive in right?
2006-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	If you're going command-line (haha going commando), you'll want to check dmesg for the correct device node after you plug in the drive...
2006-03-18T15:45:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	What did you put in for "<name>"?  It should be a path on the filesystem, so cd to it and see what's there.
2006-03-18T15:46:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	no it shouldnt. thats the label. /dev/sda1 is the device path.
2006-03-18T15:46:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	read my post again.
2006-03-18T15:46:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Yeah but the second parameter for mount has to be a filesystem path (relative or absolute), like /mnt/usbdrive or whatnot.
2006-03-18T15:47:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	does it have to be anywhere in particular?
2006-03-18T15:47:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Not really... just "mkdir /mnt/usbdrive", and then "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbdrive", and if you don't get any errors, you should be able to access the files on it through "/mnt/usbdrive".
2006-03-18T15:48:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Remember your "sudo" too :)
2006-03-18T15:48:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	ta i'll try that
2006-03-18T15:50:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	i did that, pressed enter and the terminal goes to next line (its blank) and does nothing.
2006-03-18T15:50:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	mount will only print stuff if something goes wrong.
2006-03-18T15:50:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	it wont even give me another thingo to type commands into, just entirely blank line.
2006-03-18T15:51:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Ohhhh......
2006-03-18T15:51:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Can you Ctrl+C it and get your prompt back?
2006-03-18T15:52:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Hold Ctrl and press C and see if you get your prompt back.
2006-03-18T15:53:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Can you open a separate terminal and type "dmesg", and paste it to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-03-18T15:55:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	done
2006-03-18T15:55:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	I need the URL to the new paste :)
2006-03-18T15:57:00.000Z	silvaran	bluefusion	Yeah you've got a serious issue with your USB drive... not sure where it is or if it's hardware or software... can you use the drive on other computers, can you use other drives on this computer?
2006-03-18T15:57:00.000Z	bluefusion	silvaran	yes and yes. can i wipe it from my computer and start again?
