2008-11-05T18:43:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	permission denied
2008-11-05T18:43:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	what exactly did that command do?
2008-11-05T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	what exactly said "permission denied"?
2008-11-05T18:43:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	when i tried to delete the file from the trash in the gui
2008-11-05T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	press the "reload" button in nautilus
2008-11-05T18:44:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	still denies me
2008-11-05T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	pastebin the output of: ls -lR ~/.local/share/Trash/
2008-11-05T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	that command was supposed to give your user ownership
2008-11-05T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	(the chown one)
2008-11-05T18:46:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/1245863
2008-11-05T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	sudo chmod -R u+w ~/.local/share/Trash/files/
2008-11-05T18:49:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	erm, drop the sudo
2008-11-05T18:49:00.000Z	jrib		!upgrade > JuJuBee
2008-11-05T18:50:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	the sudo rm ..../Trash/* command didn't work, says the file is a directory
2008-11-05T18:51:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop		rm -rf?
2008-11-05T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	CoRn_Laptop	I never gave you such a command....
2008-11-05T18:51:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop		ahh
2008-11-05T18:51:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	ahh that was another user.
2008-11-05T18:52:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	anyways, i tried sudo rm -rf /home/jrtuvera/.local/share/Trash/* and that worked
2008-11-05T18:52:00.000Z	CoRn_Laptop	jrib	thanks for the help
