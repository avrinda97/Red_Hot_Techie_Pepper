2008-12-22T05:05:00.000Z	mikejet		I do not understand. I thought Ubuntu was much more mainstream than this.
2008-12-22T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	install imagemagick, then run: convert <file.gif> <file.png>
2008-12-22T05:07:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	Why?
2008-12-22T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	converts the file to something ubuntu definately can use. Im unsure of gif support for wallpaper
2008-12-22T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	use opera
2008-12-22T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	it helps if you remove java plugins and install 64bit flash
2008-12-22T05:18:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	What?
2008-12-22T05:18:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	The goal of endusers is to USE internet.
2008-12-22T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	yuo can, in my experience java makes 64bit browsers a bit flaky
2008-12-22T05:20:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	Good for you for finding a great OS and a great BROWSER. Really. In this time of year everyone deserves to be satisfied and happy. Good for you.
2008-12-22T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	installing 64bit flash on a 64bit system rather than 32bit on 64bit hardware can help too
2008-12-22T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	ive no idea what you mean or what your point is
2008-12-22T05:20:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	Exactly.
2008-12-22T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	all i can do is advise based on personal experience so lose the attitude
2008-12-22T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	ive had forefox flakey as hell, after pulling java out which I rarely use ever it was a hell load better
2008-12-22T05:22:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	Agreed. I DO lose the attitude and lose Ubuntu when browsing internet. Flash exists. Deal with it.
2008-12-22T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	you could also try apt-building it, its made my firefox significantly slicker
2008-12-22T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	you didnt read what I said. Install the 64bit release from www.adobe.com will give you 64bit flash
2008-12-22T05:23:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	I have done that. Please do that yourself. It simply does not work (capitalize that).
2008-12-22T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	if you remove the 32bit version and no doubt nspluginwrapper
2008-12-22T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	and use that, you'll have nice flash runing properly
2008-12-22T05:25:00.000Z	mikejet	ActionParsnip	Ok. I realize you are trying to help, but no. No. No. I have tried that for months ( capitalizes that ).
2008-12-22T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikejet	tried what?
