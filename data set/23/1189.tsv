2010-07-20T00:03:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	shrunk my 250gb disk from 250 to 80gb and it took about 1 1/2 hours. so I
2010-07-20T00:04:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	I'm on a livecd now.
2010-07-20T00:27:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	ahh thanks.
2010-07-20T03:51:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	does this mean that there is a bad block, but it's fixing or just pressing with the test? "23652896done, 1:15:50 elapsed"
2010-07-20T03:52:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	looks like it's still scanning the disk. wow how big is your HD?
2010-07-20T03:53:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	Also, it just said  96.11% done, 1:16:25 elapsed Interrupt caught, cleaning up and then brought the prompt back.  I scanned a few different sections at a time, this section was 25gig... it takes about an hourish
2010-07-20T03:54:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	ok cool and you ran it with fsck -a right?
2010-07-20T03:54:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	I haven't done that one yet
2010-07-20T03:54:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	oh ok.
2010-07-20T03:55:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	your still on your live cd right?
2010-07-20T03:55:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	Yep
2010-07-20T03:55:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	ok... try running the fsck -a /dev/"whatever your disk partition is"
2010-07-20T03:58:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	I get this "fsck: fsck.swap: not found ; fsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.swap for /dev/sda5"  when running fsck -a /dev/sda5
2010-07-20T03:58:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	Is it because I had the swapoff when i was deleted the extra linux swap space?
2010-07-20T03:58:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	hmm, good question.
2010-07-20T03:59:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	Turned it back on, and trying again.
2010-07-20T03:59:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	have you tried to remove the swap first, then add in to swap?
2010-07-20T03:59:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	no, i just tried it with swapon and it still failed for the same reason.
2010-07-20T04:00:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	I will brb as well, I'm going to double check that I haven't screwed anything up recently and boot into my actual system.
2010-07-20T04:05:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	great idea
2010-07-20T05:14:00.000Z	nkei0	^peanut^	The fsck finished, i have 113 bad sectors, what do i do now?
2010-07-20T05:16:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	fix them =), fsck -a should auto-repair the bad blocks
2010-07-20T05:16:00.000Z	^peanut^	nkei0	or run fsck -a with the -y options as well as -a
