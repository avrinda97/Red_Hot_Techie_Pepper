2009-07-31T16:59:00.000Z	paul68		Hi , is there a way that I can hide towards my boss to which internet sites I am surfing during office hours?
2009-07-31T17:00:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	You could use a proxy server. Tor may work (but it's slow). Or if you can keep your home PC on during the day, you could use it as a proxy.
2009-07-31T17:01:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	I have a server running at home could I do it with that too?
2009-07-31T17:02:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Yes.
2009-07-31T17:02:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Does it have sshd running? (openssh-server on Ubuntu or Debian.)
2009-07-31T17:03:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Does the work PC run Windows or Linux?
2009-07-31T17:03:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	linux 8.04 server
2009-07-31T17:04:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Is that your server, or the work PC?
2009-07-31T17:05:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	my server is at home
2009-07-31T17:05:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	I am asking about your work PC.
2009-07-31T17:05:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	my laptop is also on linux
2009-07-31T17:06:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	*sigh* anyway, if your work PC runs Linux, then use this command: « ssh -D1080 your-home-server-address »
2009-07-31T17:07:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	And once it connects, set up your web browser to use a SOCKS proxy on 127.0.0.1, like in this picture: http://sine.cluenet.org/~grawity/trash/firefox-socks-config.png
2009-07-31T17:08:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	sorry just to be clear I use my laptop at work with linux and at home I have a linux server on 8.04
2009-07-31T17:09:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	okay. And you use Firefox on your laptop, or some other browser?
2009-07-31T17:09:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	I use firefox a slight detail not to forget that I am behinde a proxy here at work to
2009-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Can you connect with 'ssh' from work to your server?
2009-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	yes I can
2009-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	Good. When connecting, use « ssh -D 1080 your-server-address »
2009-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	And then set up Firefox like in that image.
2009-07-31T17:11:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	normally I use ssh myserveraddress -pxxxx so the last part is dropped then
2009-07-31T17:11:00.000Z	grawity	paul68	No, you'll need the -p too
2009-07-31T17:12:00.000Z	paul68	grawity	can we take it pvt
