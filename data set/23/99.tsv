2012-07-14T22:59:00.000Z	please_help_meee	L3top	but my problem is that 720p YouTube videos really lag a lot and I think my graphics card is lacking compatibility with Ubuntu.. What is wrong? Because My Graphics card shouldn't lag with video playback, I used to play Black Ops Multiplayer on it and it did the job. Would updating my kernel get me better performance?
