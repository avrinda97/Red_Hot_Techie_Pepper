2008-04-27T17:27:00.000Z	david567		anyone else know hot to enable transparencies on the upper panel?
2008-04-27T17:28:00.000Z	derspankster	david567	don't you have a slider?
2008-04-27T17:29:00.000Z	derspankster	david567	don't think you can do that, pick a solid color close to your theme color and then work the slider
