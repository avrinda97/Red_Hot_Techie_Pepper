2008-08-05T00:39:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	it means the package you are trying to install depends on some other package that the package manager cant find, you can try to install the dependency manually to solve.
2008-08-05T00:40:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	thanks for the reply :), how can I install it manually ?
2008-08-05T00:40:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	what are you trying to install specifically and waht does it tell you is missing?
2008-08-05T00:41:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	.. I ran a partial upgrade and restarted and suddenly GIMP wasn't there :| .. ! I tried installing it again from the package manager and it told me about 2 unresolvable dependencies .. and I checked all repo's were enabled ..
2008-08-05T00:42:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	it didnt specify which packages it needed?
2008-08-05T00:42:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	.. it did .. 2 packages
2008-08-05T00:42:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	ok but what are they named?
2008-08-05T00:43:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	libgimp2.0 (>=2.4.6) but 2.4.5-1ubuntu2 and  libpango1.0-0 (>=1.20.5) but 1.20.1-1
2008-08-05T00:44:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	apt-cache search libgimp
2008-08-05T00:44:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	tell me if it returns anything relevant?
2008-08-05T00:44:00.000Z	danya		anirud0 : I'm kind of an intermediate user and I'm not sure about what ur saying the custom repos .. :$
2008-08-05T00:44:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	: ok hold on
2008-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	sudo apt-get install libgimp2.0 libpango1.0-0
2008-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	: about the apt-cache .. I didn't get anything relevant .. just normal stuff I'm guessing
2008-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	sudo apt-get install libgimp2.0 libpango1.0-0
2008-08-05T00:47:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	try installing gimp after you install those two packages
2008-08-05T00:48:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	: the output states that the libgimp have unmet dependencies and that libpango is already newest version
2008-08-05T00:50:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	I have a feeling there is something wrong with your repos, what did you upgrade from/to?
2008-08-05T00:51:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	.. I'm using Hardy Heron .. an update reminder requested a partial upgrade so I just did it .. and restarted ..
2008-08-05T00:51:00.000Z	nixnoob_	danya	pm me
2008-08-05T00:53:00.000Z	danya	nixnoob_	I just did
