2005-06-19T09:59:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- curious need more info to know if it is a problem with user rights or the way/where it is mounted...
2005-06-19T10:01:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- you have tried sudo -s (to get a root trminal) and then nautilus?
2005-06-19T10:02:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- only when you transfer a file from the 'net directly to the other spare drive/partition?
2005-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	TokenBad	IIIEars	this is what I have in fstab: /dev/hdd1       /home/windows   vfat    rw,auto,unmask=000  0   0
2005-06-19T10:10:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- And it seems similar to the other entries? - beginning to think it is a permission problem or process permission problem
2005-06-19T10:11:00.000Z	TokenBad	IIIEars	this is one of the other entries: /dev/hda1       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
2005-06-19T10:11:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- someone else will know better if it is a permission problem.
2005-06-20T06:16:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- Hi
2005-06-20T06:20:00.000Z	TokenBad	IIIEars	what is command to install a deb file from local drive?
2005-06-20T06:21:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- About the same. - poking about in C++ tutorials. - it's enough to drive an ex windows user giddy with exitement and profoundly confused. - lol
2005-06-20T06:21:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- dpkg -i <yourfile.deb>?
2005-06-20T06:22:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- take a look at "alien" - nice
2005-06-20T06:33:00.000Z	IIIEars	TokenBad	- slocate?
