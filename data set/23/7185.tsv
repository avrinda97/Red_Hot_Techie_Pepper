2005-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	update to 0.1-21
2005-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	and do a  dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-`uname -r`
2005-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	okay?
2005-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	you mean the one I have installed which DOESN'T work?
2005-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	tried the dpkg-reconfigure line?
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	never asks me any questions, even using -plow, so no difference.
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	what?
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	only thing I can think of is that it's broken for nvidia users
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	it should have nothing to do with nvidia.
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	'dpkg-reconfigure -plow usplash'
2005-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	what never aksked you a question?
2005-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	it doesn't.
2005-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	"ccooke> cef: tried the dpkg-reconfigure line?"
2005-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	yes, the one I gave you
2005-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-`uname -r`
2005-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	of note: "Searching for splash image... none found, skipping...
2005-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	that sounds like nothing to do with usplash
2005-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	after running that dpkg-reconfigure line
2005-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	cef	ccooke	I know.. just pointing it out
2005-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	ccooke	cef	try rebooting.
