2007-08-10T13:41:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	you don't need to recompile the kernel any longer. support is compiled into the default kernel
2007-08-10T13:43:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	the instructions are way old.
2007-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	cki	howlingmadhowie	Where i can find something new ?
2007-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	what happens if you just enter "sudo modprobe zd1201"
2007-08-10T13:47:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	that's a good sign. what does "ifconfig" say? can you paste the result in pastebin?

2007-08-10T13:56:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	so it hasn't been picked up on yet. have you tried downloading and installing the deb: http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=23369&d=1169141035
2007-08-10T13:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	hang on: look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/prism2_usb
2007-08-10T14:01:00.000Z	cki	howlingmadhowie	is this better than the ndiswrapper?
2007-08-10T14:03:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	i dunno. the more i look at it, the more difficult it seems to become. it may be better to try it with ndiswrapper. but i've never used ndiswrapper myself
2007-08-10T14:04:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	cki	good luck :)
2007-08-10T14:04:00.000Z	cki	howlingmadhowie	thanks
