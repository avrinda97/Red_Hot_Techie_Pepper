2007-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	barnydan_		 I'm having trouble compiling another program.  the problem seems simlar,  when I run ./configure I get "checking for LIBOIL... configure: error: liboil-0.3 >= 0.3.12 is required". I installed liboil-0.3-dev and still get this same error. Someone mentioned that I may need to tell Configure where the file is located.  How do I do that?
2007-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	check the more accurate version, it really has to be 0.3.12 or newer, for instance 0.3.11 is not enough
2007-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	I did a find command, and it finds  "/usr/share/doc/liboil0.3"  how can I upgrade it to liboil0.3.12?
2007-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	yeah it's too old, google for the homepage for that etc.. manual work
2007-07-04T13:53:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	ok :(
2007-07-04T13:53:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	thanks
2007-07-04T13:54:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	should I look up upgrading liboil0.3 to liboil0.3.12?
2007-07-04T13:55:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	yes..
2007-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	is it common for someone to have to upgrade their distro to get updated files like liboil-0.3.12?
2007-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	it is not common for people to manually compile stuff at all imho anymore nowadays..
2007-07-04T14:01:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	 i'm trying to install Dirac codec,  it only comes in source.  Though I see the next version of Ubuntu has the file I need,  should I just upgrade or should I try to figure out how to install that file in this distro?
2007-07-04T14:02:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	libdirac0c2a - general purpose video codec - library ?? it's available.. as is gstreamer plugin.. you shouldn't need anything more
2007-07-04T14:03:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	 this is where I got it from. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155255,  I'm trying to get oggconverter to use it instead of theora.
2007-07-04T14:04:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	oh. well, then, you could just fetch liboil sources manually and compile it as well. it's a small library and very very picky and easily broken and causes often problems with certain multimedia software :p
2007-07-04T14:06:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	D'oh,  I run into every problem if there is a problem to run into.
2007-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	are you farmiliar with Encoding with Dirac?
2007-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	I'm wondering if there is an easier way.
2007-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	unlikely. the whole dirac thing is still so new..
2007-07-04T14:10:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	there is a way to get some packages from gutsy into feisty and telling it not to affect the rest. it is called "apt pinning" or something like that. someone else might be able to describe it. it involves adding couple lines to /etc/ and specifying what packages from gutsy you want to slam on your feisty...
2007-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	gutsy might work. then again it also might skin your cat and eat your granma. just keep that in mind.
2007-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	lol,  meaing it might mess everything up !fubar!
2007-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	Anlar	barnydan_	honestly? it rarely really screws up. practically never is destructive. it just might not want to boot sometimes, leading into livecd sessions where you chroot into your installtion to fix things.. :)
2007-07-04T14:17:00.000Z	barnydan_	Anlar	I probably am not ready for that yet.
