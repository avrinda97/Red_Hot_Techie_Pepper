2008-07-26T17:23:00.000Z	KenBW2		is it possible to make the keyboard layout be detected automatically at boot?
2008-07-26T17:23:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	no
2008-07-26T17:23:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	there's no way for the operating system to determine your keyboard layout
2008-07-26T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	you can write a script that distinguishes between the machines and sets the keyboard layout accordingly
2008-07-26T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	to run a script at every boot, call it from /etc/rc.local
2008-07-26T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	is it a UK one?
2008-07-26T17:25:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	yea
2008-07-26T17:26:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	it's a non-standard physical layout, but the electrical behaviour is identical to a normal UK one, ie. the keycodes are identical
2008-07-26T17:27:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	when i press "p" it thinks im pressing "*" and it thinks "i" is "5"
2008-07-26T17:27:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	you've got the NumLock on :)
2008-07-26T17:27:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	oh yea, duh!
2008-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	it doesnt have LEDs for num caps and scroll lock :(
2008-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	yeah, the Xandros desktop shows the NumLock and Caps status via notification applets. I think there is something equivalent for Ubuntu
2008-07-26T17:29:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	i usually get along fine :)
2008-10-22T02:04:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	shouldn't he make sure that sshd is installed and running on the server first?
2008-10-22T02:05:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	probably, i cant remember setting upo ssh on my PC
2008-10-22T02:08:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	winrid: please don't recommend bypassing the package manager without giving appropriate warnings ( robert__)
2008-10-22T02:08:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	warnings?
2008-10-22T02:09:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	like "bypassing the package manager to upgrade individual packages will break apt updates"
2008-10-22T02:10:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	you mean if you install apps from somewhere else they wont be updated by apt anymore?
2008-10-22T02:10:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	yes, and that's not the worst thing that can happen.
2008-10-22T02:11:00.000Z	KenBW2	soundray	malicious apps etc?
2008-10-22T02:12:00.000Z	soundray	KenBW2	I was thinking more of breaking the ability to upgrade to intrepid
