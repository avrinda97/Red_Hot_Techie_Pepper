2008-05-10T03:38:00.000Z	jgoo		hrm. hrmrhmrhrmhrmrhm. ok. I am trying to use gftp like winscp - but I get a connection reset by peer each time it tries to initialize and send the password... I can ssh no problem to this machine, why would an ssh2 copy fail?
2008-05-10T03:38:00.000Z	jgoo		(I can winscp to this machine too)
2008-05-10T03:40:00.000Z	jgoo		what else can I use in lieu of winscp? I've read ubuntu forums, they say secpanel (?) nautilus (doesn't work...) and gftp.. (no worky). Do I need to manually setup the certificates for this to work?
2008-05-10T03:41:00.000Z	jgoo		does anyone scp from ubuntu? hrm. nautilus and gftp fail. why would winscp work without any hassle? From ubuntu I can ssh fine to this machine...
2008-05-10T03:42:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	I use scp all the time
2008-05-10T03:43:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	if you told me what app you use (just scp cli?) that would help
2008-05-10T03:44:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	I just type scp from bash why do you ask?
2008-05-10T03:44:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	I am looking for a winscp type app. scp from cli is broken for humans
2008-05-10T03:45:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	from what I have seen, it might be command line, but it isn't an interface. it doesn't even spawn an interactive shell...
2008-05-10T03:45:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	no it is old school no gui
2008-05-10T03:46:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	still let's send two files by scp -but I am still looking for this supposed nautilus and gftp support, but it fails on my machine... connection reset by peer... o.0 ssh works to this machine
2008-05-10T03:46:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	I am not talking about no gui, I am talking about a broken cli
2008-05-10T03:46:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	...22 right?
2008-05-10T03:48:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	 try 'scp -p[PORT] [USERNAME]@[HOST]:/filepathtoget .' for a get command
2008-05-10T03:48:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	 try 'scp -p[PORT] myfile [USERNAME]@[HOST]:/filepathtosend' for a push command
2008-05-10T03:48:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	I know the scp command line - but it isn't usable... or productive
2008-05-10T03:48:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	whereas the ftp command line is usable and productive, as it also has a shell
2008-05-10T03:49:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	yes, but the ftp uses port 21
2008-05-10T03:49:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	make sure shorewall or whatever it is ubuntu uses these days for a firewall has the right ports open
2008-05-10T03:50:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	.... I know... what are you saying... port numbers don't dictate whether or not an application will be written to human based guidelines... ftp is a usable command, scp is an abhorrent example of how to mess up something simple... but let me send these two files and see if it does indeed support what I want (at least if I can hack up some shell magic to send multiple files)
2008-05-10T03:51:00.000Z	jlee	jgoo	OO, sorry, my server is crashed
2008-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	so scp works, gftp doesn't although the site says 'ssh and ssh2 transfers' there is only an ssh2 option in my window...
2008-05-10T03:59:00.000Z	jgoo	jlee	no keys, I asked higher up if that could be the problem
