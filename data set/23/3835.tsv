2009-11-12T18:32:00.000Z	Lewis		How do i get my Realtek RTL8192E Wireless LAN to work?
2009-11-12T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	you may have to use ndiswrapper
2009-11-12T18:32:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	Could you talk me through getting that to make it work please?
2009-11-12T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	sudo apt-get install ndisgtk
2009-11-12T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	then grab the windows driver that matches your ubuntu architecture (32bit or 64bit) and install using that gui
2009-11-12T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	if you cant get any network access, you will need another ubuntu system, install the app then copy the debs to some removable media to put in the system to then install
2009-11-12T18:35:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	it said nothing about that? It asked me for my password, and then it said a bunch of stuff i don't understand :/
2009-11-12T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	its installing the package
2009-11-12T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	if you have web access it will access the web to grab the package
2009-11-12T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	you can insert the cd you used to install the OS and install the version on there
2009-11-12T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	you will need the .inf and .sys file from the driver for the card
2009-11-12T18:38:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	I'm really lost. I only have internet access right now because of the ethernet cable; im just trying to enable wireless. Why am i putting CD's in etc.? The last thing the terminal said was: Setting up ndiswrapper-common (1.53-2ubuntu1) ...
2009-11-12T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	thats fine, the application has installed. You have a lot to learn
2009-11-12T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	run: uname -a    and paste the output here. This is ok as the output is only one line
2009-11-12T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	you can copy / paste to ad from the terminal
2009-11-12T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	ok so your kernel is 32bit (i686 == 32bit)
2009-11-12T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	so if you go to the manufacturers site of te device and download the XP driver (32bit) for your device you can get it working
2009-11-12T18:40:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	Yup; i didn't know i could even get 64bit. Im sure my laptop could handle it but i don't want to complicate things further for myself, and okay will do thank you
2009-11-12T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	64bit is equally supported, if you just want a simple system and have less or equal to 3Gb RAM, 32bit is fine
2009-11-12T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	if you do lots of encoding of audio / dvds / video then 64bit can give a boost
2009-11-12T18:45:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	Okay so im downloading the XP driver for the Realtek RTL8192E driver. When it's done, then what?
2009-11-12T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lewis	extract the files, you need a .inf and a .sys file
2009-11-12T19:16:00.000Z	Lewis	ActionParsnip	what do i do with the .inf and the .sys files?
