2005-09-19T13:39:00.000Z	pestilence		is it possible to have 2 monitors in clone setup such that one has a higher actual resolution than the other, but they have the same virtual resolution?
2005-09-19T13:39:00.000Z	pestilence		i.e. one shows the entire screen, the other scrolls when you move your mouse to the top and bottom, left and right of the screen
2005-09-19T13:40:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	i dont know, but it does sound like a cool idea
2005-09-19T13:40:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	indeed.
2005-09-19T13:41:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	i'm sure it's possible somehow
2005-09-19T13:41:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	sure, the question is, how :)
2005-09-19T13:42:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	i suspect it would involve (maybe among other things) creating a secondary screen section in xorg.conf, with the virtual desktop enabled
2005-09-19T13:43:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	i'm not sure if you can have two active "Screen" sections in xorg.conf at the same time or not..
2005-09-19T13:43:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	you can, but not in clone mode
2005-09-19T13:44:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	as far as i can tell.  it works fine if i want two different displays.  but to have one cloned display, it only wants one screen section
2005-09-19T13:44:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	oh, they act as expanded desktops or whatever?
2005-09-19T13:44:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	no, just two separate desktops.
2005-09-19T13:44:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	you can have one big desktop, that's called xinerama
2005-09-19T13:46:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	what kind of vid card are you using?
2005-09-19T13:47:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	intel 855gm
2005-09-19T13:48:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	http://www.x.org/X11R6.8.2/doc/radeon.4.html go there and search for "MergedFB" ... it looks driver-specific for radeon but if it can do it im sure other drivers have similar options..
2005-09-19T13:48:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	the i810 driver
2005-09-19T13:48:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	yes, i saw that.  didn't think it would work for the i810 driver.
2005-09-19T13:49:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	hmm all im seeing for mergedfb anywhere is for radeon and some mention of nvidia, matrox and SiS..
2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	http://www.xfree86.org/current/i810.4.html  search for "Clone" ... not very descriptive but might be a step in the right direction
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	yes, clone works.  but that makes both screens the same resolution.  i want the laptop screen to have a virtual resolution that is the same as the LCD's actual resolution
2005-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	Quinthius	pestilence	yeah... it might just be an issue of whether or not the driver has that functionality..
2005-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	pestilence	Quinthius	right.
