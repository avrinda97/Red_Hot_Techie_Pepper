2007-02-07T15:57:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		under the eth0 one, what does it say for inet addr: ?
2007-02-07T15:58:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		that's your IP address.
2007-02-07T15:58:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		what happens if you open a browser?
2007-02-07T15:59:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		like firefox or something
2007-02-07T15:59:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		what happens if you try to go to a web page?
2007-02-07T15:59:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		like www.yahoo.com or something
2007-02-07T16:00:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		hmm
2007-02-07T16:00:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		well, I have an idea. I dunno if it's the problem, but it's worth a shot.
2007-02-07T16:02:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		hmm, I'm doing it too. my default is inet
2007-02-07T16:04:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		wow, the output for that is long cypher1
2007-02-07T16:04:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	thats your routing table :)
2007-02-07T16:05:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	did you try "netstat -ra" only ?
2007-02-07T16:21:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	i meant the ping replies
2007-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	cypher1	is there a way to make it auto-detect some nameservers?
2007-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	DHCP
2007-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	does anyone know of a public DNS ip address ?
2007-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	cypher1	could I give him one of my current nameservers?
2007-02-07T16:40:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	yes we can try that
2007-02-07T16:40:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	is he on a pm ?
2007-02-07T16:41:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	ok
2007-02-07T16:47:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	cypher1	there's alot of tildes I see
2007-02-07T16:49:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	cypher1	perhaps we should have him use gedit. terminal editors are complex.
2007-02-07T16:49:00.000Z	cypher1	AmaroqWolf	yes :(
