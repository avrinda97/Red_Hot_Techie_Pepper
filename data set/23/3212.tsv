2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		Hello everyone. What are the repository lines I need to place in my sources.list file to make Apt-get read from the internet?
2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		It only had my deb cdrom line there.
2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		I'm not on standard Ubuntu
2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		On Ubuntu-Server
2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	if you're server only, let me know
2008-06-14T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	a sec
2008-06-14T13:46:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	you should have an /etc/apt/sources.list then. uncomment lines similar to the one dns53 just gave you
2008-06-14T13:46:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	except for backports and proposed
2008-06-14T13:48:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	http://paste.ubuntu.com/20093/ , replace my oakland with archive.ubuntu.com , or another mirror (unless you're in california)
2008-06-14T13:49:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	just save that file then :) Where in CA
2008-06-14T13:52:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	put it on a thumbdrive, and  echo <thatfile> >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-06-14T13:55:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	  wget  http://aphroneo.net/sources.list
2008-06-16T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	cd is built into just about all shells, that's very odd
2008-06-21T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	people ask questions, sometime stupid sounding ones, so everyone is on the same page. Can the attitude
2008-06-25T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	run   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , that will cause X to choose the best open source driver available for whatever card it finds. Then you can choose a proprietary one later if you like
2008-06-25T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	run   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , that will cause X to choose the best open source driver available for whatever card it finds. Then you can choose a proprietary one later if you like
2008-06-25T06:36:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	nickrud	I am installing my old GeForce, because apparently my Intel card keeps messing up. Games keep locking up the entire computer (which is a video driver error from what I gathered at #winehq)
2008-06-25T06:36:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	yeah, just run that command now, then stick in the card. Make sure you turn off the onboard in bios
2008-06-25T06:36:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	nickrud	Can you give me the command again?
2008-06-25T06:37:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
2008-06-25T06:37:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	nickrud	xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration
2008-06-25T06:37:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	that's fine
2008-06-25T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	airstrikeivanov	like it says, it's saving the old one in case you want it later
