2010-01-01T14:28:00.000Z	baz		hello, my new years resolution is to amass power, can someone make me an op pls. thank you
2010-01-01T14:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	you won't be made an op hehre if you ask
2010-01-01T14:28:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	how come
2010-01-01T14:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	because being an op is seen as a huge responsibility
2010-01-01T14:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	not an object of power
2010-01-01T14:31:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	so what can i do to prove that if i were bestowed the power i wouldn't simply ban everyone in the channel because i could?
2010-01-01T14:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	you have already declared that your intention is to amass power
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	that alone is grounds for dismissal
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	yes this is true, go on
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	oh really
2010-01-01T14:33:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	so what can i say to trick the ops into giving me power?
2010-01-01T14:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	nothing
2010-01-01T14:34:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	i dont understand, then how does anyone become an op
2010-01-01T14:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	it varies from channel to channel
2010-01-01T14:35:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	what if i help lots of people here?
2010-01-01T14:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	but it usually depends on who the ops think would be best based on helpfulness, personality, judgement, and ability to handle various situations
2010-01-01T14:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	also, this is starting to get off-topic.  I think we need to move this to #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-01-01T14:35:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	thats profiling
2010-01-01T14:36:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	are u an op?
2010-01-01T14:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	that should be ##baz, not #baz
2010-01-01T14:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	it's a bot, not a real person.  the ops here use it to keep the channel from being flooded
2010-01-01T14:45:00.000Z	baz	lstarnes	i dont care what nationality he is, he only criticizes
2010-01-01T14:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	baz	it, not he
