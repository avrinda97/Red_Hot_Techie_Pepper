2010-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Soreau: i'd change it to ati sucks ;)
2010-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Matt_keys: there's something you gotta do with tee to echo text into files. Not sure what it is
2010-01-28T06:34:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Hi razertek
2010-01-28T06:34:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Soreau: I use only nvidia or really old intel I know are going to give me zero issues
2010-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Thatguyoverthere: lspci | grep VGA
2010-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Matt_keys: boot to live cd and make sure all the UIDs are right for each partition in etc/fstab on the internal partition
2010-01-28T06:38:00.000Z	actionparsnip_		Thatguyoverthere: press alt+f2 type: gnome-terminal then press enter

2010-01-28T06:38:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	Still no good.
2010-01-28T06:39:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	Won't that stop my X server?
2010-01-28T06:43:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	Still nothing.
2010-01-28T06:47:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	My terminal is finally working. What was the command?
2010-01-28T06:54:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	throw the output into websearch engines. You will find guides
2010-01-28T06:57:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	you need better settings for your display. What windows does or doesn't do is moot
2010-01-28T06:58:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	How do you mean with the display settings?
2010-01-28T06:59:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	paste the line outputted into seach engines and you will find guodes and / or bug reports
2010-01-28T07:00:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	Alright, I take back what I said. Videos played more smoothly using Metacity instead of Compiz.
2010-01-28T07:01:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	actionparsnip_	Any way I can boost Compiz's resource efficiency...? I really can't stand Metacity.
2010-01-28T07:02:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	cut down the plugins drastically. I personally think com.piz is garbage. You can also ask in #compiz
2010-01-28T07:02:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	i'd see if there are any guides for your chip to make it run better
2010-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	actionparsnip_	ThatGuyOverThere	I think there's an option to make it 'greedy' may help
