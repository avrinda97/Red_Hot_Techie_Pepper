2007-10-13T11:59:00.000Z	Hilikus_		hey guys, i installed a new hdd in my pc and ubuntu lists it in the file browser, yet it is not mounted, it tells me some permission error. but what i want to know is, how come the hdd is already there, not mounted and its NOT in /etc/fstab
2007-10-13T12:00:00.000Z	Hilikus_		no
2007-10-13T12:01:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	you will have to either download ntfs-config (Assuming it's NTFS fs), or edit fstab yourself
2007-10-13T12:01:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	the OS doesn't mount every HDD in the computer, just those related to it.
2007-10-13T12:02:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	It wotn write to NTFS out of the box, so to speak.
2007-10-13T12:05:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	You realize that windows wont read it if you do.
2007-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Demortes	i.e. never
2007-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Oh, it will.
2007-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	they got games for mac
2007-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	And consoles arn't?
2007-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Check the modding scene.
2007-10-13T12:20:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	fstab is right.
2007-10-13T12:20:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Demortes	theres nothing in fstab about that hdd
2007-10-13T12:21:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	So put it in there... copy your other partitions
2007-10-13T12:21:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	You have to enter your own /dev/statement
2007-10-13T12:22:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Demortes	what do you mean
2007-10-13T12:23:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Like /dev/hda, or /dev/hdc1
2007-10-13T12:23:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Sata or IDE?
2007-10-13T12:24:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	So it's going to be /dev/hdsomething, what channel on IDE?
2007-10-13T12:25:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	well, what's your main HDD?
2007-10-13T12:25:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Also if you have a CDROM, you'll have one of those as well
2007-10-13T12:25:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	so probaly /hdd1 is what you want
2007-10-13T12:26:00.000Z	Demortes	Hilikus_	Load terminal, sudo apt-get isntall ntfs-3g
