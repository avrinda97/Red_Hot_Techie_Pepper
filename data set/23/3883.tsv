2008-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		when i use the alternate installation disk, and put root on a raid, encrypted container, lvm, or combination of these, the system won't boot. is this a known bug, am i doing something wrong, or is it something else?
2008-01-28T20:15:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	what does it say at boot-up?
2008-01-28T20:16:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	'operating system not found'
2008-01-28T20:16:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	hmm, ok. I have never done RAID, sorry.
2008-01-28T20:17:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	how about either of the other two?
2008-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	I recently set up an lvm/dm-crypt system, but didn't use the installer since it would provide less-safe algos only.
2008-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	algos?
2008-01-28T20:18:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	algorithms used by dm-crypt.
2008-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	2.6.22 can do aes-lrw, but the installer didn't offer it.
2008-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	aes-lrw is preferred about the default aes-whatever.
2008-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	That's all I can tell you since I only ran into dm-crypt specific mount problems, nothing like "OS not found".
2008-01-28T20:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	does grub load?
2008-01-28T20:21:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	no, grub doesn't. it seems like the bios can't find the /boot. but it can't be a bios error because the exact same thing happens on completely different machines
2008-01-28T20:21:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	you could try re-installing grub.
2008-01-28T20:21:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	when I installed, grub installation failed, but I was given a note about this.
2008-01-28T20:22:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	there's a good page on grub installation, but it's in German only. If you don't mind, I can give it to you.
2008-01-28T20:23:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	i didn't get an indication, but then, i did go off and do other things while it was installing, only coming back at the end. unfortunately, my german is not so hot, and i think that a mediocre grub page would be better than a googletrans of a good page, but i'm willing to take a look anyway
2008-01-28T20:24:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	ok, here you go: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB
2008-01-28T20:24:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	I'm sure google offers some good English pages too.
2008-01-28T20:25:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	google knows all that humans know
2008-01-28T20:25:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	I could explain to you the vitals, but again I have no clue about raid and wouldn't wanna wreck your system more than it is already.
2008-01-28T20:25:00.000Z	cosmodad	StrangeCharm_	unfortunately, it's sometimes unwilling to give that information to you. ;)
2008-01-28T20:26:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	cosmodad	no, i find google to be very helpful, its just the internet tht can be more annoying
