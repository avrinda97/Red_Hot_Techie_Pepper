2007-03-16T07:11:00.000Z	Uff1		Hey, another noob question: When I try to start synaptix, an error box pops out and says there is an un-interactive synaptic already running
2007-03-16T07:11:00.000Z	Uff1		what to do?
2007-03-16T07:12:00.000Z	Uff1		The one i'm trying to start, that is.
2007-03-16T07:12:00.000Z	Uff1		Nope.
2007-03-16T07:12:00.000Z	Uff1		yeah...
2007-03-16T07:13:00.000Z	Uff1		okok
2007-03-16T07:13:00.000Z	Uff1		now it worked, thanks! :)
2007-03-16T07:15:00.000Z	Uff1		Ok, how to edit xorg.conf?
2007-03-16T07:17:00.000Z	Uff1		Ok, in my xorg.conf it says Identifier "Generic video card" Driver "nvidia", does this seem right?
2007-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	you'll also need to be "ROOT" to edit your xorg.conf, so mak esure you use sudo.
2007-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	Uff1	IndyGunFreak	Done. :) thanks
2007-03-16T07:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	why would  youd o that
2007-03-16T07:23:00.000Z	Uff1	IndyGunFreak	Why not?
2007-03-16T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	just opinion i guess, but easyubuntu sucks... never liked it.
2007-03-16T07:24:00.000Z	Uff1	IndyGunFreak	I see....will check it out though. :)
2007-03-16T07:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	what happened?
2007-03-16T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	that doesn't make a lot of sense.
2007-03-16T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	did you install easyubuntu?
2007-03-16T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	what makes you believe all of your sources are gone?
2007-03-16T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	open a terminal and type sudo synaptic
2007-03-16T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	ok
2007-03-16T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	you can always look in xorg.conf again and see if it recognized your card(since it said generic before)... sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-03-16T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Uff1	i honestly don't know enougha bout easy ubuntu to be anu use, but i'd try opening easy ubuntu, and uninstalling whatever i twas you installed.
