2006-01-04T13:01:00.000Z	bobcat		hello everyone...  I got a newbie question... I accidently deleted the default gnome panel (at the top of the screen).  So, I figured out how to add a new one, but can't figure out how to make it show what processes are running like the default did on the right side???
2006-01-04T13:02:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	you mean the list of windows?
2006-01-04T13:03:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 you know when you have a app running, you will get the icon on the panel showing is running.  for example, when i am running limewire, i get a limewire icon on the right side of the panel..
2006-01-04T13:04:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	Ah, know what you mean - I'm running a danish locale though, gotta recall the english term for it :$
2006-01-04T13:05:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	Yes, nothing is 'part' of the panel, a panel is just a 'board' that you can pin whatever you want to...
2006-01-04T13:07:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	right-click; add to panel, notification area...
2006-01-04T13:07:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	AFAIR anyway
2006-01-04T13:12:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	anytime... Good idea to address the one you're writing to though, one single message easily drowns in here :)
2006-01-04T13:13:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	I havent tried, but in theory it shouldn't be hard -
2006-01-04T13:15:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	How would you do the networking you mean?
2006-01-04T13:15:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 Yea, that is what I am thinking... But I think I am going to brush up on my networking skills with Linux before conquering that one - :)
2006-01-04T13:16:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	great idea. I'm running breezy on my iBook myself... That's another challenge for you! ;-)
2006-01-04T13:16:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 Ideally I would like to have the linux box as just a big file server.  So, I would want to save files from the MAC onto it..  Also, I think it would be cool if i could remote to the linux box from the mac....
2006-01-04T13:17:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 so you have a dual boot on the ibook
2006-01-04T13:17:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	yup
2006-01-04T13:18:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	running Mac-on-Linux somtimes... not often though, it usually takes too long to boot to bother
2006-01-04T13:20:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 I see..  Well, i added ubuntu on my brothers pc running windows xp..  And we just partitioned the drive, created free space for the linux side, and that was pretty easy..  So, I would hope doing the dual boat on a Mac would be just as easy, but I have no experience with Macs... Just want to play around with one...  People say once you have one, you never go back
2006-01-04T13:22:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	 If the choice is Win and OS X; you're perfectly right.
2006-01-04T13:23:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	There are some trouble running linux on the Mac though - but hopefully they will be history once the Macintels are out...
2006-01-04T13:24:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 do you know when they are suppose to be releasing those
2006-01-04T13:25:00.000Z	bobcat	thoeger	 i was waiting for the G5 on the notebooks, but that hasn't come out yet... Starting to get impatient...:)
2006-01-04T13:26:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	Apple are very secretive about it. They sue the guts out of anyone with rumours coming too close to the truth if the news get out just one day in advance
2006-01-04T13:27:00.000Z	thoeger	bobcat	Everyone got impatient. IBM's lacking ability to get temperature down on the G5's was one of the main reasons Apple switched to Intel CPUs
