2006-12-25T12:35:00.000Z	K^Holtz		my videos that im playing on youtube are being rather sketchy.. is there something i dont have set up properly?
2006-12-25T12:37:00.000Z	K^Holtz		how do i check if i have the accelerated graphics for my nvidea set up right?
2006-12-25T12:37:00.000Z	K^Holtz		theres that collored circle program or something like that...
2006-12-25T12:38:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	in a terminal, type the following:  glxinfo | grep direct
2006-12-25T12:39:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	whoa.. lots of MISSING GLX display messages
2006-12-25T12:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	if it says "yes", you're set.  if you want to do a fast 'benchmark' of sorts, you can run glxgears -printfps, to get a quicky 'demo' as it were
2006-12-25T12:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	then it's not setup, apparently lol.  were you trying the binary blob drivers?
2006-12-25T12:40:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	im not sure what ur talking about.. i know i had them set up properly, i think it got messed up when i upgraded to edgy
2006-12-25T12:41:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	I recommend the envy script to a lot of people setting up their nvidia drivers. it just works.
2006-12-25T12:42:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	does it only set up the nvidea drivers or is it one of those package deals
2006-12-25T12:43:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	it will download and install the 'official' drivers from nvidia.com, get all the packages you need to install them properly, and make sure it's setup right.  it's NOT like automatix or anything like that, it doesn't modify package files.  it uses the package manager to make sure it gets setup properly, and gets the .run file direct from nvidia for you.
2006-12-25T12:45:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	sounds pretty convenient..
2006-12-25T12:46:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	it is.  i ran into one small problem with it ONE TIME, and the 'fix' was just to run the script again.
2006-12-25T12:47:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	i installed the package.. did u say i run it through synaptec?
2006-12-25T12:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	after you download the package, dbl click it, and install it.  once it's on your system, you'll have to switch to a straight terminal (ctrl-f1), and do a sudo envy.  it'll take care of the rest for you.  (it kills x, gdm, etc)
2006-12-25T12:56:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	i dont think it worked so well
2006-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	what happened?
2006-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	i ran it, and it just went to a black screen, and i could type anything and it wouldnt come out of it.. i hit a CTRL F1 a bunch of times while i was in there and it finally rebooted
2006-12-25T12:58:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	i tried to say the instructions before you left... you must've missed 'em :)
2006-12-25T12:58:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	ic.. what were the instructions? i just typed sudo envy and let it run
2006-12-25T12:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	after you install the package, hit ctrl-f1.  log into that terminal.  THEN run sudo envy.  envy will kill off the x windows system, gdm, and any other graphical stuff running.  it will THEN install the driver for you, and offer to restart gdm at the end of the process.
2006-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	K^Holtz	aargh, i am so sorry, i rebound my keys.  ctrl-alt-f1
2006-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	K^Holtz	SilentDis	ok, ill try that
