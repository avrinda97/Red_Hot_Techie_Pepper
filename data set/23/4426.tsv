2007-08-17T09:18:00.000Z	Devo		I installed Code::blocks but when I try to open it it says starting Code::blocks but then the window disappears. What's wrong?
2007-08-17T09:20:00.000Z	Devo		Nobody knows?
2007-08-17T09:20:00.000Z	Devo		What is wrong with my Code::blocks?
2007-08-17T09:21:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	run it from the command line and see if it outputs an error. just telling us it quits is useless
2007-08-17T09:21:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Ok.
2007-08-17T09:22:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Where would I find the executable? Haha. Where is Linux's "Program Files".
2007-08-17T09:23:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	if you type "echo $PATH" itll answer the "where's Program Files?" question
2007-08-17T09:23:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	but you dont need to know where it is to run it
2007-08-17T09:23:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	OH.... shouldn't I know the name of the executable? I don't know the name. :(
2007-08-17T09:23:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	there's a command that runs it, usually, the name of the program.  if it has multiple words it may or may not have a - in the middle
2007-08-17T09:24:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	if you start typing the beginning of the name into the terminal, though, and hit the "tab" key twice, itll list all the possibilities that start with that
2007-08-17T09:24:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	thankfully, the terminal has the nice auto-completion feature
2007-08-17T09:24:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Ok.
2007-08-17T09:25:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Yeah. :D
2007-08-17T09:26:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Here is the error. :D "codeblocks: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_gtk2u_aui-2.8.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".
2007-08-17T09:26:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	ok
2007-08-17T09:27:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Let me check to see if I have it.
2007-08-17T09:28:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	I don't think I have it, where.
2007-08-17T09:34:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	im guessing it means the program is buggy
2007-08-17T09:35:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Do you know another IDE for programming in C?
2007-08-17T09:36:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	Eclipse can do C
2007-08-17T09:36:00.000Z	Devo	macogw	Yeah... and Eclipse is not so bad. I'll try that.
2007-08-17T09:37:00.000Z	macogw	Devo	Eclipse is an IDE for tons of stuff, it's just most popular for Java.  It's really meant to be like Visual Studio though
