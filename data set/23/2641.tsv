2009-01-03T00:13:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	I asked my 'real' question to no response (more of a problem description than a question). shall I ask again? it's lengthy.
2009-01-03T00:14:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	http://www.uruk.org/orig-grub/errors.html
2009-01-03T00:15:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	that doesn't pertain to me.
2009-01-03T00:16:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Not sure if it helps you, but once I had something like that
2009-01-03T00:17:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	ah, intrepid uses orinoco by default?
2009-01-03T00:18:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	No. In Feisty discover probably confused these.
2009-01-03T00:18:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Try it. Perhaps it will help.
2009-01-03T00:18:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	feisty was never on this computer.
2009-01-03T00:19:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Thet doesn't matter. I was dealing with this on Feisty only. Could be same for you.
2009-01-03T00:20:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	preventing orinoco from loading on boot can be in modules.conf right? can't recall.
2009-01-03T00:21:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Right, but first try it manually.
2009-01-03T00:21:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Damn it. Sorry. It is in /etc/modules/blacklist or so
2009-01-03T00:22:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	ah right, thanks
2009-01-03T00:24:00.000Z	vita	Caimlas	Did it help?
2009-01-03T00:26:00.000Z	Caimlas	vita	that would require a reboot to get into the .27 kernel; on the hardy .24 kernel atm
