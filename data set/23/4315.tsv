2008-03-18T00:23:00.000Z	BinaryFu		Okay, anyone who can help with this Nautilus problem: I can't click on anything on my desktop, nor right click the desktop for a menu. I can open Nautilus (75% of the time) and I can go from one folder to another, but if the folder contains anything OTHER than more folders, it locks up tight and I have to kill it. Any suggestions on where to start to fix this? I have attempted: removing nautilus and reinstalling it, removing ~/.nautilus
2008-03-18T00:25:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	When did it first occur? Did you install something at the time?
2008-03-18T00:26:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	I'm not sure. I've been having odd experiences with errors in Nautilus for about the past month, but very few and far between...finally it's given up the ghost, and apparently something, somewhere hidden away, is performing evil experiments on any new install of it I put in...makes a man want to go to the KDE side. :/
2008-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	KDE? That's a major step. Especially when most people I know hate KDE. :) Wait a second, I'll try to find a solution.
2008-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	Bless you.
2008-03-18T00:31:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	Do you get any error messages at the 25 percent cases when nautilus don't start?
2008-03-18T00:32:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	I haven't gotten anything out of it even when I try to run it in bash, it just goes until it stops, it shows that it's taking up a small amount of ram and cpu usage at the time of the "crash" and waiting just shows that it's not responding at all, and I have to force quit or kill/killall.
2008-03-18T00:33:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	But now, even that doesn't help, the next opening of it gives the same results.
2008-03-18T00:35:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	Have you tried reinstalling nautilus?
2008-03-18T00:36:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	Indeed. I have removed Nautilus (and about 5 other programs including ubuntu-desktop in the process) using aptitude purge nautilus and then reinstalled the items removed (including nautilus) with aptitude install
2008-03-18T00:39:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	It's beyond me. I couldn't find anything but this similar case:
2008-03-18T00:40:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	Most of what is said there is unrelated to your problem, but the problem is similar.
2008-03-18T00:40:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	If there's a solution listed, I'll try it.
2008-03-18T00:41:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	There is, but it's related to an error message in the cl. You didn't get any error messages. :(
2008-03-18T00:42:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	Now that I think about it, this post is compeletely unrelated.
2008-03-18T00:42:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	I wonder if there's such a thing as the libmapping he referred to in there in Gutsy? (A quick check in apt shows it's not, so perhaps a similar name?) I'm going to do some Syn browsing.
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	Is there a way for me to set up a debug for nautilus so I can check a more verbose state as it's running?
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	Be my guest. :) You were my first "client" today, hopefully I'll be able to help others better than the "help" I've given you. :)
2008-03-18T00:44:00.000Z	iDN	BinaryFu	I know of no such option, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to answer this question. I'm a windows power user, and Ubuntu above-average user. :)
2008-03-18T00:51:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	Still no solution...*sigh* I may have to do a reinstallation to fix this...and I hate to even contemplate that.
2008-03-18T00:51:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	I doubt it's in my home settings, thankfully, since I'd removed .nautilus and .gnome2 prior to this in an attempt to repair it.
2008-03-18T01:17:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	Update on the strangeness that is Nautilus...
2008-03-18T01:17:00.000Z	BinaryFu	iDN	I have just done some sizable browsing through my system. It appears to ONLY happen when I hit a folder that has a .mp3 file in it...
