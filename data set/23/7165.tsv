2005-10-06T09:52:00.000Z	none_		your problem is that the sound device is not being created
2005-10-06T09:52:00.000Z	none_		yeah
2005-10-06T09:52:00.000Z	none_		you need to know what module to use
2005-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	none_		or if there even is one
2005-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	silasj	none_	512
2005-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	none_	silasj	how much ram do you have?
2005-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	none_	silasj	that is enough that swap won't often be written
2005-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	silasj	none_	so is swap off for default?
2005-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	none_	silasj	no
2005-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	none_	silasj	type "free" in a terminal
2005-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	silasj	none_	swap 0 0 0
2005-10-06T09:57:00.000Z	none_	silasj	then you don't have a swap partition
2005-10-06T09:58:00.000Z	silasj	none_	strange... I'm sure I did one in the install... how can I make a new one?
2005-10-06T09:58:00.000Z	none_	silasj	you need some unallocated space
2005-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	silasj	none_	cool thx.
2005-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	silasj	none_	swapon asks for arguments.
2005-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	none_	silasj	add the partition to /etc/fstab
2005-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	silasj	none_	uhm right.
2005-10-06T10:01:00.000Z	none_	silasj	cfdisk
2005-10-06T10:02:00.000Z	silasj	none_	I have one swap partition.
2005-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	none_	silasj	/dev/hda5       none            swap    sw              0
2005-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	silasj	none_	right.
2005-10-06T10:05:00.000Z	silasj	none_	swap on now! Thx!!!
