2008-01-04T01:37:00.000Z	silent_	jakel1	never again
2008-01-04T02:32:00.000Z	silent_	jakel1	depends what filesystem you use
2008-01-04T02:35:00.000Z	silent_	jakel1	nope, one of the many reasons I prefer linux
2008-01-04T02:39:00.000Z	silent_	jakel1	now I just need an exbibyte drive
2008-01-04T02:39:00.000Z	jakel1	silent_	i got 16TB

2008-01-04T02:44:00.000Z	silent_	jakel1	there's no reason you'd need 16TB.. I have just over 1TB and don't use all of it
