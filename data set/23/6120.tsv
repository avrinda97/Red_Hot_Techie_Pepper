2007-01-14T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	newbie	rename
2007-01-14T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	newbie	so do you just want to change all the files in some directory to be called misc1.jpg misc2.jpg etc?
2007-01-14T08:12:00.000Z	newbie	jrib	did you have a suggestion?
2007-01-14T08:12:00.000Z	jrib	newbie	do they all have the same extension?
2007-01-14T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	newbie	i=0; for file in *; do mv $file misc$i.jpg; i=$(($i+1)); done
2007-01-14T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	newbie	you probably want to test that out in a test directory first
