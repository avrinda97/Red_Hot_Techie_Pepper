2005-07-05T10:53:00.000Z	ratl3		hey, i use X windows!
2005-07-05T10:53:00.000Z	ratl3		haha
2005-07-05T10:54:00.000Z	ratl3		x windows is just as good as bash!
2005-07-05T10:56:00.000Z	ratl3		that root thing is confusing
2005-07-05T10:56:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	that is why ubuntu uses sudo
2005-07-05T10:57:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	much
2005-07-05T10:57:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	I have done helpdesk
2005-07-05T10:57:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	i guess i just like having a root account
2005-07-05T10:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	that is common is you have previous linux experience
2005-07-05T10:58:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	i guess ubuntu wasn't made for me... :(
2005-07-05T10:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	they are working on smarter root account handling, for people who prefer it
2005-07-05T10:59:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	is it called sudo passwd?
2005-07-05T10:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	no, deeper things
2005-07-05T10:59:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	like what?
2005-07-05T11:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	possible handling in .desktop files, etc.
2005-07-05T11:00:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	sudo within .desktop files? is this lindows?
2005-07-05T11:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	no, telling the system that an application needs root privs
2005-07-05T11:01:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	ohhh
2005-07-05T11:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	then letting the sytem decide what to use
2005-07-05T11:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	that is one option, there are other one the table
2005-07-05T11:02:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	I think that's a good idea, what are the other ideas?
2005-07-05T11:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ratl3	I don't know enough to flesh them out
2005-07-05T11:03:00.000Z	ratl3	Burgundavia	oh, ok
