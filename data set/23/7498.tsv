2006-06-29T10:51:00.000Z	grphx		So I somehow locked myself out of my desktop folder.  I try to go in it and it says access denied
2006-06-29T10:52:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	did you take off execute permissions on it?
2006-06-29T11:06:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	sudo chmod
2006-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	grphx	cwillu	What do i chmod it to?
2006-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	chmod O+RWX file/folder name
2006-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	will add read write and execute to anybody who isn't in the listed group or owner
2006-06-29T12:12:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	what did you type exactly?
2006-06-29T12:15:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	you just want everyone to read and write, right?
2006-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	what does ls -l say about the folder?
2006-06-29T12:19:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	still there?
2006-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	crash course in unix perms :)
2006-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	only the most specific permissions apply, so if you say owner=read, group=read, other=read/write, the owner and the group can only read, but anyone else can read and write
2006-06-29T12:28:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	are you on command line or would you prefer via nautilus?
2006-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	grphx	cwillu	Would you mind if you send me messages so I wont have to go through the entire chatroom log to find this again?
2006-06-29T12:30:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	oops, sorry, I meant to :p
2006-06-29T12:30:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	is your nick registered?
2006-06-29T13:51:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	ntfs?
2006-06-29T13:52:00.000Z	grphx	cwillu	Yes it's ntfs
2006-06-29T13:56:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	sudo mount /device/path /mount/path -t ntfs should work, but it's not permanent
2006-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	captive-ntfs?
2006-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	do you have a copy of ntoskn or whatever and ntfs.dll or whatever around?
2006-06-29T13:59:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	reading ntfs is easy;  writing to it is hard, because writing is inherently dangerous when the people who wrote the original don't like you
2006-06-29T14:00:00.000Z	cwillu	grphx	but yes, it'd be nice if hd's could just be mounted in media automatically
