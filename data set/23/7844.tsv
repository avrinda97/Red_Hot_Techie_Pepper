2007-08-05T16:04:00.000Z	sauvin		I'd be much more interested in a Quake-like game that's more like the original Quake - an FPS, not a DM.
2007-08-05T16:05:00.000Z	sauvin		I don't know how well Debian sources would work under Ubuntu.
2007-08-05T16:05:00.000Z	sauvin		Or even something that can play the original Quake PAKs.
2007-08-05T16:06:00.000Z	sauvin		ET? BTW, doom isn't a problem.
2007-08-05T16:06:00.000Z	sauvin		Mmkay.
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	sauvin		Tremulous I tried. It's all about the DM.
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	sauvin		And Tremulous can't play Quake I paks.
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	sauvin		you know what, you're right, my Quake quavering is off topic here.
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	I *thoroughly* recommend that for Q1
2007-08-05T16:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	sauerbraten is a good 3d fps
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	iirc tremulous is even in apt
2007-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	aha, look for the darkplaces engine
2007-08-05T16:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	Q2 Demo is free as in beer, Q2 full is not available sadly
2007-08-05T16:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	a/s/l/uptime?
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	the updates are generally pretty much rock solid
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	accidents happen, but they *are* well-tested
2007-09-16T05:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	npe
2007-10-10T13:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	it was ok in its day
2007-10-10T13:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	I set it up on a PC for my Mum to use
2007-10-10T13:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	tbh there wasn't a lot to recommend it
2007-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	it's Debian with a crappy proprietary installer, everything running as root, and a bit of time and money spent on the UI
2007-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	Ubuntu has kind of replaced it now
2007-10-10T13:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	sauvin	Ubuntu has had a lot of time and money spent on the look and feel
