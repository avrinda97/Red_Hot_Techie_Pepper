2012-02-10T22:58:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		one more question: Does 11.10 run OK with 2.4 GHz Celeron and 1 GB RAM?
2012-02-10T22:58:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		how much RAM is good?
2012-02-10T22:59:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		thanks airtonix, auronandace
2012-02-10T22:59:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		but wait, doesn't Knoppix also use LDXE?
2012-02-10T23:00:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	i didn't realise knoppix was still going! i don't know what it uses and #ubuntu isn't really the best place to ask that
2012-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		oh ok
2012-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		sorry
2012-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	auronandace	airtonix thanks again for the suggestion
2012-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	no worries :)
2012-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		I got another question: could I just install Lubuntu over Ubuntu and keep my files?
2012-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	sure, sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
2012-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	then when you next login choose lxde
2012-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		ah
2012-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	auronandace	the problem is just that there seems to be a hardware malfunction
2012-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		thus, the keyboard lights up at PC start and the USB WLAN receiver isn't recognized
2012-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		thus I am looking for a cheap PC now to transplant the HDD to, auronandace
2012-02-10T23:05:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	auronandace	do you think the Celeron I described could hold out the lubuntu installation?
2012-02-10T23:05:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		i.e. would it be able to run it
2012-02-10T23:06:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	should do yes
2012-02-10T23:06:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		thanks auronandace
2012-02-10T23:06:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		so just do sudo apt-get lubuntu-desktop?
2012-02-10T23:06:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		ah with the install of course
2012-02-10T23:07:00.000Z	auronandace	Lunar_Lander	yes
