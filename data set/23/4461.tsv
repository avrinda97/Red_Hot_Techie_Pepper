2008-01-26T08:20:00.000Z	bkar		Anderson->  remove the hard disk from windows, and bring it over to ubuntu, mount it, and have fun
2008-01-26T08:20:00.000Z	bkar		Anderson-> mount it rw then
2008-01-26T08:21:00.000Z	bkar		Anderson-> neither do I, well both guess then :)
2008-01-26T08:23:00.000Z	bkar		RequinB4-> what kind of problem?
2008-01-26T08:24:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- i'm at the partition part, using the whole HDD (overwriting window$), and it gives 4.7GB to swap.  mmkay, i go to write and i get "Input/Output error during read on /dev/hda"
2008-01-26T08:26:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- been told it needs to be fscked.  I have, that was the guided partition suggestion - the HDD is 160GB, i have the space
2008-01-26T08:28:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- i don't know how to fsck, is the problem
2008-01-26T08:29:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- ... i mean, how do i get to a shell from the cd
2008-01-26T08:31:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- ok, fsck isn't a recognizable command
2008-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	keyvin - "-sh: sudo: not found"
2008-01-27T05:20:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- at this point i have little experience, so that would be just, say 'unmount /dev/hda' ?
2008-01-27T05:21:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- i'm off a knoppix cd
2008-01-27T05:27:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- thx for those commands... mounted (important) /dev/hdc, could mount /dev/hda1 /dev/hda2.  hda2 is bootable with a bunch of blocks, so i'd assume thats my window$ one i want to erase/parition
2008-01-27T05:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- my end goal is to fix an error, my short term goal is to install ubuntu so i can change driver to fix the error
2008-01-27T05:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- means i need to parition the drive, which gives me an I/O error
2008-01-27T05:31:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- i really don't care about any data on this comp
2008-01-27T05:31:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- its been inoperable for a few months now
2008-01-27T05:36:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- thx
2008-01-27T07:50:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- 6600 GT
2008-01-27T07:54:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- i'm just trying to get the horizontal/vertical rates down.  Sec i'll try those
2008-01-27T07:56:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- well, i'm trying to make it work
2008-01-27T08:09:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	-.- it worked earlier
2008-01-27T08:12:00.000Z	RequinB4	bkar	- lol i know, but it kind of is more use when you can see what you are doing :P
