2007-05-23T11:57:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		anyone have a server running with 7.04 ?
2007-05-23T11:57:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		looking for docs pertaining to this
2007-05-23T11:57:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		ubuntu.com has some docs, but I can't find any server related
2007-05-23T11:58:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	you just looking for a general guide?
2007-05-23T11:58:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		yep, either official or non, rococo
2007-05-23T11:58:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		!server
2007-05-23T11:59:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	I was about to do that for you ;-)
2007-05-23T11:59:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	 I am not running 7.04 Server Edition...
2007-05-23T11:59:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		though
2007-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	maybe Ill try using 6.10's at https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/index.html
2007-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	rococo		CapriSkye: there's this http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/index.html but I think it pertains more to using ubuntu as a server than ubuntu server itself
2007-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	that a good idea?
2007-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	jeez,  great minds think alike
2007-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	out of curiosity, why 6.10? I actually recommend 7.04 - it's very stable
2007-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		well, rococo if it works Ill make a recommendation for it to be listed among 7.04
2007-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	no, I am running 7.04 - but there is no server guide listed for 7.04 - only 6.10
2007-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	unless you can find it... I can't
2007-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		has anyone applied 6.10'
2007-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		's server guide to 7.04 ?
2007-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	there might not be a guide for 7.04 server yet
2007-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	rococo	I will appy 6.10's... wish me luck :)
2007-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	rococo	CaptainMorgan	good luck!
