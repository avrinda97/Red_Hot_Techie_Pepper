2005-10-14T13:06:00.000Z	raetsel		Hi, any PPC users on here today?
2005-10-14T13:06:00.000Z	raetsel		Hi Whistler is usually should startx automatically
2005-10-14T13:07:00.000Z	raetsel		Backup up anything you might was to keep AES_24_96 :o)
2005-10-14T13:07:00.000Z	raetsel		are you going for a dual boot system AES_24_96
2005-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	raetsel		EasterSunshine?
2005-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	raetsel		have your windows recovery CD handy in case you have problems with windows boot, AES
2005-10-14T13:09:00.000Z	raetsel		If you have that option AES then for a first time install it is always worth
2005-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	raetsel		you'll be able to mount your windows drive from Ubuntu afterwards if you want stuff
2005-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	raetsel		any PPC users on tonight
2005-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	yes. many of us
2005-10-14T13:12:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	there is a driver for that dongle, but it is 50% favorable
2005-10-14T13:12:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	netgear ma111 is also advised
2005-10-14T13:25:00.000Z	raetsel	nalioth	is the netgear MA111 easier to use that the DWL-122 do you know? do I still need the wan-ng stuff?
2005-10-14T13:26:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	you'll need the wlan-ng stuff
2005-10-14T13:28:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	if you are using a desktop machine, there are 'extenders' or whatever they are called that use ethernet cables
2005-10-14T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	not at all. they make wireless devices that plug in via ethernet
2005-10-14T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	i'm stupid and cant remember what they are called
2005-10-14T13:31:00.000Z	raetsel	nalioth	sort of like a wireless/ethernet bridge. Are these apple mac specific or generic devices
2005-10-14T13:31:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	yes that is it. any will do (the emac will only see a live ethernet connection)
2005-10-14T13:32:00.000Z	raetsel	nalioth	found one, called an AirStation ( bit pricey )but gives me an option. Cheers nalioth
2005-10-14T13:32:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	there are others
2005-10-14T13:46:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	np, enjoy
2005-10-14T13:47:00.000Z	nalioth	raetsel	##apple is also available for your ppclinux questions
