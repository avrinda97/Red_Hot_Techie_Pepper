2010-10-12T09:57:00.000Z	Susanna		Hi there, I updated netboox remix to 10.10 but update process has been cancelled in between. Managed to reinstall the rest, but I guess I need to reconfigure a few components
2010-10-12T09:57:00.000Z	Susanna		I cannot see the panel
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	Susanna		Neither has any of the windows a border and title bar
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	Susanna		I reconfigured metacity, but no success
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	I have the same problem I think
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	You solved it?
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	gantrixx		No, I'm just now trying to figure out what the problem is
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	do you get nothing but a purple screen and a mouse pointer?
2010-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	gantrixx		Is everyone having this problem?
2010-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	did you upgrade using the Update Manager?
2010-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	in the first place yes, but ran into heaps of space issues
2010-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	gantrixx		I didn't run into any space issues
2010-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	Susanna		I propose an easy apt-get upgrade
2010-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	Ok, I found out that when playing with the Themes I get the windows title bar back
2010-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	I see more that what you see
2010-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	I have nothing to play with
2010-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	can you start a console?
2010-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	gantrixx		just a mouse pointer
2010-10-12T10:02:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	try ctrl+alt+F1 or F2
2010-10-12T10:02:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	you see a console?
2010-10-12T10:02:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	nope, doesn't work
2010-10-12T10:03:00.000Z	Susanna	gantrixx	well mate, than I'm sorry. You could try to boot it in safe-mode?!
2010-10-12T10:03:00.000Z	gantrixx	Susanna	I can login to the GNOME desktop just fine
