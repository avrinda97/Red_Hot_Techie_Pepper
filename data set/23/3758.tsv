2008-01-29T04:55:00.000Z	y_		Can I get an expert opinion on upgrading to 7.10? With Fedora, I found nothing but anger and punishment with every new release.
2008-01-29T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 i have found it better to just keep ./home on its own partition, and do clean installs. :)  But im only on a 2 user system here.
2008-01-29T04:56:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- that's handy, except I'm running a 20 computer ubuntu lab =(
2008-01-29T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 you may want to look into netbooting the other 20 machines.
2008-01-29T04:57:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	Yep, its already set up like that (albeit in a strange way).
2008-01-29T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 depending on your needs. :)  Many people have no issues upgrading. I like to see how the new 'releases' are by default since i hang in the tech support channel.
2008-01-29T04:58:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- netboot will upgrade all clients?
2008-01-29T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 well im refering to where the machines boot up and get all the info from the server.  the clients dont even have hd;s :)
2008-01-29T04:59:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- my clients have hardrives and are connected by wireless.... its somewhat laggy doing that (but that's how they are set up now)
2008-01-29T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	Most of the time for upgradeissues. it tends to be wireless/video/other hardware driver issues. - so Wireless may be an issue. dependong onthe hardware.
2008-01-29T04:59:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- it gets a little intense when everyone is on the network. That's why I want "not-so-thin" clients. =)
2008-01-29T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	  there may be better ways  do handle it all. but as i said. ive rarely had to mess with upgrading.
2008-01-29T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 runing wires would help a lot i bet. :P
2008-01-29T05:00:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- hmm. You're probably right.
2008-01-29T05:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 of couese i regularry tranfer 8+gb files around my network -  My slow wireless wont cut it for me.
2008-01-29T05:01:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- I think changing the hardware setup is definitely in order. 20 client machiens all using wifi is a little nuts.
2008-01-29T05:01:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- I'm just wondering what mess to fix first at this lab.
2008-01-29T05:01:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	I'm trying to setup LDAP but got stuck
2008-01-29T05:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 yep.  Sounds like fun. There is that edubuntu release/variant thats designed for that sort of setup i belive
2008-01-29T05:02:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- that's what I've got... but it doesn't share users. (!!!)
2008-01-29T05:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 never notic4ed. :) i just have a 4 pc home lan.
2008-01-29T05:04:00.000Z	y_	Dr_willis	-- good luck. got stuck on the tutuorials I saw.
2008-01-29T05:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	y_	 i think default installed programs - and themes.
