2009-05-20T12:45:00.000Z	dragoncorp		anyone here know how to add a line to the grub boot to make vista selectable after installing ubuntu in a different harddrive, it whiped out the old boot info obviously but i need to be able to use vista or ubuntu, (vista installed first) then (ubuntu installed on a different harddrive)

2009-05-20T12:50:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	I presume sda5 is your windows install?
2009-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	i believe so its the only other internal hdd
2009-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	okay modify your menu.lst to look like http://pastebin.com/f1f5ab42
2009-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	should i copy and paste that one or change it to look like yours?
2009-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	you just need to add the last few lines
2009-05-20T12:54:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	lets see if it'll work first :)

2009-05-20T13:00:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	what was the error?
2009-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	i have ubuntu installed on primare IDE drive and vista installed on secondary sata drive but vista installed first could that be a problem?
2009-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	hmm, no as I followed the fdisk output. What was the error?
2009-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	as i am not intelligent enough to copy it down.... lmao
2009-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	if you could that would be really helpful
2009-05-20T13:06:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	in channel please, and your fdisk output said it was the second partition on the first drive
2009-05-20T13:06:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	wait, so which hard drive is ubuntu installed on?
2009-05-20T13:06:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	ubuntu is installed on the primary ide drive
2009-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	okay, and vista?
2009-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	dragoncorp	ziroday	vista is installed on the secondary SATA drive there is only one partition on each drive
2009-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	ziroday	dragoncorp	okay, then yes in that case try hd(1,0)
