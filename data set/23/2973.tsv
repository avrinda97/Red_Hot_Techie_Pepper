2008-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	is that like Wine?
2008-09-11T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	pretty much but its got some extra goodies, cedega is also closed source and paid for
2008-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	that's right... it's like $5 a month! Is there a free program that runs Photoshop?
2008-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	no idea, it not something of interest to me
2008-09-11T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	do you have a .cairo-dock folder in ~/
2008-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	not sure, it's in my Home/Niche/ folder... is that ~/ ??
2008-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	yes ~/ = /home/<your name>
2008-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	ok so yeah it's in there... What do I do?
2008-09-11T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	rm it
2008-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	can I sudo nautilus it too?
2008-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	never sudo nautilus, you use gksu nautilus
2008-09-11T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	if you are simply removing that folder then use rm -rf ./.cair-dock
2008-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	I think I did it with "sudo rm -r ~/cairo-dock" is that correct too or hazardous?
2008-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	niche	ActionParsnip	I wanted to uninstall it though b/c it's not working so I can try it again... Did that uninstall it or do I need to do more?

2008-09-11T15:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	niche	oh ok, if you close cairo-dock and delete that folder, you will get stock settings when it is next run
