2009-03-17T14:39:00.000Z	nate[oz]		Anyone have experience with this error: [Errno 5] Input/output error ????
2009-03-17T14:39:00.000Z	nate[oz]		from installing 8.10 desktop 64bit

2009-03-17T14:40:00.000Z	nate[oz]		partitions get built, files start copying and it stops at 66% and gives this error

2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	nate[oz]		yea, tried 2 different cds, a dvd and a usb stick
2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	nate[oz]		all the same
2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	nate[oz]		tried different ram even
2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	is that your initial post?
2009-03-17T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	did you md5 check your iso as well as verify the cd was ok once burned and booted to?
2009-03-17T14:43:00.000Z	nate[oz]	ActionParsnip1	haven't done the md5 check yet, but downloaded from official website 2 different times on 2 different cds
2009-03-17T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	doesnt matter
2009-03-17T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	you could pull it down a million times and never get a good image
2009-03-17T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	md5 check the iso you downloaded as well as check the cds are ok. Once we know its not those at fault you can progress, if you have bad disks in your hands you will have a tonne of issues due to incorrect data on the disks
2009-03-17T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	you shouold have checked it as soon as you downloaded it
2009-03-17T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	before you did anything
2009-03-17T14:56:00.000Z	nate[oz]	ActionParsnip1	you were right, md5 was incorrect, cheers for the time and effort
2009-03-17T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	i will reitterate
2009-03-17T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	ALWAYS check MD%
2009-03-17T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	ive seen a tonne of users coming in moaning about bad installs and its nearly always MD5
2009-03-17T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	if you download ANY large image file and there is an MD5, get that too and check what you have
2009-03-17T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	nate[oz]	then check the disk is consistant on the first boot screen to check the burn succeeded
