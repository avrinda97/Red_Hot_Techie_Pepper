2006-09-28T16:33:00.000Z	silvertip257_		rambo3_:  it now says /bin/sh: cant access: tty: job control turned
2006-09-28T16:34:00.000Z	silvertip257_		rambo3_: the computer diplays that
2006-09-28T16:34:00.000Z	silvertip257_		rambo3_: how do i get into resc mode?
2006-09-28T16:36:00.000Z	silvertip257_		rambo3_: how?
2006-09-28T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	push escape to get to the grub menu (it'll be righ tafter the POST screen) then select the "recovery mode"
2006-09-28T16:38:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	you already got to grub menu and selected rescue mode? then you're set, it just has to finish booting
2006-09-28T16:39:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	have you already selected the recovery console?
2006-09-28T16:40:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	then, it's just normal booting, I don't remember it taking any longer
2006-09-28T16:41:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	right, that's all you'll have, is a command prompt
2006-09-28T16:45:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	so it never gets past mounting the root filesystem?  But it boots up into normal mode fine?
2006-09-28T16:47:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	Ah, alright.  So, what did you do to your computer to break it?
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	er, what? so when you do normal boot you get a terminal?
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	so it doesn't "just not boot the GUI", And, it started doing this when? did you upgrade your kernel? did you... do anything else?  what was the most recent thing you did before it broke
2006-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	oh, so this is fresh?  Ah. 6.06?  alright.  Did you burn slow enough? (4x?)  Did you check the disk, andthe md5? are you using the Desktop or Alternate ISO?
2006-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	right, thats probably the problem, burn it again at 4x, also, make sure you have 6.06.1 if you're using the desktop
2006-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	because burners suck, they do caching and stuff and it messes up ISOs
2006-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	get 6.06.1, it's got an updated installer, 6.06 has some problems with it
2006-09-28T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	silvertip257_	er, what's wrong with IRC?
