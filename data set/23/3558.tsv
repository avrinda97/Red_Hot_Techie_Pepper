2009-09-05T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 I dont have any issues with wallpaper and twniview... clarify to the channel what you are trying todo.
2009-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	well, I'm actually running fluxbox, which uses fbsetbg (which uses Esetroot) to set the background.
2009-09-05T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 you mean set a sepetrate wallpaper for each head? or what exactly? Perzonally i just make my own custome 'very wide' wallpapers of the proper sizes to cover both monitors with seperate 'images'
2009-09-05T14:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 gnome does NOT have the feature to set a seperate wallpaper for each display. kde does.
2009-09-05T14:22:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	I have the impression that after running Esetroot my automatic screen turn-off on timeout has stopped, also!
2009-11-08T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 alt-ctrl-bs has been 'removed' use alt-sysreq-k now a days
2009-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	pressing SysReq triggers the print screen application.
2009-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 thats because you need a shift also :)
2010-07-10T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 what desktop are you running?
2010-07-10T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 ive noticed that if i run 'nautilus --no-desktop' under icewm or other window managers - nautilus can do the automounting
2010-07-10T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 not sure of other ways to get it going. :)
2010-07-10T14:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 its part of some gnoem serveices  i recall.
2010-07-10T14:39:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	do you know of a description of how Linux automounting works?  It seems both tangled and in constant flux at the moment!
2010-07-10T14:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	  theres dozens of automounting things that have poped up over the years. gnomes way is thelatest in a long line of them
2010-07-10T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 there is no 'linux' automounting. :) its just yet another service you use on linux
2010-07-10T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	  Trust me - you do not want to go  back to the old old old ways. :)
2010-07-10T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 i cant recall either. :) HAL id being replaced by somthing else now
2010-07-10T14:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 at least they fixed the bug where you could actually make your initial user be named 'root' wich was proberly what he would of used.. if he was able to. :)
2010-07-10T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 that low end a box.. well.. dont expect miracles. :)
2010-07-10T15:43:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	your mention of nvidia-settings reminds me: does the Nvidia driver *still* not properly understand xrandr?
2010-07-10T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	 ive never noticed the issue.
2010-07-10T15:45:00.000Z	Araneidae	Dr_Willis	when I run xrandr it only shows the compound desktop size: 3200x1200, no option for resizing or enabling individual screens from the command line
2010-07-10T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Araneidae	  thats where twinview asnd xrandr are fighting I guess.
