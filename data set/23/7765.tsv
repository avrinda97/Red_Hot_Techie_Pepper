2005-05-04T08:19:00.000Z	smouche		working: excellent video, but I haven't tried 3d or installed the binary
2005-05-04T08:20:00.000Z	smouche		sorry I don't have the URL
2005-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	smouche		cpu throttling works like a dream, nickrud, my fan almost never comes on!
2005-05-04T08:22:00.000Z	smouche		lol, nickrud!
2005-05-04T08:23:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	what kind of lappy?
2005-05-04T08:23:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	, hp pavilion zv5405us, amd64
2005-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	you said you haven't set up the wireless yet?
2005-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	-- I am too linux-ignorant to be spending my time coping with chroot, for now, anyway
2005-05-04T08:25:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	haven't used it but i set it up... i wrote a wiki on doing it with amd64, but i dont guess you'll need that heh
2005-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	-- maybe I'm thinking of the wrong command -- but I couldn't get some apps working with 64 bit os -- realplayer, for example
2005-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	but if it's a clean install i'd suggest just installing the amd64 version as to take true advantage of your resources.
2005-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	yeah some stuff doesn't really work... but so far, i've gotten real media to play via other players and i've gotten my stuff working
2005-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	-- this machine is quicker and snappier than its owner!  I'm happy as is, for now
2005-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	well you can still use my howto on setting up ndiswrapper for your wireless... just ignore the amd64 stuff and it'll be work fine
2005-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	now that i got all my sound stuff pretty well configured to run through esd i'm happy
2005-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	 I have no clue what artsd really does on my machine -- all I know is sometimes I have to kill it when kaffeine gets weird
2005-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	care if i PM you
2005-05-04T08:33:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	- excellent explanation! thanks
2005-05-04T08:35:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	you can say fucking in here
2005-05-04T08:44:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	not the scrollpad, no
2005-05-04T08:44:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	nah it's weird... i think hp must do something funky with them because it should work
2005-05-04T08:46:00.000Z	ircbot_	smouche	probably can, but i dunno... i haven't bothered... i bet you can do it like configuring dead keys on a keyboard
2005-05-04T08:53:00.000Z	smouche	ircbot_	that's on my looooong list of apps to try though
