2012-08-25T23:06:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	recommend using 'apt-get autoremove'
2012-08-25T23:07:00.000Z	viju	WeThePeople	apt-get autoremove , is that all? no need to specify package name?
2012-08-25T23:10:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	what purge does is leave the newest version entact if that is what you want
2012-08-25T23:11:00.000Z	viju	WeThePeople	I used autoremove chrome-browser
2012-08-25T23:11:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	did you want to remove the chromium browser
2012-08-25T23:12:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	purge and autoremove do diff things
2012-08-25T23:12:00.000Z	viju	WeThePeople	I don't know what it means , I just want chrome/chromium to work for me
2012-08-25T23:12:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	purge command deletes all old files, and autoremove deletes the whole program
2012-08-25T23:13:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	what is the problem?
2012-08-25T23:14:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	go to the software center to install the browser
2012-08-25T23:15:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	did you get it installed ok?
2012-08-25T23:26:00.000Z	viju	WeThePeople	I think he is a troll
2012-08-25T23:28:00.000Z	WeThePeople	viju	oh well
