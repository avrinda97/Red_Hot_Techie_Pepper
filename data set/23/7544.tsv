2010-02-21T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 thers web sites that can grab/convert videos from web sites if you put in the URL at tehir site
2010-02-21T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 thers several. i dont rember their names.
2010-03-05T18:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 what is it supposed to be?
2010-03-05T18:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 Rename it to somting.avi perhaps.. or just drag/drop onto a video player
2010-03-05T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 well NOTICE the .zip ? perhaps you need to unzip it?
2010-03-05T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 it could be part of a Multi-part zip archive also
2010-03-05T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 do you have more then 1 'part' ? a .001 .002 ,003 and so on?
2010-03-05T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 try 'unzip whatever.01'  using the proper filename perhaps
2010-03-05T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 i use the unzip command or 'unp'
2010-03-05T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 try winrar in wine perhaps
2010-03-05T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 that eror message you gave seems to tell me you gave it the wrong filename. or it did NOT want the .zip at the end of the argument
2010-03-05T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 i dont see where it says it dosent support multipart
2010-03-05T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 WiFoPa21.zip    does not look like a multipart zip name to me
2010-03-07T15:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 the mencoder and i also rcall 'ffmpeg' faq's mention how to fix such problems

2010-03-07T15:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 mencoder faq   perhaps...
2010-03-07T15:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 perhaps go to the mencoder homepage and look for their Faq link then
2010-03-07T15:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Moat	 you went to the mencoder homepage and read the faq in less then 2 min? amazing
