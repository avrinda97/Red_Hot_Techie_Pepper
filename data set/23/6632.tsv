2009-06-18T23:19:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	did you create the new user's home directory when you created the user?
2009-06-18T23:20:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	thanks for reply, i createed user by $sudo useradd test; sudo passwd test... tahts it ?
2009-06-18T23:21:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	if you didn't pass the optino to create the user's home directory, that's why it's not working
2009-06-18T23:24:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	hold on, lemme look
2009-06-18T23:25:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	-m
2009-06-18T23:25:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	$sudo useradd -m test ? it will creat directory/profile every thing ?
2009-06-18T23:26:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	yes
2009-06-18T23:29:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	thanks..!!
2009-06-18T23:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	np!
2009-06-18T23:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	no, but I've used it in 9.04
2009-06-18T23:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	 should be functionally equivalent
2009-06-18T23:31:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	i install ubuntu 8.04 server edition then later on i gave command $sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-06-18T23:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	hmmm, not an ideal way to do it
2009-06-18T23:31:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	i have install gnome i think so, actualy i am sitting at remote sde, so what is ideal way =
2009-06-18T23:32:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	the way I understand it, the server kernel lacks a lot of the preemption code which makes a desktop nice and snappy
2009-06-18T23:32:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	now how can i use NX at this server Edition..
2009-06-18T23:33:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	 read the NX documentation. or try #nx
2009-06-18T23:33:00.000Z	bingo	ectospasm	i have installed it without error now i am facing error at my side.. this (the remote  proxy closed the connection while negitiating the session)
2009-06-18T23:34:00.000Z	ectospasm	bingo	I dunno, try #nx
