2008-08-02T02:22:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: If i screw xorg up, or if my desktop is screwed up, etc, how do i boot straight into ubuntu terminal, and not into xdesktop ?
2008-08-02T02:23:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	if you b0rked X up and it won't start, the terminal login will eventually appear after a few failed attempts to start X
2008-08-02T02:24:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Well forget X, is there a way to boot straight into the terminal during boot up?
2008-08-02T02:24:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	yup, apt-get remove gdm
2008-08-02T02:24:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	... So your giving me a terminal command to use.. to get into terminal? :p
2008-08-02T02:25:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	so you're in X and you can't figure out how to get a terminal?
2008-08-02T02:26:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	No. If i am booting my computer up, and i do not want to go into X at all (for whatever reason), how would i do that.
2008-08-02T02:28:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	ok here you go, mv /etc/rc5.d/S30gdm /etc/rc5.d/K30gdm
2008-08-02T02:31:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Again, just to explain what i was talking about, i _randomly_ did not want X to load. If during a boot process, i wanted no desktop what-so-ever to load, i wanted to know how to do that. So moving files or settings AHEAD OF TIME is not possible, because it is not what i had wanted. :)
2008-08-02T02:32:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	renaming the rc2.d fill with stop it from loading everytiime, and all you would have to do after login to start X would be /etc/init.d/gdm start
2008-08-02T02:33:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Argh lol! No, renaming it ahead of time is done _ahead of time_. I can do many things to stop my desktop from loading _ahead of time_ (including just breaking it loi), but i was asking how to do it randomly. Ie, NOT planned. Eg: During the boot process hold down F345 and no desktop will load.
2008-08-02T02:33:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	I realize its impossible, i am trying to just explain it to you now.. heh
2008-08-02T02:34:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	but it is!
2008-08-02T02:34:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Not if your answers are any indication of its possibility.
2008-08-02T02:34:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	ctrl-alt-backspace
2008-08-02T02:35:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	So you can Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to go back into time?
2008-08-02T02:35:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	:p
2008-08-02T02:35:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	no but it will kill x :)
2008-08-02T02:35:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Because last i checked, that reboots X.. rebooting tends to mean it was already loaded.. something we already discussed, is NOT desired.
2008-08-02T02:35:00.000Z	krazihrz	Leefmc	hit the power button
2008-08-02T02:36:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	I really must be explaining this bad.. because you are either thick (doubtful), or this is so insanely confusing that you just dont get it :p
2008-08-02T02:36:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	As dumb as that sounds, its the closest answer you've had yet. :p
2008-08-02T02:38:00.000Z	Leefmc	krazihrz	Out of curiosity, did you finally understand what my original desire was?
