2005-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	SirFred		Hi.
2005-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	SirFred		Since a pair or three weeks the automounting feature don't work on my Hoary.
2005-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	SirFred		I'm  starting to think that perhaps it's a problem with my configuration or something so.
2005-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	SirFred		Any idea about what could I check?
2005-01-19T06:37:00.000Z	SirFred		The cdrom for example don't mount automatically, I need to go to the "computer" place and double click on it.
2005-01-19T06:37:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	I think it is mounted...though Nautilus is not registering it correctly
2005-01-19T06:37:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	Humm, let's see.
2005-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	When I put the cd into the unit, it's accessed as it was to be mounted.
2005-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	what kind of CD is this?
2005-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	Audio CDs should not be mounted at all
2005-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	data CDs should be mounted
2005-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	No, it's a data cd.
2005-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	sounds like something is weird with fstab -> mount
2005-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	Humm, don't know. What could I check?
2005-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	not sure
2005-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	if you put a audio CD in...does it get played in gnomecd?
2005-01-19T06:42:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	Let's see.
2005-01-19T06:42:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	the you seem to have the same problem as me then
2005-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	SirFred	scizzo	And we have no solution
2005-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	file a bug report about this or look if someone has had the same problem...
2005-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	I don't have a solution for this
2005-01-19T06:44:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	you are talking a lot about how nautilus is doing the CD stuff now
2005-01-19T06:46:00.000Z	scizzo	SirFred	find out if someone has had the same problem in the bug reports please
