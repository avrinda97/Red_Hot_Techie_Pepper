2009-04-01T00:20:00.000Z	unr3a1		I was curious if anyone else is using Ubuntu on a netbook with a resolution of 1024x600?
2009-04-01T00:21:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	I have used it on a dell with 1024 resolution
2009-04-01T00:22:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	did you notice that some system menus (such as the login window setting) dont fit on the netbook displays?
2009-04-01T00:23:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	thats actually quite common, i had to first resize the desktop to lower than the standard (800x600) then enable the nvidia drivers i could use, then resize it back to my desired 1024
2009-04-01T00:23:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	how do you do that?  I wouldnt know where to begin with that
2009-04-01T00:24:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	system>prefrences>screen screen resoultion.
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	the lowest resolution I can set it to from there is 1024x600
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	lower the resoultion to 800x600 and it will "blow up the images" but they should fit on your screen to allow you to update your drivers package under system > administration> hardware drivers
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	theres no listing for under 1024
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	no there is not
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	one second let me google
2009-04-01T00:25:00.000Z	unr3a1		kk
2009-04-01T00:26:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	do you have any hardware drivers installed yet?
2009-04-01T00:27:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	restricted ones i mean
2009-04-01T00:27:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	yes.  I do.  the ones for my intel 950
2009-04-01T00:28:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	looks like 1024 is the standard for the GMA 950 integrated
2009-04-01T00:29:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	that is correct
2009-04-01T00:30:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	could you go to system>administration>hardware drivers, and check that the recommended is active?
2009-04-01T00:31:00.000Z	illumin8	unr3a1	if its not active, activate the restricted drivers and reboot, see if your still having the errors.
2009-04-01T00:31:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	actually, the intel graphics is not included in that list.  only the broadcom wireless drivers
2009-04-01T00:32:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	looks like linux supports the intel intregrated 950 by default...
2009-04-01T00:37:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	any other suggestions?
2009-04-01T00:39:00.000Z	unr3a1	illumin8	?
