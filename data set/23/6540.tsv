2006-03-29T06:36:00.000Z	Kezzer		Ok, I installed kubuntu-desktop on my Ubuntu install and now don't want it
2006-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Kezzer		I did apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop with no avail
2006-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	apt-get remove libqt3-mt
2006-03-29T06:38:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	by the wy, in the future you should use aptitude instead of apt-get to install.  Then your command would have worked
2006-03-29T06:40:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	probably not but I don't know.  Why don't you try 'dpkg-reconfigure gdm' and restart X, and then remove kde
2006-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	try removing libqt3-mt, kde cannot function without libqt3-mt
2006-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	insert an ``again'  in there somewhere :)
2006-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	one thing at a time, take care of kde first
2006-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	my real problem is that this is the first time I've actually used linux ;)
2006-03-29T06:47:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	cool
2006-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	ps aux | grep gdm
2006-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	kezzer@kezzer:~$ sudo apt-get remove qtlib3-mt
2006-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	umm try what it suggests
2006-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	5.10
2006-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	you have gstreamer0.8-mad and totem still does not play mp3's?
2006-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	it can't find gstreamer0.8-mad
2006-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	you have to enable universe
2006-04-04T14:06:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	does sun's site have a .bin?
2006-04-04T14:07:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	yes
2006-04-04T14:07:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	those same instructions /should/ work afaik
2006-04-04T14:14:00.000Z	Kezzer	_jason	sudo apt-get install fakeroot java-package java-common that command doesn't work but I have the universe packages enabled in the repo
2006-04-04T14:15:00.000Z	_jason	Kezzer	you need multiverse as well iirc
