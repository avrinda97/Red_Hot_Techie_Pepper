2009-03-02T17:16:00.000Z	puppypusher	ActionParsnip	I get an error message when download the driver.
2009-03-02T17:40:00.000Z	puppypusher	ActionParsnip	I've done everything that page you sent me said to do, but I can't run step #3 on that page because it won't run an auto-installer. Any ideas?
2009-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	puppypusher	ActionParsnip	How do I configure it, other than what that page told me to do? I copied and pasted the entire thing over to my xorg.conf
2009-03-02T17:55:00.000Z	puppypusher	ActionParsnip	does this mean I am using that driver right now?
2009-03-02T17:58:00.000Z	puppypusher	ActionParsnip	done. Am I now using the new driver?
