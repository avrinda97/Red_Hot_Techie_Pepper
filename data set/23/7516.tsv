2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		Hi all
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		I'm having a problem with Ubuntu
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		(Gnome, specifically)
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		My menu bar is, uh, gone
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		so is my taskbar
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		that's after restarting
2005-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	Funk4544		o_O
2005-07-08T15:15:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	`gnome-panel'
2005-07-08T15:15:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Run that command.
2005-07-08T15:22:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Have you tried to re run the gnome-panel?
2005-07-08T15:24:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	not yet. how do I do that?
2005-07-08T15:24:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Run `gnome-panel' from a terminal or the GNOME run dialog.
2005-07-08T15:28:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	That's just a warning, you can safely ignore those.
2005-07-08T15:30:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to ignore those GNOME warning. :)
2005-07-08T15:30:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	hehe
2005-07-08T15:34:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Those are the commands to get back to your previous shell.
2005-07-08T15:34:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	ooh like what?
2005-07-08T15:35:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	other than that, I mean. :)
2005-07-08T15:43:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	It did not kill your session, it just switched you to a virtual terminal.
2005-07-08T15:44:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	eh? virtual terminal?
2005-07-08T15:44:00.000Z	Funk4544	socomm	what's that?
2005-07-08T15:47:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	Because the developers have a contract with the devil.
2005-07-08T15:49:00.000Z	socomm	Funk4544	You choose it at login under the session option.
