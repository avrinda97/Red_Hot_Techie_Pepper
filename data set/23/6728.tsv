2006-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	vincenz		so how do I do a dist-upgrade?
2006-03-05T07:01:00.000Z	vincenz		or it's recommended to wait?
2006-03-05T07:01:00.000Z	vincenz		thx
2006-03-05T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	you have to change the repos from breezy to dapper or whatever your going to
2006-03-05T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	be warned your computer may not work after dist-upgrade
2006-03-05T07:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	may not work at all
2006-03-05T07:04:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	well yes but for certain specific bordercase scenarios?
2006-03-05T07:04:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	or for the center of the gaussian curve ?
2006-03-05T07:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	may not boot (dapper is not stable in any sense of the word)
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	dapper will be released in april
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	is it possible to steal certain packages out of the repo "like libgpod and gtkpod"?
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	released in april and it's still not halfstable??
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	those have not been backported so no
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	define half stable?
2006-03-05T07:05:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	you'd think that it'd be at least semistable except for certain borderline cases
2006-03-05T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	unstable = may break without notice one day work next day not work
2006-03-05T07:06:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	yes but typically those cases are rare
2006-03-05T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	no they are not rare
2006-03-05T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	its not in beta form yet
2006-03-05T07:06:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	and they plan to release it in less than 2 months o.O?
2006-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	its in beta form
2006-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vincenz	wont be out until june 1st
2006-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	vincenz	gnomefreak	thank you
