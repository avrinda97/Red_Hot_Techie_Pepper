2009-07-17T17:56:00.000Z	Dekko		Does anyone here know how to properly install this theme on Ubuntu? It doesn't want to work http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/eGTK-83104033
2009-07-17T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	dl the zip file, extract to where you downloaded it, then drag the tar.gz to the theme manager
2009-07-17T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	just drag the tar.gz
2009-07-17T18:02:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	But the theme still does not show up .....
2009-07-17T18:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	it asked me if I wanted to enable it
2009-07-17T18:03:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	and did it work? ;-)
2009-07-17T18:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	yep
2009-07-17T18:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	not sure what the deb is for, will investigate , perhaps the readme has some clues :)
2009-07-17T18:04:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	it does not work here for me.
2009-07-17T18:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	same thing here, dragging it and installing it and no change, then reverting to another and re-dragging (and getting an error) installed  it
2009-07-18T15:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	the egtk one?
2009-07-18T15:03:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	yes thats the one
2009-07-18T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	I got it from gnome-look iirc, it works fine
2009-07-18T15:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	took two tries to install though
2009-07-18T15:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	unzip, grab tar.gz to theme manager, it will ask if you want to install choose yes
2009-07-18T15:04:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	thats exactly how I did it.
2009-07-18T15:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	I got a no install the first time, clicked another theme, then tried again, and it gave an error but worked (oddly enough)
2009-07-18T15:06:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	is there anything ELSE that needs to be installed for the GTK themes to work??
2009-07-18T15:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	it worked for me, but I had to drag it twice for some odd reason
2009-07-18T15:11:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	Now here's a weird thing - I install the theme, it doesn't show up in the theme selector BUT when i go customize I can select the individual bits and pieces with no problem.... but as a custom theme not as a "theme" selectable in the selector .... what is missing???
2009-07-18T15:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	seems it is oddly written theme, but all the bits and pieces are fairly nice
2009-07-18T15:12:00.000Z	Dekko	bazhang	If you have a suggestion for something even more slick than this - let me know.
2009-07-18T15:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Dekko	gnome-look.org highest rated has the most
