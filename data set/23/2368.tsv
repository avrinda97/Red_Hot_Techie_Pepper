2009-04-04T09:45:00.000Z	him89	jebdm	does it not show up in places?
2009-04-04T09:46:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	I don't use Gnome, so I don't know, but I'm going to assume it doesn't.  Is there any way to check without restarting my session?
2009-04-04T09:47:00.000Z	him89		type in mounts
2009-04-04T09:47:00.000Z	him89	jebdm	and does it display the mounted dirs?
2009-04-04T09:47:00.000Z	jebdm		nope, doesn't show up
2009-04-04T09:48:00.000Z	him89		type in sudo mount /dev/sdxy /media/sdxy
2009-04-04T09:48:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	it's not listed under mount, but mount does list everything i would expect
2009-04-04T09:48:00.000Z	him89		x is the hard disk number and y is partition number
2009-04-04T09:48:00.000Z	him89		and the /media/sdxy should exist
2009-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	nope, it doesn't work, that was my problem
2009-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	him89		what it says?
2009-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	I did try to mount it under a different directory, though (/mount/arch/, which does exist).  Should that make a difference?
2009-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	him89		you need to have a dir name /media/arch
2009-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	him89		or it wont work
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	him89		type in mkdir /media/arch
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	him89		and then the mount
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	I did, but for some reason mounting it under media seems to work
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	him89		do a chmod 0777 /mount as root
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	him89		and then mkdir /mount/arch
2009-04-04T09:50:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	oh, yeah, shit, that was the problem, thanks
2009-04-04T09:51:00.000Z	him89		works now?
2009-04-04T09:51:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	i just forgot to give /mount the right permissions
2009-04-04T09:51:00.000Z	jebdm	him89	yeah, great, thanks
