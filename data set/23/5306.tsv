2006-12-30T10:05:00.000Z	ken		IsseMike: Have you changed the HDDs ports or changed them by making them master/slave AFTER the install?
2006-12-30T10:06:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	nope, nothing changed after install
2006-12-30T10:06:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	Do you get GRUB?
2006-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	nope, all I get when it tries to boot up is the message "error loading operating system"
2006-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	OK, there are no seperate setting for doing a seperate HDD install! I am having windows/ubuntu one two seperate HDDS
2006-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	Tell me which is the master and which is the slave?
2006-12-30T10:08:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	is the message "Error loading operating system" something that Ubuntu would be likely to give?  Or is that my bios talking?
2006-12-30T10:08:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	Tell me is Windows-master or Ubuntu is master?
2006-12-30T10:08:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	I have three drives total.  The windows drive is on an SATA channel.  The Linux drive is the slave on the second IDE chain
2006-12-30T10:09:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	And you installed GRUB on Ubuntu's HDD or Window's HDD?
2006-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	I don't know anything about GRUB.  I went through the ubuntu installer and told it to install everything on the slave drive of the second IDE chain
2006-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	possible it installed GRUB on the master drive of that chain?
2006-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	You know how to make a HDD master/slave?
2006-12-30T10:11:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	as in, whether it is first or second on the IDE cable?
2006-12-30T10:11:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	You know about the jumpers in a HDD, that you can change to make a driver master-slave?
2006-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	yeah... pretty sure this one is set to cable-select... should it be set differently?
2006-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	Do this, make Ubuntu's HDD as Master and windoze as slave and then try to boot-up the PC
2006-12-30T10:14:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	the windows drive is an SATA drive, it's not on the same chain as the drive I'm trying to install to, which is IDE
2006-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	Sorry, i can't help you anymore
2006-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	IsenMike	ken	am I confusing my terms here?  SATA drives aren't master or slave, right?  It's just one drive connected by one cord to the mobo.
2006-12-30T10:18:00.000Z	ken	IsenMike	I can't be of any more help to you as a SATA drive is not something i am familiar with
