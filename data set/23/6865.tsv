2005-12-09T14:51:00.000Z	ravi_		hi
2005-12-09T14:52:00.000Z	ravi_		has any one configured apache in ubuntu?
2005-12-09T14:52:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	thats not a great question. how would you like it configured?
2005-12-09T14:54:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	I have configured it in redhat. But in ubuntu, the configuration files are located in some other place. So I was wondering where it is located and how to start the httpd server
2005-12-09T14:55:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	you install apache. then the conf file is in /etc/apache/httpd.conf
2005-12-09T14:55:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	have you installed anything in ubuntu yet?
2005-12-09T14:55:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	not the source but I have installed using apt-get plenty of times
2005-12-09T14:55:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	only binaries
2005-12-09T14:56:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	install apache, or apache2
2005-12-09T14:56:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	How do I find which is installed ?
2005-12-09T14:56:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	will apt-cache search apache do the trick ?
2005-12-09T14:56:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	use synaptic, or aptitude in a terminal, aptitude search apache and see whether there is a i to the left of the package name.
2005-12-09T14:57:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	I dont use apt-cache/apt-get
2005-12-09T14:58:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	that is a huge list for me. and there is apache and apache2 and in the left side there is a 'p'
2005-12-09T14:58:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	that means it iss not installed. install one.
2005-12-09T14:59:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	do you recommend apache or apache2
2005-12-09T15:02:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	you know, I dont recommend anything like that, I am not qualified. either will work if it is just for your personal use, I think.
2005-12-09T15:02:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	So do I use apache or apache2 ? Which do you feel is better of the two?
2005-12-09T15:03:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	I have used alien to install inscape deb package in fedora
2005-12-09T15:03:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	to install a rpm driver on ubuntu will likely lead him to reeinstall the system. and the BinaryDriverHowto/ATI page of the wiki likely explains how to install the ATI drivers safely.
2005-12-09T15:05:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	I didn't know his problem.  Sorry
2005-12-09T15:05:00.000Z	dabaR	ravi_	no need to be sorry.
2005-12-09T15:05:00.000Z	ravi_	dabaR	So do I use apache or apache2 ? Which do you feel is better of the two?
