2010-02-25T08:06:00.000Z	mondragon		yeah, so dd'ing a .dmg onto a usb stick under macos x doesn't result in something bootable...
2010-02-25T08:06:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	because dmgs are OSX only, typically.
2010-02-25T08:06:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	well, I converted the ubuntu netbook iso to a dmg using hdiutil
2010-02-25T08:07:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	as per the instructions on the ubuntu web site.. :-)
2010-02-25T08:07:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Mac%20OS%20X ?
2010-02-25T08:07:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	yeah, that...no joy
2010-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	that guide does not reference hdiutil.
2010-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	also the mac section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2010-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	well, hdiutil is how you make the .img in the first place
2010-02-25T08:13:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	yeah, sure enough it isn't marked as bootable for some reason
2010-02-25T08:14:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	what are you attempting to install *to*?
2010-02-25T08:14:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	HP mini 110....I've done it this way before, I just can't seem to remember how I made the USB stick
2010-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	use an existing Ubuntu system, or Windows?
2010-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	if I had any of those things, I would use them
2010-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	worst case, boot OSX from a live CD and use the Ubuntu enviorn there.
2010-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	I think I'll probably resort to booting a vmware VM from a live ISO before I do that.. :-)
2010-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	*boot your mac
2010-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	I have my dell m1330 dual-booting OS X and Ubuntu, so I'm personally happy. Wifi and ethernet don't work, though. :P
2010-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	wow, even the wired ethernet doesn't work?  :-(
2010-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	lfaraone	mondragon	Intel card, I think. I had to resort to a USB-eth adapter.
2010-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	that sucks
2010-02-25T08:20:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	phooey, vmware it is, it seems...
2010-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	mondragon	lfaraone	I've devolved to using unetbootin in a VM...lets see how well that worked...
