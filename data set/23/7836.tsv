2007-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	quittt		hello
2007-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	quittt		I want to know what should I remove to make my Ubuntu faster....
2007-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	quittt		I have a Pentium 800 mhz with 128 RAM
2007-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	what desktop are you using, gnome?
2007-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	try xubuntu
2007-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	you could really use more ram, too
2007-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	 I know that
2007-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	it's going to be slow, as you've noticed
2007-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	it is not THAT slow
2007-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	you were asking how to make it faster :p
2007-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	 hehe
2007-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	 well... it is better than WinXP
2007-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	I would imagine
2007-09-26T05:13:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	you should try to salvage scrap computers for more ram :)
2007-09-26T05:13:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	hehe
2007-09-26T05:16:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	damn... this OS is very great... it corrects your languages mistakes...
2007-09-26T05:17:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	well... if there is Google in Latin, why not?
2007-09-26T05:18:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	is there any light console?
2007-09-26T05:18:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	you mean an x terminal? there's xterm, not that I think any of the other terminals are particularly heavy
2007-09-26T05:19:00.000Z	quittt	astro76	I used to use aterm
2007-09-26T05:20:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	do "aptitude search term" or search in synaptic, but yeah it looks like it does
2007-09-26T05:38:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	sudo uses your user password
2008-02-02T20:07:00.000Z	astro76	quittt	anythig that uses the cdparanoia library, like Grip
