2010-03-27T19:47:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	remove the lockfile and retry
2010-03-27T19:48:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	I did that but the log file being regenerated in every boot.
2010-03-27T19:48:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	err did you install drivers of any kind?
2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	Yes I try the FGLRx driver for my ATI RADEON x1200 series
2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	the graphic keep loading on safe mode..
2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	oh so you get vesa(low resolution) graphics then?
2010-03-27T19:50:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	yes, I get VESA..
2010-03-27T19:50:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	did you install any drivers? are you on karmic with the latest update, what graphic card(s) do you have
2010-03-27T19:51:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	yes, I am on karmic with fglrx driver for ATI Radeon x1200series
2010-03-27T19:52:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	did you manually install the flgrx driver or did you use the hardware driver program from ubuntu
2010-03-27T19:52:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	my kernel is 2.6.31-20 generic
2010-03-27T19:53:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	i manually installed
2010-03-27T19:53:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	the provided driver via Hardware driver did that one work/?
2010-03-27T19:54:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	it kind work but could not have compiz work properly...
2010-03-27T19:54:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	understandeable, but manually installin drivers is a bad idea
2010-03-27T19:54:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	my suggestion is to remove the drivers you installed completely and revertin to the supplied drivers
2010-03-27T20:01:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	if you installed it manually from a tarball or bin then synaptic wont be able to remove drivers
2010-03-27T20:14:00.000Z	okapi14	acicula	I  remove the fglrx driver now on the boot I have "module flgrx not found"
2010-03-27T20:15:00.000Z	acicula	okapi14	i dont know how to fix that
