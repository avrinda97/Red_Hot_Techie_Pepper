2008-07-04T10:23:00.000Z	shoeunited		Well, I appreciate the try. :)  But I know it has bluetooth cause the documentation says it's onboard and I got a button.  lol
2008-07-04T10:23:00.000Z	shoeunited		I did.  They all turn up red.
2008-07-04T10:24:00.000Z	shoeunited		Er.
2008-07-04T10:24:00.000Z	shoeunited		To say, none of them worked :/
2008-07-04T10:25:00.000Z	shoeunited		Well, I'll try restarting the service first.  Then I'll take a peek @ the bios.
2008-07-04T10:25:00.000Z	shoeunited		It's probably something stupid like turned off on bios. T_T
2008-07-04T10:25:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	whats wrong ?
2008-07-04T10:26:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	bluetooth is enabled on the phone ?
2008-07-04T10:26:00.000Z	shoeunited	esac	yes
2008-07-04T10:26:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	from terminals, what does 'hcitool scan' show ?
2008-07-04T10:27:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	then its not finding a driver for your bluetooth receiver on your laptop
2008-07-04T10:28:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	most laptops expose the bluetooth receiver as USB to linux. what does 'lsusb' show ?
2008-07-04T10:28:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	mine shows "Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0a5c:2110 Broadcom Corp. "
2008-07-04T10:29:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	pastebin it
2008-07-04T10:38:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	can i ask how you know you have bluetooth on the laptop ?
2008-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	ok i ask because i was reading that some 4520's dont have it :)
2008-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	a couple of other posts ive read say that bluetooth works out of the box on hardy. do you get the bluetooth icon in your system tray ?
2008-07-04T10:41:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	when i run 'hcitool scan' it says Scanning ... and then just goes back to a prompt since there are no devices. i know this probably isnt helpful at all :(
2008-07-04T10:41:00.000Z	shoeunited	esac	I recieved the same results.
2008-07-04T10:42:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	oh, i thought you said it said "no such device" ?
2008-07-04T10:43:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	what does "hcitool dev" list ?
2008-07-04T10:44:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	ok well that confirms that it isnt finding your bluetooth adapter.
2008-07-04T10:45:00.000Z	esac	shoeunited	good idea :)
