2007-10-21T19:42:00.000Z	xsacha		hey i am using the gutsy gibbon RC and was wondering why i am not receiving any updates. previously, when i ran the RC of feisty fawn i received updates even after the release
2007-10-21T19:43:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	try "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2007-10-21T19:43:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	oh ok, a dist upgrade
2007-10-21T19:52:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	i tried the dist-upgrade and have the same thing by the way...    it is possible there were no updates since the release candidate?
2007-10-21T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	no, i'm pretty sure there *were* updates from the RC... not from the latest dailies, but from the RC, yes. pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-10-21T19:55:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	ok, i havent had any updates since i installed it about 4-5 days ago. here is the sources.list: http://pastebin.ca/744468
2007-10-21T19:56:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	4-5 days ago? then it might have been a later version than the actual RC. are you sure it was the RC and you didn't get any "immediate" updates when you installed?
2007-10-21T19:56:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	sources.list seems ok
2007-10-21T19:57:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	i got some immediate updates.. but it was just after RC was released (maybe the next day)
2007-10-21T19:57:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	give me the output of     apt-cache policy tzdata     (that package was updated recently)
2007-10-21T19:59:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	jessie^^: the amount of used RAM, as seen in "top" or "free", doesn't mean much of anything.
2007-10-21T19:59:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	apt-cache policy tzdata  gives me 2007f-3ubuntu1 for Candidate and Installed
2007-10-21T20:00:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	uhm, there is 2007h-0ubuntu0.7.10 in gutsy-updates
2007-10-21T20:00:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	so im missing something?
2007-10-21T20:01:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	*i* am missing something, for sure. your sources.list has gutsy-updates enabled, and yet you aren't getting those updates.
2007-10-21T20:02:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	try temporarily removing the "au." from your mirrors... perhaps the australian mirrors are having problems?
2007-10-21T20:02:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	remove also the first line (the CD line), you won't probably need that and it will just be a nuisance
2007-10-21T20:03:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	hang on, im getting a tonne of 'Ign[ored]' when updating.. ill pastebin
2007-10-21T20:03:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	yes, thanks
2007-10-21T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	i use KDE... highlight and middle click *should* work though
2007-10-21T20:05:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	yeah it works in KDE. not working here in gnome :(
2007-10-21T20:05:00.000Z	xsacha	LjL	ill just pipe to a file and then upload it
2007-10-21T20:07:00.000Z	LjL	xsacha	uhm there are some igns but i'm not sure that should be an issue itself
