2008-07-12T00:32:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		i'm mapping a network share in fstab, but i've noticed it send the username/password in clear text
2008-07-12T00:32:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		does nautilus do this with it's connect to server?
2008-07-12T00:34:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		whats the best way to map a windows network share?
2008-07-12T00:35:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		nautilus in gutsy is broke, and i usually use "connect to server" to map network shares, but hey they broke that. so now i have to do it through fstab
2008-07-12T00:35:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		what's the best protocol to do it?
2008-07-12T00:36:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		i as trying cifs but i see it sends passwords in plain text
2008-07-12T00:38:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		that's kinda useless?
2008-07-12T00:38:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		it's not my share to administer
2008-07-12T00:39:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		it's a network share i map over a vpn
2008-07-12T00:40:00.000Z	Lynet	DieseL`nix	What is it connecting to? smb/cifs/windows networking supports a bunch of different authentication methods.
2008-07-12T00:40:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		well it's just a windows share on a win2003 box
2008-07-12T00:41:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		i want to know what's the most secure way to map it with linux
2008-07-12T00:42:00.000Z	Lynet	DieseL`nix	Hmm. Check the samba documentation, there should be a way to tell it to only use ntlm/ntlmv2
2008-07-12T00:43:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Lynet	i reckon nautilus smb support does that
2008-07-12T00:43:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		but gutsy broke it
2008-07-12T00:44:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		and the only way to fix is to get the latest nautilus - not available for gutsy yet#
2008-07-12T00:44:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		i could get a .deb but apparently that's not a good idea?
2008-07-12T00:47:00.000Z	Lynet	DieseL`nix	Try adding "client lanman auth = no " to smb.conf and see if that helps.
2008-07-12T00:49:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Lynet	just out of interest, what would be bad about installing a nautilus .deb that was above the version ubuntu repositories have
2008-07-12T00:50:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		:S
2008-07-12T00:50:00.000Z	Lynet	DieseL`nix	It might fail/not work. Should normally not have any really nasty effects since a .deb will most of the time uninstall fine.
2008-07-12T00:50:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	Lynet	but if i insall it over my current nautilus, when i uninstall... i would be without nautilus?
2008-07-12T00:51:00.000Z	Lynet	DieseL`nix	As in, if the new nautilus doesn't work you can uninstall it and reinstall the one from the repositories.
