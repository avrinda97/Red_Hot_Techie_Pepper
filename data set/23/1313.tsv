2010-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	I can't connect my computer with my account
2010-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	there is no "Add this computer" button anywhere
2010-05-30T07:53:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	if you use the web login on a new machine it should allow you to add the new pc straight after login
2010-05-30T07:53:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	I'm following this "guide" here https://one.ubuntu.com/support/installation/ and at step 8, there is no "add this computer" button anywhere
2010-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	it did not
2010-05-30T07:55:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	are you sure the computer has not already been added?
2010-05-30T07:56:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	I get this message when I go to the "Computers added to this account" : You haven't added any computers or devices to your Ubuntu One account
2010-05-30T07:56:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	though I have a "Ubuntu One" directory in my home folder....
2010-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	the Ubuntu One window says that I'm not connected
2010-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	thats even after you log in via the Applications, Internet, Ubuntu one?
2010-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	yes
2010-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	what version of ubuntu are you using and what browser?
2010-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	actually, Ubuntu One is in System > preferences > Ubuntu One. I'm using Lucid
2010-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	Ubuntu One opens Firefox for browsing, so I'm using that
2010-05-30T08:03:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	 ahh ok, you should also find with Lucid Ubuntu one preferences, and from there you should have some extra options, im not using lucid so i dont know for sure sorry, but try options/preferences
2010-05-30T08:04:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted		hello room, im using 9.10, ive had a look through the forums and tried some suggestions there and found that enabling KMS solved my ATI RADEON 9200 (pci) problem i was having, but then it stopped working for no apparent reason, anyone able to help?
2010-05-30T08:04:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	there are no options/preferences, only three tabs : Account, Devices, Services. On "Devices" I can click on "Connect", but the button is then grayed, and nothing happens
2010-05-30T08:06:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	if you enter your details on the account tab after logging out from the web interface can you then log in from there?
2010-05-30T08:08:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	I can log in, out, in again.... it never ask me to add a device, or computer, or anything
2010-05-30T08:08:00.000Z	yanick_	Dizkonnekted	I have nothing connected to my account, and no way to add anything
2010-05-30T08:12:00.000Z	Dizkonnekted	yanick_	try logging out of everything, then only log in using the browser, it might be an issue of multiple log ins or something
