2009-08-30T05:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	Kodak  Easyshare Software is bad,  and  won't  just work in Wine
2009-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	Kodeak cameras  should be able to use those with digikam and I think f-spot as well
2009-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	i know, it sucks.  i was hoping some smart person here made their ow
2009-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	of course  that silly  program could be  Windows virtual machined,  on computers with enough RAM
2009-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	hp mini over here with 8 gigs to work with... figured ide ask around
2009-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	well  that's way  more RAM than what is needed for a Windows virtual machien
2009-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	8 GB hd.. :)
2009-08-30T05:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	you can make your own small version of XP or Vista if you know what your doing
2009-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	using the bought CD/DVD
2009-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	i could but i wouldnt want to dedicate ~30% of my storage to getting my printer working.  pretty full with what i got
2009-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	oh printer not camera
2009-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	i know i could nlite it
2009-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	yes that's what I meant or vlite
2009-08-30T05:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	those two programs for the Windows,  and  the bot stuff for your printer?
2009-09-02T07:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	not sure about that, but   with the alternate CD you can encrypt a partition or the whole of a hard disk
2009-09-02T07:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	well as long as it's  just Linux partitions on the hard disk or whatever for the whole hard disk
2009-09-02T07:18:00.000Z	bboru	sebsebseb	alternate cd?
2009-09-02T07:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	and then if you forget the password for the ecnrypted  stuff, well good luck to you
2009-09-02T07:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	basically  you have had it then, or you have had it
2009-09-02T09:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bboru	Redhat itself is  FOSS,  hence  CentOS for example as well,   and  Redhat charge for support,  and  yes off topic
