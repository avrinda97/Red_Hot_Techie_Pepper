2010-07-09T20:58:00.000Z	roy__		pici: how to check my ubuntu cd for errors
2010-07-09T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	roy__	Boot from it, there should be an option you can pick that says 'Check CD for defects'
2010-07-09T21:02:00.000Z	Pici	roy__	You mean Wubi or within a virtual machine?
2010-07-09T21:06:00.000Z	Pici	roy__	Start typing the nick of the person you are addressing and press your tab key.
2010-07-09T21:10:00.000Z	roy__	Pici	can u help me with that
2010-07-09T21:10:00.000Z	Pici	roy__	If there are multiple nicks, just press tab again, most IRC clients are smart enough to move to the next match.
