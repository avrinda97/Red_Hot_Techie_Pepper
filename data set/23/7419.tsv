2011-10-13T03:02:00.000Z	Sphearion		best part of 11.10.. native adaptec 6405 aacraid drives.. no more wasted time compiling that module for installs... yay!
2011-10-13T03:03:00.000Z	hilacha	Sphearion	are you talking about embedded adaptec driver in the kernel?
2011-10-13T03:03:00.000Z	Sphearion	hilacha	i mean i just installed the daily on one of my servers with that card in it and I didn't have to add steps for it to see the arrays. soo nice
2011-10-13T03:04:00.000Z	Sphearion		i think there was the later end of the 2.x kernels that had support for it to. but not during install of 11.04 as it was 1 kernel version too old
2011-10-13T03:05:00.000Z	hilacha	Sphearion	cool. i work with raid cards in linux, but we uses debian
2011-10-13T03:05:00.000Z	Sphearion		We are an Ubuntu shop.
2011-10-13T03:05:00.000Z	hilacha		i dont know if already there are support to that board in squeeze
2011-10-13T03:05:00.000Z	Sphearion		and those cards used to give me hell
2011-10-13T03:06:00.000Z	hilacha		the problem is recompile the kernel to support it?
2011-10-13T03:06:00.000Z	Sphearion		the problem was it was in a rpm from adaptec so during install you had to dkms and alien the package
2011-10-13T03:06:00.000Z	Sphearion		at least in 11.04
2011-10-13T03:07:00.000Z	hilacha	Sphearion	do you sell hardware for ubuntu? what is your url shop?
2011-10-13T03:07:00.000Z	Sphearion		we don't sell. shop meaning all our servers are ubuntu and our desktops are all ubuntu.
2011-10-13T03:07:00.000Z	hilacha		is common a rc before a final release in ubuntu releases>
2011-10-13T03:07:00.000Z	hilacha		?
2011-10-13T03:08:00.000Z	hilacha	Sphearion	ok :) do you use adaptec 2405?
2011-10-13T03:08:00.000Z	Sphearion		no only the 6405
2011-10-13T03:09:00.000Z	Sphearion		and alot of asus pike cards
2011-10-13T03:09:00.000Z	hilacha		pike cards? what it that?
2011-10-13T03:10:00.000Z	Sphearion		a pike is like a manufacturer sas card for asus motherboards. it works like the adaptec. but it uses the motherboard sata connectors. and has a very special connector kinda like a really stretched out PCI
2011-10-13T03:12:00.000Z	hilacha	Sphearion	humm. i understood. Intel calls it a zero channel raid board (i guess). we already used that, but a lot time ago, witch scsi.
2011-10-13T03:12:00.000Z	Sphearion	hilacha	http://us.estore.asus.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2049 thats a pike
