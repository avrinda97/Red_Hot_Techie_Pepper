2009-02-10T10:34:00.000Z	juniecho		hello, a simple question, what is the simplist way to mount a filesystem with nice gui, in ubuntu intrepid?
2009-02-10T10:35:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	it should be automatic in most cases if you are already in the gui shell (gnome)
2009-02-10T10:37:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	suppose you insert a removable media (e.g. portable hd) into usb host port; it will shortly pop up an icon on the desktop representing the mounted volume
2009-02-10T10:38:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	if you've already mounted the volume once, and you've put it in your fstab, you can 'mount -a' to ensure it's really mounted, and it will remount at next login
2009-02-10T10:41:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	yep, the symbolic link
2009-02-10T10:42:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	probably, TBH i've as yet not tried that very thing yet
2009-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	juniecho	bernz	well i successfully created a shortcut, thanks... but there is one more thing, i am trying to assign windows+e short key to bring nautilus file manager, but i think i'm doing something wrong, it didn't work... where should i start
2009-02-10T10:47:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	that's a good q; i would probably check the FAQs at ubuntu HQ, or maybe Websearch for "faq ubuntu windows keys" or something similar
2009-02-10T10:50:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	sorry, i'm not acquainted with compiz yet  ;-/
2009-02-10T10:50:00.000Z	juniecho	bernz	yeah thanks :)
2009-02-10T10:54:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	because i'm feeling curious, i'm going to read a bit about compiz, and maybe we can figure out your problem (and then maybe karma/god/whatever-you-believe-in-including-nothing will give me some payback so i can get my mobo-usb-hosts-mysteriously-aren't-there problem fixed :-D )
2009-02-10T10:54:00.000Z	juniecho	bernz	: thanks hehe
2009-02-10T10:58:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	right on, and now you've piqued my curiosity for compiz. thank you :-)
2009-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	generally, there is a "unix way" for unix-like systems, but each application is free to do their own thing in the end, so often only the "famous commands" (cut/copy/paste, quit, cancel, etc) become "written in stone"  :-D
2009-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	yes, programs are often a reflection of their principal authors' natures, and so they vary in the same way ;-)
2009-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	if you keep a blog or whatever, your problem and solution are an excellent thing to make public :-)
2009-02-10T11:07:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	unfortunately, yes -- it can sometimes make teamwork difficult, as many programmers are insecure about letting go of their way of doing things ;-) it's hard to convince us you've thought of a better way than we have  ;-)
2009-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	hehe, it sounds like you're setting me up for a joke. but to answer, they are "young" and haven't learned wisdom yet.  seriously.  it sounds silly, like karate kid or whatever, but... they are just too eagere
2009-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	i think secretly, that's part of the goal/attraction
2009-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	juniecho	bernz	it is for installing ubuntu inside windows... create a virtual disk file instead of dedicated partition. other than that everything is same with just normal ubuntu installation
2009-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	cool, that's a good description
2009-02-10T11:15:00.000Z	juniecho	bernz	yeah one more good thing is that it is much more easier to back up ubuntu installation, just boot into windows and copy root.disk file to somewhere else... because it contains entire ubuntu installation, when ubuntu is screwed up for some reason ... just overwrite it with backup copy and it is all reverted like you did some norton ghost thing
2009-02-10T11:16:00.000Z	bernz	juniecho	oh, that *is* pretty sweet indeed!
