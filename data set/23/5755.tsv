2006-12-29T12:24:00.000Z	psynaps3		Folks, a few questions :) Should I got for reiserfs or ext3? typical developer usage
2006-12-29T12:25:00.000Z	psynaps3		fine, a year or so back, i had read a few good reports comparing reiserfs with ext3 and the former had the lead. What's the scenario like now?
2006-12-29T12:26:00.000Z	psynaps3		hmm.. fine. ext3 it is then :)
2006-12-29T12:26:00.000Z	psynaps3		hahaha
2006-12-29T12:27:00.000Z	psynaps3		okay next one. I am setting up a dual boot sys here and would like some help with the paritioning.
2006-12-29T12:27:00.000Z	psynaps3		what should the size be of my swap partition? (system ram is 1gb)
2006-12-29T12:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	try 1 GB, it's completely arbitrary and can be changed at any time if it's at the end of a disk
2006-12-29T12:28:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	i wouldn't worry too much about it. just give it a GB
2006-12-29T12:29:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	you don't need a boot partition
2006-12-29T12:30:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	boot needs enough size to contain your kernel images and your initrd. i really don't think you need one but if you're hellbent on making a boot partition then be my guest.
2006-12-29T12:30:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	i.e. 128 MB is ample
2006-12-29T12:31:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	if you want to take my advice, have /, /home and swap. you really don't need more than that for most cases and having /home on a separate partition is just convenient for power users
2006-12-29T12:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	bear in mind that things like UT2004 are about 6 GB
2006-12-29T12:33:00.000Z	psynaps3	alex-weej	there won't be any games in my laption :) at least not UT
2006-12-29T12:33:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	you can, but it is difficult
2006-12-29T12:33:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	basically, you can't move the start of an ext3 partition. it's just not possible
2006-12-29T12:34:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	so you are limited by that
2006-12-29T12:35:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	fat32 will destroy your user permissions, and probably filenames
2006-12-29T12:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	fat32 can't store filenames with colons, double quotes, or many other chars - but you could of course just move everything to a new ext3 partition :P
2006-12-29T12:51:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	all on one disk?
2006-12-29T12:52:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	overkill.
2006-12-29T12:53:00.000Z	alex-weej	psynaps3	do you really need a fat16 partition?
2006-12-29T12:53:00.000Z	psynaps3	alex-weej	that's the dell diagnostic partition. I can't take it out.
