2008-03-31T03:24:00.000Z	Swiss73		Hello, I have Ubuntu + grub on a hard drive (samsung, for name sake to keep track) and xp on another one (maxtor), and id like to remove ubuntu and grub so that i can boot off of maxtor and use samsung as more storage for XP, but i tried an online guide and now when i try to boot off of mactor i get "NTLDR is missing [Next line] Press any key to restart"
2008-03-31T03:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Swiss73	boot a instalation windows cd into recovery mode and use fixmbr to install the win boot loader.
2008-03-31T03:27:00.000Z	Swiss73	erUSUL	i did that as some one told me to get rid of grub and NOW i have ntldr missing
2008-03-31T03:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Swiss73	maybe you should first change the master slave status of the disk or mark the correct disk for booting on bios
2008-03-31T03:28:00.000Z	Swiss73	erUSUL	im using the small cable, not the master slave ones, what do i do?
2008-03-31T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Swiss73	the disk where windows is installed should be the first one on the boot sequence on bios if you are using sata i guess
2008-03-31T03:30:00.000Z	Swiss73	erUSUL	so my maxtor, ill boot from that one sec
