2010-07-18T17:07:00.000Z	gwern		I remember hearing once that you can use a spare flashcard as some sort of cache for the hard drive, but I've been googling around and can't seem to find anything on this
2010-07-18T17:07:00.000Z	gwern		anyone know what I'm talking about?
2010-07-18T17:08:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	no but you can have a /swap partition on it, and mount at boot via fstab
2010-07-18T17:09:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	hm, I'm not sure swap ever gets hit here
2010-07-18T17:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	how much ram you got?
2010-07-18T17:10:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	about 4 gigs
2010-07-18T17:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	ssd for / as well?
2010-07-18T17:10:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	hah, one day I'll be able to afford a big ssd, but that day is not today
2010-07-18T17:11:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	so why would you want to cache on flash memory with less read/write speed than a reg 7200rpm hdd?
2010-07-18T17:12:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	I figured that another 512MB would be useful, that's 1/8th of ram, and would let me increase preload's caching
2010-07-18T17:12:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	given flash memory's limited r/w
2010-07-18T17:13:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	like I care? flash can take a lot of r/w, there's wear-leveling, and if the card dies in a few years, I just shrug and trash it
2010-07-18T17:16:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	what gpu, and are you compositing?
2010-07-18T17:17:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	no compositing (running xmonad) and the card is ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650 1G
2010-07-18T17:18:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	it's not a bad card, and my older computers were much faster with nvidia cards. so I blame the driver
2010-07-18T17:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	problem solved. ati support for linux is essentially near crap, its only recently they provided open source drivers
2010-07-18T17:18:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	well, that's why I blame the driver...
2010-07-18T17:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	have you tried experimenting with kms?
2010-07-18T17:19:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	with what?
2010-07-18T17:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	kernel mode setting its a new feature but its cause more problems for some
2010-07-18T17:20:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	I'll look into that I guess
2010-07-18T17:22:00.000Z	gwern	aeon-ltd	only if the keybindings are set up for that. I do just fine with one hand with xmonad
2010-07-18T17:23:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gwern	same here when i'm feeling lazy on dwm
