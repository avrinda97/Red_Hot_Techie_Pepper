2005-12-18T06:48:00.000Z	cmatheson		what exactly does zsh do that bash doesn't?
2005-12-18T06:49:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	bunches of small things which, aggregated, reduce the amount of typing by a huge amount
2005-12-18T06:49:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	some of the best features aren't on by default.  The best way to learn it is to turn on one at a time
2005-12-18T06:50:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	zsh is really worth learning
2005-12-18T07:08:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	vim macros are really rather primitive.  but there are a number of things that gvim does better than emacs.  So I use both.
2005-12-18T07:10:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	these days I do use vim much more often.  But if you want your macro to branch based on a condition, or anything similar, it's back to emacs for me.
2005-12-18T07:10:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	regular expression search and replace is at least 10 X faster with vim than with emacs
2005-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	oh man i sure like that regexp search
2005-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	emacs has it, but it is very very slow.  I haven't bothered to figure out why.
2005-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	that's wild.  i didn't know my regular expressions back in my emacs days
2005-12-18T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	he said sendmail, just on a different line  :)
2005-12-18T08:03:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	oh woops
2005-12-18T08:09:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	might fetchmail be using the mta to deliver mail locally?
2005-12-20T06:11:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	hey i've been meaning to play around w/ LVM, but i always wonder if there is some sort of performance hit involved
2005-12-20T06:11:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	well, of course there is always an impact, but it is very minor.
2005-12-20T06:12:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	hmm, i'll have to try it on one of my servers one of these days
2005-12-26T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf
2005-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	not on my box...
2005-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	on mine, I just checked two
2005-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	ah, there are links
2005-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	sorry about that
2005-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	cmatheson	either one works
2005-12-26T10:28:00.000Z	cmatheson	sethk	that's cool
