2008-05-20T07:37:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo		I have a desktop PC connected to (wired) cable modem. I would like to share my internet connection with another person in the house.  He has a laptop and he would like to do wireless internet.  I have a Dell Wireless Broadband 2350 Router. As for me, I would like to continue using Wired internet. How do I go about setting up the router?
2008-05-20T07:37:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo		I have tried doing a physical "rewiring" (the end of cable that went to the back of my computer now goes to the Internet port on the wireless router. Then, with another cable, I connect the back of my computer to "LAN1" at the back of the wireless router) but that doesn't work). Thanks
2008-05-20T07:39:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	that should have worked.. once connected can you see the rom of the router .. usually on 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1
2008-05-20T07:39:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	izinucs	thanks for your reply. How do i know if i can see rom?
2008-05-20T07:40:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	type in both of the address i just gave you and see what pops up.
2008-05-20T07:43:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	izinucs	it says "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 192.168.0.1."
2008-05-20T07:44:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	did you try the other number?
2008-05-20T07:44:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	izinucs	yes, both numbers were tried. both said "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 192.168.0.1."
2008-05-20T07:45:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	if you have the manual for the router it should give you the administrative ip address to see the rom
2008-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	izinucs	i have the paper manual. paper manual has no ip address
2008-05-20T07:47:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	you might check dell's website for a more detailed manuel.. or their online live help
2008-05-20T07:48:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	izinucs	good news. CD rom has some stuff. IP   Address   192.168.2.1.   Subnet   Mask: 255.255.255.0. Does that help?
2008-05-20T07:48:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	try it.

2008-05-20T08:11:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	it should be a button to push
2008-05-20T08:12:00.000Z	izinucs	redwhitewaldo	you won't need to know the mac address.. the router will find it by itself
