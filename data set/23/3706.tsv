2010-05-20T20:25:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	I swear you have to be screwing with me
2010-05-20T20:26:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	I am looking for a PCI Sound Card that works with 10.04
2010-05-20T20:27:00.000Z	Vigo	wng-	No I am not, I am giving you official Canonical Links for supported Hardware and workarounds that may have been implemented to date.
2010-05-20T20:27:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	so the Canonical links that list no sound cards...
2010-05-20T20:28:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	none of them are listed as supported in 10.04, and after watching 2 sound cards have regressions that result in no sound output im a little weary to trust a page of "old sound cards"
2010-05-20T20:28:00.000Z	Vigo	wng-	Have you looked at the Launchpad site?
2010-05-20T20:29:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	yes i did, show me where it mentions any hardware sound cards please...
2010-05-20T20:30:00.000Z	Vigo	wng-	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSetupSoundCards <: That may help.
2010-05-20T20:31:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	please just stop
2010-05-20T20:31:00.000Z	wng-	Vigo	you're making me laugh
