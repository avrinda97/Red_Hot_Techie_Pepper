2005-03-23T07:29:00.000Z	xav		there is no way to downgrade hoary?
2005-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	Hmm
2005-03-23T07:54:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	update now
2005-03-23T07:55:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	I think its better to use k7 or i686 than i386
2005-03-23T07:56:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	ok mate :)
2005-03-23T07:56:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	is there restriced-module for it ?
2005-03-23T07:57:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	I would wait for 2.6.11 to be linked by linux metapackage
2005-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	hope so
2005-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	shit so do i :)
2005-03-23T08:01:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	yep :)
2005-03-23T08:05:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	can you recommend a guide to follow for the latest ATI drivers?
2005-03-23T08:05:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	I don't know for ubuntu
2005-03-23T08:53:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	minimised ?
2005-03-23T08:54:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	minimise the glxgears window :P
2005-03-23T08:54:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	whats the use ? first glxgears sux, if besides its minimised
2005-03-23T08:55:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	have you read anything else i wrote.....
2005-03-23T08:55:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	yes
2005-03-23T08:58:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	now that u see its totally irrelevant, don't post glxgears score anymore :) just fire quake 3, et, ut2k4 whatever and see how it's.
2005-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	erm... i was merely asking if 4500fps was an average score for an ATI card, i dont think you should give me the third degree because of that, and i really don't see why i cant post anything i want, seeing as its a public irc channel
2005-03-23T09:00:00.000Z	mattgirv	xav	so your bored of it? well don't even comment on it then, and thinking i am wrong? why am i wrong.
2005-03-23T09:02:00.000Z	xav	mattgirv	I'm not saying that for you only
