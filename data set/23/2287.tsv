2009-06-04T07:48:00.000Z	pw-toxic		now shutting down has an error: CIFS VFS: server not responding: CIFS VFS: No response for cmd 50 mid ...
2009-06-04T07:48:00.000Z	pw-toxic		and then it waits ~1 min and the stops the computer (turn off the power)
2009-06-04T07:49:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	I've seen the same behavior... did you define an SMB mount or something in /etc/fstab?
2009-06-04T07:49:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	what is SMB mount? ;)
2009-06-04T07:49:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	well, the CIFS mount is a windows (SMB) filesystem connection
2009-06-04T07:50:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	not sure I have a solution though

2009-06-04T07:53:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	thanks!
2009-06-04T07:59:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	the fix works for me!
2009-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	awesome, I'm going to try it too, since I need to create some static CIFS mounts to my NAS
2009-06-04T08:01:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	if i have Gbit lan.. can i see any differences to a local installed drive?
2009-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	you're referring to a Gbit-connected network-attached storage device?
2009-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	its gonna be pretty snappy
2009-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	what does snappy mean?
2009-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	i mean, that i have two computers wihtin a GBit LAN, and one pc does cifs to the drives of the other pc
2009-06-04T08:03:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	much faster than my 100Mbit NAS
2009-06-04T08:03:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	;)
2009-06-04T08:03:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	oh... I see
2009-06-04T08:04:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	I don't know exactly the data rate you could expect, but on the Gbit LAN at work, I can transfer a 500MB file in 20-30 seconds?
2009-06-04T08:05:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	maybe i really should build up a raid5 then... ;)  because i want to transfer data from a raid5 to a INTEL 80GB SSD
2009-06-04T08:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	wow - my WD 1TB greenpower does 80MB/s ;)
2009-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	kcollins	pw-toxic	sounds like you're cookin'!
2009-06-04T08:09:00.000Z	pw-toxic	kcollins	if you are interested in what i'm trying to do, you may switch to #ubuntu-offtopic
