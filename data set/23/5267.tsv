2007-01-22T08:27:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	there is this really nice article, cause it will really help if you tell us what you need http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
2007-01-22T08:28:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	i told you 2 x ram or 1gb as for ext that's your main OS whatever you need
2007-01-22T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	in number
2007-01-22T08:29:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	1 for each
2007-01-22T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	i have 4 g hard disk
2007-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	swap as I told you 2 times already is twice as much as your ram, that is where pagging goes, now more then 1gb is a waste of space cause noone with a desktop/laptop will go over 1gb of swap
2007-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	man what this mean
2007-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	as for the ext that is how much you want to alocate for ubuntu and noone can tell you that
2007-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	i mae it
2007-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	ubt is there some mb for /
2007-01-22T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	becosue i only create for swap and for ext3
2007-01-22T08:34:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	ext is the type, / is the place to put it
2007-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntu2	elpargo	but i put it in ext3
2007-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	elpargo	ubuntu2	ext3 is the TYPE you created a ext3 partition and mount it at "/"
