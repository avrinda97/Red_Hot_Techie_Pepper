2005-02-21T07:15:00.000Z	mebaran151		anybody know
2005-02-21T07:15:00.000Z	mebaran151		if I could use apt-source
2005-02-21T07:15:00.000Z	mebaran151		to compile evolution from source
2005-02-21T07:15:00.000Z	mebaran151		I have been reading on the msg boards
2005-02-21T07:15:00.000Z	mebaran151		that a source compile
2005-02-21T07:16:00.000Z	mebaran151		seems to solve all the weird float exceptions
2005-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	mebaran151		on AMD64
2005-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	mebaran151		so I thought I might try a source compile
2005-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	mebaran151		I was unsure if checkinstall was safe
2005-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	mebaran151		to do over an existing install
2005-02-21T07:18:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	apt-get source evolution
2005-02-21T07:18:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	sudo apt-get build-dep evolution
2005-02-21T07:20:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	will that automagically play nice with the existing binaries
2005-02-21T07:20:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	once you build the package, yes
2005-02-21T07:21:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	should I also build server too?
2005-02-21T07:21:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	i don't know, i don't really think that's going to help
2005-02-21T07:21:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	it was just a try
2005-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	that is not a problem
2005-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	yeah
2005-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	by choosing windows in grub... that's the whole point
2005-02-21T07:25:00.000Z	jdub	mebaran151	install windows, install warty, grub has windows and warty in the menu. no mucking around required.
2005-02-21T07:26:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	I had done that
2005-03-13T13:09:00.000Z	mebaran151	jdub	how do you reenable that
