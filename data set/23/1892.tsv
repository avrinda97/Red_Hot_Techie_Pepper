2009-09-20T08:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Is Windows the first partition?
2009-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Even if you choose safe graphics mode?
2010-06-28T01:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Envy isn't compatable with 10.04 and it's author considers it obsoleted by System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2010-06-28T01:12:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	Yeah, but the NVIDIA driver on the repositories does not support multiple monitors
2010-06-28T01:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	If you're having problems with multiple monitors specifically I doubt that the problem is that your nvidea driver is out of date.
2010-06-28T01:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Yes, it does.
2010-06-28T01:13:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	the one on the repositories is 197 and the lastest NVIDIA has released is 256 :\
2010-06-28T01:13:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	hmmm weird, but i could install the nvidia driver in 9.10 without any problems, and i could configure multiple monitors correctly. I can't with 10.4 though
2010-06-28T01:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	What happens when you try to configure multiple monitors.
2010-06-28T01:15:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	i can run nvidia-settings and configure my second monitor to run as a separate x screen
2010-06-28T01:16:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	 but the problem is that when i save x and reboot, the screen is there but its all black, and when i move my mouse to it it appears as an X-shaped cursor
2010-06-28T01:19:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	do i make sense?
2010-06-28T01:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Yes. What is the exact card you're using?
2010-06-28T01:20:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	its 9400 GT
2010-06-28T01:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	Do you have the Xorg.conf that you used with 9.10?
2010-06-28T01:26:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	no :( but it was generated by the nvidia tool
2010-06-28T01:27:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	brb mom calling for lunch xD
2011-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	An easier method with network manger is explained here: http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/10/16/video-fedora-10-connection-sharing/
2011-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	(Works with Ubuntu as well as Fedora of course)
2011-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	I'll check it :)
2011-01-10T10:58:00.000Z	Alan502	Jordan_U	the video was nice but it just shows how to set up an adhoc network :P
2011-01-10T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Alan502	It also sets up DHCP server and router.
