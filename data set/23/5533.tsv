2006-12-15T15:48:00.000Z	fuffe	reverseblade	open it and moving it around within the filesystem works great within my own filesystem.. but I can't transfer it to an ftp server
2006-12-15T15:48:00.000Z	reverseblade	fuffe	how are you transferring it ? in binary mode or in ASCII mode ?
2006-12-15T15:51:00.000Z	fuffe	reverseblade	dunno.. I just transfer with nautilus
2006-12-15T15:52:00.000Z	reverseblade	fuffe	nautilus do not have FTP support, you can't use FTP
2006-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	fuffe	reverseblade	weird.. I have used it for ftp transfers for a week now.. has worked much better than gftp which crashed too much
2006-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	fuffe	oh, are you typing ftp://
2006-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	reverseblade	fuffe	sorry it supports ftp, I got it wrong

2006-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	fuffe	reverseblade	the weird thing is.. the files get uploaded.. but I get that error anyway

2006-12-15T16:22:00.000Z	reverseblade	fuffe	so what was it ?
2006-12-15T16:23:00.000Z	fuffe	reverseblade	well it wasn't anything with the file I changed.. because the old version of the zip worked, then I made a zip with all files I changed from last time(just a few) and it worked
