2009-12-10T02:50:00.000Z	asdfa	linuxguy2009	yea... you say it
2009-12-10T02:50:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	asdfa	remove pulseaudio from synaptic and install gnome-alsamixer or use alsamixer CLI mixer.
2009-12-10T02:50:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	asdfa	pulseaudio is so integrated that when you remove pulse you also lose the volume applet in your panel. Pretty freaking lame IMO.
