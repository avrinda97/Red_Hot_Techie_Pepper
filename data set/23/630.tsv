2011-05-10T05:23:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		What does one need for Netflix? Just the moonlight plugin?
2011-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		I have a windows install already.
2011-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		I just figured I'd give ubuntu another soht.
2011-05-10T05:25:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	yes, you just need sliverblight. or liverbite. or whatever that stupid plugin is.
2011-05-10T05:26:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		i think guys in here ought to ask more ubuntu-specific questions, rather than bash-specific questions...
2011-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		Back to windows I guess.
2011-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	why do you need to use windows?
2011-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern	Mitsukaru	netflix.
2011-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		I'm not willing to setup a VM just to watch netflix.
2011-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	i already answered your question xD
2011-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		"zacharyalexstern, yes, you just need sliverblight. or liverbite. or whatever that stupid plugin is."
2011-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern	Mitsukaru	the current version of moonlight is 2.4, it's too old.
2011-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		Moonlight (the linux version of silverlight) does not support DRM yet.
2011-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		weird o_O why wouldnt moonlight work? that's dumb.
2011-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	install the windows version of firefox with wine, and then silverlight. then watch netflix like that.
2011-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern	Mitsukaru	No.
2011-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		DRM SUX!
2011-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	why not just use wine? xD
2011-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern	Mitsukaru	because I don't want to.
2011-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		also isnt there a linux version of the proprietary silverlight w/ drm support?
2011-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Mitsukaru		hi Tendors :P
2011-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	zacharyalexstern		I'm going to try out the nightly build of moonlight.
2011-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Mitsukaru	zacharyalexstern	whats wrong with running firefox w/ silverlight in wine?
