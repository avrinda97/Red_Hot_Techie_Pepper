2006-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	darko3d		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32961/ <---how can i mount the 40gb drive
2006-11-20T11:10:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
2006-11-20T11:11:00.000Z	darko3d	cld2	i got mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
2006-11-20T11:11:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	ok, so you want at boot?
2006-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	^
2006-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	yeah sorry put that in the /etc/fstab file and change /mount/point to where you want to mount it.
2006-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	darko3d	cld2	i opened fstab, but i can't save any changes
2006-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	you need to use sudo to edit, like rioghal has above
2006-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	the only thing you need to change from what rioghal told you is: change ext3 to vfat
2006-11-20T11:20:00.000Z	darko3d	cld2	ok i opened it, and added /dev/hdb1        /media/darko-data   udf,ntfs user,noauto  , at the bottom, is that right
2006-11-20T11:20:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	so the line you would add to the /etc/fstab will look like this : /dev/hdb1 /mount/point vfat defaults 0 0
2006-11-20T11:21:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	take off the udf and ntfs and replace it with vfat - its a fat32 FS not a ntfs.
2006-11-20T11:21:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	and if you have that noauto it wont mount at boot time. which I thought was the whole point?
2006-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	one more thing, sorry set this option umask=000
2006-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	thats so you dont ad unix permissions to your windows files.
2006-11-20T11:24:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	almost make it like defaults,umask=000
2006-11-20T11:25:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	sorry, here I just got onto my box at home... here is my line /dev/hdc1 /media/windows vfat iocharset=utf8,umask=000 0 0
2006-11-20T11:26:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	no, sorry to be confusing, you need to have all your options , seperated so it would be defaults,umask=000 but nm the defaults, use the string i just pasted
2006-11-20T11:26:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	exactly. sorry about that. its early on monday
2006-11-20T11:27:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	mount -a
2006-11-20T11:28:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	if you umount it from where it was mounted and then run mount -a and check to see if /media/darko-data is there then its working.
2006-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	cld2	darko3d	pastebin your fstab.
2006-11-20T11:32:00.000Z	darko3d	cld2	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32962/ what do you think?
