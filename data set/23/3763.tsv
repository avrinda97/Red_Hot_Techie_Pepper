2008-02-06T04:42:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe		hi all, i have just being changing some of the settings for  services and i modified gdm so it did not start on boot, however i now want to change it back
2008-02-06T04:42:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe		could someone tell me what the default setting is
2008-02-06T04:43:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe		ie. for each run level should it be start/stop/ignore and the priority

2008-02-06T04:49:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe	yell0w	great thread, thanks, do you know what the priority should be?
2008-02-06T05:04:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	uhm just read the thread, i believe it explained well what's needed and what's not so necessary
2008-02-06T05:05:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	when in doubt just shout in here what's "such and such" supposed to be and etc...
2008-02-06T05:07:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe	yell0w	the only service that i changed was gdm, in the article it says when the service should be running but not at which priority, i've set it to 50 at the moment for run levels 2,3,4,5
2008-02-06T05:08:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe	yell0w	i suppose the question i'm asking is, could someone look at what settings they have for gdm

2008-02-06T05:16:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	sysvconfig
2008-02-06T05:16:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	should be in repos with the same name

2008-02-06T05:19:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	oh there's another?
2008-02-06T05:21:00.000Z	yell0w	TheRealFaceOfBoe	should function similarly though
2008-02-06T05:23:00.000Z	TheRealFaceOfBoe	yell0w	well i'll restart and see how things go, if it doesn't work i'll have to call it a night cos its late with me, thanks for the help
