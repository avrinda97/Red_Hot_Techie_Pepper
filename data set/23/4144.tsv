2008-01-14T08:27:00.000Z	bmt2		hello to all
2008-01-14T08:28:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	apt-get install ffmpeg
2008-01-14T08:28:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	i have done that...but for some reason apt-get can not find the source "ffmpeg"
2008-01-14T08:29:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	i just got it like an hour a go
2008-01-14T08:29:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	i am getting the error after i type "apt-get source ffmpeg"
2008-01-14T08:29:00.000Z	bmt2		i get the error " unable to find a source package for ffmpeg"
2008-01-14T08:29:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	why source?
2008-01-14T08:30:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	i am reading instructions from a web page that is going to show me how to convert DVD to mpeg4 so that i can play it on my PSP
2008-01-14T08:31:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	ok then just type apt-get install ffmpeg and use konsole commands or you could look for a frontend
2008-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	a frontend for ffmpeg ?
2008-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	i seem to think i heard of of it
2008-01-14T08:32:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	i dont use one so im not sure
2008-01-14T08:33:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	can you tell me how you installed ffmpeg, and all the codecs
2008-01-14T08:33:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	i just did
2008-01-14T08:34:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	all you did was apt-get install ffmpeg ?
2008-01-14T08:34:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	after it installs you may have to go into your package manager and get libxine extra codecs
2008-01-14T08:34:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	thats it
2008-01-14T08:35:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	im converting the bucket list avi to mpg right now
2008-01-14T08:35:00.000Z	bmt2	spideyman	let me try the libxine
2008-01-14T08:36:00.000Z	spideyman	bmt2	does ffmpeg open when you type it in konsole
