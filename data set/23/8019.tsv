2005-02-20T17:43:00.000Z	mike998		is there any tool i can install on ubuntu to allow me to sniff if there are any wireless networks around?
2005-02-20T17:43:00.000Z	Helios_	mike998	you can use 'iwlist wlan0 scan'
2005-02-20T17:44:00.000Z	mike998		no scan results... strange i know there are at least 3 networks in range
2005-02-20T17:44:00.000Z	Helios_		Mike998: are there correct drivers installed for the card? Took me quite some effort to get mine working
2005-02-20T17:45:00.000Z	Helios_		Mike998 you can check with 'ifconfig -a' to see if it shows up there
2005-02-20T17:47:00.000Z	mike998		Helios_:pardon me, I stepped away...
2005-02-20T17:47:00.000Z	Helios_		np
2005-02-20T17:47:00.000Z	mike998	Helios_	ndiswrapper -l shows the correct driver installed... but it's a 802.11g driver and I *think* this card can do b/g
2005-02-20T17:48:00.000Z	Helios_		does it say driver installed / hardware present?
2005-02-20T17:48:00.000Z	mike998		yep
2005-02-20T17:48:00.000Z	mike998		had to install hoary to get the thing to work
2005-02-20T17:49:00.000Z	Helios_		then it should work
2005-02-20T17:49:00.000Z	Helios_		hoarry?
2005-02-20T17:49:00.000Z	Helios_		( -r )
2005-02-20T17:49:00.000Z	mike998		yeah... i had to install hoary for it to work
2005-02-20T17:50:00.000Z	Helios_		Mike998: Can you tell me what Hoary is? I'm getting some trouble with my WLAN card lately
2005-02-20T17:50:00.000Z	mike998		can you hang on a bit - baby is crying
2005-02-20T17:50:00.000Z	Helios_		sure
2005-02-20T17:57:00.000Z	Helios_		Anyone know what a good Wiki server would be?
2005-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	Helios_		i gtg
2005-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	Helios_		bye
2005-02-20T06:10:00.000Z	mike998		Helios_:
