2011-07-12T00:47:00.000Z	rate5		Can anyone help me fix screen flickering / tearing?
2011-07-12T00:47:00.000Z	dli	rate5	what video card?
2011-07-12T00:47:00.000Z	rate5	dli	its the onboard intel one for toughbook cf-18
2011-07-12T00:48:00.000Z	dli	rate5	intel video should be stable enough now. which video card from lspci ?
2011-07-12T00:51:00.000Z	rate5	dli	its Intel Corp 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics rev 02
2011-07-12T00:52:00.000Z	dli	rate5	that's an old one, flickering with LCD ?
2011-07-12T00:52:00.000Z	rate5	dli	yes it is
2011-07-12T00:53:00.000Z	dli	rate5	try your luck with xrandr , maybe, it's better with other resolution/frequency
2011-07-12T00:55:00.000Z	rate5	dli	oh ok, should I remove the xorg.conf that it generated?
2011-07-12T00:56:00.000Z	dli	rate5	no need, just try with the command xrandr
2011-07-12T00:57:00.000Z	rate5	dli	thank you I will try that now
2011-07-12T00:59:00.000Z	rate5	dli	I just ran that commend still getting flicker :(
2011-07-12T01:00:00.000Z	dli	rate5	no, you need to set modes with xrandr, to see whether it makes difference
2011-07-12T01:01:00.000Z	rate5	dli	so I use the info that xrandr gives me and I put in in the xorg.conf file?
2011-07-12T01:02:00.000Z	dli	rate5	something like: xrandr --output LCD1 --mode 1024x768
2011-07-12T01:04:00.000Z	rate5	dli	the commend did not seem to do anything, do I need to reboot?
2011-07-12T01:05:00.000Z	dli	rate5	also, like: xrandr --output --mode 1024x768 -rate 75
2011-07-12T01:06:00.000Z	rate5	dli	ok so far no difference :( but thank you for your help so far
2011-07-12T01:07:00.000Z	dli	rate5	what's your refreshing rate?
2011-07-12T01:08:00.000Z	rate5	dli	it says60.0*+
2011-07-12T01:08:00.000Z	dli	rate5	tried anything 70+ ?
2011-07-12T01:10:00.000Z	dli	rate5	do you get 3D ? glxinfo
2011-07-12T01:11:00.000Z	rate5	dli	its not installed will get it now
