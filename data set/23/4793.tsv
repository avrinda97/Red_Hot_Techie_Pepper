2007-06-24T05:45:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26988/ did you get a chance to have a look for me?
2007-06-24T05:46:00.000Z	wols_	t1g3r	yes and it looks as you didn't have a connection to your windows. sudo /etc/init.d/netwroking restart. any errors, especially DHCPOFFER?
2007-06-24T05:53:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	i got an error saying timestamp too far in teh future..gonna restart buntu and try again
2007-06-24T06:01:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	i got no DHCPOFFERS received
2007-06-24T06:01:00.000Z	wols_	t1g3r	do you have a switch or crossover cable?
2007-06-24T06:02:00.000Z	wols_	t1g3r	no
2007-06-24T06:04:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	i have a cat.5 patch cable connecting the two, dont havea  switch, i think this cable is a crossover one, ill confirm in a few mins
2007-06-24T06:09:00.000Z	wols_	t1g3r	don't talk like this in here if you wanna stay
2007-06-24T06:09:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	just checked the wiring on the cable and found out its not a xover cable
2007-06-24T06:14:00.000Z	t1g3r	wols_	sorry man any ideas? reckon it will work just with a network cable somehow?
2007-06-24T06:14:00.000Z	wols_	t1g3r	not if your nics aren't autoswithing
