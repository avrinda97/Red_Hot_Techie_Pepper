2008-09-11T01:50:00.000Z	Edel_RSX		Does anyone know how to specify to network manager which location to load at boot?
2008-09-11T01:52:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Do you mean like assign in /etc/network/interfaces which ESSID to associate with by default, or?
2008-09-11T01:53:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	no; just need to get append an entry to the search path every time so that it searches my lab network which I'm never a 'member' of
2008-09-11T01:53:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Can't you add another line in /etc/resolv.conf for that?
2008-09-11T01:54:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	no; because it gets overwritten everytime Network Manager does anything
2008-09-11T01:54:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Ah, got it.. in cases like that I tend to make a shell script to fix it for different locations. :)
2008-09-11T01:54:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	I don't need it different for different locations; I need it always
2008-09-11T01:55:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	it doesn't hurt me if it tries to search and can't find anything
2008-09-11T01:56:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	I reckon you could do something with the interfaces ifup or post commands to run a script to append the search line after association.
2008-09-11T01:56:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	so basically whether I get an address at X.com (office) or Y.com (home) or whatever else, I always want test.X.com searched... yeah I found a way to get it done for the vpn client easily enough
2008-09-11T01:57:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	That sounds an awful lot like my situation.  I keep most of my servers at home and VPN into them when I'm out.  Still haven't nailed down resolving internal hostnames yet.
2008-09-11T01:59:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	basically I'm at company X, and we have all of the test machines  that they use for "real activity" on their own subnet
2008-09-11T01:59:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	so I'm never a member of that domain but I ssh into it constantly
2008-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	I grok.  I've been fiddling with openvpn for a while now trying to get my VPN subnet to resolve hostnames on my internal LAN, much like your setup.
2008-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	aliases could work but its not a good general solution
2008-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	We have the at&t client thrusted down our throats
2008-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	Edel_RSX		wasn't hard to fix that one :-)
2008-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Guh, tell me about it.  I just kludged that together to run on my Ubuntu 64 box the other day for work.
2008-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	never had this problem before on any other distro version in the past 4-5 years
2008-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Wait, are you saying you managed to get a different VPN client working for you instead of the ATT one?  Because that would rock.
2008-09-11T02:02:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	no I got the ATT one to work properly for me
2008-09-11T02:02:00.000Z	Edel_RSX	Moleprince	want me to find the file I edited to get that setting to stay?
2008-09-11T02:03:00.000Z	Moleprince	Edel_RSX	Yes please, feel free to PM me it.  I'm at work so may get lost otherwise.
