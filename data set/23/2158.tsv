2009-06-12T05:03:00.000Z	Cry__Baby		I installed a .deb file.. how do I now remove it?
2009-06-12T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	find it in Synaptic and right click and remove like that.   you can do the config files to.  or  use command.   sudo apt-get purge  programname
2009-06-12T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	purge removes config files as well, remove, removes only program
2009-06-12T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	what did you install?
2009-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	yeah that's not even in the Ubuntu repo by the looks of it
2009-06-12T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	got to remove it in another way then  I think, but not sure exactly how right now
2009-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	yeah, Linux is all about choice
2009-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	Rythombox  in Ubuntu since it's default,   or  Amarok if Kubuntu.   I quite like Banshee myself,  even though a Mono app
2009-06-13T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	 I still don't understand  after all this time what the big deal is with Amarok
2009-06-13T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	 mpd  is a commandline music player
2009-06-13T07:38:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	i will try Rythombox :)
2009-06-13T07:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	I think Rythombox is a bit better now from when I gave up with it, and did Banshee
2009-07-19T03:30:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	lol
2009-07-19T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	yes, but  I would  just  do  sudo apt-get purge  "the stuff it wants to remove"  to remove the config files as well
2009-07-19T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	they are safe or the  terminal in Ubuntu woudn't suggest  doing them
2009-07-19T03:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	yes and I already told you something similar you can do which is better
2009-07-19T03:34:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	i misseed it, was dc
2009-07-19T03:34:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	whats better than apt-get autoremove?
2009-07-19T03:35:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	??
2009-07-19T03:36:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	so I type sudo apt-get purge ?
2009-07-19T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	yep and then copy and paste in what it wants to remove
2009-07-19T03:37:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	sebsebseb	I typed what you said, and it says 'Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
2009-07-19T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cry__Baby	sudo apt-get  purge  list of programs
