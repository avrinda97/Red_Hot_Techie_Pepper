2008-11-26T17:49:00.000Z	fevel		Can anyone pleeeease help me with the segmentation fault issue?
2008-11-26T17:50:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	this is happening with firefox?  what version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I am using 8.04
2008-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	32bit?
2008-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	It is a fairly new install 32 bit
2008-11-26T17:53:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	Im pretty sure its a null pointer access attempt
2008-11-26T17:54:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	you may want to try and reinstall firefox?  maybe some of the data got corrupted,  but I don;t know beyond that
2008-11-26T17:54:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I cant remove it the system doesnt let me
2008-11-26T17:57:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	you could try upgrading to intrepid.  Sometimes that fixes things
2008-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I am actually using a modified kernel for the eeepc
2008-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	So I cant just upgrade right now
2008-11-26T18:00:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	ah, I see...  that's probably the source of your problems I would think
2008-11-26T18:05:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	are you using ubuntu eee?
2008-11-26T18:05:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	yes! Please see if u can find anything friend since I cant navigate
2008-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	maybe you could just reinstall from the usb stick
2008-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I guess thats what Ill have to do
2008-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I was hoping not to
2008-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	do you have a separate /home partition?
2008-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	I hate leaving a problem behind and not reporting it or knowing the cause
2008-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	yes
2008-11-26T18:10:00.000Z	temppy	fevel	yes, but getting the problem to recur from a fresh install is the best way to report it
2008-11-26T18:10:00.000Z	fevel	temppy	thats enough to make up my mind ...Im going for a clean install DAMN
