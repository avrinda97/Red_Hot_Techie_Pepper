2010-03-21T23:00:00.000Z	madjoe		Hi! How can I connect with telnet to my Thomson SpeedTouch ADSL modem? telnet 192.168.1.1 works in Windows XP Pro, but not on Ubuntu! :(
2010-03-21T23:01:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	specify a port perhaps?
2010-03-21T23:04:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	it's the default telnet port I think (23)... it's just Trying... no luck
2010-03-21T23:04:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	what's the error you're getting?
2010-03-21T23:05:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	no error... just "Trying..."
2010-03-21T23:05:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	turn on extra verbose with ''-vv' flag
2010-03-21T23:08:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	i'm nearly certain the problem is that you're not running the right command rather than it being broken, maybe check out some telnet examples
2010-03-21T23:08:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	I did: "telnet 192.168.1.1"
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	that's usually not correct; defaults are implied
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	yre you telling me that Windows has different defaults of telnet command?
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	what port is your router expecting?
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	maybe it guesses which ports are open
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	not sure :( I guess it's 23
2010-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	nmap your router
2010-03-21T23:10:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	nmap -A -PN 192.168.1.1 ?
2010-03-21T23:11:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	nmap 192.168.1.1 will suffice
2010-03-21T23:13:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	open ports are ftp, http, https and pptp...
2010-03-21T23:25:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	did you find the port number?
2010-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	no... but my open ports are 21, 80, 443 and pptp port
2010-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	try -O
2010-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	it should tell you the port name beside the port
2010-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	madjoe	repo_man	-O flag? on telnet?!
2010-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	repo_man	madjoe	no on nmap
