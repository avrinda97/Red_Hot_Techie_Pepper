2008-04-27T03:48:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	sudo apt-get remove awn-core-applets-bzr and then remove the new entry from /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-27T03:48:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	ok thanks man
2008-04-27T03:51:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	ok it uninstalled but i still get errors when i try to install avant thru add/remove
2008-04-27T03:51:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	what kind of errors?
2008-04-27T03:52:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	cannot install avant window naviator this application conlficts with other installed software to install avant the confliction software must be removed first switch to synpatic pakcage manager to resolve this conflict
2008-04-27T03:53:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	can you paste the exact message given by apt-get remove into a pastebin please?
2008-04-27T03:54:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	i uninlstalled it sucessfully but when i go to add/remove it says other software is in the way and go to synaptic manager to resolve...its a pop and i cant copy and paste the words
2008-04-27T03:55:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	i'm confused...what are you going to add/remove for if it was uninstalled successfully?
2008-04-27T03:58:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	no i uninstalled thru terminal with sudo apt-get remove awn-core-applets-bzr
2008-04-27T03:59:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	weird, it usually will tell you which software conflicts with it.  try what it says; go to synaptic, see if it shows a conflict there.
2008-04-27T04:00:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	hw would i tell if theres a conflict there?
2008-04-27T04:00:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	I would assume that a message would pop up or something :)
2008-04-27T04:01:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	if nothing happens there, try running "sudo apt-get -f install" at command line
2008-04-27T04:01:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	okay ima try
2008-04-27T04:02:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	okay cool it told me to autoremove libawn-bzr so i did now ima see if that fixed it
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	SUCCESS THANK YOU MAN
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	awesome :)
2008-04-27T04:05:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	it worked like a charm so now i know when i install something to sudo apt-get remove what i installed....is there a way of seeing extactly what i installed before it went wrong? god forbid i lost the site i was on and i needed to check whats conflicting with the program is there a way to find out cuz i run into this kinds of stuff alot
2008-04-27T04:05:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	there's a way to show what's been installed already...i'll look it up, just a sec
2008-04-27T04:06:00.000Z	androver	blankhead	"dpkg --get-selections" will show you all installed packages.  there may be a way to show them in date order but I don't know it.
2008-04-27T04:07:00.000Z	blankhead	androver	awesome that'll help linux is getting so cool the hell with windows man
