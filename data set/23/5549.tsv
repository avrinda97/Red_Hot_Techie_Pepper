2008-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	nemo		Why is it I'm unable to get ubuntu to poke me about upgrading my mom's computer? I've tried update-manager -p and update-manager -c
2008-11-24T11:12:00.000Z	nemo		ah. normal releases vs LTS. gotcha
2008-11-24T11:13:00.000Z	nemo		something about Ibex - the upgrade tool prompted me to try the new fast-user-switch-applet - I turned it down at the time, is there a way to rerun that?
2008-11-24T11:13:00.000Z	nemo		including creating the guest account and whatnot?
2008-11-24T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	Yes, let me find the command
2008-11-24T11:14:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	cool. thnx
2008-11-24T11:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	"python /usr/share/gnome-panel/migrate-fusa-config.py"
2008-11-24T11:18:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	thanks again.
2008-11-24T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	np
2010-04-21T01:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	Just use vino, it's built in and dead simple to enable.
2010-04-21T01:47:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	useless for headless
2010-04-21T01:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	Ahh.
2010-04-21T01:47:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	xtightvnc's server works btw.
2010-04-21T01:47:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	but I wanted to get things working w/ xinetd
2010-04-21T01:48:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	remmina and XDMCP also work - although insecure. unfortunately ubuntu doesn't package xqproxy yet
2010-04-21T01:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	You should use ssh -X instead of -Y so that X11 traffic is encrypted also.
2010-04-21T01:50:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	uh....
2010-04-21T01:50:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	the X11 traffic is encrypted w/ both
2010-04-21T01:50:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	is just trusted vs non
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nemo	Sorry, misremembering I guess.
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	ssh -Y is needed also for a ton of gnome apps.
2010-04-21T01:53:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	settled on manually starting xtightvnc server for now, and also using xqproxy/remina/XDMCP combo
2010-04-21T01:54:00.000Z	nemo	Jordan_U	BTW. gnome also screws up keymaps w/ xtightvnc, so is necessary to set XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
