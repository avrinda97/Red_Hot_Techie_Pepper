2008-06-19T05:50:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		i tried the Wake-On-Lan, are there other ways to kick start it?
2008-06-19T05:50:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		and my network works fine for short bursts, how do u explain that?
2008-06-19T05:51:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		my settings seem to revert to old settings every minute or so
2008-06-19T05:53:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		why would my network revert to default settings every minute?
2008-06-19T05:53:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		is there a way to lock down my settings so they can't move?
2008-06-19T05:53:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	how are you setting the settings anyway? through the GUI?
2008-06-19T05:54:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto	jameslr	yes, and it works fine for a bit but then it just reverts back on its own
2008-06-19T05:57:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	where are you seeing Passive mode?
2008-06-19T05:58:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto	jameslr	in my network settings, under "connection preferences"
2008-06-19T05:58:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	you're using KDE i take it?
2008-06-19T05:58:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	sorry I don't know KDE.
2008-06-19T05:58:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	I can probably help with command line though
2008-06-19T05:58:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	if you know where you're going
2008-06-19T06:00:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto	jameslr	in windows i use DHCP in my network settings, but in Kubuntu it only works if it's in manual, any idea?
2008-06-19T06:01:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	what is the contents of your /etc/network/interfaces?
2008-06-19T06:02:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto	jameslr	http://paste.ubuntu.com/21286/
2008-06-19T06:04:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	so if you change that file to say iface eth0 inet dhcp and remove the address, netmask, and gateway from eth0. Save and restart you don't get an IP?
2008-06-19T06:05:00.000Z	jameslr	Mr_Cheeto	you don't have to restart your PC. Just ifdown eth0 /ifup eth0
2008-06-19T06:05:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto	jameslr	i haven't tried that i've only been doing it graphically, one sec
