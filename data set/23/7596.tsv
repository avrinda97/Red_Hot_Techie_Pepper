2005-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	ZeZu		i dont know why i waste so much time
2005-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	ZeZu		i always end up back on windows
2005-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	ZeZu		what is the point
2005-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	why?
2005-10-16T12:51:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	had the same danged problem
2005-10-16T12:51:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	best thing you can do is just stop buying from ATI till they offer better linux support
2005-10-16T12:52:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	you can get a cheap nvidia card for about 60
2005-10-16T12:52:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	it will outproform the ATI on linux
2005-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	i have an mx400, and it is only half as fast as my 9800 pro
2005-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	the mx4000 should be more than capable of blowing the 9800 pro out of the water
2005-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	the mx4000 is about 60 right now
2005-10-16T12:54:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	pay attention to the 0's
2005-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	yeah it was hell getting my 9800 pro to work
2005-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	and when i did i only got 3k FPS
2005-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	somehow
2005-10-16T12:56:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	now my mx400 ( four hundred) gets half of that, with half the memory less tahn a quater the price (now) and its older than snot
2005-10-16T12:58:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	true, but the linux drivers are more effective than the windows ones
2005-10-16T12:59:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	yes, ati are weak on both in my estimation, they got the hardware, but their drivers suck
2005-10-16T13:00:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	i put that old GPU into my older system and actually experienced a slow down (the nvidia card) but on my linux system, there is a definate marked proformance.
2005-10-16T13:00:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	and because of that i will only buy nvidia
2005-10-16T13:01:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	and of course i learn all of this AFTER getting a 250 dollar GPU
2005-10-16T13:02:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	like i said, you get a cheaper nvidia card and it will outproform the windows version of the same card and some of the better ones
2005-10-16T13:02:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	ZeZu	but if thats the route you wanna go i understand, i will actually do the same thing
