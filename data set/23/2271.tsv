2009-08-09T06:20:00.000Z	cast	fosa	personally i'd say dd was overkill
2009-08-09T06:21:00.000Z	cast	fosa	no point copying empty space
2009-08-09T06:21:00.000Z	fosa	cast	i heard dd was the best way to store all settings
2009-08-09T06:21:00.000Z	cast	fosa	and who told you that
2009-08-09T11:06:00.000Z	cast	fosa	no real need to clone, use mkfs+tar
2009-08-09T11:07:00.000Z	fosa	cast	gogeta which one is easier and which one maintains my current user settings exactly?
2009-08-09T11:08:00.000Z	cast	fosa	settings are merely stored in files, they both would replicate your settings, as would cp, dump/restore, et el
2009-08-09T11:09:00.000Z	cast	fosa	one is way way faster, and imho the smarter way.
2009-08-09T11:09:00.000Z	cast	fosa	it is also more flexible
2009-08-09T11:11:00.000Z	fosa	cast	i'll take your word for it, do you know of a good site tutorial for tar+mfks?
2009-08-09T11:11:00.000Z	cast	fosa	perhaps a theoretical understanding would benefit you best.
2009-08-09T11:12:00.000Z	fosa	cast	uhtoh, i'd prefer a step by step walkthrough that treats me like i'm an idiot
2009-08-09T11:14:00.000Z	fosa	cast	any tips on where i can learn how to mkfs?
2009-08-09T11:14:00.000Z	cast	fosa	my proposal is this: partition, mkfs on new drive. copy files over to new drive.
2009-08-09T11:14:00.000Z	cast	fosa	mkfs is easy, mkfs.xfs /dev/sdXY
2009-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	fosa	cast	and i should be doing these partitions from an ubuntu live cd or is it completely irrelevant?  does it matter how much activity i have going on while the mkfs is running?  (such as editing files/music/normal os usage?)
2009-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	cast	fosa	mkfs is very fast
2009-08-09T11:16:00.000Z	cast	fosa	you can do whatever you want during the operations
2009-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	fosa	cast	 i'm already working from an ubuntu live cd as you might have noticed, and there is a nice tutorial that details using sudo grub, find /boot/grub/stage 1 type things, root hd(0,0) etc.. is that the tricky part?
2009-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	cast	fosa	what exactly are you copying?
2009-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	cast	fosa	aye, the grub bit si the tricky bit
2009-08-09T11:20:00.000Z	cast	fosa	cant you just have two hard drives :)
2009-08-09T11:20:00.000Z	cast	fosa	yeah, i have NFI about NTFS or the windows boot sequence
