2007-12-25T00:36:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		I'm trying to install a dual-boot of Ubuntu on my father
2007-12-25T00:36:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		's laptop
2007-12-25T00:36:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		grr, butterfingers
2007-12-25T00:38:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		I'm trying to set up a dual-boot of with Ubuntu on my father's laptop that has Vista installed. When I try to install with the Live CD, it does not give me  the option for Guided Install on the empty space on the hard drive (about 11gb free of 60)- just Guided using the entire disk and Manual. How can I install Ubuntu in the free space so it can dual-boot Vista/Ubuntu?
2007-12-25T00:39:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	have you looked at resizing the drive in vista first.. to make the partion?
2007-12-25T00:41:00.000Z	Tezasaurus	numpy	No, I didn't think I had to do that- I haven't really used Vista much, I was on XP myself before ubuntu
2007-12-25T00:43:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	the best way to go aobut it is to part the drive.. as the version of *buntu you might have will probably not know what or how to resize the bits in the Vista part.
2007-12-25T00:43:00.000Z	Tezasaurus	numpy	Okay, so I use a tool in Vista to resize the partition, and then when I use the Ubuntu live cd again, it will let me install into that free space?
2007-12-25T00:44:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	indeed it will bro..
2007-12-25T00:44:00.000Z	numpy		you need to have better hold on your system them magic_ninja :-)
2007-12-25T00:49:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		okay, new question about gparted
2007-12-25T00:49:00.000Z	numpy		shoot
2007-12-25T00:51:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		there are two partitions, an 8gb recovery partition and the main on (65gb)- so I want to resize the 65gb so there are 10gb free, so I would put 0 for Free Space Preceding, 55000 for new size, and 10000 for Free Space Following?
2007-12-25T00:56:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	no no man try it this way
2007-12-25T00:58:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	actually looking at your description of what you need you are right
2007-12-25T00:58:00.000Z	Tezasaurus	numpy	You sure? I don
2007-12-25T00:59:00.000Z	Tezasaurus		t' want to kill my father's laptop :P
2007-12-25T01:00:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	I looks "right " to me.. the problem that I saw with it was the "space before" option
2007-12-25T01:00:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	you should want to start from the ass end of a drive
2007-12-25T01:01:00.000Z	Tezasaurus	numpy	Actually, it's not letting me resize at all. I can type in the values but can't confirm the resize. I'll just try it in Vista
2007-12-25T01:02:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	that's the best way to go at it bro :)
2007-12-25T01:02:00.000Z	numpy	Tezasaurus	sorry not much help beyond that
2007-12-25T01:02:00.000Z	Tezasaurus	numpy	No problem- if it works in Vista, that should solve everything. Do you know the name of the program in Vista?
