2009-02-06T06:05:00.000Z	glen_		:P
2009-02-06T06:05:00.000Z	glen_		umm
2009-02-06T06:05:00.000Z	glen_		go to www.hotmail.com?
2009-02-06T06:05:00.000Z	glen_		Umm, When I try to run Sudo, it says "must be setuid root"
2009-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	glen_		What's wrong with it/
2009-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	you do sudo with a command. thats the do part
2009-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	sudo ls
2009-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	wait, sudo ls?
2009-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	man ls
2009-02-06T06:07:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	Ok, your confusing me
2009-02-06T06:07:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	su means go super user.  do means, well do.  so sudo means, do this command as super user.  aka root user
2009-02-06T06:08:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	what are you trying to do?
2009-02-06T06:09:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	Well, I strongly dislike the way root owns several things that I should as the sysadmin. So I'm trying to own everything basicaly.
2009-02-06T06:10:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	ubuntu has no root user, so if you want to do something as root, you use sudo .  nice side, is no one can hack your root account. there is none
2009-02-06T06:10:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	I'd have to  disagree with that. User manager says there's a root.
2009-02-06T06:11:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	it is good that they did it that way.  it protects the system from people who do not understand how to use root
2009-02-06T06:12:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	sounds like you would be logged into irc with root, if you had a root user
2009-02-06T06:12:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	Huh? The system updater doesn't even work.
2009-02-06T06:13:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	how are you trying to run it?
2009-02-06T06:13:00.000Z	glen_	gpled	What, IRC? This is chatzilla.

2009-02-06T06:15:00.000Z	gpled	glen_	man sudo
