2006-11-19T11:40:00.000Z	feross		brett_: hey so got it working?
2006-11-19T11:40:00.000Z	brett_	feross	 well it still saying RADIO OFF
2006-11-19T11:41:00.000Z	feross	brett_	did sudo kismet right..
2006-11-19T11:41:00.000Z	brett_	feross	 and scan is being done way too fast.... with nothing been found.. with KWifimanager it shows eth1 as disabled.
2006-11-19T11:42:00.000Z	feross	brett_	are you trying to do it on the same laptop that you are connecting on right now? are you on wire while trying to scan on wireless?
2006-11-19T11:44:00.000Z	brett_	feross	sorry*
2006-11-19T11:45:00.000Z	brett_	feross	 I did sudo kismet yes... it did a few things ("Enabling channel hopping." for eg)  then done.
2006-11-19T11:48:00.000Z	feross	brett_	ok... something is messing it up. I would comment out my whole /etc/network/interfaces except for the lo interface... clear the profiles.xml that gnome-nm-applet makes and install network-manager.. then restart and disable wireless through the network-manager task-tray icon and try kismet again. that's how I currently have it setup.
2006-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	brett_	feross	 Do you know were profiles.xml is located?
2006-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	feross	brett_	oh, well if you're using xubuntu I don't think the gnome-nm-applet is enabled by default right...
2006-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	brett_	feross	  yes I dont think so.
2006-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	feross	brett_	so go ahead and install network-manager and go from there.. you could try to restart udev to get network-manager going or just quick reboot.
2006-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	brett_	feross	any ideas about my earlier question about using having KDE session as opposed to Xfce or gnome?   I mean how to switch between these just via login manager?
2006-11-19T11:59:00.000Z	feross	brett_	yeah, if you apt-get install kde-desktop or something like that... you'll be able to switch between the desktops from the login
2006-11-19T11:59:00.000Z	brett_	feross	BTW I already have network-manager installed from before.
2006-11-19T12:00:00.000Z	feross	brett_	did you comment out your interfaces file? everything in there except the lo device
2006-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	brett_	feross	yes I did... I think I should restart once though?
2006-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	brett_	feross	I left iface & eh0 though or else I will not have net access?
2006-11-19T12:02:00.000Z	feross	brett_	yes or just /etc/inet.d/networking restart .. but it wouldn't hurt if you just want to restart.
2006-11-19T12:02:00.000Z	feross	brett_	you have to manage those through network manager..
2006-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	brett_	feross	Sorry where is network manager located?  I have so many net-related tools  :-s
2006-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	feross	brett_	should be on the task tray .. looks like four little bars
2006-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	feross	brett_	or two pc's
