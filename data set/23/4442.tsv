2007-08-15T14:43:00.000Z	TBZ		Hey guys, I'm trying to compile something first time around, I have read info pertaining it but can not get it to work right. First, can someone explain ./configure? When I "./configure" I get "./configure: No such file or directory"
2007-08-15T14:43:00.000Z	TBZ		I'm there..
2007-08-15T14:43:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	some programs don't use the ./configure script. There should be an INSTALL/README file in the archive that expains how to compile and install
2007-08-15T14:50:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	yup (if you make install then the files will be installed into predetermined locations)
2007-08-15T14:50:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	a make will just compile the app in the pwd
2007-08-15T14:54:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	not sure about those various make commands....the package should document em
2007-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	are you on fiesty?
2007-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	you can always tried the old, tested, and tru make then
2007-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	not at the moment. Are you having problems pulling in postfix packages?
2007-08-15T14:56:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	I'm getting various "warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function"
2007-08-15T14:56:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	sorry, wrong person
2007-08-15T14:57:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	don't worry about those
2007-08-15T14:57:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	the only thing you need to worry about is an *ERROR*, *warnings* are ok...it referers to the coding of the actual app
2007-08-15T15:00:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	are you using the period there? ./glnostromo?
2007-08-15T15:00:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	.glnostromo command not found
2007-08-15T15:01:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	./glnostromo: No such file or directory
2007-08-15T15:01:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	if you look around that directory...do you see the glnostromo directory?
2007-08-15T15:01:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	the glnostromo file, sorry
2007-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	no... only nostromo
2007-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	you could try ./nostromo then
2007-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	k, just did, and I guess it ran but it didn't do anything
2007-08-15T15:02:00.000Z	somedrew	TBZ	but if the executable is supposed to be called glnostromo...they may have been an issue during compilation
2007-08-15T15:04:00.000Z	TBZ	somedrew	will you dl this and install it plz? so you can see for yourself so I can better understand? it's basically a usb2key thing so I can use gamepad, something I really need
