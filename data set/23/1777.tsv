2009-11-13T03:21:00.000Z	dno		Any experts have knowledge about mount share from a NAS?
2009-11-13T03:22:00.000Z	epinky	dno	protocol ?
2009-11-13T03:23:00.000Z	dno	epinky	I am trying to connect 9.10 to my netgear nas.  I can sudo mount cifs but it fails.
2009-11-13T03:24:00.000Z	epinky	dno	it does not support other protocols?
2009-11-13T03:24:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 I can try from Nautilus, but once I select the share it keeps asking for the password.  It works with my 8.04 box.  But not my 9.10 box.
2009-11-13T03:25:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Is there come synaptic program that controls authorization or something?
2009-11-13T03:26:00.000Z	epinky	dno	what protocol?
2009-11-13T03:29:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Well, it is like my computer sees the NAS and I can ping it and I can connect to the folders that do NOT have a password.  But for the folders with a password it just keeps asking me for the password.  Somewhere they are not talking when it comes to passwords.
2009-11-13T03:29:00.000Z	epinky	dno	netgear ...?
2009-11-13T03:30:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Yes...
2009-11-13T03:30:00.000Z	epinky	dno	netgear model
2009-11-13T03:31:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 ReadyNAS
2009-11-13T03:31:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Any thoughts?
2009-11-13T03:33:00.000Z	epinky	dno	The ReadyNAS supports a wide range of protocols, including NFS, AFP, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS and Rsync ..., you're using ...?
2009-11-13T03:35:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Here is my command sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.104/backup /media/netgear
2009-11-13T03:37:00.000Z	epinky	dno	then include : sudo mount -t cifs -o username=NAME,password=PASSWORD //192.168.1.104/backup /media/netgear
2009-11-13T03:38:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 I can add that too, but either one gives memount error(13): Permission denied
2009-11-13T03:40:00.000Z	epinky	dno	have you tried with smbfs ?
2009-11-13T03:42:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 Yes. both smbfs and cifs give me the same error.  That is why I think it is a protocol, handshake or something.
2009-11-13T03:44:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 is there a way to see the output of the communication between the two after the command is executed?
2009-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	epinky	dno	I don't think so, it'll better if you check your NAS logs
2009-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	dno	epinky	 ok thanks
