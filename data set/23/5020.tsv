2007-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	could you please tell me how I could select/change the colour?
2007-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	in the preferences
2007-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	or Settings, don't know how it is called in English
2007-03-12T06:14:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	I just want to change the colour. it's red now. no idea how to do it
2007-03-12T06:15:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	I have an spanish version, so maybe the names of the menus/options are different, but it should be: Configuration -> Preferences -> Colors
2007-03-12T06:15:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	I was there before but ..
2007-03-12T06:15:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	but?
2007-03-12T06:16:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	if I write something it's in grey. if you write something and there is my nick it's in red. I just want to change the colours
2007-03-12T06:17:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	your nick in bold but not the message. I want event the message to be in bold
2007-03-12T06:18:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	you can change the colours, but I don't think you can make the whole message bold
2007-03-12T06:19:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	so what's the colour name for highlighted message?
2007-03-12T06:20:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	text colours got some numbers do you know what they mean?
2007-03-12T06:20:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	below that there should be more colours without number
2007-03-12T06:21:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	only for marking text and interface colours
2007-03-12T06:22:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	below interface colours, the first one of the right column
2007-03-12T06:23:00.000Z	cimenta	facugaich	let's try
2007-03-12T06:23:00.000Z	facugaich	cimenta	it's not that one :(
