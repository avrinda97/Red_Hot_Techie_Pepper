2009-07-15T03:00:00.000Z	puff		Hm, I installed cups-pdf and it created a PDF printer, but when I print to printer PDF, where does the output file show up?
2009-07-15T03:01:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	~/PDF
2009-07-15T03:02:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Ah, thanks, had to create ~/PDF for it to print to.
2011-11-05T00:39:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	you'll be much happier with the -alternate CD image
2011-11-05T00:39:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Really?
2011-11-05T00:39:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	really. parted is menu-driven. selecting what aprtitions to mount and use where is a breeze.
2011-11-05T00:40:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	remember, you're going to have to match UUIDs and such across installs to get file permissions happy.
2011-11-05T00:40:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Right... does that just mean I have to tweak /etc/passwd & etc to make sure the user accounts have the same numbers?
2011-11-05T00:41:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	just get used to creating users and groups from the command line, and you can tell the OS what UUID to assign.
2011-11-05T00:41:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Okay, that's easy enough.
2011-11-05T00:42:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	but if you know what /etc/passwd *is* you are well capable of running the alternate install.
2011-11-05T00:42:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	I'm pretty familiar with this stuff, it's just the dual-boot aspect that's new to me.
2011-11-05T00:43:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	So I run the alternate install CD, manual partitioning, select the new / for the system, select existing /home, then install, right?
2011-11-05T00:44:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	the alternate installer has a few more install tweaks easily available. such as defining partition use and mount points, LUKS, dm-crypt etc etc
2011-11-05T00:44:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	And afterwards, make sure I create users with the same UUIDs.
2011-11-05T00:44:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	How do I set up the boot process?
2011-11-05T00:44:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	right, you'll get to partitioning, see the stuff that already there, and assign a mount point. you can tell the installer NOT to format it
2011-11-05T00:45:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	the GRUB installer should find the other /boot and menuitizerize it
2011-11-05T00:45:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	The GRUB installer from the new (11.10) install?
2011-11-05T00:46:00.000Z	mneptok	puff	another /boot should make GRUB set up menu entries for the other installation. but i have not done any of this recently.
2011-11-05T00:50:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Okay, thanks.
2011-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	Sounds risky enough that I'm going to wait until I get home and see if the overnight backups executed properly (didn't have time to check this morning :-()
2011-11-06T02:28:00.000Z	puff	mneptok	you around?
