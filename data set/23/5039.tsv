2007-04-21T11:45:00.000Z	sickofwireless		jordan_u: uh it sees my card, I just can't see (connect) to my network
2007-04-21T11:45:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	if you do sudo iwlist eth1 scan it tells you what networks are out there
2007-04-21T11:46:00.000Z	sickofwireless		crazytom: I click on network config, it does not display the wireless network
2007-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	just do sudo iwconfig eth1 essid laptops
2007-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	sickofwireless		yup
2007-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	sickofwireless		crazytom: is something supposed to happen?
2007-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	nope
2007-04-21T11:48:00.000Z	sickofwireless		crazytom: okay. Done that
2007-04-21T11:48:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	do sudo iwconfig eth1 key yourkeyhere
2007-04-21T11:48:00.000Z	sickofwireless		does WPA work?
2007-04-21T11:55:00.000Z	sickofwireless		crazytom:Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : invalid argument "my key here"
2007-04-21T11:57:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	you have got to be kidding right?  use your wep key. it's probably a number.
2007-04-21T11:57:00.000Z	sickofwireless		my network is set on a WPA key
2007-04-21T11:57:00.000Z	sickofwireless		ok, i'll change it
2007-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	Crazytom	sickofwireless	then you're going to have to install wpasupplicant if it's not already installed
