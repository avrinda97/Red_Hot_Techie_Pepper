2008-12-15T10:03:00.000Z	iHome		i feel gedit nowadays not quick enough for me, any suggestion for an easy change-to?
2008-12-15T10:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	you can use pico (nano) like evilGUI suggests
2008-12-15T10:05:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	i m doing basic php coding, and sometimes manipulate data. eg today: 100,000 lines of 50 chars, replace " with ' and gedit got stuck
2008-12-15T10:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	you may want to consider vim,
2008-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	vim is the last to learn. someone suggest 1 year ago, never learn howto do with vim
2008-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	they have some crazy useful features, for replace like that, it would be s/"/' or something like that
2008-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	i can't remember if it would require escapes, regardless, it's useful
2008-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	same with ereg, i never got a clue what-to-do :D
2008-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	yeah, vim is a pain for a while, but it's well worth the effort
2008-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	well. i m looking for retire soon.
2008-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	you can also try something like pida (http://pida.co.uk/)
2008-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	it's an IDE that integrates vim or emacs, moo in the future
2008-12-15T10:08:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	ok thanks
2008-12-15T10:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	or cream, which is a easier version of vim
2008-12-15T10:11:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	mmm. interesting. text-edit is one of the first application we need. hope gedit(the ubuntu-default) will be better tomorrow?
2008-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	who knows, there's so much animosity when it comes to that, that there will likely never be an end; the vim and emacs guys have been fighting it our for years :)
2008-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	pida look nice to me, nano looks like vim, and i m not in a mood to try
2008-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	well, more like decades now
2008-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	there's also editra, it does search and replace
2008-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	what do you use? not gedit and not vim
2008-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	rdw200169	iHome	i use pida, with vim
2008-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	oh dear. gedit finally finish the replace 10-15 minutes !
2008-12-15T10:15:00.000Z	iHome	rdw200169	me still in honeymoon with gedit. still want to keep it for a while :D
