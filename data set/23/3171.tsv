2008-10-06T05:00:00.000Z	Killer--Tux		bibertdos - when i recored my screen and i send the video to someone the quality is bad
2008-10-06T05:01:00.000Z	Killer--Tux		<aurel42> well i have a 36" sony
2008-10-06T05:01:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	try increasing the video quality or "bitrate" in the capturing application.
2008-10-06T05:01:00.000Z	Killer--Tux		<aurel42> tht not the problem
2008-10-06T05:02:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	the more details you provide, the higher the chance of someone understanding your problem. ;)
2008-10-06T05:02:00.000Z	Killer--Tux		<aurel42> but how about on videos i have already recorded
2008-10-06T05:02:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: do you understand what i am trying to say ?!?
2008-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	I suspect that's not possible, but it might depend on your capture application.
2008-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	I think I understand that you use some tool to record videos of your desktop activity and that the quality is too low (blurry text in the video etc.). Correct?
2008-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: yes
2008-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	unless that tool keeps high-res raw data and produces bad-quality videos afterwards, there's no chance to improve videos after the fact.
2008-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: oo
2008-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: this is going to be tough
2008-10-06T05:06:00.000Z	aurel42	Killer--Tux	you produced a lot of videos without checking the quality on a sample first? ;)
2008-10-06T05:06:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: pretty much
2008-10-06T05:07:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	aurel42	: lol
