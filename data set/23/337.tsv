2011-12-25T02:14:00.000Z	Raliegh		Mmkay, this is probably a stupid question... But I'm currently installing Gnome on my server for a GUI. How exactly do I USE said GUI remotely?
2011-12-25T02:16:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	I like Xnest
2011-12-25T02:36:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	 for a remote GUI you really could do to use lxde/xfce
2011-12-25T02:38:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	use ssh X forwarding and an app called arista.  or learn to use ffmpeg
2011-12-25T02:39:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	ffmpeg can be quite easy, depends what you want to do....
2011-12-25T02:39:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	autoremove --purge
2011-12-25T02:40:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	might have to sudo apt-get autoremove --purge (just like that) after it also to make sure
2011-12-25T02:40:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	what kind of transcoding you need to do ?
2011-12-25T02:41:00.000Z	Raliegh	mongy	I need to transcode a live ICecast stream in OGG and convert it to MPEG/MP3, and then push to a new Icecast mount. Also I got a segmentation fault with that previous command, haha.
2011-12-25T02:42:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	so, convert ogg to mp3?
2011-12-25T02:43:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	I'm no ffmpeg buff but I know it can do streams..  man ffmpeg
2011-12-25T02:43:00.000Z	Raliegh	mongy	apt-get --purge remove ubuntu-desktop gives me a sgmentation fault crap. I gotta remove Gnome before I work on all of that, haha.
2011-12-25T02:46:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	are you sure its not just using it all for cache?
2011-12-25T02:47:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	free -m
2011-12-25T02:51:00.000Z	Raliegh	mongy	Just did a reboot though and that free up a looot of memory, so yay.
2011-12-25T02:52:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	yeah I saw it was using all your ram..    what vps is it?
2011-12-25T02:52:00.000Z	Raliegh	mongy	are you asking what my OS is or my VPS provider?
2011-12-25T02:59:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	sometimes you have to remove stuff manually..
2011-12-25T02:59:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	as seveas says....
2011-12-25T03:00:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	use autoremove --purge
2011-12-25T03:03:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	just go through it like autoremove --purge gnome* libgtk*
2011-12-25T03:26:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	ask in #ffmpeg they will know how to pipe from a stream into whatever
2011-12-27T03:56:00.000Z	mongy	Raliegh	I find installing from vbox repo sometimes slow and unresponsive also.  I quit and try again
