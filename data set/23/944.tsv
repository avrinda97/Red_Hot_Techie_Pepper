2011-01-05T11:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	normally the software goes into packages and can be varied from distro to distro, under ubuntu those software packages usually have the file extension .deb
2011-01-05T11:46:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	can i get documentation or some kind of book about it??
2011-01-05T11:47:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	you might be interested in looking into DEB package management HOWTO on internet
2011-01-05T11:48:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	thanks man, and also i am unable to open any of my hard disk drives, by default when i click on them they get open in vlc player!!
2011-01-05T11:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	something is messed up there, it could be the file manager you are using I think
2011-01-05T11:49:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	so how can i make work it back to normal.
2011-01-05T11:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	that doesn't matter really
2011-01-05T11:50:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	:)
2011-01-05T11:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	I'm not sure exactly how :) I don't use nautilus (default ubuntu/gnome file manager)
2011-01-05T11:51:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	so how can i remove nautalius.
2011-01-05T11:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	I wouldn't do that :)
2011-01-05T11:52:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	so is there any way to make it work proper?
2011-01-05T11:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	I'd look into something like file associations for example
2011-01-05T12:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	you could try holding shift, select the file that needs to be permanently deleted and hit the delete button on you keyboard
2011-01-05T12:07:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	s/you/your/
2011-01-05T12:08:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	after deleting the file it does go to trash can instead gets directly deleted!!
2011-01-05T12:08:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	even when holding shift key?
2011-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	babaji	psycho_oreos	ya
2011-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	babaji	weird, I dunno then :)
