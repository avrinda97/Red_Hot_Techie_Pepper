2011-05-16T05:26:00.000Z	pfifo	devnull_	no
2011-05-16T05:28:00.000Z	pfifo	devnull_	are you sure your device is getting enough power? plugged into a powered usb port and its light comes on if it has one?
2011-05-16T05:33:00.000Z	pfifo	devnull_	usually even usb devices that dont have drivers show up in lsusb, since yours is not Im thinking its the ddevices fault, can you test it on a different computer
