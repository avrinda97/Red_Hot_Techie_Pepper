2006-03-14T14:54:00.000Z	kditty		i only have around 4-5GB free on my system
2006-03-14T14:55:00.000Z	kditty		would 4GB be enough room to install?
2006-03-14T14:55:00.000Z	kditty		install and run properly
2006-03-14T14:55:00.000Z	kditty		i could free some up
2006-03-14T14:55:00.000Z	kditty		i just dont know where it all goes with xp...
2006-03-14T14:56:00.000Z	kditty		well i hardly have ANYTHING on my computer, i deleted all of my media
2006-03-14T14:56:00.000Z	kditty		but somehow i have 16GB used space
2006-03-14T14:57:00.000Z	kditty		i would use an external, but i cant afford one at the moment and i dont want to hook something else up to this computer
2006-03-14T14:57:00.000Z	kditty		its coming straight out of the archives, this computer was purchased in 2001
2006-03-14T14:58:00.000Z	ewood	kditty	your computer have internal space for a second hard drive? It'd make installing Ubuntu a lot more feasible.
2006-03-14T14:58:00.000Z	kditty		800mhz intel celron, 20gbhd, 256ram
2006-03-14T14:59:00.000Z	kditty		thats all i got, no extra space either
2006-03-14T14:59:00.000Z	ewood		Meh, buy a 10 gig HD or something.
2006-03-14T14:59:00.000Z	ewood		Unless you find a bigger one really cheap
2006-03-14T14:59:00.000Z	kditty		ive got another computer with vector linux installed on it, i was thinking of pluging it in and installing a network card and connecting the two
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	ewood		That other computer mean much to you in one piece?
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	kditty		lol no
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	kditty		a foot stool
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	ewood		Yank that vector Linux HD out of it and put it into your XP box.
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	kditty		i use it to keep my feet propped up sometimes
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	ewood		There ya go - a spare hard drive just waiting to become your new Ubuntu drive.
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	kditty	ewood	there isnt room for it in this case
