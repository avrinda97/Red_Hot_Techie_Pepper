2007-08-30T14:50:00.000Z	mraustin1337		Hello.  I've had this problem before but it was in 6.10 and now in 7.04 I'm having the same issue.  I installed the nvidia kernel modules from NVIDIA-installer and now I have to run the installer every boot.  I added nv to the restricted-modules but no success, any suggestions?
2007-08-30T14:52:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	does it say  API mismatch?
2007-08-30T14:52:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Let me look.
2007-08-30T14:53:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	I'm going to give it a reboot to see the exact error.
2007-08-30T14:54:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	so you tried the ubuntu restricted drivers and the ones from the nvidia website?
2007-08-30T14:55:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	you need to remove the ubuntu restricted drivers before installing the ones from nvidia website they conflict
2007-08-30T14:58:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Yes, API Mismatch.
2007-08-30T14:58:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	lol i was talking to you... didn't realise you left so soon ....
2007-08-30T14:59:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	lol  Sorry.  My /var/log/Xorg.log was screwed so I wanted to get a clean one.
2007-08-30T14:59:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	So what should I do?  Easy fix?  =)
2007-08-30T14:59:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	ok API Mismatch is common it happened to me..
2007-08-30T15:00:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	basically the drivers from the nvidia website conflict with the old ubuntu drivers.. they need to be removed first...  type:   sudo apt-get remove nvidia*      then reinstall the website drivers
2007-08-30T15:02:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	nvidia-kernel-common is the only one installed, I'm removing it.
2007-08-30T15:08:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Perfection.  Thanks man.
2007-08-30T15:10:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	great mate... compiz fusion and all the bling should work now..  remember if you upgrade the kernel or x server you will need to reinstall the driver.. so keep a copy
2007-08-30T15:13:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Yeah.  I always do.  Note on compiz fusion, is there a way to not have to do a hard power off every shutdown?
2007-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	are you sure it's compiz's fault lol?    is it a laptop?  i never got hibernate to work properly
2007-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Well my computer shuts down alright normally but if I have compiz running it locks up completely on a shutdown.
2007-08-30T15:18:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	i had that but it fixed itself with the latest version.  i am using the gutsy gibbon alpha and i didn't know if it was compiz or gnome..  are you using the latest compiz?
2007-08-30T15:19:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	I think it is the latest, let me check.
2007-08-30T15:20:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	0.5.2
2007-08-30T15:24:00.000Z	mraustin1337	serenityUK	Maybe I'll talk to the compiz-fusion guys.
2007-08-30T15:25:00.000Z	serenityUK	mraustin1337	yes there is a #compis-fusion channel
