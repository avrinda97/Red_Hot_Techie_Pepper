2008-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe		actually nevermind guyz thanks anywayz
2008-08-29T09:37:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe		Hey guyz, could anyone plz tell me how step by step to get to the xserver configuration?
2008-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 the xserver is configured by the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  theres various tools to alter that file. Its just an ascii/text file
2008-08-29T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 'sudo nano /path/to/file' BACKUP THE ORIGINAL first.
2008-08-29T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 'alt-ctrl-f1' to get to the console perhaps?
2008-08-29T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	  try the recovery/rescue feature from the grub menu?
2008-08-29T09:44:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe	Dr_willis	it does the same thing--goes blank screen, I need to configure zee file --xorg
2008-08-29T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 if the recovery/rescue mode gives a blank screen.. then ya got a bigger issue.. It dosent spawn X if i recall correctly. so its not a xorg.conf issue.
2008-08-29T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 so when you selecte revovery you dont see a lot of 'text' messages go scrolling by eh?
2008-08-29T09:47:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe	Dr_willis	running recovery mode
2008-08-29T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	  you might want to disable the 'framebuffer' in the normal boot options. that may be why you are seeing no error messages on a normal bootup.
2008-08-29T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 thats a start at least. :)
2008-08-29T09:49:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe	Dr_willis	everytime the "Loading Hardware Drivers" appears its takes forever and then it doesnt say ok
2008-08-29T09:50:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe	Dr_willis	the loading hardware drivers takes forever and doesnt say ok
2008-08-29T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 you may need to manally install the ati/fglrx drivers from the command line. then test them with 'startx' perhaps.
2008-08-29T09:51:00.000Z	BiNaRyCoDe	Dr_willis	would a nvidia Velocity 128 work with ubuntu???
2008-08-29T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 it should.
2008-08-29T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 most nvidia cards work better then ati
2008-08-29T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx' or nvidia-glx-legacy, or nvidia-glx-new :) should do it
2008-08-29T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 dependign on how old the card is
2008-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 if you boot 'normally' to X. the consoles are on the alt-ctrl-F1 through F6 screens.
2008-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BiNaRyCoDe	 I have no idea why the ati card is messing up the console.  Could be the framebuffer. may not be..
