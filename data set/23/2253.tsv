2009-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	the installer does this
2009-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	The problem is that the installer isn't showing up the 50 gigs of free space on my disk
2009-05-13T19:34:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	50G free on NTFS partition or unpartitioned space?
2009-05-13T19:35:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	It's free space on an NTFS partition
2009-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	you need to shrink that NTFS partition. The installer can do this
2009-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	I'm going to give it another go mate, I'll get back to you if it doesn't happen
2009-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	It says the amount of space used on the drive is unknown, and then gives me an option to use as a particular file system and set a mount point
2009-05-13T19:47:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	is that hte alternate CD?
2009-05-13T19:47:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Shouldn't be, it's a 32bit installer which I'm putting onto an AMD64
2009-05-13T19:48:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	desktop CD then
2009-05-13T19:48:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Yes mate
2009-05-13T19:49:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	what does it say exactly
2009-05-13T19:50:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Device; dev/sda1, Type; NTFS, Size; 152800, Used; unknown
2009-05-13T19:51:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Then when in "Edit partition" it says Use as; (then a file type, ntfs ext3 etc etc)
2009-05-13T19:52:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	it's so long ago that I installed. I feel lost right now.
2009-05-13T19:53:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Mate, so do I. I think I might just forget the dual boot thing and get rid of windows
2009-05-13T19:53:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	I'm so fed up of trying to keep windows..
2009-05-13T19:53:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	do you have more than one computer?
2009-05-13T19:54:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	In the house, yeah.
2009-05-13T19:54:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	I think that eases the decision.
2009-05-13T19:55:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Aye, does a bit, doesn't it. I'll give one last try at making another partition. If that fails, it's goodbye to windows.
2009-05-13T19:59:00.000Z	Vxn	ranf	Cheers for your help mate, see you later.
2009-05-13T19:59:00.000Z	ranf	Vxn	bye
