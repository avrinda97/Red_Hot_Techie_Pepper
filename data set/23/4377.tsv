2007-08-31T16:05:00.000Z	eamonnd		tux: so now that I'm in system log, do I search for "error"
2007-08-31T16:06:00.000Z	eamonnd		tux: okay I'm there
2007-08-31T16:06:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	searching for error is a good start
2007-08-31T16:07:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	I clicked on "error_log" and the only error that was listed read "creating missing directory "/var/run/cups/certs"
2007-08-31T16:08:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	search for the word error in sys.log
2007-08-31T16:08:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	okay, so use "crtl f"
2007-08-31T16:09:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	I ran "ctrl F" in "syslog" and the error that came up was "Firmware error detected. Restarting"
2007-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	it says "ipw2200" infront of it too
2007-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	check if this is related to the piece of hardware you are concerned with.
2007-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	how do I do that?
2007-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	i used to have a problem with the ipw2200 as well.
2007-08-31T16:11:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	I also found "Buffer I/O error on devie sr0, logical block 3809531"
2007-08-31T16:11:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	ipw2200 is a wireless network driver. are you having problems with wlan?
2007-08-31T16:12:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	I could be, I am connected to the internet whenever my computer crashes, I might have been wrongly blaming the problem on my sound. I don't know for sure though
2007-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	you still there? how do I find out whether this is the problem?
2007-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	sorry, lagging
2007-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	okay that's fine. I was just making sure you were there
2007-08-31T16:16:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	which soundcard are you using?
2007-08-31T16:17:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	it's an Intel ICH4
2007-08-31T16:17:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	have you tried disabling the sound card in BIOS?
2007-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	no, I don't know how to do that, and then if I did wouldn't I not have sound anymore?
2007-08-31T16:19:00.000Z	idefixs	eamonnd	look into #eamonnd, to much traffic in here
2007-08-31T16:19:00.000Z	eamonnd	idefixs	okay I'm there
