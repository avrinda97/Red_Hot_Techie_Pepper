2010-01-25T07:11:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	i read that doesn't answer my question
2010-01-25T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	wasn't your question about whether numbering starts at 0 or 1 in grub 2?
2010-01-25T07:14:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	sda1=1 sdb=2 sdc=3 sdd=extended sde=firstLogical=?
2010-01-25T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	same as before afaik.  It's the nth partition.  So in your example, 5
2010-01-25T07:19:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	you have a link/ereference? In grub1 firstlogical always = 4
2010-01-25T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	because counting started at 0 before, now it starts at 1
2010-01-25T07:21:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	you are saying that no matter my partitioning, /dev/sdaX always equals hd0,X ?  even with 1 primary 1 logical, /dev/sda3 = hd0,3 ?
2010-01-25T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	afaik, yes.
2010-01-25T07:21:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	where is that info? I want to be REALLY sure b4 i potentialy hose it
2010-01-25T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	how would you hose it?  It would just fail to boot
2010-01-25T07:22:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	that would mean reinstall for me
2010-01-25T07:23:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	add an extra entry in grub instead of deleting the working one, no?
2010-01-25T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	you would have figured it out already.  The link I gave you earlier explains how the numbering works.  There's also the official grub 2 docs I guess
2010-01-25T07:25:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	thing is (i'm using alternate i386) top says "configuration grub-pc" yet the instructions & examples are for old grub with wrong numbering
2010-01-25T07:26:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	will it actualy do the correct thing given the corrct number?
2010-01-25T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	I don't understand what you just said.  top of what?
2010-01-25T07:26:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	i'm using the alternate install disk, when promped to write grub to mrbr i decline, then next screen it ask me for hdx,x, gut gives old instructin for grub1
2010-01-25T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	what ubuntu version?
2010-01-25T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	I don't actually know if the alternate disk uses grub 2 or not
2010-01-25T07:28:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	oh, that could make it different from live? it says "grub-pc" in title of that screen, grub-pc is grub2 no?
2010-01-25T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	lizk	I don't know.  I suppose if that's true, it's very likely a bug already exists at bugs.ubuntu.com about it
2010-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	lizk	jrib	thing is this is my second install, first worked briefly then wouldn't boot after update grub said "file not found"
