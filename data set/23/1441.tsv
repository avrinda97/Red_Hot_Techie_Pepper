2011-06-03T12:02:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	what's the background you need for the course?
2011-06-03T12:02:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	you can install the HTTPS everywhere Firefox plugin: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
2011-06-03T12:02:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	the only background necessary is an interest in web standards and peer learning.
2011-06-03T12:03:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	we can have an open AND secure network. Thank you for opening your wi-fi :-)
2011-06-03T12:06:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	check out Firestarter, the iptables frontend.
2011-06-03T12:06:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	my cable provider made a little mistake and took the brakes off my connection. I often get 20MB tho I dont use it.
2011-06-03T12:07:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	you may consider putting some of your extra bandwidth to use protecting free speech online: https://www.eff.org/torchallenge
2011-06-03T12:08:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	 noisewaterphd I've been reading about iptables and I'm not sure what this is. My gui is gnome or do you mean something else. You need to get this idea. I am very smart but that means if "something is left out that connects the ideas" I can be dumb as a rock. (the good part is I dont break things. not counting that Thermostat housing I messed up once on a car)
2011-06-03T12:08:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	Firestarter is a GUI tool to configure iptables.
2011-06-03T12:10:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	Open Mesh routers have dual SSIDs so that you can have an open, bandwidth throttled, network as well as an encrypted wireless network at the same time. http://open-mesh.com
2011-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	that is almost nonsense to me. as I said, I need some basics before I can understant, throttled 2 networks open mesh ssid sual ssid -- so I will look at your link and copy all this advice into a file.
2011-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	start with HTTPS everywhere plugin: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
2011-06-03T12:13:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	here is a Firestarter tutorial: http://www.fs-security.com/docs/tutorial.php
2011-06-03T12:13:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	Wikipedia is your friend for any  words that you do not know.
2011-06-03T12:14:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	you can use the following plugin to look up a selected word on Wikipedia: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wikipedia-lookup-add-on/
2011-06-03T12:16:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	there is also an introductory GNU/Linux course on Peer to Peer University: http://new.p2pu.org/en/groups/linux/
2011-06-03T12:16:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	still copying
2011-06-03T12:19:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	noisewaterphd  -- thatnks for this info. I'd been reading but had not gotten to the point where I can see the basic issues, except for by common sense - and I need more than that to tweak the systems I am involved with. So this gies me somewhere to go. I think I have to learn the network layers "maybe?"

2011-06-03T12:24:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	if you are still here hehe.  If peer to peer means what I think then perhaps I can set up a way for others to break through the "threshold barrier" between ignorance and being able to play -- sometimes there are basics that are hard to get. a midddle ground say on Ubuntu between how to use and how to think about it. (if you want to go to offtopic or PM anytime it's quite alright) Once I understand something I'm good at that.
2011-06-03T12:24:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	I've heard about the tor challenge on reddit and I could be interested in being a bridge.
2011-06-03T12:24:00.000Z	tripelb	brylie	after I'm secure.
2011-06-03T12:27:00.000Z	brylie	tripelb	did you get my message?
