2004-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	I got gdesklets here.
2004-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	baHam	socomm	0.26?
2004-10-26T11:48:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	0.26.2
2004-10-26T11:48:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	yes running that cow deskelet
2004-10-26T11:49:00.000Z	baHam	socomm	how do you do that ?
2004-10-26T11:49:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	`apt-get install gdesklets && apt-get install gdesklets-data'
2004-10-26T11:49:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	you may have to update your repos first though.
2004-10-26T11:49:00.000Z	baHam	socomm	yea I mean, after installing.. how do you run the displays..
2004-10-26T11:50:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	`cd /usr/share/gdesklets/Displays'
2004-10-26T11:51:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	'ls' and 'cd' to whichever desklets you wanna run.
2004-10-26T11:52:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	Then run gdesklets and give it the name of the display as an argument. For instance 'gdesklets debian-cow.display'
2004-10-26T11:52:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	good luck, there isn't much documentation for this piece of software.
2004-10-26T11:53:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	oh and after you've done that 'gdeskelet desklet.display' run gdesklet so it will appear on your desktop.
2004-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	`man dpkg'
2004-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	should be 'dpkg uninstall package'
2004-10-27T12:41:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	gftp
2004-10-28T16:12:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	you can play wmv with mplayer.
2004-10-28T16:13:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	No, xmms only plays audio files.
2004-10-28T16:14:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	yes xmms should be able to play your wav files.
2004-10-28T16:15:00.000Z	socomm	baHam	I don't mean any disrespect but try figuring things out before you ask other people for help.
2004-10-28T16:15:00.000Z	baHam	socomm	you're right
2004-10-28T16:15:00.000Z	baHam	socomm	marijuana is very bad :|
