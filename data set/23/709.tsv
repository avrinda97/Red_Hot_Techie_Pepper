2011-10-14T19:43:00.000Z	rob25		Hello, everyone. I have installed from 11.04 to 11.10 and it seems that even though I am connected to the internet, I cannot use the internet without painfully slow speeds. Anyone know a solution to this?
2011-10-14T19:43:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	have you checked Additional Drivers?
2011-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	It seems that when I tried to do that, it says there aren't any available.
2011-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	Wifi or Wired?
2011-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	Wifi.
2011-10-14T19:45:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	do you have the hwinfo package installed?
2011-10-14T19:45:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	Not sure, how would I obtain it if I didn't have it.
2011-10-14T19:47:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	open a terminal and run "sudo aptitude install hwinfo"
2011-10-14T19:48:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	It's telling me aptitude: command not found
2011-10-14T19:48:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	try "sudo apt-get install hwinfo" (i'm an aptitude user, they work very similarly)
2011-10-14T19:49:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	Already started install aptitude, but it's going at a painfully slow speed.
2011-10-14T19:49:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	sorry about that, you can Ctrl-C it if you want
2011-10-14T19:49:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	Alright, I'll do that and try the command above.
2011-10-14T19:52:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	hwinfo will just give me details on the card itself
2011-10-14T19:52:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	Oh, I see.
2011-10-14T19:53:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	I'm not very good when it comes to stuff on the terminal...
2011-10-14T19:53:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	I
2011-10-14T19:53:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	i wasn't either, man. The more I used the WDM the more I realized that i could do things way faster with Terminal, but i enjoy working in a desktop envrionment...
2011-10-14T19:54:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	is this an internal card that came with the computer, ie. a laptop wireless nic card
2011-10-14T19:54:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	It's a laptop, so it basically just a wireless card that I'm just stuck with
2011-10-14T19:54:00.000Z	meowsus	rob25	not necessarily, but it should be fine
2011-10-14T19:55:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	It's been working before 11.10, I'm not quite sure what made it break.
2011-10-14T19:55:00.000Z	rob25	meowsus	It's also been working on my 10.04 install.
