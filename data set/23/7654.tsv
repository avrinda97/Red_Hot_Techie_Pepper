2005-06-03T06:22:00.000Z	_kevin		anyone know a good way to stream music on ubuntu, something like shoutcast
2005-06-03T06:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	use VLC
2005-06-03T06:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	it's a media player with great streaming capabilities
2005-06-03T06:24:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	ohh, then maybe you want to check up on shoutcast for Linux
2005-06-03T06:43:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	depends on your needs
2005-06-03T06:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	the MP3 collection would do best on ReiserFS, IMO
2005-06-18T05:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	my suggestion is a tftp server
2005-06-18T05:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	as long as you specify a local IP, _all_ connections will go through locally
2005-06-18T06:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	commandline
2005-06-18T06:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	there's a man page on almost everything, tftpd included
2005-06-18T06:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	tftp tends to me nice and hassle free for me
2005-06-28T06:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	something trivial like that is not available in Linux in GUI
2005-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	no, it's not, neither is it in Windows
2005-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	_kevin	Razor-X	don't make claims that you can't back up, becasue Winrar can do it
2005-06-28T06:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	if it has a CRC error, are you sure?
2005-06-28T06:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	........... do you know what a RAR index is?
2005-06-28T06:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	please use propper grammer ("there") before I consider being outsmarted
2005-06-28T06:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	an archive consists of an index, so that the archive can specify to the decompressor where the bits of compressed data as, and what that data refers to
2005-06-28T07:00:00.000Z	_kevin	Razor-X	It's CRC Failed Error
2005-06-28T07:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	a CRC check checks against the signature of the archive to see whether the archive is valid or not
2005-06-28T07:01:00.000Z	_kevin	Razor-X	CAn i turn it off?
2005-06-28T07:01:00.000Z	_kevin	Razor-X	Is their a program that doesn't have a CRC checker
2005-06-28T07:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	_kevin	it definitely is
