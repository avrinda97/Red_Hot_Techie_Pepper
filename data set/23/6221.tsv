2006-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	or.... you thought you restarted it but you did not :)
2006-12-15T09:10:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	totem won't play encrypted dvd's by default
2006-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	do you have codecs installed?
2006-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	right, so I ran through the encrypted section of restricted formats.
2006-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	same issue O.o
2006-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	man, I look like a fool.. I guess three reboots is a charm, lol.
2006-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	well, it may be that totem won't play them regardless... not sure exactly.... i know vlc works great though
2006-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	it should play them, and apparently it does.  lol.. idk why it wasn't doing it before, I was only getting that error.  I restarted again and now it's working.
2006-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	a little "magic" in the pipeline somewhere I guess
2006-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	my guess would be that you did not restart totem after you installed dvd support
2006-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	it was never started when installing anything :)
2006-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	so you're guess would be wrong :)
2006-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	then i dont know
2006-12-15T09:18:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	easy way to fix that is: 1) ps -ef | grep <your program binary name> and 2) pkill <your program binary name>
2006-12-15T09:18:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	#1 searches for <your program binary name> and #2 kills it :)
2006-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	i dont think that is a normal option, you can try looking in gconf-editor
2006-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	if it is not in gconf-editor then the option does not exist.. you would have to edit the source code and compile it (way too much work of course)
2006-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	yeah, been all through those settings.  of course, holding this back too, is the fact that you cannot configure the toolbars in nautilus.. they are what they are.
2006-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	welcome to gnome :)
2006-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	hehe, nautilus always was the stickler for me with gnome.  ever since forever :)
2006-12-15T09:29:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	scribes rocks :)
2006-12-15T09:30:00.000Z	agent	ThePub	yes it does rock... more than vim even
2006-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	ThePub	agent	oh, shh, I'm just responding and not making :)
