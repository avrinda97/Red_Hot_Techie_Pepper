2008-11-11T02:41:00.000Z	n8tuser		chilli0-> put it in /etc/rc6.d
2008-11-11T02:42:00.000Z	n8tuser		chilli0-> test it and see..read some of the scripts there, those that start with K
2008-11-11T02:44:00.000Z	n8tuser		rblst-> change it, so it will be the same
2008-11-11T02:45:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	change it where? if i change it in CUPS, it doesn't affect the setting in OO.o
2008-11-11T03:10:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i may be completely lame, but i don't see such an option in OO
2008-11-11T03:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	rblst	when you go to file ->print settings  what printer is set there?
2008-11-11T03:58:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	there are two printers attached, a hp and a samsung; the hp printer used to be the default, but i changed it to the samsung; yet OO still shows hp as the default printer
2008-11-11T04:01:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i'm sure it's a trivial problem, but i don't know how to get OO to change it
2008-11-11T04:02:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	could you explain in a bit more detail?
2008-11-11T04:05:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i can of course do that, but if i restart OO, it shows the old printer as default again
2009-10-26T18:04:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i've done that
2009-10-26T18:05:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i've also tried wicd instead of network-manager
2009-10-26T18:05:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	yes
2009-10-26T18:07:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	in my nm-applet, wired network says: this device is not managed; i have to manually get an ip in terminal with dhclient for the wired connection to work
2009-10-26T18:08:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	furthermore, my wifi connection is not shown, i cannot use it, not even from command line
2009-10-26T18:09:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	there was a kernel update, but i tried booting an earlier kernel, to no avail
2009-10-26T18:11:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i don't have a netbook, i have an Intel  PRO/Wireless 2200BG card, i used to work before the last update
2009-10-26T18:15:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	module ipw2200 is loaded, as well as ieee80211 and ieee80211_crypt; but please note, that my wired interface (eth0) is not automatically brought up either
2009-10-26T18:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	rblst	can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces  contents? and tell me which network manager are you using?
2009-10-26T18:20:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d5f81aa31 i'm using network-manager (default)
2009-10-26T18:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	rblst	now try to insert entries for your eth0 and wlan0
2009-10-26T18:24:00.000Z	rblst	n8tuser	i will, but should it not be done by nm-connection-editor?
2009-10-26T18:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	rblst	your are welcome
