2010-09-03T06:45:00.000Z	smw		Is it possible to purchase a license to use libdvdcss or something on linux? I know of a small OEM who wants to include it.
2010-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 i belive theres a 'legal' codec pack you can buy. but i never looked into it. 'feundo' or somthing like that was its name
2010-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	thanks. I think this is BS and would never pay for it. But as an OEM, they can't just include it :-\
2010-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 from a legal point of view. they may not be able to include it anyway... (legal things are always so illogical)
2010-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	fluendo has a OEM section
2010-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 but does it actually include dvd.. or is it just other codecs. :)
2010-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	looking
2010-09-03T06:51:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	he is thinking about making a quick script that gives a disclaimer and lets the user install it
2010-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	for some reason you are prompted to download codecs. With dvds, you are not told what the problem is.
2010-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 totem has always been weird that way.. one reason i use VLC :)
2010-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	vlc also needs libdvdcss...
2010-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 if you are lucky it does download the codecs ..
2010-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 last i checked it was built in.. but i rarely play comercial dvds
2010-09-03T06:54:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	last I checked, it wasn't...
2010-09-03T06:54:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	someone asked about it here a while ago. And when he installed it it worked.
2010-09-03T06:54:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	nor do I. I pirate anyways. No need to deal with css :-P
2010-09-03T06:56:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	I don't know. It could be that ubuntu intentionally does not compile it in.
2010-09-03T06:56:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	I don't have a windows system handy to test it on...
2010-09-03T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 that also may be the issue.. i always use vlc from various PPA's
2010-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	chrome has it, chromium does not (I think)
2011-04-23T19:18:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	I remember using aptproxy awhile ago. Is it better?
2011-04-23T19:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	smw	 its newer. and has some other features i belive
2011-04-23T19:22:00.000Z	smw	Dr_Willis	ok, thanks
