2006-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	Keyframe	I don't use emacs myself, but I know enough about it to respect it :p

2006-03-09T09:23:00.000Z	Keyframe	Xenguy	I know about visual differences.. I tried kubuntu also.. but I wan't to know why are they different, how to switch them on ubuntu if I wanted to etc.. there should be a guide somewhere into all of this :)
2006-03-09T09:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Keyframe	there are howto's definitely.  Ubuntu has GNOME by default, and kubuntu has KDE by default.  Try /msg'ing ubotu also
