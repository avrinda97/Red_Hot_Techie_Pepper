2006-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	Armas		Alright, possibly an easy question: Anyone know how to change audio languages / subtitles on a file playing with a fresh install of mplayer?
2006-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	right click the mplayer screen
2006-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	then go to the DVD menu, subtitles should be somewhere there
2006-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	unfortunately there isn't an option in the DVD menu for this file
2006-10-01T13:06:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	I'm 100% this has dual languages and and english subtitle however
2006-10-01T13:06:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	hmm. doesnt the root menu of the dvd movie have options in it?
2006-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	It's a file, not a DVD - if that makes a difference. haha
2006-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	cute :) download a subtitle in the net, use vlc to play the movie and insert the subtitle
2006-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	well, here's the thing
2006-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	I know VLC will play it, and I can switch languages there
2006-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	however VLC cuts out on sound here and there
2006-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	so I decided to switch to mplayer to get rid of said problem on sound
2006-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	however switching to mplayer, I've noticed I can't switch between included languages
2006-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	ah but you want mplayer... haven't tried that problem yet, wait, did you google for it? (mplayer subtitle)
2006-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	I haven't tried google, I tried here instead haha
2006-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	try google first, im not sure if i have encountered that yet with mplayer
2006-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	I guess basically I'm trying to figure out how to change audio tracks with files in mplayer
2006-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	in VLC it's straight foward, you just hit the audio menu and switch tracks
2006-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	but if it's just one movie file (.avi?) how can you choose tracks? what format is it in?
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	some movie file formats can contain several langues, this one is mkv
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Armas		languages*
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	nocti	Armas	alas i haven't done that yet. sorry dude.
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Armas	nocti	no problem
