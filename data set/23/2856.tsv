2011-07-29T23:55:00.000Z	photon		hi. I am trying to delete lots of files with + signs in their file names. I tried this: rm *+*, but rm complains: rm: invalid option -- '+' Try `rm ./'-+ (705)'' to remove the file. what can I do about that?
2011-07-29T23:56:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	\+
2011-07-29T23:58:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	that did not help. I think the problem is that the wildcard is being extended by the shell and the resulting file names are not quoted.
2011-07-29T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	if the filename is test+name.file rm test\+name.file should work
2011-07-29T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	repeating the same question every 2 minutes will not help
2011-07-29T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	please ask the question, wait a while to se if anyone knows, if they don't wait a while and ask later
2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	you obviously didn't read the question. but I have an answer, don't worry.
2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	sorry, that was for paddy
2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	apologies
2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	typo
2011-08-04T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	that's a very bad idea
2011-08-04T15:55:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	why?
2011-08-04T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	do you really need 1 4TB file system ?
2011-08-04T15:56:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	it's convenient. why is it a bad idea? because of disk failure rates and the increased risk?
2011-08-04T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	1.) it's external storage so on a slow bus 2.) you'd have to use fakeraid (terrible idea) or software raid, but with external storage poor performance c.) you'd have to use gpt partition tables d.) slightest corruption and you use all your data
2011-08-04T15:58:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	hm ok. so, I should rather treat them as two separate drives, so that if one fails, the other one isn't hit?
2011-08-04T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	correct, and it's not even a failure, it's file system corruption that would cause you the main issue
2011-08-04T15:59:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	good point, you have convinced me. but not having to use gpt isn't really a good argument since we will have to use gpt some day any way. :p
2011-08-04T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	do you know how to manage the gpt partitions in Linux ?
2011-08-04T16:01:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	yes, I read about it, never tested it though. and even if I did not know, I still have to learn it since it's only a matter of time till >2TB drives become standard usage.
2011-08-04T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	it is not a matter of time until 2TB become standard.
2011-08-04T16:02:00.000Z	photon	ikonia	you sound like Bill Gates arguing that 64K is enough for everybody.
2011-08-04T16:02:00.000Z	ikonia	photon	nope
