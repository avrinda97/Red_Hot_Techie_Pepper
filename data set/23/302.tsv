2012-01-23T08:01:00.000Z	txomon|home	DasEi	its a SIS soundcard
2012-01-23T08:01:00.000Z	DasEi	txomon|home	exact model ?
2012-01-23T08:02:00.000Z	txomon|home		dasei sis si 7018  (that is the alsamixer's info)
2012-01-23T08:02:00.000Z	DasEi	txomon|home	so driver is obviously found and used, fine; are the channels unmuted ?
2012-01-23T08:03:00.000Z	txomon|home	DasEi	I am rechecking that
2012-01-23T08:03:00.000Z	txomon|home		have appeared a pair of bars more...
2012-01-23T08:04:00.000Z	DasEi	txomon|home	mind the icons, if using alsamixergui, and main and pcm upper 0
2012-01-23T08:04:00.000Z	txomon|home	DasEi	just alsamixer command
2012-01-23T08:05:00.000Z	txomon|home		2 more bars appeared...
2012-01-23T08:05:00.000Z	txomon|home		might be because I had chromium opened, and mean while, installed alsa-base  and alsa-tools?
2012-01-23T08:07:00.000Z	txomon|home	DasEi	seems to be fixed
2012-01-23T08:08:00.000Z	DasEi	txomon|home	nice to hear

2012-01-23T08:09:00.000Z	DasEi	txomon|home	it's often muted either from defaults or another program like the gui or volume manager
