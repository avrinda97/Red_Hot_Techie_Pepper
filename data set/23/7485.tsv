2007-09-30T12:41:00.000Z	narothepharoh		 how do i install a .run file?
2007-09-30T12:42:00.000Z	narothepharoh		I am trying to install but it says i dont have write permission
2007-09-30T12:44:00.000Z	narothepharoh		what exactly would you write in terminal?
2007-09-30T12:44:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	it need root permissions? that seem strange. it should be able to install to user home dir. perhaps they changed the install method.
2007-09-30T12:45:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	ah. "sudo ./installfile.run"
2007-09-30T12:47:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	you can't apt-get install a .run file. I think if you run without "sudo" you should be able to install it to your own home directory. /usr/local/games sound good otherwise
2007-09-30T12:48:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	so try "sudo -i" then cd to the dir that contain the install file and run it from there.
2007-09-30T12:50:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	"cd /home/username/whereyoudownloaded-enemy-territory" after installation is done simply type "exit" to get out of the root terminal session.
2007-09-30T12:57:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	what is the exact error you get?
2007-09-30T12:59:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	you need to go to the correct directory "cd /home/narothepharoh/where you downloaded et" then type "./enemy-territory2.60.run"
2007-09-30T13:05:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	you did not do what I said.
2007-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	first cd to the dir then type "./enemy-territory2.60.run"
2007-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	"no such file or directory" always means that the path you typed did not exist.
2007-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	"cd /home/narothepharoh/where-you-downloaded-et-to/"
2007-09-30T13:10:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	"cd /home" <----- exactly like that
2007-09-30T13:13:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	if you get no errors now type "ls" this will list the contents of the directory you just changed to. you should see your user directory listed. type "cd narothepharoh" to enter your home directory from here (notice that the forward slash is missing intentionally)
2007-09-30T13:14:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	we take it step by step. no worries.
2007-09-30T13:15:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	very good. now, to which directory did you download et?
2007-09-30T13:16:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	if you type "ls" do you see it?
2007-09-30T13:16:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	good. now type "./enemy" and pres [TAB]  key. do you get the full name?
2007-09-30T13:17:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	press enter
2007-09-30T13:18:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	the [TAB]  key you just did is called tab-completion and will work to fill in filenames/directories for you automatically. it is quite useful.
2007-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	Jowi	narothepharoh	after installation is done type "exit" and then "et" to play
