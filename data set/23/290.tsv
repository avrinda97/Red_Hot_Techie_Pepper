2012-10-20T12:06:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	an easy method is open nautilus - right click on any of your own files... look at permissions tab
2012-10-20T12:07:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	eg mine would shown xxx-yyy, I use xxx as the name:name
2012-10-20T12:09:00.000Z	bjrohan	SuperEngineer	in Nautlius it shows me as the owner, group is root Owner, group and othrs can all create and delete files
2012-10-20T12:11:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	use [for name:name] whatever is shown as "me"]
2012-10-20T12:11:00.000Z	bjrohan	SuperEngineer	what is name:name
2012-10-20T12:13:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	in the example sudo su -c 'chown -R name:name /media/disk-2'
2012-10-20T12:13:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	that is the name:name bit
2012-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	bjrohan	SuperEngineer	I do NOT understand where to put my brohan:brohan stuff, brohan is my username on that machine
2012-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	in the example sudo su -c 'chown -R brohan:brohan /media/themountnameofdiskorpartition'
2012-10-20T12:16:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	the ' marks are part of the command
2012-10-20T12:17:00.000Z	bjrohan	SuperEngineer	thank you. what does su -c do?
2012-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	that escaltes [for the one command only] the user [you] to the correct level to perform the command
2012-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	bjrohan	SuperEngineer	okay. In nautilus as ROOT I can access the drive, as a mere user NOGO. it didn't work :-(
2012-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	SuperEngineer	bjrohan	*please* do not use things like su without direct knowledge of it & it's consequences though
