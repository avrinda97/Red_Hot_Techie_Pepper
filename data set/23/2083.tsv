2009-07-10T03:00:00.000Z	Carnical		for ubuntu, how would one best update to firefox 3.5?
2009-07-10T03:01:00.000Z	Carnical		I see
2009-07-10T03:02:00.000Z	Carnical		is there a way to replace the Firefox entry in Applications>Internet with ff3.5?
2009-07-10T03:04:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	I replaced the /usr/bin/firefox symlink to point to firfox-3.5
2009-07-10T03:04:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/firefox-3.5 /usr/bin/firefox
2009-07-10T03:04:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	awesome, thanks
2009-07-10T03:05:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	but now if I type "firefox" in terminal it brings up 3.5 rather than 3.0.1 or w/e
2009-07-10T03:06:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	I thought that that was what you wanted...
2009-07-10T03:07:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	lol, nvm, thanks
2009-07-10T03:08:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	you could start 3.0 with this command: /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.11/firefox.sh
2009-07-10T03:08:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	a firefox upgrade will probably undo our change...
2009-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	apt-get remove firefox seems to have removed the old one, leaving the new one intact
2009-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	that's a good idea, thanks
2009-07-10T03:10:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	err or not
2009-07-10T03:10:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	it's still in my file structure
2009-07-10T03:10:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	but?
2009-07-10T03:11:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	oh, does apt-get remove not delete?
2009-07-10T03:11:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	I'm somewhat unfamiliar as to how the package manager actually works
2009-07-10T03:13:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	"remove" leaves config file intact.... "remove --purge" removes them too...
2009-07-10T03:16:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	alright, but apt-get remove firefox left ALL of the firefox files
2009-07-10T03:16:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	rather than just the config
2009-07-10T03:16:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Carnical	try installing and then apt-get remove --purge firefox
2009-07-10T03:17:00.000Z	Carnical	Kalmi_	thanks, didn't do anything different, but I'm going to restart my computer
