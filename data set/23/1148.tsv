2011-02-23T04:03:00.000Z	daniel_tree		is it safe to turn of the acpi ?
2011-02-23T04:05:00.000Z	daniel_tree		does anyone see what I write ???
2011-02-23T04:06:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	yes, we do. about acpi, it should depend on your hw (if it is safe or not)
2011-02-23T04:07:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	I have an annoing bug..that happens every time
2011-02-23T04:07:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	why dont you try booting without acpi from liveCD or liveUSB ?
2011-02-23T04:08:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	http://pastie.org/1595823 pls take a look
2011-02-23T04:10:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	and it keep sending this message over and over ...infinite loop
2011-02-23T04:10:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	reading bug reports about something that should look like your problem... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi/+bug/535643
2011-02-23T04:13:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	yes..those guys have the same problem :( I have an acer 5930g too like one of those guys...
2011-02-23T04:14:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	but no solution :(
2011-02-23T04:14:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	yep. Have you tried new kernel ?
2011-02-23T04:15:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	2.6.35-25 I have now...is there a newer version ?
2011-02-23T04:18:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	Linux version 2.6.35-25-generic (buildd@palmer) (gcc version 4.4.5 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.4.4-14ubuntu5) ) #44-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 21 17:40:48 UTC 2011
2011-02-23T04:18:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	yes, sure. i am running 2.6.38-rc6. if you have time, you could try compiling (how to is on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild). If it is kernel problem, this could help
2011-02-23T04:19:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	I think is a kernel issue ..cause in 9.10 it wasnt this bug
2011-02-23T04:19:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	btw, does it affect system performance, suspending or something else ?
2011-02-23T04:20:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	the keyboard is not responding...when I type the writing lags
2011-02-23T04:21:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	 so it's impossible to continue working after the error occurs
2011-02-23T04:21:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	something like this ? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1466442
2011-02-23T04:24:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	when I log in I can type normally ...only after a while...this error occurs from nowhere and then all the magic happens :) I cant type correctly..and the infinite messeges in the bus
2011-02-23T04:25:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	googling it with Aspire-5930 and doenst look like somebody solved it...
2011-02-23T04:25:00.000Z	denwerko	daniel_tree	sorry, going off. good luck, bye
2011-02-23T04:25:00.000Z	daniel_tree	denwerko	thanks bye
