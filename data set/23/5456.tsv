2007-06-23T06:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	breezy has reached End of Life
2007-06-23T06:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	please upgrade to dapper
2007-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	that's ok. I'm not asking anyone to help me ... my hardware cannot run dapper.
2007-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	all i ask is old software to be there.
2007-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	This is really annoying.
2007-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	do you know how much it costs to keep that on servers? ;)
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	I run quite a bit of servers. I have a fair idea.
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	this is bizzare.
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	I can still access potato archives.
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	Breezy was supported for 18 months... please upgrade. EOD really?
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	this particular hardware cannot run dapper. what am i suppossed to do?
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	will it work with an upgrade from breezy instead of fresh install?
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	your old settings might save it
2007-06-23T06:58:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	Gnea This is not something that you can defend. this is really stupid ... you can encourage people to upgrade.I run feisty on mynew laptop but ... I guess I really should go back to debian.
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	I suggest backing up and attempting an upgrade
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	spo0nman2	please don't complain about breezy being gone. It reached end of life, you were warned. We don't owe anything.
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	spo0nman2	PriceChild	Gnea Thanks for you time.
