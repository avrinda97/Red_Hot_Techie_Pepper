2011-03-23T09:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	xion: that sounds like it would work to me
2011-03-23T10:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	I wrote a script that checked if a program was already running before it ran, is that what you want?
2011-03-23T10:04:00.000Z	ac7ss	sacarlson	Yes, I currently use ps -A|grep SCRIPTNAME| wc -l
2011-03-23T10:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	I think I use this if [ "$(pidof openvpn)" ]
2011-03-23T10:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	yes that's what I wanted also since for some reason the app didn't always start so I had a cron check it every hour and at boot
2011-03-23T10:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	true I like z that's what I normally use, and I tested it just now and I can do it with tar cvzf backup.gz .  from within the dir seems to still work with the "." at the end
2011-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	depends maybe with find -exec
2011-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	ping will loop and you can provide the time interval
2011-03-23T10:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	ping -i 30 google.com
2011-03-23T10:36:00.000Z	ac7ss	sacarlson	not actually pinging.
2011-03-23T10:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	ActionParsnip: yes you can have it time out after a count -c
2011-03-23T10:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	not actually pinging?  be more specific
2011-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	closer and you want to loop on what value?
2011-03-23T10:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	in the time it took to ask you could have wrote the script
2011-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	ac7ss	sacarlson	the point was to learn how. (I need monitors often for different things. just one shots.)
2011-03-23T10:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	I did find this but I can't find a way for a infinite loop http://penguinpetes.com/b2evo/index.php?title=how_the_one_liner_for_loop_in_bash_goes&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1.
2011-03-23T10:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	I tried while [1]; do sleep 1; done but fails
2011-03-23T10:49:00.000Z	ac7ss	sacarlson	try 'while : ;do echo 1;sleep;done
2011-03-23T10:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	critical_max; yes this works while [ 1 ] ; do echo test; sleep 2 ; done
2011-03-23T10:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	critical_max: I think it would just require a arrow up or some control caricter to echo to move up one line before the next loop
2011-03-23T11:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	well it will be the only thing running in that term so I guess the clear should work as good as any
2011-03-23T11:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	ac7ss	but what about the derailments if your not watching?
2011-03-23T11:33:00.000Z	ac7ss	sacarlson	they de-rail on their own. I just have to fix it after.
