2008-04-10T11:25:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	in the terminal.

2008-04-10T11:29:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	can you ping 192...
2008-04-10T11:32:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	are you in the same ip subnets (i.e. both 192.168.0.X )
2008-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	settings -> networking or something

2008-04-10T11:38:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	but you can ping your router?
2008-04-10T11:41:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	is your windows set to automatic ip (dchp)?
2008-04-10T11:42:00.000Z	Stroganoff	jefffromhell	have you some odd security software (symantec etc.)?
