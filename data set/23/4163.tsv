2007-11-07T05:28:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	that is what I am using
2007-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	scorp123	paulistall	oh, sorry then :-)
2007-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	went throught the whole process on ubuntuforums
2007-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	thanks anyway
2007-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	scorp123	paulistall	you wrote it worked for a short moment?
2007-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	when i first installed ubuntu
2007-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	worked immediately
2007-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	I don't know what I could have done to mess it up
2007-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	scorp123	paulistall	did you check the display of the printer (if it has one)? Maybe the toner is empty or there is a paper jam or something like that?
2007-11-07T05:31:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	it is fine
2007-11-07T05:31:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	printer icon shows up for a second and then switches to a dark grey
2007-11-07T05:32:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	when I click on it there are no jobs listed
2007-11-07T05:32:00.000Z	scorp123	paulistall	and there is no error message on the display or anywhere?
2007-11-07T05:32:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	nope
2007-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	actually everything is showing up as a completed job
2007-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	but it doesn't print
2007-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	paulistall	scorp123	I think I'm getting closer to the issue here
