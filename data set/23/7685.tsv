2005-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	be careful you dont kill (as in kill -9) your linux doin that
2005-09-06T07:48:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	livecd, backup your homedir, and take the easy way out
2005-09-06T08:13:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	please with the language
2005-09-06T08:14:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	sorry... im just pissed
2006-01-03T17:54:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	hello, i was here as Eroick before (aparently im still using my old name on this computer) and I was talking to you about gparted. Well, gparted wont work! I resize and then it just goes back to the original size. It also gives an error about a busy device and says I should reboot, but I have rebooted and there is NO change! Help!
2006-01-03T17:54:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	use a liveCD
2006-01-03T17:55:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	yep, I am.
2006-01-03T17:55:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	install qtparted on your live session
2006-01-03T17:57:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	how? I cant get online, needs ndiswrapper
2006-01-03T06:08:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	where can i snag qtparted from?
2006-01-03T06:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	enable universe and get it with apt-get or synaptic
2006-01-03T06:11:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	enable universe and get it with your fave pkg manager
2006-01-03T06:11:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	no internet. needs ndiswrapper for wireless
2006-01-03T06:12:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	Epix then you are out of luck, since at the least you'll need ntfsprogs (preferably qtparted)
2006-01-03T06:13:00.000Z	Epix	nalioth	crap. how else can I resize? Knoppix has qtparted?
2006-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	you can try knoppix, i'm not sure if it has qtparted or not
2006-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	nalioth	Epix	qtparted calls ntfsprogs btw
