2011-05-02T23:26:00.000Z	ShockDoc		anyone else know how can make 11.04 boot verbose?
2011-05-02T23:28:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	i think i do... try editing /etc/default/grub and remove quiet and splash from this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
2011-05-02T23:29:00.000Z	ShockDoc		I tried that ruffleS , but is doesn't work :/
2011-05-02T23:29:00.000Z	ShockDoc		it*
2011-05-02T23:30:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	did you try running: update-grub
2011-05-02T23:30:00.000Z	ShockDoc		yes ruffleS
2011-05-02T23:30:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	someone here just said you could maybe try 'text' here: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
2011-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	ruffleS		make it: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
2011-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	ruffleS		ShockDoc,
2011-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	ShockDoc		just tried that ruffleS , didn't work, then it booted into a shell
2011-05-02T23:33:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	there's another thing you can try... i don't know if this would apply to ubuntu anymore but i would try finding out  how to switch the runlevel
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	ShockDoc		I edited my /etc/default/grub about 20 times, still no verbose boot
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	run this command and reat its output: man /etc/default/grub
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	ShockDoc		k ruffleS , just a sec
2011-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	ShockDoc		nah Dr_Willis , the grub is brand new :p
2011-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	ShockDoc	Dr_Willis	??
2011-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	ShockDoc		well I think something is wrong with the nvidia drives is what is causing the issue Dr_Willis
2011-05-02T23:38:00.000Z	ShockDoc		ah, well I'm out of options Dr_Willis  ;)
2011-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	ShockDoc		now I have GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
2011-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	ShockDoc		I'I'm sure of that Dr_Willis , installed to the MBR
2011-05-02T23:40:00.000Z	ShockDoc		updated, Dr_Willis
2011-05-02T23:40:00.000Z	ShockDoc		shall I reboot?
2011-05-02T23:42:00.000Z	ruffleS	ShockDoc	the splash screen is probably hard coded into the kernel.. if i were you i would try both googling and reading 'man /etc/default/grub'
