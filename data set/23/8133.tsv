2005-01-15T13:21:00.000Z	xed	prox2far	hmm..it supports suspend and resume
2005-01-15T13:23:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	ACPI = Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, can't help you with resource controlling (i don't care for that since iv'e always got a power cord nearby )
2005-01-15T13:23:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	+ worked out of the box for mee
2005-01-15T13:24:00.000Z	xed	prox2far	so do I. But.. it being a laptop, I'd like to be able to use... the laptop without having to constantly plug in the ac power cord
2005-01-15T13:25:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	i'm using ubuntu with a laptop and i can see my batt. time varies depending on how i'm using the system
2005-01-15T13:27:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	but i don't know how to control the ACPI features i ubuntu because they work great by default ( by my opinion )
2005-01-15T13:28:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	no i'm not too lasy to push 2 buttons
2005-01-15T13:28:00.000Z	xed	prox2far	thats not all..
2005-01-15T13:30:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	ACPI should be installed by default ( in warty ) and if your CPU is an Mobile cpu it should adjust automaticly
2005-01-15T13:35:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	but wmacpi is only a monitor :( doesn't change anything
2005-01-15T13:40:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	micro$oft charges money if you want to use hotmail externally
2005-01-15T13:40:00.000Z	xed	prox2far	well I'm not surprised...=|
2005-01-15T14:03:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	no not source but old cs works fine with Wine
2005-01-15T14:05:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	yes do that it's way easier than going through wine
2005-01-15T14:15:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	your laptop fan doesn't run constantly
2005-01-15T14:15:00.000Z	xed	prox2far	most of the time it does =(
2005-01-15T14:16:00.000Z	prox2far	xed	if you do nothing fora while it will stop ( if ACPI works )
