2010-04-30T14:12:00.000Z	grndslm		heya guys...  can you think of anyway to partition a netbook that has no optical drive... and no external optical drive, either??
2010-04-30T14:14:00.000Z	obscurant1st	grndslm	create a bootable usb, and boot live!
2010-04-30T14:15:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 yea, i'm not sure if this old laptop will actually boot from usb, but possibly
2010-04-30T14:16:00.000Z	obscurant1st	grndslm	you could try network boot
2010-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 i'm actually doing a netboot on one old laptop, but the real problem comes with the new netbook... i want to keep windows 7 *and* install linux, which means i'd have to partition it with windows, i'm assuming
2010-04-30T14:18:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 true
2010-04-30T14:37:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 "aptitude purge bonages-package-name" ??

2010-04-30T15:14:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 it's a vaio tr1a... the "original netbook"... had a "combo drive" in it all the way back then, but i dropped it and haven't been able to use it since, because the HDD inside was 1.8", and i just found a 20gb 1.8" drive for $20 on fatwallet, so this is the first time i've used it in a few years... optical drive broke as well, so net boot option is all i have to install
2010-04-30T15:15:00.000Z	obscurant1st	grndslm	oh. ll need a lot patience, i think
2010-04-30T15:15:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 it's at 42%  :(
2010-04-30T15:16:00.000Z	obscurant1st	grndslm	are you upgrading, or doing a fresh install?
2010-04-30T15:16:00.000Z	grndslm	obscurant1st	 all fresh, new HDD
2010-04-30T15:16:00.000Z	obscurant1st	grndslm	aaah.
