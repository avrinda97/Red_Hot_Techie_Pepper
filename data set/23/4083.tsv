2008-03-01T07:28:00.000Z	tinman		So, i have been trying to fix my x server after somehow failed to start, i have got the basics down, but my mouse isen't working, any ideas?
2008-03-01T07:30:00.000Z	tinman		From what i gather my mouse is PS/2 but the xserver-xorg gives me so many option redarding the protocols and such, is there a way to maybe make xorg.conf auto detect my mouse and protocol
2008-03-01T07:31:00.000Z	ere4si	tinman	have you tried   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   to see if a second go will give better results?
2008-03-01T07:32:00.000Z	tinman	ere4si	the is what i ahve been doing
2008-03-01T07:32:00.000Z	tinman	ere4si	that is also how i fixed all other srtull, my entire s server wasent somehow woeking
2008-03-01T07:33:00.000Z	tinman	ere4si	that asks me about my mouse protocol and what not which i am not sure about nor do i have any documents regarding my mouse
2008-03-01T07:33:00.000Z	ere4si	tinman	sorry - can't offer more than that
2008-03-01T07:34:00.000Z	tinman	ere4si	i read somewhere that there was a way to make xorg aut detect my protocol but it didnt say how, it just said edit xorg.conf
