2011-12-20T16:57:00.000Z	killnine		why is 'apt-cache search' only returning results from one of my apt-repos?
2011-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	killnine		(10.04 lts)
2011-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	phix	killnine	apt-get update first?
2011-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	killnine	phix	I did that...
2011-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	phix	killnine	apt-cache policy ?
2011-12-20T17:01:00.000Z	killnine	phix	apt-cache policy shows only /var/lib/dpk/status
2011-12-20T17:01:00.000Z	killnine	phix	can i easily add all repos?
2011-12-20T17:01:00.000Z	phix	killnine	weird, you have anything in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2011-12-20T17:01:00.000Z	killnine	phix	yup
2011-12-20T17:01:00.000Z	phix	killnine	uncommented?  or does it start with #
2011-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	killnine	phix	and a bunch of other repos in a .list file
2011-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	killnine	phix	it's on rackspace.....
2011-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	phix	killnine	ok what is in your /etc/apt/apt.config.d ?
2011-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	phix	killnine	rackspace means nothing to me ;) I dont use it
2011-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	phix	killnine	does rackspace come with user support?
2011-12-20T17:03:00.000Z	killnine	phix	sure... will take me hours tho... but you're right...
2011-12-20T17:03:00.000Z	killnine	phix	anyway, i have some files in the
2011-12-20T17:05:00.000Z	phix	killnine	cat them and see if any of them is blocking reading your repository list or trying to read it from somewhere else
2011-12-20T17:06:00.000Z	killnine	phix	how would I see if they are blocking?
2011-12-20T17:07:00.000Z	phix	killnine	pastebin them and I can take a look if you like :)  pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file too
2011-12-20T17:09:00.000Z	killnine	phix	would an empty file block?
2011-12-20T17:09:00.000Z	phix	killnine	no that is normal
