2006-06-09T13:00:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		if I find a program that is not installable via apt-get, is it ok to just install it by downloading the file?
2006-06-09T13:00:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		this one, http://ksocrat.linux.kiev.ua/
2006-06-09T13:00:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		tar.bz2
2006-06-09T13:01:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		no, someone didn't recommend those backlinks? is it really bad to install software manually
2006-06-09T13:02:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	what do you mean?
2006-06-09T13:02:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	it's preferred to use packages, or if you build from source, to use checkinstall to build a nice .deb from it
2006-06-09T13:19:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	tritium	could you clarify how I use checkinstall
2006-06-09T13:19:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	^^
2006-06-09T13:22:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	tritium	i'm a noob, cc is not installed. checkinstall only said it depended on "Make" so I installed those
2006-06-09T13:23:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	you should install build-essential
2006-06-09T13:30:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	tritium	this time it got alot further, but came to an error at "checking for libz" error: not found
2006-06-09T13:31:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	you'll need to install that too
2006-06-09T13:31:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	you probably need zlib1g-dev
2006-06-09T13:32:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	what are we building
2006-06-09T13:34:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	tritium	this time "X includes" :-)
2006-06-09T13:35:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	what are we building?
2006-06-09T13:35:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	tritium	Ksocrat from http://ksocrat.linux.kiev.ua/
2006-06-09T13:35:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	^^
2006-06-09T13:37:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	you've updated your package list?
2006-06-09T13:37:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	works fine here
2006-06-09T13:37:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	make sure you update it
2006-06-09T13:38:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	yeah
2006-06-09T14:00:00.000Z	tritium	Scorpmoon	yes, you can
