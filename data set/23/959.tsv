2011-01-04T19:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	anadon	yes you can port forward from your router to the system you want to serve that function
2011-01-04T19:29:00.000Z	anadon		well, my step dad isn't going to let me touch the router configuation, let alone the password!
2011-01-04T19:29:00.000Z	anadon		well, on to the 404 error i guess.

2011-01-04T19:35:00.000Z	anadon	sacarlson	sure, but I'd like to tackle the 404 error right now
2011-01-04T19:36:00.000Z	anadon		well, could you help me with a 404 error on my server configuration?
2011-01-04T19:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	anadon	I think 404 is file not found,  what do you have apache2 root set to?  id the direcotry there?   does www-data have privliges in it?
