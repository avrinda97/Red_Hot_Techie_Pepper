2010-09-16T19:52:00.000Z	erickj92		Sorry ROasted, I used to have one but can't for the life of me remember the name
2010-09-16T19:54:00.000Z	erickj92		What about searching for speech recognition?
2010-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	erickj92		I keep getting this error when trying to mount my partition: "THe superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 filesystem. If the device is valid and really contains an ext2 filesystem, then the superblock is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock: e2fsck -b 8193 <device>"
2010-09-16T19:56:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	Would you mind me asking, maybe someone has already asked, what kind of troubleshooting you have done?
2010-09-16T19:57:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	just want to confirm, this partition is your normal internal hard drive?
2010-09-16T19:59:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	I am   assuming you are using ext3 file system here?
2010-09-16T20:00:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	Was there any error messages during the install ?
2010-09-16T20:01:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	sorry for asking like mad, but I am trying to get a handle of the issue here....
2010-09-16T20:01:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	so the install was fine, huh?......hmmmm
2010-09-16T20:03:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	You know what? erickj92? I think there is a problem with even recognising that a partition exists, let alone its file system
2010-09-16T20:03:00.000Z	erickj92	Psychodelius	It may be worth mentioning that the Windows partition on the same HDD mounts fine
2010-09-16T20:04:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	well it is not window's fault, that's for sure
2010-09-16T20:04:00.000Z	erickj92	Psychodelius	Would you recomend formatting said partition and re-installing Linux as a definate measure?
2010-09-16T20:04:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	sounds like grub problem
2010-09-16T20:05:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	sigh, well, might have to....if yo want to redce the dabbling around
2010-09-16T20:05:00.000Z	erickj92	Psychodelius	What I'd honestly like to do is get rid of Linux on this computer, because i want to sell it. How would I go about getting rid of LInux and sitll being able to boot Windows?
2010-09-16T20:07:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	wooooo, so your boot loader is on the linux partition, not on the windows partition?
2010-09-16T20:07:00.000Z	erickj92	Psychodelius	My boot loader is on a flash drive apparently. Right now I don't even have a boot loader. Thus the mess I am currently in
2010-09-16T20:09:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	mate, that is not quite my level of expertise. I think you better find someone who can do this kind of stuff
2010-09-16T20:09:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	no help at all....:P
2010-09-16T20:10:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	have a look at this : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms901837.aspx
2010-09-16T20:11:00.000Z	Psychodelius	erickj92	that is the windows bootloader creation method, dirfectly from microsoft
