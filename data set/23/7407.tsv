2010-09-15T05:10:00.000Z	renedox		it is for 9.10 but I found things generally work in future versions when it comes to video drivers
2010-09-15T05:11:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	yes I was just worried it didn't make a lot of clarity with lucid.
2010-09-15T05:11:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	yeah, I did consider that but probably wouldn't hurt to give it a try, I guess :S
2010-09-15T05:12:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	other forums suggest that the open source drivers are ok.  Hmm, just worried his slowdown might be elsewhere
2010-09-15T05:12:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	yeah.. me too
2010-09-15T05:13:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	video drivers might be a good place to start though, cause ems is also getting the same thing on windows and a driver install fixes it
2010-09-15T05:13:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	however the pdf is saying there are quite a few libraries that need to be there before the .run works.
2010-09-15T05:14:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	what's the link to the .pdf again? I didn't open it
2010-09-15T05:14:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	XFree86-Mesa-libGL,libstdc++, libgcc, XFree86-libs, fontconfig, freetype, zlib, gcc
2010-09-15T05:15:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	oh damn.. lol -_-;
2010-09-15T05:15:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	would envy-ng be an easier solution - does it still do ATI ?
2010-09-15T05:16:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	not sure, I use nvidia and only troubleshooted ATI once but it wasn't this problem :S
2010-09-15T05:17:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	me too - but I have a couple of clients with ATI, again as you say, it wasn't this particular problem
2010-09-15T05:21:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	what job?
2010-09-15T05:21:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	lol !
2010-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	 process might be a better phrase
2010-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	haha sure does :P
2010-09-15T05:28:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	seems he went afk
2010-09-15T05:34:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	ems,  WOOT!
2010-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	ems went afk - i'm at work - but congratulations on getting the problem fixed :D
2010-09-15T06:38:00.000Z	fluvvell	renedox	thanksems, sol ?
2010-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	renedox	fluvvell	Jabber tried
