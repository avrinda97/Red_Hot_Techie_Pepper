2009-10-19T23:34:00.000Z	Hsarci		i typed "sudo reboot" into my terminal now everything is jakced up.....any ideas?
2009-10-19T23:34:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	is it in the middle of rebootin, maybe?
2009-10-19T23:35:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	no it rebooted fine, but when it came back online i was at a screen with nothing but a terminal in the top left corner
2009-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	it was an all black screen no window borders couldnt move the terminal around but terminal worked fine...then i typed in gnome-session and i got to the desktop but it was missing my panels
2009-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	then i rebooted again it it was back at the all black screen with terminal in the left corner
2009-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	did it have a text or graphical login screen?
2009-10-19T23:37:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	graphical and i have auto login
2009-10-19T23:38:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	oh...no idea how to change to "failsafe gnome" with auto-login...can you log out?
2009-10-19T23:41:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	sorry i got busy...yeah i can log out i think...its on my laptop though an battery is dead atm and i dont have a charger with me
2009-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	well try logging out and choosing failsafe gnome on the login screen
2009-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	whenyou get battery
2009-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	what can I do after choosing failsafe gnome to get my desktop back???
2009-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	well im guessing failsafe has a better chance of working than default
2009-10-19T23:45:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	so it might actually work
2009-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	i dont want to just use failsafe though?
2009-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	at least check with that to be sure its your config thats broken and not something more major
2009-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	well how can i check config?
2009-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	im thinking that im just gonna to "sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop && sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop"
2009-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	that may fix it
2009-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	that wont change your configuration files in $HOME
2009-10-19T23:49:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	so im f'ed in the a?
2009-10-19T23:49:00.000Z	maco	Hsarci	try the failsafe gnome and see how it goes. if it works, its something in your config files (probably ~/.config)
2009-10-19T23:50:00.000Z	Hsarci	maco	ok ill do that whne i get some juice back in the laptop...thanks
