2007-09-10T10:20:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	question, why do u have him doing gksu vs gksudo
2007-09-10T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	they both use the sudo backend
2007-09-10T10:21:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	i know, but more commonplace for sudo or gksudo,
2007-09-10T10:22:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	seen both used here, and it's shorter.
2007-09-10T10:23:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	gksu creates some error backlash in Ubuntu, best to use gksudo
2007-09-10T10:23:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	mostly GUI error stuff, but still, want it as clean as possible
2007-09-10T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	ok, gksudo it is hadn't heard that one yet. Can you tell me what it is.
2007-09-10T10:24:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	gksu creates errors such as  GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager: Authentication Rejected,
2007-09-10T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	ah, the old ones I'm used to seeing
2007-09-10T10:24:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	it accomplishes the same goals if im not mistaken, gksudo is just more clean
2007-09-10T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	haven't noted that gksduo had cleaned that up, no more answering that question. Good enough reason
2007-09-10T10:25:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	old time linux user aye?
2007-09-10T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	started debian in 2001

2007-09-10T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	yeah, I had sudo going a long time ago, I did a remove -rf in the wrong terminal *once
2007-09-10T10:26:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	eek, done that before too, wiped out 20g of music by accident :)
2007-09-10T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	about 3 months work on a linux from scratch
2007-09-10T10:27:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	ack, what distro ? ubuntu or a self built?
2007-09-10T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	DM|	self compiled, from the ground up. I was doing it because the first time I sat down at a potato install, I had no clue what to do. I figured after that is was time :)
2007-09-10T10:29:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	very nice, too bad it got borked
2007-09-10T11:18:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	i bought vmware, works great for what i need it for.
2007-11-30T11:53:00.000Z	DM|	nickrud	ATI is a waste of cycles
