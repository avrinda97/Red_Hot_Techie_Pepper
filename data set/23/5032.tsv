2008-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	WorldDomination		hi - whats the best way of creating an admin user along with the user group "admin" or "admins" with associated privileges (not graphically, but in the shell)
2008-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	WorldDomination		unfortunately, the only stnadard user group which could serve is adm
2008-12-09T06:07:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	Don't use adm for that - adm has a very standard purpose: "Can read system logs"
2008-12-09T06:07:00.000Z	WorldDomination		hm maxb - how then ?
2008-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	well, what do you mean by admin user? That's "root", surely?
2008-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	WorldDomination	maxb_	if you like, I want a root user, with same right, except that they need to do "sudo" for system tasks like mounting a new device
2008-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	WorldDomination		or mapping it
2008-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	so... you want a normal user that is authorized to sudo?
2008-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	WorldDomination		but basically I want them to be able to inspect e.g. the svn directory and write there
2008-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	WorldDomination	maxb_	: well, yes - would you recommend that ?
2008-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	WorldDomination		I want my team to be able to be admin on this server
2008-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	WorldDomination		so I think the best approach would be to create admin accounts for them
2008-12-09T06:11:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	Have you noticed that Ubuntu ships with an 'admin' group which has the right to sudo, by default? :-)
2008-12-09T06:11:00.000Z	WorldDomination	maxb_	well not on mine
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	WorldDomination		I did a vi /etc/groups
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	hmm, how odd
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	WorldDomination		there is no admin group there
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	WorldDomination		sorry
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	WorldDomination		vi /etc/group
2008-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	maxb_		Well, you don't even need a group, really, you can just grant authority to individual users in /etc/sudoers
2008-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	WorldDomination		oh ok
2008-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	WorldDomination		is there a howto for that somewhere ?
2008-12-09T06:18:00.000Z	maxb_	WorldDomination	I agree sudoers is a fairly mindbending file format, but I'd still suggest reading "man sudoers". By way of an example:   root,maxb,%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL      means that root, maxb, and people in the admin group can run, on ALL hosts (that's a feature to allow a single sudoers file to be shared for a whole network), as ALL (any) user, ALL (any) command, without needing to confirm their password
