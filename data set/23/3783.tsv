2009-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	exim is a server. It won't show up as an application
2009-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	then how do I know what servers are running on startup?
2009-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	it is run at boot from /etc/init.d; you need to check out runlevel editors
2009-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	alright
2009-05-18T21:05:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	you should also be able to tell what gets started by looking in /etc/rc.0, /rc.1. /rc.2...etc. Depending on what run level yu are interested in
2009-05-18T21:06:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	mmm I need to learn abour run levels I guess, i donno what they mean... btw exim4 exists in both /etc/init.d/ and in /etc/cron.daily/
2009-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	yes, it is a good idea to have at least a basic understanding of run levels. And the exim in cron.daily might or might not be right. I suspect it is a daily cleanup job and not a daily rerun of exim
2009-05-18T21:08:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	oh alright... I'm looking at runlevels on wiki, am assuming that's a good place to look, right?
2009-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	yes. You should know there are two ways run levels are being handled. Debian/Ubuntu uses them a little differently than Suse/Redhat/Mandrake
2009-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	alright... though I am more of a debian-related OS kinda guy... but I'm considering gentoo sometime soon.
2009-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	this one applies to ubuntu....http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/212
2009-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	thanks... opening it.
2009-05-18T21:19:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	it is a very interesting article.. thanks :)
2009-05-18T21:20:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	there are a number of pdf files on the web you might want. One that came to mind immediately is the SAG (System Adminstrators Guide)
2009-05-18T21:20:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	i'll check thato ut
2009-06-26T21:13:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	can you get to a login prompt with Alt-F2?
2009-06-26T21:14:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	if you can ssh to it, log in and do a 'ps ax | grep lock' then kill that screen lock process
2009-06-26T21:14:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	did not work
2009-06-26T21:14:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	I have smth called [lockd], iis that it?
2009-06-26T21:15:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	are you running gnome?
2009-06-26T21:15:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	yes
2009-06-26T21:15:00.000Z	th0r	Daremonai	the screen lock there is handled by the gnome-power-manager daemon, and I am not sure how to restart that as I run xfce
2009-06-26T21:16:00.000Z	Daremonai	th0r	okay, let me check
