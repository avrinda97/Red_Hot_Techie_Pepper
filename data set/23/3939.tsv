2008-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	Is that a verbatim paste?
2008-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	sloanesky		yes
2008-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	well, according to http://www.oculon.org/hijinx/linux/grub.htm there are supp to be "=" signs betw title and root keywords and assigned values.
2008-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	sloanesky		without the ubuntu entries of course
2008-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	sloanesky		hm, well, there arent any for the ubuntu entries
2008-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	eg root = (hd0,1)
2008-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	sloanesky		Ill try it and come back if it doesnt work
2008-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	OK... puzzling that your ubu entries don't have = :-)
2008-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	sloanesky		Ill paste the whole file verbatim in another pastebin
2008-01-05T10:14:00.000Z	sloanesky	moidekar	http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/50824/
2008-01-05T10:15:00.000Z	sloanesky		maybe that page is out of date? the examples in the menu.lst dont have = signs
2008-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	I agree - I just looked at my own menu.lst and the examples don't have "="
2008-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	what's the savedefault entry for? The example block in my menu.lst for Win2K doesn't have that keyword
2008-01-05T10:18:00.000Z	sloanesky		Im not sure, one of the guides I found had it in there heh
2008-01-05T10:20:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	two possible things to try: use rootnoverify instead of root, and remove the savedefault keyword and try?
2008-01-05T10:20:00.000Z	sloanesky		alright
2008-01-05T10:20:00.000Z	sloanesky		brbz
2008-01-05T10:24:00.000Z	sloanesky		it worked moidekar
2008-01-05T10:24:00.000Z	sloanesky		thanks
2008-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	which one worked - rootnoverify?
2008-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	sloanesky		not sure, did both
2008-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	sloanesky		but if I had to venture a guess id say that yeah it was rootnoverify
2008-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	moidekar	sloanesky	ok, tx for the feedback - something to file away in head :-)
