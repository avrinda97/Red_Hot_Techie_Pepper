2008-04-16T12:26:00.000Z	powertoo108		Couldn't find package "data", and more than 40
2008-04-16T12:26:00.000Z	powertoo108		packages contain "data" in their name.
2008-04-16T12:26:00.000Z	powertoo108		where should i put a tgz file so that doesn't happen when using aptitude?
2008-04-16T12:26:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	what did you do?
2008-04-16T12:27:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	tgz is a compressed file using tar ang gzip
2008-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	if you want to install apps using aptitude just 'sudo aptitude' '/' for search
2008-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	i realize that, but its looking for the tgz and the folders compressed in it, so where do i extract them to solve the error?
2008-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	is aptitude looking for files in a compressed archive? Thats has never happened to me
2008-04-16T12:29:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	what exactly are you trying to do?
2008-04-16T12:29:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	i assume it is? i'm trying to install rubygems * and i get that error
2008-04-16T12:29:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	what error is that?
2008-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	you get an error when you sudo apt-get install rubygems ?
2008-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	the can't find package error
2008-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	yes
2008-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	try sudo apt-get update
2008-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	and then once more sudo apt-get install rubygems
2008-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	didn't fix it
2008-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	apt (or aptitude) most often doesnt look for packages lokally, but on servers
2008-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	so there shouldn't be any need to manually put a package anywhere on your harddrive
2008-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	i know, thats what i don't understand about the error, its like its looking for pre-existing directories to install to but they aren't there
2008-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	could you cut'n'paste the error?
2008-04-16T12:35:00.000Z	ay^	powertoo108	is that * suppose to be there?
2008-04-16T12:36:00.000Z	powertoo108	ay^	i believe so, it was in the documentation on the wiki
