2010-02-03T12:30:00.000Z	Rowan		Maybe it was messed up, hopefully the new one will work better?
2010-02-03T12:30:00.000Z	Rowan		I remember it being a whole hell of a lot easier to install Ubuntu when I was installing it on my desktop tower when I was little.
2010-02-03T12:31:00.000Z	Rowan		Little meaning 13.
