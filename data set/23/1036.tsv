2010-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	how much free space do you have left in vista?
2010-09-29T13:22:00.000Z	CameronH		uh like 40-50gb
2010-09-29T13:23:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	and how big do you want your ubuntu part to be? 30GB (normally plenty if you're just trying ubuntu properly. mine is 100GB, but i've only ever used 40GB over two years with it dualbooting with win7)
2010-09-29T13:24:00.000Z	CameronH		Ya i just wanted to try it with a small part then if i liked it id make it bigger cause i have heaps of space on my external for stuffs
2010-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	well...have you got a copy of the ubuntu install CD/DVD from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
2010-09-29T13:27:00.000Z	CameronH	evilmercenary	i have a .iso from awhile ago
2010-09-29T13:28:00.000Z	evilmercenary		better off getting the most recent one
2010-09-29T13:28:00.000Z	evilmercenary		CameronH,
2010-09-29T13:34:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	you'll best off downloading and burning the latest version of the ubuntu disk....
2010-09-29T13:35:00.000Z	CameronH	evilmercenary	k im doing that now
2010-09-29T13:38:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	great :) about partitioning: the ubuntu installer is set up to be as easy as possible. to partition in the installer, when prompted select "i want to install ubuntu alongside windows" and it will open a slider up on the menu. from there you just graphically slide along to how big you want the partition to be (i'd suggest about 10-30GB for you) and how big your windows partition will be too. then press "finish partitioning"
2010-09-29T13:38:00.000Z	evilmercenary		and it will do it all, automated :)
2010-09-29T13:38:00.000Z	evilmercenary	CameronH	that's how easy it will be. nothing to worry about :)
