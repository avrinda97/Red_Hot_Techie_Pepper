2008-06-23T22:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	I've got KDE4 and Gnome installed simultaneously on my OpenSuse11 distro install without any problems... Why would it be that much different for Ubuntu?
2008-06-23T22:39:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	because they share the same repos, everything is available to the user then, all gnome apps that bwere installed as well as for kde, so it actually causes some instability-that was my experience, which is not unique
2008-06-28T00:38:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	just use mkfs
2008-06-28T00:39:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	i'm not familiar with mkfs
2008-06-28T00:39:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	can you elaborate plz?
2008-06-28T00:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	type man mkfs in a terminal :)
2008-06-28T00:39:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	doh! lol, thankz
2008-06-28T00:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	If say for example your usb drive was /dev/sdd, then you would want to I guess first use fdisk, so sudo fdisk /dev/sdd, then create a primary partition of type FAT32, once you do that, you'd do mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdd1
2008-06-28T00:44:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	I get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23351/
2008-06-28T00:45:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	first you need to do sudo fdisk -l to find what the device is called, paste me that output
2008-06-28T00:46:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	http://paste.ubuntu.com/23352/
2008-06-28T00:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	huh? you typed exactly this: sudo fdisk -l and got that as an output?
2008-06-28T00:47:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	yeah
2008-06-28T00:48:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	see, the reason i need to format is, there is no data on the disk, its 1 GB, but it says there is only 165MB's of available memory
2008-06-28T00:48:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	I'm confused about the output of your sudo fdisk -l
2008-06-28T00:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	I've never seen that before
2008-06-28T00:49:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	8\
2008-06-28T00:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	Not to be rude, but you definitely typed sudo fdisk -l (that's a lowercase L)
2008-06-28T00:49:00.000Z	theFATMAN	ASULutzy	for sure, mate
2008-06-28T00:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	I've got no clue then, sorry
2008-06-28T00:52:00.000Z	ASULutzy	theFATMAN	I tried googling that error, and there are only two pages that even list that... Try posting on the forums, cause it's definitely pretty obscure
