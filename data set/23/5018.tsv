2007-04-08T14:08:00.000Z	Eureka		federico90: i would suggest using something like vi or gedit.
2007-04-08T14:09:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	how can i do it from an automated script?
2007-04-08T14:10:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	Sorry, i missed your last question??
2007-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	for example i want to modify a file from a .sh file adding a line at the end
2007-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	can i?
2007-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	if all you are doing is adding something to the end each time you can do something like this
2007-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	Eureka		ls >> filename
2007-04-08T14:12:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	what does it do?
2007-04-08T14:12:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	the >> will tell output to be sent to another file rather than to your screen. Make sure its >> though, as this APPENDS it to the end of the file, if you use > only it will overwrite the whole file!
2007-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	well i try
2007-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	ty
2007-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	the example of using ls (listing contents of the directry) in this method. ls >> filename would mean that im listing the contents of the directry into the end of the file
2007-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	Hope it helps ;) im sure there are a million other ways to do it
2007-04-08T14:14:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	i think that only one is better ;)
2007-04-08T14:14:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	ah, where i have to write the line to add?
2007-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	eg. ls >> file [and then?] 
2007-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	well, hope i helped ;) im going afk now but i would check ou the forums if you have more scripting questions
2007-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	ty
2007-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	well, it should just append the file... try using the command once with a dummy file (if there isnt one and you have high enough privlages it will create it)
2007-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	that way you can get a feel for how it works
2007-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	so i'm going to make some try
2007-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	Federico90	Eureka	thanks
2007-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	Eureka	Federico90	welcome! =)
