2009-06-28T00:06:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	open /etc/X11/xorg.conf   does Driver say "fglrx"?
2009-06-28T00:06:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	Yes.
2009-06-28T00:08:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok first thing is make copy of your xorg.conf  so  in terminal  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2009-06-28T00:10:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	OK.
2009-06-28T00:12:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	open   System>Administration>Hardware Drivers   what in there?
2009-06-28T00:13:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	I'm running IceWM right now. Also, no windows will come up at all.
2009-06-28T00:15:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok well if you want you can try the radeon driver to see if that helps until you can fix it.  so  in terminal   gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change  "fglrx" to "radeon" then save and reboot
2009-06-28T00:16:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	Like I said, gedit won't launch. Nothing will. I'll fix it with nano though.
2009-06-28T00:16:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok
2009-06-28T00:17:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	Still cannot open display.
2009-06-28T00:18:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	this all started after installing new drivers?
2009-06-28T00:19:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok instead of "radeon" try "vesa"
2009-06-28T00:20:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	Nothing, same.
2009-06-28T00:21:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok  open /etc/hostname  what does it say?
2009-06-28T00:22:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	The exact name of my desktop. It's correct. "jbeatty-desktop"
2009-06-28T00:23:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok now open /etc/hosts  what does that say?
2009-06-28T00:23:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	only top two lines
2009-06-28T00:24:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	ok thats fine there used to be a hostname bug but thats not your problem
2009-06-28T00:26:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	only other thing i can think is put  "fglrx" back in xorg.cong and uninstall the driver you installed. was everything working before you installed that?
2009-06-28T00:26:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	 was everything working before you installed that ati driver?
2009-06-28T00:26:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	I actually already tried that. I uninstalled the driver, no fix, so I reinstalled it so I can know exactly what changed.
2009-06-28T00:27:00.000Z	mefached	legend2440	Yes.
2009-06-28T00:27:00.000Z	legend2440	mefached	which ati card?
