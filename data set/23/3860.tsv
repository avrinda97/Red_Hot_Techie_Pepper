2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		ok
2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		now seriously
2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		I install a fresh Maverick
2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		and now after 2 reboots or so, I CAN'T LOGIN.
2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		now I understand not every bug is found in testing
2011-03-13T01:44:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		but what the fuck is this shit?
2011-03-13T01:45:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		I login, background from user comes up, get thrown back to login screen
2011-03-13T01:45:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		sorry jrib this kind of bugs just makes me loose any understanding. It's too obvious and any testing should have shown it
2011-03-13T01:46:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		any testing would have shown that
2011-03-13T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	what release did you install?
2011-03-13T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	how big are your partitions?
2011-03-13T01:47:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	ActionParsnip	ext4 little under 60GB, 1,5GB swap iirc
2011-03-13T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	ok so not due to full systems
2011-03-13T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	what video chip do you use?
2011-03-13T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	tried the bootoption: nomodeset
2011-03-13T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	you can also try blacklisting the current driver so you force the OS to use vesa, you can then get updated
2011-03-13T01:52:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	ActionParsnip	I guess updating isn't going to do much, I don't think the Matrox drives has been updates for ages
2011-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	but the kernel has as has Xorg, could be the difference
2011-03-13T01:54:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	ActionParsnip	there's nothing to update anyway, I installed from mini.iso, so unless I activate backports..
2011-03-13T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	i'd look into that.
2011-03-13T02:13:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	ActionParsnip	I replaced the Matrox G400 with a Geforce MX4000 and yay.. system logs in automatically, menu bars on top and bottom are back and perfectly visible
2011-03-13T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	cool, sounds like a bug with the driver for matrox
2011-03-13T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	W3ird_N3rd	I guess :(
