2007-11-18T02:53:00.000Z	HunterKiller		I have a problem with ubuntu on my laptop. My laptop has an "Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950" graphics card and Linux finds it automatically and picks a driver for it. All sorts of cool effects work, except for certain glitches, like horizontal line artifacts in specific places on my screen. They go away if move a window over them or drag a selection box over them but they come back in a while.
2007-11-18T02:53:00.000Z	HunterKiller		If I can't fix this problem it'll be a deal breaker and I'll have to go back to Windows and I don't want to do that.
2007-11-18T02:54:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	card is not quite compatible, some cards dont work sowell, you're the lucky winner of one of them
2007-11-18T02:54:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	sometimes you can disable certain effects,wobbly windows is good for causing artifacts
2007-11-18T02:54:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	the problems still happen with all effects off
2007-11-18T02:54:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	and you can always just disable the effects
2007-11-18T02:55:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	could it also be caused by some problem with me using an external display for my laptop? I have the main display disabled and the external display is the default.
2007-11-18T02:55:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	unlikely
2007-11-18T02:57:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	What can I do if turning off all the effects still causes me problems?
2007-11-18T02:57:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	not all onboard cards run effect well, although im surprised a intel doesnt, i thought most of those worked
2007-11-18T02:58:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	you may wanna check how much ram is dedicated to the card in bios, what kinda machine is it
2007-11-18T03:01:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	shouldnt really be having alot of problems with that machine, is it set to 128mb shared?
2007-11-18T03:02:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	you may want to try it off of the external monitor just to see, if it works, then its just remediating why the external is funky
2007-11-18T03:04:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	would if I could but the laptop's screen is broken
2007-11-18T03:04:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	Yeah, it's set for 128mb shared
2007-11-18T03:05:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	DOOOH...hmmm...may want to check the xorg.conf and see what it looks like, you can post it to pastebina nd ill peak at it, i got  a little more time before I need to jet

2007-11-18T03:10:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	I've had nothing but problems with display on my laptop. Compiz has problems detecting my true resolution so I have to set it manually and the dimming effect when it asks for my sudo password when I install stuff doesn't dim the whole screen like it's detecting the wrong resolution.
2007-11-18T03:11:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	I think it seriously has something to do with me using an external display on my laptop. I open my laptop and I push the button to shut down the main screen and use the external display and nothing happens... but in setting in ubuntu I have it set to use only the external display but it still has my main display turned on
2007-11-18T03:12:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	ohh just looked at your config, switch that driver to i810
2007-11-18T03:13:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	intel driver is no good, like using base ati driver indeed of radeon
2007-11-18T03:13:00.000Z	HunterKiller	helfrez	I've tried that. It messes things up. I end up with my screen 'zoomed' meaning that my screen doesn't match the resolution
2007-11-18T03:14:00.000Z	helfrez	HunterKiller	to get it right you will need to put the monitor Refresh and sync setting in there...and to be safe, remove all the modes except the rez you want
