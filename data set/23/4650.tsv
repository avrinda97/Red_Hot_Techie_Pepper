2007-06-12T06:58:00.000Z	MrMe01		Hello all!
2007-06-12T07:00:00.000Z	MrMe01		does anyone have experience with vmware and ubunu and desktop effects?
2007-06-12T07:01:00.000Z	MrMe01		there is a guide to enable acceleration in vmware, you think that will help?
2007-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	MrMe01		so I need to run it native?
2007-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	MrMe01		how does ubuntu play with the x1950?
2007-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	MrMe01		bah
2007-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	MrMe01		so no pretties?
2007-06-12T07:04:00.000Z	MrMe01		whats the support like for ati raid?
2007-06-12T07:05:00.000Z	MrMe01		but I love DAAMIT !
2007-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	Don't use software raid chips in raid mode. use in-kernel md raid.
2007-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	How much did it cost?
2007-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	If it's on the mobo it's *not* hardware raid, but software raid running in a dedicated (PROPRIETARY) chip.
2007-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	Run it in normal sata or pata mode, use the kernel's software raid. It's faster anyway.
2007-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	raid0? Ouch
2007-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	it's it's 2x500 looking like 1Tb it's raid0. Which would be bad.
2007-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	Until one disk dies, then *all* data goes away.
2007-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	... which is fine if you have backups
2007-06-12T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	If all you need is more space, using lvm is a better bet - then you only lose the data on the disk that died.
2007-06-12T07:14:00.000Z	cafuego	MrMe01	well, the problem is the raid setup on XP; Linux needs to map that so that it doesn't trash the winxp partition, which may be anywhere on the physical disk.
2007-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	MrMe01	cafuego	can I PM you?
2007-06-12T07:16:00.000Z	MrMe01	cafuego	 can I PM you?
2007-06-12T07:18:00.000Z	MrMe01	cafuego	 can I PM you?
