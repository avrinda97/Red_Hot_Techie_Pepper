2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Shay		good morning
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Shay		finally my ipod works with floola, :D
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Shay		is the /opt folder used for anything? people recommend putting programs in there
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Shay		ahh
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	Shay		what was it used for?
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	Shay		aha
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	Shay		i just put songbird and floola downloads in there and it works fine :)
2008-08-22T14:12:00.000Z	Shay		i used ndiswrapper to get my broadcom.. 4310 i think running using dell drivers
2008-08-22T14:12:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	you shouldn't need ndiswrapper for broadcom, just a wired ethernet connection
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	so?
2008-08-22T14:15:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	With a wireed ethernet connection handy you need only install the fwcutter and then enable the driver in the drivers panel for it to work
2008-08-22T14:16:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	the drivers are already there, fwcutter just downloads the firmware to make them work
2008-08-22T14:16:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	nforce ethernet has been supported for years ;)
2008-08-22T14:17:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	lots of people come a cropper with broadcom because they don't keep a wired connection handy when they try and install it and then assume it's not supported
2008-08-22T14:17:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	then they try and give all kinds of silly excuses for just why they don't have a wired connection handy
2008-08-22T14:18:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	Once you get wireless going you can do without the wired, you just need the wired to make installing the wireless easier
2008-08-22T14:21:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	Yeah, installing the fwcutter enables the driver in the hardware-drivers panel, you simply enable it there and it'll download the firmware and do all the config needed to make the driver work. The catch is that without a working internet connection you run into a chicken and egg type situation. Many people assume (incorrectly) that it's not supported at that point and run to ndiswrapper
2008-08-22T14:21:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	Once you have the firmware installed and the driver working, nm will work as well as with any other driver
2008-08-22T14:22:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	If you're already using ndiswrapper and it works then there's no real reason to change. I was just pointing out that there was no real reason to use ndiswrapper in the first place and whoever told you otherwise doesn't know what they were talking about :)
2008-08-22T14:24:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	ndiswrapper is becoming to wireless what hdparm is to disk issues. People are flocking to it without first investigating alternatives
2008-08-22T14:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	next to the password prompt
2008-08-22T14:25:00.000Z	Shay	LSD|Ninja	what about the password prompt?
2008-08-22T14:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Shay	sorry, I miscompleted that last one
