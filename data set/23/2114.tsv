2009-06-25T02:49:00.000Z	nbkr	waul	In the Properties menu of a _real_ folder (not a link like the "personal folder" on the desktop).
2009-06-25T02:50:00.000Z	waul	nbkr	is /usr a "real" folder?
2009-06-25T02:50:00.000Z	nbkr	waul	Yes it is.

2009-06-25T03:00:00.000Z	nbkr	waul	Hm - should be there. Try to create a new folder on your desktop and check if you can see it there. Maybe its a problem with access rights.
