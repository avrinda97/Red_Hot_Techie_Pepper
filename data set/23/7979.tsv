2005-03-06T17:07:00.000Z	S1nn3r		hi all
2005-03-06T17:09:00.000Z	S1nn3r		anyone know why alsa ant detecting my sound card on startup (am in the process of first run after install .. updateing now)
2005-03-06T17:10:00.000Z	S1nn3r		is alsa support for all the supported soundcards set up in ubuntu or ?
2005-03-06T17:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	what sound card do you have ?
2005-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	VIA 82xx
2005-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	thats the driver ive needed for the onboard sound in the past
2005-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	the oss drivers are probably loaded what does lsmod | grep via output
2005-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	if the oss drivers are loaded then alsa will not work
2005-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	its still cleaning up after the first run and update.. will get back to you when its done
2005-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	okie :)
2005-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	I don't know why the alsa drivers aren't working out of the box, oss probably ahs taken control for some odd reason
2005-03-06T17:18:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	arg, hm.. so how do i go about killing OSS in ubuntu ?
2005-03-06T17:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	you will have to unload the modules
2005-03-06T17:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	then add the alsa modules using modprobe
2005-03-06T17:21:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	probibly have to go looking for the alsa conf to right ?
2005-03-06T17:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	alsaconf isn't installed in Ubuntu by defaule :(
2005-03-06T17:22:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	oh great, so much for the install and go idea then, heh
2005-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	1 set backward to take 2 steps forward :)
2005-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	so first get rid of OSS modules,make sure the alsa ones are loading then create the alsa conf file ?
2005-03-06T17:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	yeah basically
2005-03-06T17:26:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	think im gonna see if i can get Nvidia acell up and running first.. then go back to alsa heh
2005-03-06T17:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	S1nn3r	that's pretty easy to do did you see the howto on the ubuntu site ?
2005-03-06T17:28:00.000Z	S1nn3r	LinuxJones	yep.. which is precisely why im doing that first .. always do the easy stuff first
