2006-05-15T05:41:00.000Z	Nihil_85		hi! can aybody tell my if it's better an Intel Pentium D 930 or a 830?The first one is a dual core with separate cores and 2x2mb of cache, the second one has the cores on the same silicius and 2mb shared.
2006-05-15T05:43:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	they both suck heh
2006-05-15T05:45:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	i did not say intel sucked. i said both of the processors mentioned sucked (and they do)
2006-05-15T05:46:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	so wich is a processor that doesn't suck?
2006-05-15T05:46:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	if you want a good dual core processor, then you want core duo or core 2 duo
2006-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	Pentium D is dual core
2006-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	i know this. the pentium D also sucks hard.
2006-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	core duo is the product name.
2006-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	core duo is only for Mac... the 64bit dual core of Intel is named Pentium D
2006-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	no, it is NOT only for mac, and 64bitness is irrelevent
2006-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	the pentium product line is dead (and good riddance)
2006-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	so here in italy there's not this core duo. THey sell only pentium D. Why?
2006-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	probably demand, the core duo isn't very popular yet
2006-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	so i can choose from: Pentium D, Amd 64 and Amd64 X2. what should i choose? You must consider that AMD costs 20%more than Intel
2006-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	probably the amd64 x2, unless money matters a lot
2006-05-15T05:55:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	you can't use a pentium M (mobile, like centrino) in a desktop machine, i think
2006-05-15T05:56:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	that was only what i thought, maybe not what's true
2006-05-15T06:05:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/04/24/dual_core_intel_processors_for_low/page3.html <--- here you can see that core duo's not available on desktop systems.
2006-05-15T06:06:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	the core 2 duo will be though :)
2006-05-15T06:06:00.000Z	spikeb	Nihil_85	and you can get a core duo desktop motherboard, or at least a pentium M one. i've seen em
2006-05-15T06:06:00.000Z	Nihil_85	spikeb	tomshardware tell the contrary
