2010-01-14T21:24:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: is there any way of getting the local network ip ?
2010-01-14T21:24:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: I want to assign it to something like $ip
2010-01-14T21:28:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	ah, abe3k don't know, use grep and awk on ifconfig to echo network ip if there is no direcht command for it
2010-01-14T21:28:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: so I have to make a scrip to filter the output of ifconfig then ?
2010-01-14T21:30:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	ifconfig | grep "inet addr:192" | awk '{print $2}'
2010-01-14T21:30:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: awesome, I'll give it a try thanks
2010-01-14T21:31:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	does that work for you? if you want the addr: part gone then pipe to sed also
2010-01-14T21:31:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: it worked verry well but I don't want to include the addr: in the output
2010-01-14T21:32:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	hang on, let me try
2010-01-14T21:32:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: thanks buddy
2010-01-14T21:33:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	 ifconfig | grep "inet addr:192" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/addr://'
2010-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: perfect thaaanks :D
2010-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	I'm sure it can be done much smarter and geekier, but this works
2010-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: thats good enough for me xD
2010-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: you can't imagine how long the scrip I imagined to do was haha
2010-01-14T21:36:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	:  current_ip="$(ifconfig | grep "inet addr:192" | awk '{print $2}'|sed 's/addr://g')"     works perfectly
2010-01-14T21:36:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	:  thanks again buddy
2010-01-14T21:37:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	any time
2010-01-14T21:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	abe3k	don't know if ip has always same amount of numbers; but here's an easier alternative, just for fun: ifconfig | grep "inet addr:192" | cut --characters 21-32
2010-01-14T21:43:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	: yeah, I agree sometimes I'll use it with machienes that end with 3 digits
2010-01-14T21:44:00.000Z	abe3k	VCoolio	:I think the long one is safer
