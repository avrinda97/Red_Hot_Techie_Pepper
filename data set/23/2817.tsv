2008-12-30T07:10:00.000Z	lawstudent		hi, folks. all of a sudden our internet stopped working. by removing our wireless router from the equation, the internet is now accessible again. what could be the problem? we want to use our wireless router?
2008-12-30T07:11:00.000Z	lawstudent		(I'm typing on my friend's cabled/wired Windows XP computer, because my Ubuntu comp is on wireless, and I didn't want to complicate our troubleshooting.
2008-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	lawstudent		tripped?
2008-12-30T07:13:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	have you rebooted the router?
2008-12-30T07:13:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	yes.
2008-12-30T07:13:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	unplugged power cable and replugged. went to web browser config and did a factory default thingamajig.
2008-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	if it's factory default you may have turned wifi off.
2008-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	or reset the esid
2008-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	yes, but still the wired connection on a wirelless router should still work. But in fact, wired using wireless router does not work.
2008-12-30T07:15:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	what's esid? and how to reset?
2008-12-30T07:15:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	wait your saying wired connections don't work when wireless is enabled?
2008-12-30T07:16:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	that's right. wired connection does NOT work when wireless router is used.
2008-12-30T07:17:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	ok i'm convinced.  your router is possessed by the specter in ghost busters I.
2008-12-30T07:21:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	I've got news for you, you're router is in bridge mode.
2008-12-30T07:22:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	really? I think I've checkde severeal times, and router should be / is in gateway mode.
2008-12-30T07:22:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	if it was your PC would get a 192. address when you plugged it in.  right now it's give you the IP of the cable modem, meaning it's not building a NAT list
2008-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	also known as pass through.
2008-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	all right. I'm not sure i understand. But what are the implications? in other words, can we solve this problem? how/
2008-12-30T07:25:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	give me the exact model number and name of your router and i'll see what I can do.  basically your router isn't a router now.  somehow it's been switched into a normal hub unit.
2008-12-30T07:26:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	I agree with him.  Factory defaults here would be your best option.
2008-12-30T07:27:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	Dell Wireless 2350 Broadband Router
2008-12-30T07:30:00.000Z	pyrophelia	lawstudent	reset the router one more time (following the exact instructions on how to reset).  if that doesn't work I don't know what else anybody can do.  the documentation for your router clearly states that the factory defualt for the router is to have dhcp enabled on the cable port.  if it's not building a NAT table (routable LAN IPs) after a reset your router may be bad.
2008-12-30T07:33:00.000Z	lawstudent	pyrophelia	hansel. ok. i'm powering off my router and modem and computers for 30 secs +. pls save messages directed to me while I'm away. thanks!!!
