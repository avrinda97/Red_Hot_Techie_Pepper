2009-11-29T21:24:00.000Z	trayzz		is there a file which saves the gui preferences for nautilus? ..and if so where is it?
2009-11-29T21:25:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	gconf-editor
2009-11-29T21:26:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	thanks, my problem is that nautilus starts with the default layout and i thought it might be due to wrong user rights..
2009-11-29T21:26:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	define 'default layout'
2009-11-29T21:27:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	gconf-editor is a gui frontend to edit the gconf.xml file
2009-11-29T21:27:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	which lives somewhere in a users home folder
2009-11-29T21:28:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i wonder though if it's due to file ownership or if it's something else..started like a day ago for the first time
2009-11-29T21:29:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	have you tried killing the nautilus process then restarting it while you have system-monitor open to show open files?
2009-11-29T21:29:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	thus showing you which files it's using
2009-11-29T21:29:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	in any case the gconf stuff lives in ~/.gconf
2009-11-29T21:31:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i get some error messages: trayzz@tray:~$ nautilus&
2009-11-29T21:31:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i tried it now, got some error messages
2009-11-29T21:32:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	I'll send you a private message if you don't mind
2009-11-29T21:32:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	pastebin the error message here instead
2009-11-29T21:34:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	1. goto paste.ubuntu.com 2. paste into text field there 3. get url result and paste it here
2009-11-29T21:35:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i posted it in a textfile: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/642705/nautilus.txt
2009-11-29T21:36:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	restarting nautilus worked
2009-11-29T21:37:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i wonder what it was though
2009-11-29T21:37:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	errors are a symptom of runnin nautilus from commandline.. don't worry about them
2009-11-29T21:37:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	not relevant to your problem
2009-11-29T21:38:00.000Z	trayzz	jadakren	i'll see if it reappears but for now it's fine.. thanks alot mate
2009-11-29T21:39:00.000Z	jadakren	trayzz	welcome
