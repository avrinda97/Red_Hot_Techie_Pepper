2009-03-30T06:31:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	5 years for server
2009-03-30T06:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	yeah, but he is not installing a server
2009-03-30T06:32:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	Just sayin'
2009-03-30T06:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	sidux I still  haven't tryed that in a vm
2009-03-30T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	yeah, but they are also closed hum
2009-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	Better that than nothing.
2009-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	Adobe flash is closed too
2009-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	true, but there are two good alternatives, Gnash and Swfdec
2009-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	That aren't feature-complete enough for normal use.
2009-03-30T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	depends on the usage,   Gnash has improved a lot recently.  and  that's enough on that subject I think,  since offtopic
2009-03-30T06:45:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	There are some things closed source works for. And true enough.
2009-03-30T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	true
2009-03-30T06:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	  pretty much yeah, but  a virtual machine would be better usaully I think, even if Windows is the host,  plus it's nice to be able to run two OS's like that at same time
2009-03-30T07:07:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	ext4 isn't stable yet; I wouldn't recommend it for crucial data. Still all that stuff w/ unordered journaling causing data corruption
2009-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	yeah stuff like that, hence why I wait for 9.04 final and  good jaunty Ext4 views  before I decide to clean install with Ext4 or not.  we shoudn't talk to much about Ext4 here, since it will go offtopic
2009-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	One last thing; you can mount an ext3 partition as ext4
2009-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	yeah, but not get full ext4 suppourt
2009-03-30T07:26:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	Yes you do. :\. Even for ssh, you need 5900 open
2009-03-30T07:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	no you don't
2009-03-30T07:27:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	You need *a* port open. :P
2009-03-30T07:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	only the SSH ports need to be open
2009-03-30T07:27:00.000Z	gigabites2	sebsebseb	You need a vnc port open on the localhost at least then in order to forward over ssh
2009-03-30T07:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gigabites2	indeed at that
