2008-10-27T15:06:00.000Z	r0ach		Here's something I did ....
2008-10-27T15:06:00.000Z	r0ach		k k ubottu u bot !!
2008-10-27T15:07:00.000Z	r0ach		Try this out. If you have a RAR file password protected, press "Extract here". It'll start extracting. After sometime, it asks for password. So, in the mean time, all the data has been leaked
2008-10-27T15:08:00.000Z	r0ach		I actually leaked some data ;)
2008-10-27T15:09:00.000Z	r0ach		I used this method. I created a folder and made it extract to it. Then when it asks for password, I changed the permissions of the folder to "List Files". So, the leaked data got stuck there and fileroller can't do anything about it. Yay !!
2008-10-27T15:11:00.000Z	r0ach		You guys know of any primitive RAR openers ?
2008-10-27T15:12:00.000Z	r0ach		I need to get the oldest version of this "unrar"
2008-10-27T15:13:00.000Z	r0ach		guys, this is turning out to be a great exploit
2008-10-27T15:14:00.000Z	r0ach		!fuck | r0ach

2008-10-27T15:22:00.000Z	r0ach	bazhang_	I didn't get you. I was asking if there's some site which still keeps files of old software.
2008-10-27T15:22:00.000Z	bazhang_	r0ach	what kind?
2008-10-27T15:23:00.000Z	r0ach	bazhang_	Stuff like Unrar, Winrar. Just the condition that I need them real real old.
2008-10-27T15:23:00.000Z	bazhang_	r0ach	not sure; does this relate to ubuntu support? you may wish to ask in #ubuntu-offtopic if not
2008-10-27T15:24:00.000Z	r0ach	bazhang_	Not Ubuntu support. I'm on an experiment. Thought people here wud be familiar with old stuff since I'm just 2 years of ubuntu
2008-10-27T15:25:00.000Z	bazhang_	r0ach	then please ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-10-27T15:25:00.000Z	r0ach	bazhang_	Sigh.... Ok then
