2007-08-12T16:09:00.000Z	Cartas		If I download a program, how do I install it?  I don't seem to be able to do the ./configure, make, make install method? :S
2007-08-12T16:10:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	installing the traditional way will likely to break your system, you should use a properly compiled deb.
2007-08-12T16:11:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	did you check getdeb.net?
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	I'm downloading the Thunderbird tarball, what is its content?
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	is there any Makefile in there?
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	no, it
2007-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	so it's a binary package, is there any executable?. WHat does the README say?
2007-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	the package is ~11MB so it will take me a few minutes to download.
2007-08-12T16:20:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	yep.
2007-08-12T16:25:00.000Z	Cartas	fnf	 How's it going, old chap?
2007-08-12T16:26:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	it's a binary package, if you have a file manager, just double click on 'thunderbird' is OK.
2007-08-12T16:27:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	yep, it should work :)
2007-08-12T16:28:00.000Z	Cartas	fnf	 Anyway I can add the application to the Applications -> Internet menu?
2007-08-12T16:28:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	sure, the GNOME menu isn't very flexible in that regard though. You'll have to use Alacarte: right-click on the Main Menu->Edit
2007-08-12T16:30:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	it should be as easy as dragging-n-dropping to the menu though
2007-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	Cartas	fnf	Everytime I run it, I have to use the 'thunderbird' file I just used?
2007-08-12T16:32:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	yeah, or add a new item to the main menu which points to that file.
2007-08-12T16:33:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	thunderbird compiled in a DEB package will have an icon in the menu and everything in place automatically.
2007-08-12T16:33:00.000Z	Cartas	fnf	But how does one get a deb package of it if it's not at getdeb? :p
2007-08-12T16:33:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	compile one ;)
2007-08-12T16:34:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	alright, I'll give it a shot.
2007-08-12T16:35:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	have to waste another 5 mins again to download source, sigh.
2007-08-12T16:36:00.000Z	fnf	Cartas	I'll be back in a few minutes.
