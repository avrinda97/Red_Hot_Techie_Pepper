2007-12-25T19:14:00.000Z	Condoulo		is there an easy way to find out what my drives specifically are? Such as it shows my main Ubuntu install as (0,0). But how can I find out what my Windows disc is.'
2007-12-25T19:15:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	fdisk -l will show all partitions...the windows partition will be ntfs
2007-12-25T19:18:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	you have to do 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-12-25T19:19:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	what does 'mount' say?
2007-12-25T19:19:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	are you running off the flash drive?
2007-12-25T19:21:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	a windows xp install?
2007-12-25T19:21:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	ok...give me a sec
2007-12-25T19:22:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	I believe it would be 1,0....not sure, but it wouldn't hurt to give that a go. I assume your xp drive was bootable and you just moved it and installed linux on the other drive?
2007-12-25T19:23:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	if you do 'sudo fdisk -l' it doesn't show anything?
2007-12-25T19:24:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	that's not right....it would have to show your linux drive if nothing else...I mean...you are logged in right?
2007-12-25T19:25:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	what does 'mount' say?
2007-12-25T19:26:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	something isn't right....it would have to show / and /home at a minimum, and a swap probably
2007-12-25T19:29:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	try 'hwinfo' in a terminal and see if you have that installed
2007-12-25T19:31:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	'hwinfo' will output a ton of info....capture it to a text file with 'hwinfo > hwinfo.txt'
2007-12-25T19:35:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	you should be able to identify the hard drives in that text file...
2007-12-25T19:36:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	there should be a line 'block.device = '/dev/hda3'
2007-12-25T19:38:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	well...it won't necessarily be sda3, but you should be able to identify both drives in that text file....see what devices they are. I suspect you will find /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1
2007-12-25T19:41:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	nope...the line with the block device.../dev/hda or /dev/sda...
2007-12-25T19:42:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	do you have multiple partitions on either of the drives?
2007-12-25T19:43:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	did you find the device designations.../dev/sda or /dev/hda
2007-12-25T19:44:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	then that should be hd(1,0)
2007-12-25T19:45:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	that is the xp drive?
2007-12-25T19:47:00.000Z	thor	Condoulo	found this...http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/installation/56461-grub-menu-lst-chainloader-help-needed.html...looks like he had the same problem....the solution seems to be at the end of the thread. Worth a try
