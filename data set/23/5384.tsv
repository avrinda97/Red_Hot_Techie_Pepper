2007-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	Draconicus		Hey there. I just built a fairly powerful machine for my little brother, and I'm putting Ubuntu on it. In the past I've had trouble with nodes in Edgy. Have there been recent updates to it? Should I go with Dapper?
2007-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	Draconicus		device nodes.
2007-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	Draconicus		Namely wireless controllers and such, but it could happen to anything, I'd imagine, if the problem isn't driver-related.
2007-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	Draconicus		And it probably isn't, since Dapper used the same driver and didn't have the problem. Anyway, this isn't about that problem, it's about whether I should put Edgy or Dapper on it.
2007-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	Draconicus		This is a computer I want to leave him when I move away. He'll no doubt be upgrading it to newer versions eventually, but I want to make sure it's reliable.
2007-03-22T10:19:00.000Z	Draconicus		By the way, I think you guys switched to gscreensaver way too early. It's pretty lousy at the moment in that it lacks many screensavers and is generally incompatible with xscreensavers.
2007-03-22T10:20:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	I completely agree
2007-03-22T10:21:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	Pici, soundray  - I personally find that the gscreensaver's lack of ability to edit the settings for each screensaver is most irritating
2007-03-22T10:22:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	I think you can tinker with the .desktop files and adjust some settings there. All in all, though, it ought to still be called a beta.
2007-03-22T10:23:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	yep - something that I've always thought was not exactly the most user friendly.
2007-03-22T10:24:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	Certainly something that doesn't belong in Ubuntu, since it's supposed to be the user friendly distro and all. :P
2007-03-22T10:24:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	yep - and I love how this isn't #ubuntu-support -
2007-03-22T10:25:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	What difference would that make? This isn't about support. :P
2007-03-22T10:25:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	Though the channel is. The topic clearly says so.
2007-03-22T10:25:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	frankly - I think it'd be best to port everyone who's here for help to #ubuntu-support rather than this channel - it's unusable with this many users
2007-03-22T10:25:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	Well, there's a #ubuntu-offtopic, I think. Let's go there.
2007-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	maybe I'm just old fashioned - but isn't talk about Ubuntu ontopic in #Ubuntu?
2007-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	XD
2007-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	;)
2007-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	I miss the old days. Remember Breezy? I still have some Breezy systems kicking around. That was when I joined the Ubuntu bandwagon.
2007-03-22T10:29:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	While it was really for apache, I just caught Pici giving a user support in #ubuntu-offtopic. XP
2007-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	Crescendo__	Draconicus	downstairs - silly IRC!  There must be a mistake1   * #ubuntu-support #ubuntu :Forwarding to another channel
2007-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	Draconicus	Crescendo__	Ahahaaa...
