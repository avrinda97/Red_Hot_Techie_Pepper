2007-11-07T08:40:00.000Z	Lurker_	sethk	apparently I need a bit more than just that.
2007-11-07T08:40:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	ok, what happened?
2007-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	is this a very old machine?
2007-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	Lurker_	sethk	it's about 2 years old
2007-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	that's not old enough to have the 1024 limit.  It's about 10 years too new for the limit
2007-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	so I'd suspect that /dev/sdc may not be correct
2007-11-07T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	can you review for me what drives you have, and how they are connected?
2007-11-07T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	the fourth port is sdd, not sdc
2007-11-07T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	so if it's in the fourth port, try (hd3,0) and /dev/sdd1
2007-11-07T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	sdd is in your device.map, from your paste
2007-11-07T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	in that case,  you want    (hd0,0)      and    /dev/sda
2007-11-07T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	wait
2007-11-07T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	dmesg says sdd is the seagate
2007-11-07T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	but something else says its the first sda drive?
2007-11-07T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	oh, ok.  does dmesg show you the one that is the one you want?  I'm confused, is that the maxtor?
2007-11-07T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	which one has linux on it, and what does dmesg refer to it as?
2007-11-07T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	you can also find the information in /sys, in case dmesg no longer has all the info
2007-11-07T08:55:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	the "first hard disk" is sda.  Have we tried    (hd0,0)    and    root=/dev/sda     ?
2007-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	you can also modify parameters at the grub prompt without changing menu.lst
2007-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	makes it easier to experiment
2007-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	you can edit the commands on the fly.  But I think I'd try changing menu.lst first.  after all, it doesn't work the way it currently is, so there's nothing to lose by changing it.
2007-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	I don't have it in front of me, but there are prompts.  I believe you type     e     to edit the values
2007-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	sethk	Lurker_	go ahead and change menu.lst now, anyway.  As I said, it doesn't work the way it is, so there's really nothing to lose by changing it.
