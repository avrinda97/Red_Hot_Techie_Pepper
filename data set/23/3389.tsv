2008-05-07T04:29:00.000Z	Alp`		hi there, i got a problem. i reinstalled hardy over gutsy today. and know i got a weird behaviour with maximized windows (compiz is enabled): every maximized and focused window randomly restores and maximizes again after almost each click in that window... result is a complete weirdness with constantly "moving" windows
2008-05-07T04:29:00.000Z	babolat	Alp`	try disabling compiz then reenabling it
2008-05-07T04:30:00.000Z	Alp`	babolat	compiz --replace ?
2008-05-07T04:30:00.000Z	babolat	Alp`	nope.. just go restart it
