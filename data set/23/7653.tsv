2005-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	CarlFK		way OT, but not sure where to go: OO for win, how do I tell it to associate itself with .doc after MSword took it over?
2005-07-25T08:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	you mean inside Windows?
2005-07-25T08:20:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- correct
2005-07-25T08:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	run OOo's install program again, pick the "Repair Install" option. it'll display the option to take over the Office docs again
2005-07-25T08:21:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- good plan.  thanks
2005-09-07T11:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	it's the fact that you have to pay MS for the NTFS drivers that make the whole NTFS-writer app non-Free...
2005-09-07T11:19:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- right, but you wouldn't have NTFS in the first place if you didnt' already own the MS product.  the part that is "captive ntfs" is free, open, all that
2005-09-07T11:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	right, but the whole thing isn't, and people who don't run Win might still be interested in NTFS-writing (can't imagine why, but...)
2005-09-07T11:22:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- I think you are thinking that the captive package includes the MS drivers.  "it" (what you get when you dl captive) doesn't, so "it" can be called free
2005-09-07T11:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	even if it doesn't include the drivers, it depends on them, and they're not free...
2005-09-07T11:24:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- ext2 depens on things you have to buy to.  but ext2 is free, right?
2005-09-07T11:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	hardware isn't the issuet, if you mean "you have to own a hard drive to be able to use EXT2"...
2005-09-07T11:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	http://www.debian.org/intro/free
2005-09-07T11:27:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- find me something that sugests that depandancy on non free drivers voids the OSness of it.
2005-09-07T11:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	read the URL I just posted...
2005-09-07T11:28:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	- like "While free software is not totally free of constraints" or is there something that supports your point?
2005-09-07T11:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	the "free to develop" part, and "free to copy"
2005-09-07T11:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	let's move to #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue, OK?
2005-09-07T11:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	#ubuntu-offtopic - you're missing a couple of details that're important...
2005-09-07T11:33:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	"
2005-09-07T11:33:00.000Z	CarlFK	Madpilot	"I" dont' care.  if anyone does care, they can go get them
2005-09-07T11:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	see above ^^^
2006-03-11T13:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	CarlFK	XPlane is non-free
