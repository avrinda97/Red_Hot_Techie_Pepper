2008-12-22T00:22:00.000Z	n8tuser		xxxxx-> man awk
2008-12-22T00:23:00.000Z	n8tuser		xxxxx-> now is a good time to learn these tools
2008-12-22T00:24:00.000Z	n8tuser		xxxxx-> kindly google for ls and awk and pipe
2008-12-22T00:25:00.000Z	n8tuser		tonsofpc1-> those are called console terminals or tty
2008-12-22T00:25:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	not when they don't work they aren't
2008-12-22T00:25:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	i am trying to get to a console term on vt1-6, it is not changing properly
2008-12-22T00:26:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	"8.10, installed 4 days ago, ctrl+alt+f1-6 causes the video output to change sync, then change sync back, then display a pointer cursor drawn over a black background where the mouse cursor was.  the cursor does not move with any input and all keyboard inputs appear to be ignored.  "
2008-12-22T00:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> off course, single user mode does not have x
2008-12-22T00:27:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	after killing X and allowing it to reload [via gdm/init, i suppose], from the login screen, ctrl+alt+fkey will apparently change VTs, but will not show anything but the mouse cursor stuck where it previously was, over a grey background, it will allow me to change back.
2008-12-22T00:29:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	yea
2008-12-22T00:30:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	file for tty1-6
2008-12-22T00:34:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	any ideas?
2008-12-22T00:36:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> can you try sync; sync;sync;  sudo telinit 1   this should get you to single user, and telinit 5 to get back to X
2008-12-22T00:36:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	will that kill screen?
2008-12-22T00:37:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	screen, the app running in bg, not the X screen.
2008-12-22T00:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> why dont you kill it? whats stopping you?
2008-12-22T00:38:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	why don't I kill what?
2008-12-22T00:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> whatever running in the screen shell
2008-12-22T00:38:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	well, #1, it's this irc client :)
2008-12-22T00:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> well i dont know what you wanted solve, you dont want to do things to test it, so you are on your own
2008-12-22T00:39:00.000Z	tonsofpc1	n8tuser	I simply asked if it will kill screen
2008-12-22T00:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	tonsofpc1	-> yes it will screen when change levels
