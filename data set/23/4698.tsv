2007-05-27T10:59:00.000Z	Ericc		I'm making a File Server from scratch size of 1 TB .. anyone what experience in this and is willing to help me for a few minutes?
2007-05-27T11:01:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	1TB? That is huge...
2007-05-27T11:01:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	Oh, I thought you said swap
2007-05-27T11:02:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	There are tons of different file servers, do you have any in mind that you want to do.. what do you want its functions to be?
2007-05-27T11:02:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	I understand, but what do you want it to accomplish
2007-05-27T11:05:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	Do you want it to be encrypted? User authentication, etc?
2007-05-27T11:05:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage (NAS) is what you should read up on
2007-05-27T11:14:00.000Z	Ericc	compotatoj	that's a problem because then I need HD's all the same speed
2007-05-27T11:07:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	Open source NAS-oriented distributions of Linux and FreeBSD are also available, including FreeNAS, NASLite and Openfiler. They are easy to configure via a Web-based Interface and run on low-end conventional computers. They can run from a LiveCD, bootable USB flash drive, or from one of the mounted hard drives. They run Samba, NFS daemon, and FTP daemons which are freely available for those operating systems.
2007-05-27T11:07:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	NAS is just the general term for what you want
2007-05-27T11:08:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	samba is just the protocol
2007-05-27T11:09:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	You could just build a computer with a linux distro and 1tb of raid storage and have a gigabit network card.. I think there are better ways though
2007-05-27T11:10:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	Make sure that you have fault protection
2007-05-27T11:11:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	How much money are you thinking of spending and how good of fault protection do you want?
2007-05-27T11:12:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	So for that, you probably will only have a TB hard drive and if it fails then you lost all of your data
2007-05-27T11:13:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	With multiple 1TB hard drives and RAID you can mirror your data over multiple hard drives and so if one dies you aren't screwed
2007-05-27T11:15:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	What were you planning on doing?
2007-05-27T11:15:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	If you haven't bought them yet it shouldn't cost any more
2007-05-27T11:16:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	I sent you a message
2007-05-27T11:18:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	I'm not sure..
2007-05-27T11:18:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	go to room #ericc
2007-05-27T11:19:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	/join #ericc
2007-05-27T11:19:00.000Z	compotatoj	Ericc	It is because you aren't registered.. just go into the room #ericc
