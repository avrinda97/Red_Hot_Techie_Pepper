2006-07-13T05:20:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	lets give him a break, hehe i was jumping and bouncing like he was when i got stuff running
2006-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	you rock
2006-11-23T17:15:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	with a text editor
2006-11-23T17:15:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	"rename" can do that. "man rename"
2006-11-23T17:15:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	coolers
2006-11-23T17:35:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	i took a look at man rename but it only renames files from capital to non capital etc or extension wise
2006-11-23T17:35:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	no, not really. it can take any regular expression.
2006-11-23T17:36:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	wish there was a website
2006-11-23T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	there is. "man regex" and "man sed" are there also
2006-11-23T17:40:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	rename "s/dsc.(....\.png)/dsc1\1/" *     might work, though no guarantees - test it in a backup directory first
2006-11-23T17:41:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	 ok thanks will check,
2006-11-23T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	uhm? you still want to make a script?
2006-11-23T17:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	 rename "s/dsc.(....\.png)/dsc1\1/" *   worked great
2006-11-23T17:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	just changed the png to jpg extension
2006-11-23T17:52:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	nice
2006-11-23T17:53:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	oh, right, i forgot the png thing, i was just trying a random extension =)
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	copy that line to a new file and name it *.sh and chmod it to what?
2006-11-23T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	you don't need to rename it. you need to put     #! /bin/sh   on the first line, and to chmod +x
2006-11-23T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	generally speaking, if the first line of a file (we call it A) begins with #! followed by a filename (call this B), the shell tries to run B as a command, passing A as an argument. so, for shell scripts, you want B to be a shell (/bin/sh)
2006-11-23T17:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	i see
2006-11-23T06:03:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LjL	nevermind ill just run that command from the prompt lol
2007-05-15T10:28:00.000Z	LjL	SurfnKid	swapon and swapoff
