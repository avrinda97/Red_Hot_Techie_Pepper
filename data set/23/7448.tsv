2005-07-27T14:31:00.000Z	GreenmanX		ive just got one stupid question...im thinking about using linux and so i decided to test ubuntu with the live cd....but how can i login? username and password?
2005-07-27T14:32:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	it will auto-login
2005-07-27T14:33:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	but theres a login screen for 10 seconds, after these 10 seconds i get an error message
2005-07-27T14:34:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	what is the error?
2005-07-27T14:36:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	something about not logged in within 10 seconds...test rebooting to get the autologin
2005-07-27T14:36:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	and that is on the liveCD on every boot?
2005-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	*shame on me* it was the first boot of the live cd
2005-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	the latest
2005-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	there are severeal interpretations of 'latest'
2005-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	is it hoary (5.04) or breezy (5.10 development)
2005-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	5.04
2005-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	okay...the same problem after intall...login screen came up...user ubuntu will login within 10 sec...screen went black...now ive got the error message..."your session only lastest less than 10 seconds. if you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is a problem bla bla try failsafe session
2005-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	hm...after reboot
2005-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	odd, have you tested the md5sum of the iso before you burnt it?
2005-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	hm...dont remember...i downloaded two or three weeks ago but burnt it today
2005-07-27T14:46:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	maybe there a problem because i try it on my notebook?
2005-07-27T14:46:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	what graphics chip does it have?
2005-07-27T14:47:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	could the problem result from a faulty screen resolution?
2005-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	for the ati chip on laptops, auto-detect works fine
2005-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	try dropping to a terminal with <ctrl><alt><f1> and login as user ubuntu without password (if that works) and loook at the end of /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-07-27T14:49:00.000Z	Seveas	GreenmanX	ah :)
2005-07-27T16:08:00.000Z	GreenmanX	Seveas	ok...it wont work...but i keep on trying...thanks for your help...bye
