2006-05-29T10:48:00.000Z	spikeb		everything is patent laden when it comes to video
2006-05-29T10:49:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	there are a few options actually.  theora.
2006-06-10T12:52:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	that's not really why
2006-06-10T12:52:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	there is an OSS implementation of java partly installed by default
2006-06-10T12:53:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 it has a eula and is subject to sun's clauses...
2006-06-10T12:53:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 it is NOT open source - YET.  thanks to ubuntu and mark, sun is possibly changing its ways a little faster...
2006-06-10T12:53:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	classpath is not subject to sun's EULA
2006-06-10T12:53:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 blah.  read stallman's report on the java trap and you will see what i mean.
2006-06-10T12:54:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	aye
2006-06-10T12:54:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 they _ARE_ speaking of going open source, last thing i read was 'matter of when, not if'
2006-06-10T12:54:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	yes, which will be interesting
2006-06-10T12:55:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	i wonder if that is going to end up helping or hurting projects like gjc and harmony
2006-06-10T12:55:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	i suppose it depends on the license
2006-06-10T12:55:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 whatever works, if everyone uses java after they go open source, great.  its pretty mature etc.  but if it is eula bound and tied up, the community will still look to alternatives.
2006-06-10T12:56:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	yup
2006-06-10T12:57:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 that is perhaps the best thing about Ubuntu -- it opens your eyes to the hidden hurdles of tech.  like mp3 garbage and ipods, the java issue, etc.
2006-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 flash :)
2006-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	i'm old hat at that stuff, part of the reason i even got into linux was political
2006-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 yah but your average user is completely in the dark on it.  Ubuntu is raising the knowledge bar with their approach.  very very very important and damn cool.
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	yes it is
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	the bar is going to be raised further in the future, too
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	spikeb	troy_s	there is a project to make a welcome center for ubuntu, and that info will be in it
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	troy_s	spikeb	 awsome.
