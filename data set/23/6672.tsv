2007-05-15T14:27:00.000Z	clever		can ubuntu's kernal handle java files natively
2007-05-15T14:27:00.000Z	clever		so i can exec a java binary and the kernel run it
2007-05-15T14:27:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	no, you need to install java
2007-07-07T13:08:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	i know ive made them before
2007-07-07T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	yeah
2007-07-07T13:05:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	would i need to rebuild the kernel though? my initrd is 6mb
2007-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	Why do you need a boot floppy?
2007-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	the harddrive doesnt boot in the computer
2007-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	Why not?  Doesn't boot to harddrive?
2007-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	grub wont load from the drive
2007-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	is /boot on LVM?
2007-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	no
2007-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	the smartbootmanager cant see the harddrive to chainload grub
2007-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	you can make a grub boot floppy
2007-08-30T06:56:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	The changelog is probably the easiest location
2007-08-30T06:56:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	i'll check that once i find out which kernels to compare
2007-08-30T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	dpkg -S /path/to/file
2007-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	that mearly shows me the package name its in(faster then my other methods, but not what i wanted)
2007-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	what are you looking for then?
2007-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	which deb line from sources.list provides that package
2007-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	Oh.  You want apt-cache policy [package] 
2007-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	clever	dep vs deb.
2007-08-30T07:19:00.000Z	clever	Flannel	im trying ti mix and match sources.list's atm to get non 7.04 kernels into 7.04
