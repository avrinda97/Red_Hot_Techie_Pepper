2010-10-29T23:41:00.000Z	armenb		damnit. ubuntu is supressing my grub menu screen.
2010-10-29T23:41:00.000Z	armenb		how can I change my kernel command line upon boot?
2010-10-29T23:42:00.000Z	Barnabas	armenb	hit esc on boot up ?
2010-10-29T23:42:00.000Z	Barnabas		grub is not influenced by the gfx drv
2010-10-29T23:42:00.000Z	armenb	Barnabas	no luck whatsoever.
2010-10-29T23:42:00.000Z	armenb		i'm never getting a grub menu
2010-10-29T23:43:00.000Z	armenb		the exc key merely switches back and forth between an Ubuntu splash screen and a text syslog
2010-10-29T23:43:00.000Z	armenb		which shows that the kernel has already booted
2010-10-29T23:43:00.000Z	Barnabas	armenb	the kernel has not loaded in the grub menu
2010-10-29T23:44:00.000Z	armenb	Barnabas	exactly my point.
2010-10-29T23:44:00.000Z	armenb		how do I get to that grub menu?
2010-10-29T23:44:00.000Z	armenb		when i press esc frantically upon power-up, the first thing I see is ubuntu slash screen.
2010-10-29T23:44:00.000Z	Barnabas	armenb	have you tried simply to select another console?
2010-10-29T23:44:00.000Z	Barnabas		if the system boots
2010-10-29T23:45:00.000Z	Barnabas		ctrl+alt+f1 for instance
2010-10-29T23:45:00.000Z	armenb	Barnabas	that's where X comes in. the x server is broken and rendering my inputs useless.
2010-10-29T23:45:00.000Z	Barnabas	armenb	try a rescue disk
2010-10-29T23:46:00.000Z	Barnabas		or usb
2010-10-29T23:46:00.000Z	armenb	Barnabas	suck. stupid ubuntu. who thought it would be a good idea to get rid of the grub menu for ubuntu installs?!
2010-10-29T23:46:00.000Z	armenb		I don't have either as an option, unfortunately.
2010-10-29T23:46:00.000Z	Barnabas		its not away
2010-10-29T23:46:00.000Z	Barnabas		only on your system aparantley
2010-10-29T23:48:00.000Z	Barnabas	armenb	remember you only have 3 seconds during boot to enter the boot menu for grub
