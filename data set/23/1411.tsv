2010-09-06T15:17:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	revert for now, let them fix it, then update it later
2010-09-06T15:17:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	borrow a keyboard from a friend/neighbor when you have a chance
2010-09-06T15:18:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	you can try putting in a line 'pci=noacpi' and see fi that helps
2010-09-06T15:19:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	... your mouse doesn't work?
2010-09-06T15:20:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	ah, the problem is that several people have had this problem and no one has a fix
2010-09-06T15:21:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	lol I know how you feel but they dont' have every piece of hardware to test with in development
2010-09-06T15:22:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	it disables the routing of acpi information on the system bus
2010-09-06T15:22:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	Can't get into it, but sometimes it works magic
2010-09-06T15:25:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	bluetooth, tell me one of those keyboards is a wired usb
2010-09-06T15:26:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	ok, how about this, teh grub list should have an entry for each version kernel available on your system, just select the old one as the default by manually editing it
2010-09-06T15:29:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	nice
2010-09-06T15:30:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	better not to  lol
2010-09-06T15:33:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	oh you're completely foobared
2010-09-06T15:34:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	Narcotics and Jar-Jar Binks stickers
2010-09-06T15:35:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	we may be able to assume it wasn't the kernel update, maybe something else
2010-09-06T15:38:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	yea, you can use synaptic package manager and go File > History
2010-09-06T15:38:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	keyboard can do it
2010-09-07T01:54:00.000Z	Doyle	Baram2	How did you fix it?
