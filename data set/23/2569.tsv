2009-05-24T19:20:00.000Z	gartral		how do i restart the bluetooth services on my computer?
2009-05-24T19:22:00.000Z	gartral		infact, my keyboard works regardless of the bluetooth functionaity in ubuntu
2009-05-24T19:23:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	if your keyboard is bluetooth ... then this isn't possible -- the bluetooth adapter must be recognized, and the devices paired
2009-05-24T19:25:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	might be as Slart said, cause the adapter and KB were sold as a set, but the adapter reads Bus 002 Device 005: ID 04fc:0538 Sunplus Technology Co., Ltd
2009-05-24T19:25:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	who said that it's bluetooth? what you're describing is how 99% of proprietary RF keyboards are sold
2009-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	if it works out of the box, and there's no bluetooth pairing done -- then it's not bluetooth, it's proprietary rf
2009-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	doing a google search, that string came up as a Bluetooth adapter
2009-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	also, the adapter operates in the bluetooth part of the 2.4 ghz spectrum
2009-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	tgat spectrum is totally open, that doesn't mean anything
2009-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	show me where it says bluetooth
2009-05-24T19:28:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	ok, one sec
2009-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	I missread... now i fel stupid...
2009-05-24T19:31:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	don't feel stupid, just listen to me the next time I explain what the device is, and why it works out of the box
2009-05-24T19:31:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	it's a vuescape keyboard sold from inkscape
2009-05-24T19:32:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	the brand doesn't mean anything in this context
2009-05-24T19:34:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	ok, well seeing as the adapter works in the 2.4 ghz spectrum, is there any way to use it as a bluetooth adapter?
2009-05-24T19:35:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	no way ... you clearly don't understand what bluetooth is
2009-05-24T19:38:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	bluetooth adapters are very cheap, if you want one, buy one
2009-05-24T19:39:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	i have $0...
2009-05-24T19:39:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	then don't buy one :)
2009-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	and whats the point in having an adapter for a device structure i dont have clients for?
2009-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	giovani	gartral	you tell me -- I said IF YOU WANT ONE
2009-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	gartral	giovani	no reason to be rude about it..
