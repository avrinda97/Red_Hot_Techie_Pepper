2007-06-10T07:13:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	what is it?
2007-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	i've just installed a new LAN Card
2007-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	by the way i was using a ubuntu 5.04
2007-06-10T07:16:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	have you tried just booting up?
2007-06-10T07:16:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	i haven't yet....
2007-06-10T07:17:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	i'd try it.
2007-06-10T07:17:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	well can u pls help me figure it out if ubuntu 7.04 can support the PIII 500mhz, 128MB SDRAM, 8MB VGA, 15MB HD
2007-06-10T07:18:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	15MB?
2007-06-10T07:19:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	15MB Hard drive
2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	would not think you could run /any/ ubuntu flavour with that much space
2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	unless you meant GB
2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	ohhhhhhhhhhh jezzzzzzz man..... yeah....... its GB argh... sorry
2007-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	:)
2007-06-10T07:22:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	i'm confused... i dont know what version should i install.. because installing a new one would take a lot of time
2007-06-10T07:24:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	what do u think on my hardware? and what version on ubuntu wuold i use?
2007-06-10T07:24:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	not sure really.  i've never had to run a system that slow.  i''d go xubuntu myself just to play it safe.
2007-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	yes.  as default, ubuntu uses gnome, xubuntu uses xfce, which is more lightweight
2007-06-10T07:40:00.000Z	mIgUeL_sAn	orbin	how about some applications.. is there any application that xubuntu cannot run and only ubuntu can run?
2007-06-10T07:43:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	not sure if *everything*  can be. e.g. don't know how panel applets etc. would work, but yes, standalone apps will bring in the required gnome libraries if you install them in xubuntu with an apt tool
2007-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	orbin	mIgUeL_sAn	yw.  good luck.
