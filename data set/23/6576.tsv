2006-03-18T09:43:00.000Z	FarSe3r		I cant get my printer working ://///
2006-03-18T09:44:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	what kind of printer?
2006-03-18T09:44:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	hp laserjet
2006-03-18T09:45:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	which one?
2006-03-18T09:45:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	hp laserjet 1020
2006-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	tried just about everything... i think :/
2006-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	which I'm guessing was trying several different ones of the 1000 series?
2006-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	1020, 1022
2006-03-18T09:47:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	and you used the System > Administration > Printing to set it up?
2006-03-18T09:47:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	can u use ndiswrapper to use the windows driver?
2006-03-18T09:47:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	yes
2006-03-18T09:48:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	I thought ndiswrapper was strictly for wireless drivers
2006-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	when you ran the setup, did the system at least pick up the printer on the port?
2006-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	ok then it cant be it. i found a really neat guide on the net wich let you import inf files to use win drivers.. maybe some other
2006-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	Bus 004 Device 002: ID 03f0:2b17 Hewlett-Packard
2006-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	usb
2006-03-18T09:50:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	so the system obviously picked up the printer, but the driver is an issue, at least, that what it sounds like.
2006-03-18T09:51:00.000Z	FarSe3r	cdubya	yeah that is correct. i dont get any contact
2006-03-18T09:53:00.000Z	cdubya	FarSe3r	maybe something here?          http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/
