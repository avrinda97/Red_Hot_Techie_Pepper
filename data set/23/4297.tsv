2007-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	Yes, fsck
2012-03-09T01:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo blkid"?
2012-03-09T01:41:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/H2n5LnKU
2012-03-09T01:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	It's interesting that blkid only finds one raid member.
2012-03-09T01:42:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	disk utility sees the two as far as i know
2012-03-09T01:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	One of the devices is /dev/sda, what is the other?
2012-03-09T01:44:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	2 secs
2012-03-09T01:46:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	http://azcld.dyndns.info/disk-util.png
2012-03-09T01:46:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	get it?
2012-03-09T01:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	It's odd, because at the same time this disk utility is claiming that sdb is somehow part of an array, and yet /dev/sdb1 is a mountable partition in and of itself.
2012-03-09T01:53:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	yup... anything i can further do to diagnose it?
2012-03-09T01:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	Try "sudo parted -l". You could also try mounting /dev/sdb1 and see if it gets you what you want. Since there is obviously something I'm not understanding about this though I can't guarantee that attempting to mount /dev/sdb1 will be safe.
2012-03-09T01:56:00.000Z	wolfric	Jordan_U	Error: /dev/sda: unrecognised disk label
2012-03-09T01:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	That makes sense since /dev/sda is a member of a raid0 array. It's possible that /dev/sdb is the "first" member of the array, and so has the blocks containing the partition table.
2012-03-09T01:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wolfric	But that doesn't explain how /dev/sdb1 can appear to contain a valid ntfs filesystem as well.
