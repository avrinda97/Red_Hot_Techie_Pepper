2007-08-24T16:57:00.000Z	RJ_BR		please guys help me solve this problem. I cannot use anymore synaptic because it fires a message (E: Could not open file /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin - open (13 Permission denied))->
2007-08-24T16:57:00.000Z	RJ_BR		then I go to the archive usin shell
2007-08-24T16:58:00.000Z	RJ_BR		consider see the result: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34873/
2007-08-24T05:00:00.000Z	RJ_BR		I forgot to say
2007-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	RJ_BR		I am using edgy into usb flash drive with persistent feature
2007-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	RJ_BR		using it right now
2007-08-24T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Are you using the modified image or did they fix the persistence bug with Feisty?
2007-08-24T05:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Did a package manager crash recently?
2007-08-24T05:37:00.000Z	RJ_BR	Jordan_U	I used the synaptic package manager for 2 to 3 times before it started to complain... weird, and now I cant install more packages :-/
2007-08-24T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	If you are absolutely sure that there are no other applications open that use dpkg ( if you are not then restart ) then delete the lock file manually
2007-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Why are you trying to delete that file?
2007-08-24T06:10:00.000Z	RJ_BR	Jordan_U	because it might solve my problem with synaptic
2007-08-24T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	I seriously doubt it, are you still getting the same error about another package manager being open?
2007-08-24T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	That file should not be deleted, why do you think deleting it will help?
2007-08-24T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Are you still getting the same error about another package manager being open?

2007-08-24T06:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	What message?
2007-08-24T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Have you rebooted?
2007-08-24T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Have you rebooted?
2007-08-24T06:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	I think I have the command you need but you need to answer my questions so I can be sure it won't screw anything up
2007-08-24T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	Have you rebooted so that you are absolutely sure that all package managers have quit?
2007-08-24T06:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RJ_BR	If it still doesn't work after the reboot run "sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock"
