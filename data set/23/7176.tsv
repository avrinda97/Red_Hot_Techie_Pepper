2008-02-28T20:57:00.000Z	soundray	ting	listing by installed size takes some fairly advanced scripting. You could look at the archive sizes: 'cd /var/cache/apt/archives ; ls -srS'
2008-02-28T21:00:00.000Z	ting		thanks soundray
2008-02-28T21:00:00.000Z	ting		i am gonna check it
2008-02-28T21:01:00.000Z	soundray	ting	if you do want to go down the more advanced route, the file /var/lib/dpkg/status holds the raw information you need.
2008-02-28T21:02:00.000Z	ting	soundray	ummm thanks, do you know where i can put some request for the next version of ubuntu ?? I would like to ask if it is possible to add the size sorting for the next version of Synaptic Packages Manager

2008-02-28T21:06:00.000Z	soundray	ting	in Settings-Preferences-Columns and Fonts, make sure it displays the Installed Size. Then select All in the left part of the window and click on Size in the displayed list. Your window has to be large enough, so you can see the Size column
2008-02-28T21:07:00.000Z	ting	soundray	really ???
