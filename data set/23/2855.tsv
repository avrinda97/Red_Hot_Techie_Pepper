2010-10-13T20:23:00.000Z	Vinetou		which encryption is used if you choose to encript the home directory when you install Ubuntu 10.10 ??
2010-10-13T20:24:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	AES-256, I believe
2010-10-13T20:24:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	The same encryption the US government uses to encrypt sensitive data
2010-10-13T20:31:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	where can i check which encryption is used for encripted home directory?
2010-10-13T20:31:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	It's AES-256
2010-10-13T20:31:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	No, sorry, AES-128
2010-10-13T20:31:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	are you sure, where did you get that info?
2010-10-13T20:31:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	got a link that tells that?
2010-10-13T20:32:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	I checked my encrypted home dir and it says cipher is AES, key bytes is 16. 16 bytes is 128 bits, so it's AES-128
2010-10-13T20:34:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	is AES-128 the strongest cipher or is it AES-256?
2010-10-13T20:35:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	I think you can go as high as you want with the number, but most people stop at AES-256
2010-10-13T20:35:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	so AES-256 is stronger encryption than AES-128?
2010-10-13T20:36:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	Yes
2010-10-13T20:38:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	I have no idea. I've heard about the attack, but don't know the details
2010-10-13T20:39:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	why can you attack the stronger encriptions, i.e. AES-192 and AES-256, but you cannot attack the weaker AES-128  ?
2010-10-13T20:40:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	so is using EAS-128 better than AES-192 or AES-256then?
2010-10-13T20:40:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	That's interesting...
2010-10-13T20:40:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	Even with that, breaking the encryption is still infeasable though
2010-10-13T20:43:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	i would like to know why AES-128 is not affected by the related-key attack
2010-10-13T20:45:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	Well, for starters, these are two seperate attacks. One for 256 and one for 128
2010-10-13T20:47:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	It looks like because the block size of AES is only 128, you can get more information from multiple block from the cipher?
2010-10-13T20:47:00.000Z	undecim	Vinetou	Idk, I'm not a cryptographer, lol
2010-10-13T20:47:00.000Z	Vinetou	undecim	i asked in crypto
