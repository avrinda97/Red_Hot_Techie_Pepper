2008-03-11T16:04:00.000Z	xomp		Can someone help me install these wireless drivers before I up and install Vista to have a working wireless adapter? I run tired of old devices not working on Gutsy...
2008-03-11T16:04:00.000Z	xomp		I mean this laptop is years old and linux hasn't got a solution yet?
2008-03-11T16:05:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	whats your problem?
2008-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	I have a wireless adapter that requires orinoco drivers and it doesn't appear that anyone has been able to get them to work in Gutsy

2008-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	go to the archlinux wiki and read the part about wireless drivers
2008-03-11T16:07:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless#Drivers
2008-03-11T16:08:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	thanks, I'll give that a try first.
2008-03-11T16:09:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	archlinux is cutting edge and will have your driver i bet
2008-03-11T16:10:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	I can't believe that Gutsy doesn't have it to begin with. I mean this laptop is 5 years old at least.
2008-03-11T16:11:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	i don't think age is an issue... its repositories.
2008-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	this looks like I need some windows files to tie in with the linux ones :( I'm not sure how to understand this wiki article :/
2008-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	ndiswrapper?]
2008-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	so I need ndiswrapper then?
2008-03-11T16:13:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	if thats what the wiki says i suppose so
2008-03-11T16:13:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	ok, I guess I got lost because it's mentioning archlinux specific things first, but if you get down to brass tacks it does look like it's what I need.
2008-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	run this in the terminal:   uname 'r
2008-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	check if u have the latest kernel
2008-03-11T16:15:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	did that and I'm at a ">" prompt
2008-03-11T16:15:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	try it with the `
2008-03-11T16:16:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	ok, the recent one is  ..  .24 i think
2008-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	xomp	heymr	I just installed a grip of updates yesterday. I'm not privy to linux kernels and all. I couldn't build my own if my life depended on it lol
2008-03-11T16:24:00.000Z	heymr	xomp	ndiswrapper wraps around a windows driver
