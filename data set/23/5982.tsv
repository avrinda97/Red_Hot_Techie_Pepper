2006-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	Heretician		QUESTION: I am looking at the screen where I prepare my partitions (manually) although it isn't working out really well for me, I am wanting 1gb for the Media space and the rest (29.56) for /(root) -- It all seems to go well except during the installation it gets to about 2% and tells me that I need a media partition, although I have already added one.. It was at /media/sda3 im pretty sure
2006-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	Heretician		Is this correct
2006-07-23T05:56:00.000Z	Heretician		np

2006-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	Don't make a separate partition for /media
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	one for /media and one for / ?
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	it was going for /media/sda3
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	It's just all mountpoints, you're just wasting diskspace
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	How big should I make it?
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	Don't make a separate partition at all for /media
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	It lets you just make one? It told me it was required ;/
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	Trying it now though.
2006-07-23T06:00:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	It seems to be creating it itself lol
2006-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	"No mount point selected for Partition 3 Disc USB/SCSI/SATA 1 (Primary) [sda3] ."
2006-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	it is creating the extra 1gb itself
2006-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	That sounds like swapspace maybe?
2006-07-23T06:02:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	Yeah, that sorry.. What should I name it? /swap ?
2006-07-23T06:02:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	No, in the partition editor, just mark it as the type "Swap", swap space is kind of weird as it's not really a filesystem
2006-07-23T06:03:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	Primary Partition?
2006-07-23T06:03:00.000Z	bettsp	Heretician	Yeah... it might be easier if you just let Ubuntu set up partitions for you
2006-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	When I try that it uses the extra 1gb for / and the 29.56 for swap
2006-07-23T06:06:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	One is set as just "swap" (996 mb) and one is set as "/" (29.56) hopefully this works
2006-07-23T06:06:00.000Z	Heretician	bettsp	That look right?
