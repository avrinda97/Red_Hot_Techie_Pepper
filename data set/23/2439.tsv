2009-07-19T01:59:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	can you post a sample xorg.conf using the DRI driver?
2009-07-19T02:00:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	there is no DRI driver
2009-07-19T02:00:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	what am i confusing it with?  I have an ATI Mobility and the driver that is currently being used sucks, and I need to change it
2009-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	it was working great under 8.04
2009-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	exactly what card do you have?
2009-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	remind me of the comand to find out

2009-07-19T02:03:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	use the free ati driver
2009-07-19T02:03:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	I think that's what I am using, and it's really slow and laggy
2009-07-19T02:04:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	well, the card is slow when it comes to anything 3d
2009-07-19T02:05:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	I'm saying its slow just on the Gnome interface, and skippy playing youtube vids, let along 3d
2009-07-19T02:05:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	glxinfo
2009-07-19T02:06:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	sorry, you'll need to be more explicit
2009-07-19T02:06:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	it should say what driver it's trying to use
2009-07-19T02:14:00.000Z	Mion	skiwithpete	it should say somethign like (II) LoadModule: "vesa"  or "ati" or whatever
2009-07-19T02:15:00.000Z	skiwithpete	Mion	loadmodule: "Radeon"
