2009-05-13T13:49:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse		has anyone else gotten a bad KVM apt update?
2009-05-13T13:51:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse		bsd is a bit hard-core security
2009-05-13T13:53:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	quite a lot of questions today.
2009-05-13T13:54:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	: any regarding a bad KVM patch?
2009-05-13T13:54:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	no, no...
2009-05-13T13:56:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	do you have any idea how to convert .mdi files in something more accessible?
2009-05-13T13:57:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	: many, many options. if you're looking for 1:1 replacements for apps, look at osalt.com
2009-05-13T13:58:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	no, I just would like to open the file, and read the presentation. I don't know why this professor used that crappy file format instead of the normal .ppt
2009-05-13T13:59:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	: if it's a prez, then OpenOffice
2009-05-13T14:00:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	... I'll try to open it from OO.
2009-05-13T14:01:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	cross fingers... It's trying to import it.
2009-05-13T14:02:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	... looks like OO is crashing.
2009-05-13T14:03:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	... lol... just a bunch of nonsense chars
2009-05-13T14:06:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	oohh fuck.... you can't open *.mdi files under linux.
2009-05-13T14:07:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	you can open pretty much anything; just have to find the right app
2009-05-13T14:07:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	... and have the time for it. ;-) Thx.
2009-05-13T14:08:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	:  mdi from what app?
2009-05-13T14:09:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	:  if they insist on giving you files in some crappy windoze app, you can always run the win app inside wine
2009-05-13T14:09:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	... I think it was made with Office from microsoft. As far as I can see from uncle google.
2009-05-13T14:10:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	yeah. I'm not such an expert to install wine and all the other stuff in a reasonable amount of time. I really need a windows machine.
2009-05-13T14:10:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	 and someone willing/able to convert that in some normal format.
2009-05-13T14:11:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	matitaccia	: no hassles. go to apps, add/remove, pick wine. once installis finished, install the file-reading app per usual & off u go!
2009-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	matitaccia	AnnonyMouse	kk... could give it a try. Thanks.
