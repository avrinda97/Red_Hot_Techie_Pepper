2006-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_		im trying to install a minolta 2300w laser, and driver recog seems fine throughout installation, 'till i click apply. the installer closes without adding the printer and outputs this to terminal -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36159/ - any ideas?
2006-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	snype	then do the same for the transpiracy option, or what ever you find.
2006-12-10T06:15:00.000Z	snype	nolimitsoya_	thats the point there is no transparency
