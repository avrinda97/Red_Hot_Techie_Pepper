2007-06-19T11:17:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	- in grub console try root (hd0,0)   then setup(hd0)
2007-06-19T11:18:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	that command is suppose to .... ?
2007-06-19T11:18:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	: set grub for the first hard drive, first partition (if that's whaere your /boot is)
2007-06-19T11:19:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	 may i explain you my situation in private ? it might be easier ..
2007-06-19T11:22:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	as u wish : FIRST OF ALL : bios setup :: first HD 400gig ( installed ubuntu on it ) second HD 160gig ( windows on it ) and used to be first HD at first try on installing ubuntu it installed GRUB on my 160gig hardrive ( wich is the windows one ) but ive installed ubuntu on my 400gig, once the installation was done it coudlnt boot anymore, saying grub error 22. then i installed it again, and used another dev as grub install path, it would boot
2007-06-19T11:25:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	- does your /boot/grub/menu.lst tell to boot ubuntu as hda1 ?
2007-06-19T11:25:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	- go into the live cd - terminal - grub - root (hd0,0) - setup (hd0)     try that
2007-06-19T11:26:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	i cant do it if im on ubuntu ? i have absolutly to run live cd ?
2007-06-19T11:26:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	: oh, i thought you cant get to your ubuntu
2007-06-19T11:27:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	- ok then you will have to edit your /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst to tell it the changes
2007-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	sorry to ask, but could you please explain me how ?
2007-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	: just open those in a text editor - it should be self explanatory
2007-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	: and you have to use sudo to edit them
2007-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	hum .. fstab mean nothing to me :/ . im not good enought with the /dev method :/
2007-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	ill do something easier.. just a sec
2007-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	: fstab tells your mount points... so for / you should change it to /dev/hdb1
2007-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	look at that, maybe it will give you more detail about the situation , its a complete menu.lst fstab and result of fdisk -l
2007-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	gh0stid	look at what
2007-06-19T11:46:00.000Z	gh0stid	xTaJMoX	as u wish : FIRST OF ALL : bios setup :: first HD 400gig ( installed ubuntu on it ) second HD 160gig ( windows on it ) and used to be first HD at first try on installing ubuntu it installed GRUB on my 160gig hardrive ( wich is the windows one ) but ive installed ubuntu on my 400gig, once the installation was done it coudlnt boot anymore, saying grub error 22. then i installed it again, and used another dev as grub install path, it would boot
