2009-08-29T06:37:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	what kind of wifi card you have? - just curious
2009-08-29T06:37:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	atheros AR9285
2009-08-29T06:40:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	did you say you installed 9.04?
2009-08-29T06:43:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	did you say you installed 9.04 and tried the sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-jaunty?
2009-08-29T06:44:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	no i was in the process of trying that when the live image errored out at boot-time
2009-08-29T06:45:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	what kind of error?
2009-08-29T06:45:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	mnaines: one sec, trying the boot again (have to re-dd the image..)
2009-08-29T06:49:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	+1 for unetbootin!
2009-08-29T06:55:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	did you USB key boot on any other machines?
2009-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	i haven't tried booting from that image on any other machines
2009-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	that's a good idea though
2009-08-29T06:59:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	how did you make the USB key you were trying to boot from?
2009-08-29T07:00:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	that one is an "asdf.img", which apparently is a directly-dd-to-a-usb-key-able img
2009-08-29T07:00:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	whereas the desktop one is an .iso
2009-08-29T07:01:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	heh
2009-08-29T07:01:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	s/asdf.img/ubuntu-9.04-netbook-remix-i386.img/
2009-08-29T07:02:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	how do you prepare the USB for that?
2009-08-29T07:03:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	sudo dd if=ubuntu-9.04-netbook-remix-i386.img of=/dev/sdb
2009-08-29T07:17:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	how is it going?
2009-08-29T07:19:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	i'm sidetracked with something else for a bit, but my plan is to get the desktop .iso (x86_64, since this little laptop has an athlon64) onto a usbkey bootably (a word?;), and see if i can get ubuntu installed that way. if that works i'm going to try the linux-backports-modules-jaunty pkg.
2009-08-29T07:20:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	i'll report back with the outcome, however it goes
2009-08-29T07:20:00.000Z	mdg	mmorrow	good luck - looking forward to your report :)
2009-08-29T07:21:00.000Z	mmorrow	mdg	thanks! :)
