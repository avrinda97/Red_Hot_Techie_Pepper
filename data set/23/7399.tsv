2005-08-11T05:31:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	I think you might want to put FollowSymLinks in the appropriate Options line of your apache config file (maybe /etc/apache2/apache2.conf , maybe somewhere in /etc/apache2/sites-available)
2005-08-11T05:32:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	it is working fine with symlinks that does not link to my home dir  ....
2005-08-11T05:34:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	how do i do that ?
2005-08-11T05:36:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	maybe a permissions problem ?  what is your documentroot and the source and destination of your symlink ?
2005-08-11T05:36:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	i`m trying to symlink a folder in my /home/ to /var/www
2005-08-11T05:40:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	sudo ln -s /home/deviant/Download/dc++/felicitari/ /var/www/
2005-08-11T05:40:00.000Z	deviant		 should do the job. but it doesen`t
2005-08-11T05:41:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	right.  it works for me here, although I own /var/www.
2005-08-11T05:41:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	hmm. what do you mean by "own". i`m using sudo when i`m creating the symlinks
2005-08-11T05:43:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	each time i access my apache server, i get this error in error.log: [Sat Aug 06 02:50:27 2005]  [error]  [client 195.95.255.75]  File does not exist: /var/www/favicon.ico
2005-08-11T05:43:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	I recursively chowned /var/www and its contents to me
2005-08-11T05:44:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	you think that will do ?
2005-08-11T05:45:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	well, I did that so it would be convenient to edit files in /var/www, not to solve your symlink problem
2005-08-11T05:45:00.000Z	deviant		ermm, this is starting to become anoing ..
2005-08-11T05:45:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	i see.
2005-08-11T05:46:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	ok, if i try to copy the files in /var/www , the server shows them to me, but i can`t open them. permision denied ..
2005-08-11T05:49:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	I sorry, I don't understand what you mean.  could you explain in more detail ?
2005-08-11T05:51:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	ok. so i`ve copyed the files (some .jpeg`s) from /home/user/blablabla to /var/www/felicitari ok? and now i can see the files, but i can not open them. ([error]  [client 195.95.255.75]  Symbolic link not allowed: /var/www/felicitari
2005-08-11T05:51:00.000Z	deviant		)
2005-08-11T05:58:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	is it world readable ?
2005-08-11T05:59:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	nop. .jpeg`s
2005-08-11T05:59:00.000Z	deviant	wibble	nevermind, i`ve just erased those files. this thig has pissed me off :P 10x anyway :)
2005-08-11T06:04:00.000Z	wibble	deviant	I mean the permissions -- if you do ls-hal on the dir and the link and its contents, do they show "r" at the start ?
