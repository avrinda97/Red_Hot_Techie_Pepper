2010-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	TraumaPony		What DGM sid
2010-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	TraumaPony		said
2010-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	TraumaPony		virtualbox.org
2010-08-07T17:36:00.000Z	TraumaPony	DGM	Even though ubuntu is already booting from grub?
2010-08-07T17:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	TraumaPony	DGM: well another disk is the same as having an available partition so can do.  the install of ubuntu detects the windows and asks if you want to dual boot
2010-08-07T17:36:00.000Z	TraumaPony		Yeah, sacarlson, I already have both ubuntu and windows installed
2010-08-07T17:37:00.000Z	TraumaPony		Exactly
2010-08-07T17:37:00.000Z	TraumaPony		How would one instal lilo now?
2010-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	TraumaPony	DGM so you want to virtuabox to autostart in windows or ubuntu.  is that what you want?
2010-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	TraumaPony		I'd have to do it from the real boot, correct?
2010-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	TraumaPony		no sacarlson
2010-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	TraumaPony		I have windows + grub on my primary harddrive
2010-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	TraumaPony		Ubuntu on my secondary
2010-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	TraumaPony		Interestingly, there is heaps of documentation for doing it the other way around
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	TraumaPony	DGM oh that would be cool but I think the file structure of virtualbox is different but maybe you could or at least convert what was there into it.
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	TraumaPony		wat
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	TraumaPony		No
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	TraumaPony		I'm not creating a virtual machine
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	TraumaPony		I'm using the actual disk
2010-08-07T17:43:00.000Z	TraumaPony	DGM	VirtualBox also has an option of embedding a custom MBR in the disk access file. Would that be an alternative solution?
2010-08-07T17:43:00.000Z	TraumaPony		Or would I still need grub/lilo?
2010-08-07T17:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	TraumaPony	DGM:  well I think I may be way off but I have done a netboot or pxe_boot with virtualbox that used the partition and files direct from the host that it was runing on.  Am I close?
