2007-03-13T12:06:00.000Z	wolferine		anyone use gdesklets?
2007-03-13T12:07:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 I do , what can I help you with ?
2007-03-13T12:07:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 I have no network drives but I would assume you need to give the desklet the proper path
2007-03-13T12:08:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 your network drives have mount points in ubuntu ?  that path
2007-03-13T12:10:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	if you can access your network drive from nautilus,  use the path provided there to specify in the desklet configuration
2007-03-13T12:11:00.000Z	wolferine	Pelo	I tried the most obvious things, im saying its a bit odd
2007-08-20T15:03:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	  in the termial  type   sudo pppoeconf  and follow the instructions
2007-08-20T15:06:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 who's your isp ?
2007-08-20T15:07:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	explain to me how (physicaly) your computer is connectdd to the internet
2007-08-31T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	hardly
2007-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 on get-deb.com I think
2007-10-08T14:28:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	on the 18
2007-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 no it's on the 18,   your update manager will tell you automaticaly when it is out
2007-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	wolferine	Pelo	yeah, I tried to do that when Feisty was released, I ended up just grabbing the ISOs
2007-10-08T14:30:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 that's not what I meant,  the update manager will offer and upgrade when  the new release is available,  so you will know it is officialy out ,and can dl the iso
2007-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	that's what I do each time,  i dl the dvd just in case as a backup, and then try the upgrade ,  the upgrade has never worked for me so far
2007-10-08T14:33:00.000Z	wolferine	Pelo	especially that day, the upgrade "method" doesnt work that well :)
2007-10-08T14:33:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 I usualy wait a couple of weeks ,  you can also upgrade from the alternate isntall cd or from the dvd
2007-10-08T14:34:00.000Z	wolferine	Pelo	your obviously too patient then :)
2007-10-08T14:34:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	not realy it jsut wait for other ppl to figure out how to fix the weird stuff before I try it
2007-10-08T14:35:00.000Z	wolferine	Pelo	once a release is out, I find there isnt that much weird stuff anymore :)
2007-10-08T14:35:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 i don'T mean bugs , I just mean config stuff
2007-10-08T14:36:00.000Z	Pelo	wolferine	 by all means
