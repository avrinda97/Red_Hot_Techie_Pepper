2010-03-01T19:44:00.000Z	Kangarooo		im now installing clean install 9.10 updating and a window pops up Configuring grub-pc what would you like to do about grub? keep the local version currently installed ? install the package maintainer's version?
2010-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	What's on your computer now?
2010-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	Kangarooo		xubuntu
2010-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	Are you replacing it, or installing ubuntu in another partition?
2010-03-01T19:46:00.000Z	Kangarooo		but that doesnt change anything. question is about grub. its clean install and just downloaded 146 mb of updates and updates are installing
2010-03-01T19:46:00.000Z	Kangarooo		im installing xubuntu 9.10 on sda and sdb has windows
2010-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	OK, you're confusing me.  You said you already have xubuntu on your computer.
2010-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	Kangarooo		yes i put xubuntu 3h ago and put updates
2010-03-01T19:48:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	So are you now trying to do a clean install over the existing install, or installing it in a different partition?
2010-03-01T19:48:00.000Z	Kangarooo		i installed xubuntu on sdb. before installing i deleted whole partition
2010-03-01T19:49:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	I'm asking a straightforward question and you're not answering it.
2010-03-01T19:49:00.000Z	Kangarooo		so its clean install
2010-03-01T19:50:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	OK, install the package maintainer's version
2010-03-01T19:51:00.000Z	Kangarooo		ok thx dj_segfault1. and is theres some situation when i should choose other? how to know that? maybe maintainers version is always better since its newer?
2010-03-01T19:52:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	Does the window mention menu.lst?
2010-03-01T19:52:00.000Z	Kangarooo	dj_segfault1	no.
2010-03-01T19:53:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	That doesn't make sense.  Can you repost the exact message?  If you are installing in a clean partition, there's no installed version to conflict with.
2010-03-01T19:54:00.000Z	Kangarooo	dj_segfault1	its asking about grub-pc
2010-03-01T19:55:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	I'm sorry I missed that.  Never heard of it before.
2010-03-01T20:02:00.000Z	Kangarooo	dj_segfault1	!grub2
2010-03-01T20:02:00.000Z	Kangarooo		!grub
2010-03-01T20:05:00.000Z	dj_segfault1	Kangarooo	I know what grub2 is, but what is grub-pc?
2010-03-01T20:08:00.000Z	Kangarooo	dj_segfault1	grub2 package name is grub-pc
