2005-01-30T14:02:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	The filename is a different matter. ALL package filename have underscores.
2005-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	Not, normally.
2005-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	if you want specific versions, you're better off compiling statically.
2005-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	cafuego	you aren't answering me.
2005-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	It's a yes/no question, you just don't like the answer ;-)

2005-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	And lo behold, I told you about LD_PRELOAD
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	cafuego	is a bot right?
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	if you preload the lib from /usr/local/lib and then run jackctl...
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	cafuego	you aren't answering any question i'm asking whatsoever.
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	cafuego	you sound like a bot.
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego	BROKEN_LADDER	Or ignore and troll me.. up to you.
