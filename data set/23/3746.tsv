2008-02-01T12:06:00.000Z	Nyle		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/54301/ <-- this is my dmesg|grep ata .  Sometimes while using my system, my compter freezes up for like half a minute to a minute and then starts working ok.  I have recently started to see some of these messages while booting up that were not there before regarding ata.  Could someone please look and possibly help me figure out if it is my disk that is going bad
2008-02-01T12:07:00.000Z	Nyle		Thank you very much
2008-02-01T12:08:00.000Z	Nyle		can I get some help with my problem?
2008-02-01T12:09:00.000Z	Nyle		maybe this is better suiited  for #ubuntu-offtopic

2008-02-01T12:12:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	quit spamming
2008-02-01T12:12:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	i'm not clicking that link
2008-02-01T12:14:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	fdisk
2008-02-01T12:14:00.000Z	Nyle	gmcastil	fdisk?
2008-02-01T12:14:00.000Z	Nyle	gmcastil	please don't try to help me.
2008-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	Nyle	gmcastil	stated that he has been using ubuntu for 1 day.  I am asking problem on my ata errors, and about some tools to check my hdd health, and he is telling me to use fdisk.  I simply requested that he try not help me.
2008-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	well....using ubuntu for 1 day....using linux?  ....longer than you
2008-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	here...hold on, i'll go google your error for you
2008-02-01T12:17:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	yup...google has a whole bunch of crap on it that you might need
2008-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	Nyle	gmcastil	please do not address me any more.  You are only being sarcastic and not helpful.
2008-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	in all seriousness, what I would do is try to build a kernel
2008-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	Nyle	gmcastil	why are you maliciously giving ill advice?
2008-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	i'm not
2008-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	the I/O during a kernel build is pretty intense...if there's a problem with your hard drive, that'll show you
2008-02-01T12:19:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	or, if you want a windows solution, scandisk works really well
2008-02-01T12:19:00.000Z	gmcastil	Nyle	speeddisk, not scandisk
