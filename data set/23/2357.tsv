2009-05-10T12:44:00.000Z	joemac		Any grub experts in here?
2009-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	hm. this problem sounds fun.
2009-05-10T12:45:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	Depending on the problem, I'll take a stab at it.
2009-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	cheers, I have been for a while, I cant boot without editing my grub from ro quiet splash to all_generic_ide
2009-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	Do you need ro quiet splash? Like absolutely have to have it?
2009-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	Slart: ro quiet splash doesn't work and I have no interest in it. I have had to edit it out with all_generic_ide, but I won't boot of the first enrty(default) and I have to go to the 3rd one on the list to boot
2009-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	This sounds like a problem with your GRUB configuration file, care to pastebin it or something?
2009-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	http://pastebin.ca/index.php
2009-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	wrong link? ;) or was that a self link?
2009-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	this is after i have changed the 1st and 3rd entys
2009-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	sorry http://pastebin.ca/1418076
2009-05-10T12:50:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	Why so many entries?
2009-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	I have no idea. I have had it since dapper, andhave always had issues with it, all sata Hdds and funny MOBOs
2009-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	So the top entry wont start but the third will?
2009-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	If thats the case I see the problem
2009-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	yes
2009-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	look at the "Kernel" line for the third entry with the first entry.
2009-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	your kernel line is wrong
2009-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	I'd rather you do it my way but if you want to do that i can help you :)
2009-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	joemac	roadmap	 right, I am with ya
2009-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	top of your /boo/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	you will see an entry that says: default          0
2009-05-10T12:55:00.000Z	roadmap	joemac	just make it 2 and itll auto select the third option at startup
