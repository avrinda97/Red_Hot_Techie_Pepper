2005-01-27T13:51:00.000Z	brian_		how much of a performance increase can i expect with switching from a 386 imaage to a 686?
2005-01-27T13:51:00.000Z	brian_		ok anyways i want the latest kernel so how would i go about installing it with synaptic
2005-01-27T13:52:00.000Z	brian_		install the newer one then uninstalll old one?
2005-01-27T13:52:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	install linux-686
2005-01-27T13:52:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	then reboot
2005-01-27T13:54:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	no, you don't _need_ it unless you need binary-only modules provided by linux-restricted-modules-foo
2005-01-27T14:36:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	yes.
2005-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	main, I answered above :)
2005-07-03T09:49:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	what sound card?
2005-07-03T09:50:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	which sblive do you have?
2005-07-03T09:50:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	not the 7.1 nor the 24-bit, correct?
2005-07-03T09:50:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	please make sure
2005-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	cat /proc/asound/modules
2005-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	heh, you have three sound devices
2005-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	which do you want to use?
2005-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	then do this: echo "options snd-usb-audio index=-2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base && echo "options snd-emu10k1 index=-2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2005-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	then you can: sudo invoke-rc.d alsa force-reload
2005-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	you rebooted with the usb webcam plugged in, probably, and it grabbed the first 'slot'
2005-07-03T09:57:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	then just reboot
2005-07-03T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	paste the output from amixer onto pastebin.ca
2006-03-12T13:43:00.000Z	crimsun	brian_	single user (telinit 1) has nothing to do with what you want. You just want: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2006-03-12T13:43:00.000Z	brian_	crimsun	thanks
