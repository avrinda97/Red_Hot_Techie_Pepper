2008-04-06T04:42:00.000Z	Waterloo		uh oh - what does [260.831682] Buffer I/O error on device fd0 mean?
2008-04-06T04:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	just taking a guess here but sounds like a problem with your floppy drive.. if you don't use it disable it in the bios
2008-04-06T04:48:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	well im trying something interesting here.  This laptop i'm trying to install ubuntu onto has a busted screen, but can port out to my other monitor.  Is there any way I can trick the laptop/ubuntu to this that the auxilary monitor is the primary?
2008-04-06T04:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	maybe in bios or boot from the live cd and then use your laptops key combination to shift output to the external..
2008-04-06T04:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	Hardy Heron.. or 8.04 LTS
2008-04-06T04:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	Hardy (name of bird)
2008-04-06T04:59:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	na im going to call it hardy hadron
2008-04-06T05:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	if you have another computer you could MAYBE ssh into it and reconfigure for dual monitors..
2008-04-06T05:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	ssh is a way of connecting to another computer using the terminal.. on a windows machine the default that most people use is putty.. sorry I can't help configure it..
2008-04-06T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	for what?
2008-04-06T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	ah.. for a fresh install.. root or / as it is known should be 10-12 gigs.... /swap=1gig max .. /home the rest of the drive.
2008-04-06T05:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	what emma is asking is what kind of video card do you have?
2008-04-06T05:10:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	I dont know.  This laptop was given to me
2008-04-06T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	from the terminal you can usually find out by typing lspci which lists all devices connected to the pci buss.
2008-04-06T05:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	you can do that.. just make room and be prepared to reinstall grub.. it get's wiped out.. on the other hand if you're not going to run any 3d games,, use VMWare server and put it there.. that avoids dual boot.
2008-04-06T05:25:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	what is grub?  and this is the first i've heard of a VMware server
2008-04-06T05:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	you probably don't see grub because there is not other os on the system.. it's a boot manager and lets you choose between different os installs. VMware server loads in Ubuntu and allows you to install windows "in a window" so you can run windows like any other program but totally isolated (virus protection).
2008-04-06T05:27:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	what is the range on programs that can run in a VMware window? no 3d games you say huh?
2008-04-06T05:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	yep.. no 3d games, the vid driver is generic and won't do glx.. but pretty much everything else.. I use it all the time. how much ram do you have?
2008-04-06T05:29:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	2 gigs
2008-04-06T05:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	your fine with that.. that's what I have.
2008-04-06T05:30:00.000Z	Waterloo	Scunizi	wouldn't I have to reformat a part of my drive back into NTFS?
2008-04-06T05:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	Waterloo	nope.. VMWare uses files to make windows think that it is in a normal drive partition.. so if you wanted to get rid of it.. you just delete the files and it's GONE.  It will also let you install other OS's to try out
