2012-09-26T04:41:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	maybe running xlinpack inside a VM is not a good idea :/
2012-11-11T06:15:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	/etc/network/interfaces?
2012-11-11T06:15:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	do you happen to know what is the syntax to use?
2012-11-11T06:16:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	i've never messed with stuff at that low a level
2012-11-12T01:23:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	if you need to sync then sync.
2012-11-20T04:15:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	thats seems perfectly reasonable if that is your concern
2012-11-20T04:16:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	having three VM's with EXT4, yes it does. Can i disable it w/out having to use EXT2 ?
2012-11-20T04:16:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	the distinction between ext2/3/4 is not a bright line.
2012-11-20T04:17:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	its perfectly valid to say ext4-journalling is ext3-journaling+extents or ext2+extents
2012-11-20T04:17:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	to focus only on the high level features
2012-11-20T04:17:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	however if i keep using EXT4 i would still have the beneficts of SSD compatibility, such as trim. So can i just get rid of journalling w/out too many drawbacks?
2012-11-20T04:18:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	if you disable the journal then you are disabling journaling
2012-11-20T04:19:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	is it something that i write on /etc/fstab, right?
2012-11-20T04:19:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	etunefs
2012-11-20T04:20:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	since you certainly are more wise than me, if having too many SSD write rates concerns me, would it be a good idea to disable it?
2012-11-20T04:22:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	if that is your concern then that is your concern. i cant say whether or not that is a good idea. that depends on how stable your system is and how much you value the security of the journal
2012-11-20T04:23:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	yeah, i think that tomorrow at work i can spend few time to understand exactly how journalling works. Thanks for your help dude :)
2012-11-20T04:24:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	personally i wouldn't disable journalling.
2012-11-20T04:25:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	if your SSD is any good it should notice the journal blocks are hot and do a good job balancing those writes across the free blocks, if its a poor firmware is going to wear unevenly anyways
2012-11-20T04:27:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	yeah, that's exaclty what i'm afraid of. I don't want the same sector to be written over and over all day when the system is idling. Iostat shows like 10 GB in a week on the SSD and i'm only writing to the HDD drive.
2012-11-20T04:29:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	i view any SSD i purchase for the next 5 years as a temporary performance booster and have no faith it will work. if it manages to save data across a boot its a miracle.
2012-11-20T04:30:00.000Z	VlanX	escott	well, isn't that a little too pessimistic?
2012-11-20T04:30:00.000Z	escott	VlanX	it also means i get a present every day that my computer boots
