2008-02-13T08:26:00.000Z	djezer		Anyone know how to fix automount (or mount a camera)?
2008-02-13T08:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	Did you check the supported hardware page?
2008-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	it worked fine last week... it worked for years
2008-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	now the camera or my usb drive don't automount
2008-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	Have you used or installed things from outside repos?
2008-02-13T08:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	Hopefully you have never used automatix or envy?
2008-02-13T08:28:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	not automatix on this machine, envy I don't know
2008-02-13T08:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	What about the rest
2008-02-13T08:29:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	what rest?
2008-02-13T08:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	Installing from outside repos
2008-02-13T08:30:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	the last thing I tried to install was iceweasel from deb repo
2008-02-13T08:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	What else since you last had the cam working
2008-02-13T08:32:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	the cam has always worked, I installed everything since the cam worked :P I don't know of any other package that isn't standard
2008-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	Your cam was working, so it has to be something that was changed , upgraded or installed.  You didnt answer earlier so I doubt you will find a fix.
2008-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I don't know what to answer
2008-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I don't know of anything i installed that might of broken the automount
2008-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I'm trying to answer with tthe best of my ability
2008-02-13T08:44:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I'm UNAWARE of anything that could have broken the automount!
2008-02-13T08:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	I understand that you are unaware of anything, but since it did work and now dosent, it will take some work on your part.  I assume you had no form of backup to revert to
2008-02-13T08:46:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	how about simply mounting???? I mounted my usb hard drive, but I don't know how to do it for my camera
2008-02-13T08:47:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not sure what kind of work besides reinstalling the whole system
2008-02-13T08:48:00.000Z	djezer	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not a programmer
2008-02-13T08:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	djezer	I dont have the time to help with that, but start with lsusb in cli and see if it still sees the camera
