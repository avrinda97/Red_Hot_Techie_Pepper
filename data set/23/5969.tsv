2009-03-18T17:04:00.000Z	limboto		in my synaptic manager : gnash, gnash-common, mozilla-plugin-nash
2009-03-18T17:05:00.000Z	limboto		and adobe flashplugin
2009-03-18T17:05:00.000Z	limboto		all above installed
2009-03-18T17:07:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	use adobe-flashplugin as the other is crashy as all hell
2009-03-18T17:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	go to "System > Administration > Software Sources" then go to 3rd party tab and enable/tick the partners repository.. once dont quit software sources and reload your package list.. then do "sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin"
2009-03-18T17:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	also remove any other flash installs such as gnash
2009-03-18T17:10:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	as I said already
2009-03-18T17:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	also close your browser as it obviously is not going to work if you leave it open the whole time while installing
2009-03-18T17:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	are you doing as I said?
2009-03-18T17:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	well?
2009-03-18T17:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	did you even do what I said
2009-03-18T17:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	?
2009-03-18T17:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	well?
2009-03-18T17:18:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	it is as it is.. unless you want to reverse engineer flash to find out I suggest you drop it :)
2009-03-18T17:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	and you removed gnash and flashplugin-nonfree
2009-03-18T17:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	hmm
2009-03-18T17:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	are you using 32 bit or 64 bit
2009-03-18T17:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	really.. hmm.. are you using 8.10 64 bit or 32 bit?
2009-03-18T17:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	which version of ubuntu and is it 64 or 32 bit?
2009-03-18T17:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	ah "uname -r" in a terminal
2009-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	and you are using firefox?
2009-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	could you open up synaptic package manager and search for "flash" and tell me what is installed
2009-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	limboto	could you stop firing that trigger please :)
