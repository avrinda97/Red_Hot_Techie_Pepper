2011-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	maybe it'll work in Cedega or Crossover office if you have the brass :)
2011-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	i'll check em out thanks :)
2011-02-19T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	only if you have a full account :(
2011-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	yep but its worth the cash
2011-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	true, looking at the paid account soon (not premium though). I stil use it in wine for free
2011-02-19T06:53:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	yeah if you run it on wine you get more, the actual linux verison is missing some minor detail
2011-02-19T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	really, whats lacking?
2011-02-19T06:55:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	offline files & full support :( the developers love linux so made a version for themselfs whilst coding so they released an unsupported version
2011-02-19T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	thats cool, I have no offline data :)
2011-02-19T07:03:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	great no excuses then hehe :)
2011-02-19T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	booya
2011-02-19T07:03:00.000Z	Ben__437	ActionParsnip	casha
2011-02-19T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ben__437	the projects contribute to multiple distros, so its all good
