2009-10-28T22:07:00.000Z	Lain_13		hi there, I have a problem with reinstallation of xserver-xorg-core and some other xorg packages
2009-10-28T22:08:00.000Z	Lain_13		when I mark them to reinstall synaptic tells me what he can't download these packages
2009-10-28T22:09:00.000Z	Lain_13		so, maybe someone here know how to reinstall xorg?
2009-10-28T22:09:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 what problem are you having in particular?
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	Lain_13		I updated xorg to edgers version from launchpad
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 oops
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	Lain_13		and now my mouse pointer works strange
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 I did that once.  Bad things happened to me. :)
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	Lain_13		now I want to roll it back
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 Do you still have access to the desktop, Synaptec, etc?
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	Lain_13		yep
2009-10-28T22:10:00.000Z	Lain_13		everything ok
2009-10-28T22:11:00.000Z	Lain_13		except problems with mouse
2009-10-28T22:11:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 Well, if you go to your etc/apt/sources.lst (or Software Sources in the Admin menu) and remove the PPA,
2009-10-28T22:11:00.000Z	Lain_13		already removed
2009-10-28T22:11:00.000Z	abb		you should be able to then go into Synaptec and install an older version of Xorg as needed.  (See the "additional info" at the bottom, there is a "which version to install?" section)
2009-10-28T22:12:00.000Z	abb		oops, the above was for Lain_13
2009-10-28T22:12:00.000Z	Lain_13	abb	I reinstalled part of xorg using synaptic
2009-10-28T22:12:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	 and...?
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	Lain_13	abb	but part of xort still not reinstalled and synaptic can't reinstall it
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	Lain_13	abb	it telling me what don't know where to download these packages
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	abb	Lain_13	hmm.  Ask your question again and let someone smarter than me take a whack at it.
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	Lain_13	abb	it's xserver-xorg-core and some other
