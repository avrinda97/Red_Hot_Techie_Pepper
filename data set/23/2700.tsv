2011-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	Can you elaborate.
2011-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	Same as sshd with X and root password enabled, Ubuntu != centos
2011-05-14T12:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	I do not undersgtand your answer well. I do not know how X and sshd relate.
2011-05-14T12:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	Why do you say then: "Same as sshd with X and root password enabled"?
2011-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	That it is habit to at least skim configuratio of service before running it...
2011-05-14T12:46:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	Default != Most sequre.
2011-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	Thank you for commenting.

2011-06-16T11:33:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	ccsm, and look through plugins
2011-06-16T11:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	As I have said: "Compiz is switched off."
2011-06-23T15:03:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	sudo vim /etc/default/grub
2011-06-23T15:03:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	and: sudo update-grub
2011-06-23T15:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	 The file grub.cfg is headlined: "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE".

2011-07-07T08:41:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	screen -dr ???
2011-07-07T08:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	I put here a question. I expected here an answer and no question.
2011-07-07T08:43:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	second idea is, your server rebooted, uptime.
2011-07-07T08:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	Yes, my server rebooted.
2011-07-07T08:45:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	Life....
2011-09-17T07:43:00.000Z	qin	bullgard4	I think it is equivalent to: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-09-17T07:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	qin	Yes, this makes sense to me. --  Thank you very much for your help.
