2012-09-10T17:24:00.000Z	hatman		Hello
2012-09-10T17:24:00.000Z	hatman		My audio fails
2012-09-10T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-09-10T17:25:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	sure
2012-09-10T17:28:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	http://temporary.paste.to/MTEyNTc2NQ==
2012-09-10T17:29:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	This makes no sense! My audio worked fine yesterday
2012-09-10T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa; sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*     wait 10 seconds and reboot
2012-09-10T17:30:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	ack
2012-09-10T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	what?
2012-09-10T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	why the ack?
2012-09-10T17:32:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	lol dunno I thought I would say "ok"
2012-09-10T17:35:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	Didn't work!
2012-09-10T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	zelluz they should rerun and make only one
2012-09-10T17:38:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	What?
2012-09-10T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	the killing of pulseaudio then deleting the ~/.pulse* folders will give default settings. If you run:  alsamixer   are all levels cranked and unmuted?
2012-09-10T17:45:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	How do I stop pulse and how do I delete its folder by command?
2012-09-10T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*    run it as one command
2012-09-10T17:47:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	What should I do next? Audio seems disabled
2012-09-10T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	pulseaudio will restart and make the file and folder again
2012-09-10T17:50:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	So system reboot?
2012-09-10T18:21:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	My sound still doesn't work, still not recognised. Help plz?
2012-09-10T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hatman	my sound troubleshooting ability is low, maybe others can advise
2012-09-10T18:24:00.000Z	hatman	ActionParsnip	Thanks
