2011-02-12T02:50:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	What two OS'es do you have?
2011-02-12T02:50:00.000Z	peayness		win7 64 ubuntu 64
2011-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	peayness		the latest
2011-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	peayness		first experience with liux
2011-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	install windows first then install ubuntu and let it automatically detect windows and add an entry for it next to ubuntu in your boot loader
2011-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	peayness		ive had windows installed for a while
2011-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	peayness		jsut installed ubuntu last night
2011-02-12T02:52:00.000Z	peayness		does that mean i need to reinstall
2011-02-12T02:52:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	Ubuntu will automatically detect other OS on the machine and attempt to make an entry for it in the boot loader
2011-02-12T02:52:00.000Z	peayness		i dont remember it doing that last night
2011-02-12T02:53:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	In /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, do you see any entry for windows?
2011-02-12T02:53:00.000Z	peayness	soreau	how would i enter that into terminal
2011-02-12T02:53:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	What is the output from this command in your terminal? grep -i windows /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	peayness	soreau	i entered that into my terminal nothing happened
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	No output? Then that means it's not installed to your boot loader
2011-02-12T02:56:00.000Z	peayness		so do i need to reinstall ubuntu
2011-02-12T02:56:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	Try 'sudo update-grub2' and see if it detects windows
2011-02-12T02:57:00.000Z	peayness		found linux image
2011-02-12T02:57:00.000Z	peayness		found initrd image
2011-02-12T02:57:00.000Z	peayness		found memtest86 image
2011-02-12T02:57:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	You should be able to add an entry for 7 but with grub2, it's more complicated.
2011-02-12T02:58:00.000Z	soreau	peayness	Maybe Jordan_U can help
