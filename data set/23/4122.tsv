2007-11-20T01:30:00.000Z	kakoonia		hey.. it seems like my swap space isnt used and 66% of my memory is used.. how can i lower that?
2007-11-20T01:32:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 You don't really want to force low memory usage.  Run the 'free' command and see how much memory is used for "cache".  That is file data cached in otherwise free memory.  You should be happy to have it.
2007-11-20T01:34:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	: where is the cached data? /tmp?
2007-11-20T01:35:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	: how do i clean it?
2007-11-20T01:36:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	: where is the cached data? /tmp?
2007-11-20T01:36:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 The file system cache is holding data from all sorts of files that you have written or read.  It is not in a particular part of your filesystem.  You can use writes to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches to make recent kernels flush the cached data.  But you normally don't want to do that.
2007-11-20T01:37:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 See "man 5 proc" for some documentation of /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
2007-11-20T01:37:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	isnt 66% of 1gb alot of memory use?
2007-11-20T01:38:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 It is reasonable to use memory to cache data.  It is much faster to access than a file system or swap device.
2007-11-20T01:39:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 Page cache memory is first on the list of places to get more memory from if free memory runs really low.  If the page is 'clean' meaning that it does not need to be written to disk, then it is very quick to release and reuse.
2007-11-20T01:41:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	i know that... but when i run up ubuntu, thats the default about 57%, so i think it should be...

2007-11-20T01:42:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 Have you run 'free' to see how much of your ram is used for 'cached'?
2007-11-20T01:42:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	ye, it uses 260mb
2007-11-20T01:42:00.000Z	kakoonia		cached
2007-11-20T01:45:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 So only about 300MB of your ram is 'used', and 260MB 'cached', and 43% is useless 'free' RAM.  It don't really see a problem.  Using RAM isn't an issue unless the system is slowed down by swapping, or when allocations actually fail.
2007-11-20T01:48:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	ok! thanks.. it bugged me! ;)
2007-11-20T01:51:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 I will confess that there are a couple of corner cases where cached ram is actually not available to be freed.  System V shared memory objects and tmpfs file system data are reported as part of the 'cached' memory values.  Those actually need to be swapped out to a swap device to be reclaimed.  It is a rare corner case that those would be a real issue.
2007-11-20T01:55:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	i see.. well.. i dont know why i gave my swap partition such big space.. (not that big, but still) 2gb.. i cant see it uses it. and i was wondering if there are cases which swap space is preferable over RAM.. ..
2007-11-20T01:57:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 The only situation where swap is preferable is when you have too much data to afford the RAM to hold it.  (Or you just can't fit that much RAM in a system.)  But swap is only  practical if most of you data goes unaccessed for long periods of time.  Actively using swap is very slow.
2007-11-20T02:00:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	so the system determines which of my data is unaccessed for a long period of time, and by that.. it throws it to the Swap?
2007-11-20T02:01:00.000Z	stroyan	kakoonia	 If there isn't any free RAM or freeable cache, then something will be pushed out  to swap.  The OS has algorithms that try to select 'least recently used' memory for swapping out.
2007-11-20T02:02:00.000Z	kakoonia	stroyan	alrighty then! thanks alot bro.. appriciate it.
