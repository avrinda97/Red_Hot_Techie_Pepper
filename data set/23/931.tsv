2012-01-12T07:17:00.000Z	kieppie		hi all. I'm having trouble getting MPD to push ASLA audio out through my secondary sound card. SLSA to XBMC on my primary (HDMI) works fine
2012-01-12T07:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	ask in #xbmc , someone will assist
2012-01-12T07:19:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	my XBMC setup is OK in that regard, so my query's not really relevant there (alshough I have IR keymapping under kernel 3.0.x that I'm trying to work through0
2012-01-12T07:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	suit yourself
2012-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	I'm already in the #XBMC channel..
2012-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	me too
2012-01-13T08:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	#xbmc ??
2012-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	mpd?
2012-01-13T08:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	lets try that again, strip the xbmc stuff, what is it you want to achive, and be specific about the hardware and app
2012-01-13T08:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	lets keep it simple, can mplayer 'push' to your card?
2012-01-13T08:21:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	no - doesn't seem to - http://pastebin.com/D6gHfzR7
2012-01-13T08:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	you dont have alsa or pulse avail according to mplayer, what were you wanting to use? oss? something?
2012-01-13T08:25:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	atm I've scratched PA & making use of ALSA. the mplayer present is most likely that which is bundled with XBMC & I'm not seeing CLI args to define a audio device on the fly
2012-01-13T08:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	nope, never heard of a mplayer bundle with xbmc, use them both
2012-01-13T08:26:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	sorry - I mean to say that mplayer is the media player that XBMC uses to serve up it's content
2012-01-13T08:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	you can force xbmc to use an external player
2012-01-13T08:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	no, xbmc uses its own player
2012-01-13T08:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	should say 'i cant find asla or pa'
2012-01-13T08:29:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	looks for PA, cand find, then looks for ASLA moans then fails
2012-01-13T08:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	really?
2012-01-13T08:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	you trashed alsa and pa, btw, does xbmc still work?
2012-01-13T08:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	kieppie	nevermind, i would suggest undo all the alsa stuff you did and re-install pa(pulseaudio), remove-purge-reinstall
2012-01-13T08:32:00.000Z	kieppie	almoxarife	yea... starting to think that too now......
