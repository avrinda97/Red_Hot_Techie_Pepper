2009-03-24T19:34:00.000Z	sayuncle		hi all
2009-03-24T19:34:00.000Z	sayuncle		im just trying to install ubuntu on my laptop
2009-03-24T19:34:00.000Z	sayuncle		and i want to use partition 3
2009-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	sayuncle		but it keeps selecting partition 5 which is ntfs
2009-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	are you using the desktop install CD for 8.10 ?
2009-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	you must know what ubuntu version you're installing
2009-03-24T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	ok - thats fine
2009-03-24T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	so when it comes to partitioning are you selecting "manual" ?
2009-03-24T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	ok - and at this part you select what partition goes on what mountpoint, yes ?
2009-03-24T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	how can you say "yes" when you don't know what it means ?
2009-03-24T19:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	what is it asking
2009-03-24T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	ok - so you have to change them to use the mount points you want
2009-03-24T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	correct, so modify it to use the partitions/mount points you want
2009-03-24T19:39:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	so change / = partition 3
2009-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	if you want to install ubuntu on it - you have to set a file system yes
2009-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	ext3 is the default
2009-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	ext3
2009-03-24T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	/
2009-03-24T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	/ is the mount point
2009-03-24T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	leave as default
2009-03-24T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	sounds very small
2009-03-24T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	guide is normally the same as your ram - or just over
2009-03-24T19:47:00.000Z	ikonia	sayuncle	doesn't matter
