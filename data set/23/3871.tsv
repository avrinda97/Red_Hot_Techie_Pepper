2008-08-07T02:45:00.000Z	justin_	ActionParsnip	maybeway36  ive dowloaded the .deb off the site, installed the modules server, but when i start it up it says im still missing some modules. I remember before, all i had to do was sudo apt-get install virtualbox, but i guess it dont work like that no more
2008-08-07T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	try dpkg -i <debfile>
2008-08-07T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	then use sudo apt-get -f install
2008-08-07T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	 it will install the deps then the deb you downloaded
2008-08-07T02:47:00.000Z	justin_	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
2008-08-07T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	try use the reos as much as you can
2008-08-07T02:48:00.000Z	justin_	ActionParsnip	reos?
2008-08-07T03:00:00.000Z	justin_	ActionParsnip	i did what you said earlier, but virtualbox didnt show up under system tools now

2010-04-28T11:29:00.000Z	justin_	ActionParsnip	I can't seem to find anything googling that will help. I am at my wits end, I have no clue how to fix this.
2010-07-21T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	can you give the output of: dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf     use: http://www.pastie.org
2010-07-21T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	copy the big command I gave, run it then use pastie to give the output
2010-07-21T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	alternatively: sudo apt-get install pastebinit; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf > ~/paste.txt; pastebinit ~/paste.txt; rm ~/paste.txt
2010-07-21T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	was it the output of that big command?
2010-07-21T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	justin_	run that big command, a url will be output, paste it here
