2007-12-08T09:33:00.000Z	bro_man		<-- still seeking help, started this morning... OS: Ubuntu-feisty, Symptom: after loading OS, gui freezes/locks as soon as mouse/cursor is moved, Suspected Cause: last thing I did before rebooting and discovered reoccuring sympom was use "Add/Remove Applications" and added Nvidia drivers... Present State: mouse unplugged, after OS loaded I pressed alt+cntrl+F3 and I am at a fullscreen terminal prompt....
2007-12-08T09:34:00.000Z	bro_man		 I do not know any commands but I can follow directions... umm... help?
2007-12-08T09:34:00.000Z	soldats	bro_man	what do you need
2007-12-08T09:35:00.000Z	bro_man	soldats	I need to use my system without wiping my boot... everything is right there...
2007-12-08T09:35:00.000Z	soldats	bro_man	sorry what do you mean by wiping the boot
2007-12-08T09:42:00.000Z	soldats	bro_man	yes
2007-12-08T10:46:00.000Z	bro_man	soldats	I selected the "auto configure" option in xserver-xorg for my video card, Nvidia geforce 4 MX 4000, and it is asking me what my video cards bus identifier is... it says PCI:1:0:0_______ there is a blinking cursor after the last zero... is this a pre-inserted answer or am I to  insert data there?
2007-12-08T10:47:00.000Z	soldats	bro_man	usually leaving it blank will default it but if you go into your bios on boot you should be able to find out the path
2007-12-08T10:48:00.000Z	bro_man	soldats	where would it be in the bios ?
2007-12-08T10:48:00.000Z	soldats	bro_man	pci devices list
