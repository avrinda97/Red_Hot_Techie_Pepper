2008-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	CineScope		is there anyway to control a laptops fan with ubuntu? it runs all the time now, much louder than vista.
2008-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	yes sure what kind of cpu u have?
2008-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	can you post the contents of cat /proc/cpuinfo command?
2008-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	CineScope		intel p8600
2008-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	right can open terminal and type sudo modprobe p4-clockmod
2008-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	what does it say?
2008-10-19T08:38:00.000Z	CineScope		sudo modprobe p4-clockmod
2008-10-19T08:38:00.000Z	CineScope		FATAL: Module p4_clockmod not found.
2008-10-19T08:39:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	right how about sudo modprobe speedstep-centrino
2008-10-19T08:39:00.000Z	CineScope		FATAL: Module speedstep_centrino not found.
2008-10-19T08:41:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	hm thats weird
2008-10-19T08:41:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	according to powertop it is running at 800Mhz 98.5% of the time  but the fan is still running
2008-10-19T08:43:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	thats weird so it does scale? can u double check that by adding a cpu scaling applet to your panel and see if it lists different available frequencies
2008-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	yep running at 800
2008-10-19T08:45:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	when u click on it does it list other available frequencies
2008-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	yes - 800, 1600, 2400
2008-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	switched it to performance and shot to 2400 but the fan speed stayed the same
2008-10-19T08:47:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	just wasn't sure if there was anyway to say don't run the fan so much
2008-10-19T08:47:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	hm that is really strange. do you have all acpi modules installed sudo apt-get install acpi acpid acpi-support
2008-10-19T08:48:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	no it should just spin slower if cpu scales down
2008-10-19T08:48:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	all three are installed.
2008-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	usser	CineScope	im sorry i dont what the problem is
2008-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	CineScope	usser	thanks for the assist anyway
