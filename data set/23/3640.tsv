2008-03-06T07:43:00.000Z	D-Unit		is it possible to compress everything the way u can on an ntfs partition in windows xp?
2008-03-06T07:43:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	make a big tar.bz2 file
2008-03-06T07:45:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	you could fit one ISO file. I suggest using AcidRip and encoding to XviD or x264 to save some space.
2008-03-06T07:46:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	i want the dvd to be exactly like my original xept compressed to a 4.7 gb dvd
2008-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	dd if=/dev/dvd of=/path/to/file.iso
2008-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	i dint understand that
2008-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	now you have a full-size ISO file. Now run bzip2 on it and it will get a bit smaller.
2008-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	do u no of any windows freeware that i can use thru wine that would compress directly bcuz i have no internet on that comp and windows apps dont ask for dependencies
2008-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	DVD video and audio is already compressed, somewhat, using MPEG2. Compressing more, especially with a general purpose lossless algorithm like gzip or bzip2, will likely not work.
2008-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	both dd and bzip2 are included in a base system.
2008-03-06T07:51:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	you may have to read the dd man file for some info.
2008-03-06T07:51:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	no offense but u rely lose me with the way u talk
2008-03-06T07:51:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	ok, sorry. Did I skip something? Where'd I lose you?
2008-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	like "special words" like dd and bzip2 etc
2008-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	are you familiar with the command line?
2008-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	well somewat i guess
2008-03-06T07:52:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	like i dont avoid it
2008-03-06T07:53:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	ok, dd is a bitstream copyer thingy that you can use to make ISO images of CDs and DVDs, among many many other things.
2008-03-06T07:53:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	so, sudo dd if=/dev/dvd of=/path/to/file.iso will create a copy of the input file (if) to the output file (of).
2008-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	wat does that command do? compress?
2008-03-06T07:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	D-Unit	there are dozens of compression utilities for Linux.
2008-03-06T07:58:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	k, i guess ill continue this later on cuz i have to go to bed cuz i have things to do early tomorow
2008-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	D-Unit	cellofellow	thanks for ur efforts
