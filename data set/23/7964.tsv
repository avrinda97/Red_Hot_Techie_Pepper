2005-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	Greg___		does anyone know a good network troubleshooting page for establishing your wireless connection to the internet?
2005-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	Greg___		i have ndiswrapper installed correctly
2005-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	Greg___		and the driver has been loaded
2005-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	Greg___		but whenever i try to connect to something or ping, or ssh
2005-03-13T06:46:00.000Z	Greg___		it just stalls for a while, and then says it couldn't resolve the name
2005-03-13T06:46:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	what about /etc/resolv.conf?
2005-03-13T06:46:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	dns servers
2005-03-13T06:47:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	there must be some value there
2005-03-13T06:47:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	you have to put there your provider dns servers
2005-03-13T06:48:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	mmmm maybe your provider web
2005-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	it is something udeful, copy dns set in xp
2005-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	there is one primary and one secondary dns
2005-03-13T06:50:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	net-> tcp/ip-> properties
2005-03-13T06:50:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	maybe they are assigned dinamically
2005-03-13T06:51:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	ipconfig /all
2005-03-13T06:51:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	from msdos prompt

2005-03-13T06:53:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	try IP first
2005-03-13T06:54:00.000Z	fgx	Greg___	it is surely a /etc/resolv.conf problem
