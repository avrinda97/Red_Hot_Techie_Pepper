2007-04-09T14:11:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	That's part of the point - the GUI eats up system resources.

2007-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	let me check
2007-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	I actually never got a wireless manager program working under Edgy - you can use the command line.
2007-04-09T14:13:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	yeah it works how can i configurate it?

2007-04-09T14:16:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	"sudo iwconfig (interface) ESSID (router's ESSID)
2007-04-09T14:17:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	is wlan0
2007-04-09T14:18:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	Did it work?
2007-04-09T14:19:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	but you didn't tell me what I need to set, how can it know that's is my wireless connection?  i mean how to set the name pass etc...
2007-04-09T14:19:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	nope , normal key- 5796727545
2007-04-09T14:20:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	Normal?  There is no "normal" kind of encryption.
2007-04-09T14:21:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	I think you have 128-bit WEP.
2007-04-09T14:23:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	Still here?
2007-04-09T14:23:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	look: http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/iwconfig8.html
2007-04-09T14:24:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	I've read the MAN page.
2007-04-09T14:24:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	Try "sudo iwconfig wlan0 key (whatever your key is).
2007-04-09T14:25:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	just that? i don't think so really maybe something like:
2007-04-09T14:27:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	iwconfig essid 2WIRE811 Channel 6 ap any key 5796727545
2007-04-09T14:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	Well, yes. That would work.
2007-04-09T14:28:00.000Z	wiikki	spasticteapot	=D let me check, what do you know about  "iwlist scanning" what does exaclty ?
2007-04-09T14:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot	wiikki	DUH!
