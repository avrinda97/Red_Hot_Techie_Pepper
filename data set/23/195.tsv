2012-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	Dragonster82		Hey does anyone know why is it that when I record my screen with Kazam Screencaster, my computer suddenly becomes laggy?
2012-10-30T06:17:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	no
2012-10-30T06:22:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	why you dont do it yourself?
2012-10-30T06:22:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	Do what myself?
2012-10-30T06:22:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	what you just said, format
2012-10-30T06:24:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	To reformat I will need the Windows disc, but my laptop doesn't come with it. Besides, I asked for a recovery disc and they told me I had to pay.
2012-10-30T06:24:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	so why dont you get an windows copy, there so much torrents from original win 7 and such
2012-10-30T06:25:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	I've already tried that, but the thing is that: If I were to install windows 7 by torrenting, it would give me the results of a desktop one, not allowing me to connect to wireless network and such.
2012-10-30T06:26:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	why not???
2012-10-30T06:29:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	im running ubuntu 12.10 with nvidia optimus (from bumblebee)
2012-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	You know, I don't really feel like going to the terminal and typing optirun blablabla. Its really tiring you know.
2012-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	you can add the bumblebee repo available from launchpad and install it, and you another GUI to allow you to run apps from optirun
2012-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	still i dont use to use optirun, im simply satisfied to have bumblebee runing that puts only the notebook temperature in good levels
2012-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	I've done sudo apt-get install bumblebee , what do I do now>
2012-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	https://launchpad.net/~bumblebee/+archive/stable
2012-10-30T06:35:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	first you need to add the repo, but go to that link and read
2012-10-30T06:36:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	Ubuntu 12.10 has issues with Nvidia
2012-10-30T06:36:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	The desktop will not show if I were to install it.
2012-10-30T06:37:00.000Z	simplew	Dragonster82	what???
2012-10-30T06:37:00.000Z	Dragonster82	simplew	Simply putting it, there's going to be a bug if I install Nvidia n ow.
